ufo1k,3,2012-06-01,Still never got an apartment situation settled... Anybody else looking?,ChrisloriousHD,columbusclassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbusclassifieds/comments/ufo1k/still_never_got_an_apartment_situation_settled/," A friend and I have been trying to get an apartment for a couple months now and because we are younger (I'm 19 and he's 18) we haven’t been able to find anywhere that will take us without a cosigner. This is based upon our lack of credit scores and rental history (cause you know, we can really control that….).

 At this point I am open to finding somebody who has the credit that would like to get the townhouse with us in Worthington that we were looking at (with utilities and 3 people it should be about $270 a month per person). I'm also willing to move in with somebody who is looking for a roommate, either both of us or just me, I'm just ready to be on my own again.

 I have good credit (for my age, 647) and a steady 40 hour a week job. I am an intern IT at a programming company. I am attending classes at Strayer University online and I have a steady girlfriend that I have been dating for 14 months. I grew up in a Christian home. I’m allergic to dogs and cats but I wouldn’t mind having either, I am cool with coping xD. I love dogs and cats both. I normally sit at my computer or play Xbox. I’m a calm mature person. I keep my areas clean and I help keep shared areas clean.

   I’ve been looking for a while. I moved here to attend classes at DeVry a year ago (literally a year today actually, oddly enough). I was placed into an apartment through them. The first apartment I was in I had to deal with druggy drunk roommates and I couldn’t handle it. I had them move me to a different apartment. In the second apartment, I had a thief for a roommate and ended up losing 1.5k worth of items, including a laptop. I got out of there, broke the lease (payed it through) and moved in with my cousins. I’ve been living there for 5 months now. I need to move badly, I don’t enjoy living with them because I feel like I’m intruding as they are raising a family.

   A big thing I'm looking for really though is a roommate that I can connect with. Somebody that has some similar likes. I've been lacking real social interaction due to what happened with the other roommates and such. I don't party so I don't really meet people that often. I like to play video games a decent amount, I personally own a Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Nintendo Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3. I like music of all sorts. I have a powerful PC and 2 large screens for monitors, one being a 3DTV. I like bowling and playing basketball and such. I want somebody who will not only be a roommate, but be a friend."

I'm 22 F and have felt relatively happy with my identity up until a year ago.  I was in an internship in 2011 and roomed with two bisexual girls who spent most of the time trying to convince me that I was bisexual.  They were of the opinion that ""nobody is every just straight or just gay"" and really liked to announce their bisexuality.  It really grated on my nerves, but made me think that maybe I needed to consider that.  Of course, I eventually blew it off because I determined that my doubts were just from their pressure.

Now, though...  Well, I was snuggling with my boyfriend and we were just talking about random stuff when he mentioned well... to be as discrete as I can, 'hanging out' with another girl (as in me, him, and the girl together) and wanted to know if I was okay with that.  I was kind of surprised to find myself not opposed to the idea and shortly after started crying out of confusion.  (I'd like to note that my boyfriend is completely supportive and isn't trying to force me either way; he suggested I talk with others rather than just keeping it to myself)

I know for certain that I am attracted to males but now I'm beginning to think that I am attracted to females as well.  I wasn't raised in a particularly strict or homophobic family and I'm all for freedom of sexuality, so I don't feel ashamed or wrong feeling this way...  But it is a little confusing at 22 to suddenly realize I might be interested in the same gender.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for here other than to just talk through it with people to help me sort myself out.  I have felt a little more... comfortable?  with myself after having that 'epiphany', but as I said, I'm pretty confused.

Anybody feel like just talking about stuff?  I don't really have any direction for this (probably because I'm pretty confused), but talking about it with people helps me more than just trying to think through it.

Thanks, everyone.  :)"

&gt;  Some things I didn't know...
&gt;Things to remember in November  
&gt;
&gt;      After going to both Harvard Business School and Harvard Law &gt;School simultaneously, he passed the Michigan bar, but never worked &gt;as an attorney.
&gt;·       As a venture-capitalist, Romney's first major business deal &gt;involved investing in a start-up office supply company with one store &gt;in Massachusetts that sold office supplies.
&gt;That company, called Staples, now has over 2,000 stores and &gt;employs over 90,000 people.
&gt;·       Romney or his company BainCapital (using what became known &gt;as the ""Bain Way"") would go on to perform the same kinds of business &gt;miracles again and again, with companies like Domino's, Sealy, &gt;Brookstone, Weather Channel, Burger King, Warner Music Group, &gt;Dollarama, Home Depot Supply,
&gt;and many others.
&gt;Got your calculators handy? Let's recap.
&gt;       Volunteer campaign worker for his dad's gubernatorial campaign &gt;1 year.
&gt;·       Unpaid intern in Governor's office 8 years.
&gt;·       Mormon missionary in Paris 2 years.
&gt;·       Unpaid bishop and state president for his church 10 years.
&gt;Took no salary as president of the Salt Lake Olympics 3 years.
&gt;·       No salary as MA governor 4 years.
&gt;Gave his ENTIRE INHERITANCE to charity.
&gt;·       That's a grand total of 28 years of unpaid service to his &gt;country, his community and his church. Why? Because that's the kind &gt;of man Mitt Romney is.
&gt; 
&gt;And He’ll show you his:
&gt;1)     Un-doctored Birth Certificate!
&gt;2)    College transcripts!
&gt;3)    Law degree!
&gt;4)    Un-doctored Draft notice!  Un-doctored Social Security card, &gt;and what state it's registered in!
&gt;Isn’t it time for a REAL CHANGE?
&gt; 
&gt;    A brighter HOPE for America?

Last year I almost gave up.  At the start of this year I got new docs and meds and really gave it my all to get better. 

It's been 6 months since I started recovering from those 9 years.  I'm working 2 internships, I was offered a full time job off of LinkedIn, I leave my room and socialize, I am trying to date, I am stable and faithful with my meds.  I still have to patch up my relationship with my dad and living with my mom sucks (divorced, he blamed it on me) and have drug abuse under control.

What prompted me to post is that I am returning from a 3 week vacation in Guatemala (where my mom is from) and I feel different.  The last time I was in that country was when I was 14 years old, before all the mental anguish and shit, and 12 years have passed!  My cousins are married or getting married, having babies, building homes for their families.  I was both embarrassed/sad that I didn't have similar accomplishments to talk about with them, but they were very happy to see me and took care of me/showed me around and I was even able to confide in one close cousin.  I climbed a volcano, partook in a cacao ceremony with a shamanic healer, visited family in the mayan kaqchikel highlands, and got laid (whoo! dry spell over), to name a few things I did during my vacation.

I want to say thanks to Puddles, Cat226, Logiz, erics, and the other mibbit users who encouraged me to stay off drugs during my trip, to take fewer books and focus on the experience instead, and for being open and honest about their lives.  It's made a huge difference to have this subreddit community available to reflect and learn from others.  And to those who are struggling every minute of every day, there is hope for you.  Please reach out even if you think it's over for you... there is a good chance it isn't, I know that now."

I posted something earlier today, but I remained distant and vague in my explanation.

My girlfriend of eight months broke up with me a little bit more than a week ago. I know eight months isn’t a very long time and in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite trivial. But I’ve dated girls for more than a year and I’ve never felt this torn apart. She told me she no longer loved me. I saw this coming and I tried as hard as I could to keep our relationship together—and honestly I think that’s probably what tore us apart… I’ll explain.

We had a really good relationship. We were interested in the same things: action movies (Resident Evil, Avengers, etc.), videogames (Zelda of course!), Indian food (every Thursday), fitness, television shows (Burn Notice, White Collar, and Alias), and a lot more. I tried to help her with her school work as much as I could and she did cute things for me too, such as cooking me crepes or French toast in the morning. You and I both know the list of the good things could go on indefinitely--I’m in love with her.

However, there were issues like every relationship. We both had two majorly conflicting character traits.

I have an “anxiety disorder,” which is likely inherited from my father who tried to commit suicide a few years back, so I get extremely paranoid about whether the person I’m dating truly loves me. My paranoia and anxiety is also probably the result of my flawed family life. My mother was an alcoholic and my dad had an affair. He had two children with another women (a stripper actually), and he abused me childhood naivety; namely, he said that this situation was normal and that I shouldn’t tell my mother. For two years I knew about my dad’s affair while I watched my mother’s heart be slowly ripped into pieces as she wondered why my dad was becoming more distant by the day. She eventually found it and it wasn’t from my mouth. I regret that every day. Anyway…

Unfortunately, my paranoia was exacerbated by one of her quirks, specifically her distant and unaffectionate attitude. That is, she never gave me any sort of affection, which she said was the result of her depression and self-confidence issues that I will not go into for the sake of her privacy. I always said love you first. I cuddled with her. I kissed her and held her. And she never reciprocated; she never showed affection in return. She told me she didn’t like that I was affectionate because she didn’t like being touched by anyone (which is odd because for the first month and a half she was extremely affectionate).

Our two quirks collided obviously. Every day I became more and more paranoid. But I loved her, so I tried to conceal my paranoia as best as I could. In fact, it was the first time in my life that I could actually sort of contain it. I loved her and she hated my paranoia, so I tried so desperately hard to not be paranoid. Even though we had our issues and she still told me that she wanted to be with me. She said that if she couldn’t be in a relationship with me, then she wasn’t meant for anyone. She wanted to marry me and she actually designed our floor plans for our house one day. This was two weeks before our break up.

reddit, I no longer have passion or motivation to do anything anymore. I have an internship starting in 5 days at a Fortune 20 company and I need my motivation back. I’m going down the wrong road at this point. I don’t care about anything and I can’t be around anyone without being on the verge of breaking down and crying. I’m probably overly sensitive, but I’ve never felt this way about anyone. Maybe someone could share some advice.

**tl;dr** My girlfriend broke up with me and I'm really sad about it."

ugtbh,4,2012-06-02,IAMA College StudENT Who Unfortunately Has To Stop Smoking Trees. My Story of StudENT To Student Along With Questions I Propose To Anyone,FalloutForever,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ugtbh/iama_college_student_who_unfortunately_has_to/,"My Story, (I have been trying to write this IAMA for awhile now so hopefully someone will read it)

To start, I am afflicted with depression as well as a high level of social anxiety so writing this has me really feeling vulnerable because I do not know how people will react to (if even read) this IAMA. 

So I am a college Sophomore that is studying engineering. I began smoking trees about a month into school after experimenting with alcohol/ tobacco (Cigars mostly). I found that trees really helped me deal with my social anxiety and depression better then any other medication I have taken.

Because trees allows me to be more outgoing and less self conscious I gained many friends and friENTs in my first year of college. I will without a doubt say that my first year of college has been the best year of my life so far because of the many positive experiences I have had with and without trees.

There is much more I want to say but I feel as if people will not be interested in my somewhat boring life so I will move on to why I need to stop the thing that brings me great joy and relief.

For me to get a job at a well-respected, high paying engineering firm I will without a doubt take drug tests. I could of had an internship this summer at a very respected, multi-billion dollar company except that I would have had to take a hair folical test. I was told that I had been accepted for the position because of cancellations of others and I would be able to work at the company over the summer. Unfortunately I had done large amounts of research into the company and confirmed they do hair tests so I was had to decline the offer. When I finished the phone call I immediately thought I had missed a golden opportunity to start my career of on the right foot. I still feel this way.

So for the sake of my potential career as an engineer (which I don't really want to be but it is the only job with substantial income that I don't resent) I am stopping my trees smoking this Sunday.

If it were not for drug testing, I feel I would be a productive member of society while also smoking trees. I mean, I do very well in school, 3.5 GPA, I follow every state and federal law with exception to speed limits and marijuana prohibition, I try to help those around me when possible. Why is it that I cannot smoke an herb that provides me relief from my (in my point of view) very unimportant, un-special life.

Me stopping this Sunday will provide a sufficient amount of time for the THC to leave my hair folicas due to the fact I will have about a year before I have to take the hair test. (I have high metabolism, I take niacin, I get buzz cuts every 2 months ect...) But me stopping this Sunday will take something I love completely out of my life.

Since I have to stop smoking, I am going to try and become a major advocate for the legalization for marijuana. I feel that I am insignificant in this political world where pharmaceutical companies spend millions lobbying to keep marijuana illegal. A world where politicians can lose their credibility for trying to pass pro-marijuana legislation. A world where money has absolute power and the individual has little to none. I want the world to change, not just for marijuana, but for everyone. A world where the logical/ right thing to do is implemented over a company wanting to increase its profits by denying rights to millions

I was a sophomore college studENT, now I am a college student with the will to try and change at least one aspect of the world. I know that I am small in this world, but even small things can make an impact.

Questions:

1. How should I go about my pro-marijuana activism

2. What do you think of my story and viewpoints

3. Is there anyone else in my situation or one close to it

4. Feel free to comment on any part of my story, I will comment back. :-)

       (I am open to any response to this, I just hope some reads this because trees are an important part of my life and I would like feedback on my situation) 

Thank You In Advance,

I am just ending my senior year of college, and it is supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life, but today that all changed.

 I have been with this guy for almost a year. It was a relationship unlike any I have ever had before. We clicked immediately. He told me he loved me before we even started officially dating. From the day we met (at an internship) we spent all of our time together until the summer ended and we went back to our individual colleges which are 3 hours apart.

Everything the past few months has been great. We had a little scare because he is going to grad school and he almost ended up across the country. But, by some stroke of luck he got into his dream school which by coincidence was only half an hour away from the place where I had accepted a job offer.

Since then we have been counting the days until we would be living near each other. We see each other about every other weekend, and for Memorial Day, we spent the long weekend together. We had an amazing weekend, a vacation on the beach and I left on Tuesday feeling like the luckiest girl in the world.

Wednesday he says that he is worried about graduation and wants to spend a lot of time with his friends and starts mentioning needing some space. Everything since Wednesday has been an awful rollercoaster of emotion culminating in him breaking up with me today.

I just feel like this is so sudden and abrupt, which is why I am struggling to deal with this. He had already purchased a train ticket for my graduation (One week from now). I had plans with his parents to drive down for his graduation. He bought me a day to make and bottle our own wine in Napa in July for my birthday. We bought concert tickets this past weekend for a concert in late July. All of these things seem to indicate he had no intention of breaking up with me and I am devastated. 

Reddit, where do I go from here?? How do I deal with this?? Everything I thought about my future, where I was going to live, how I was going to make friends, even my plans for graduation and the month break between school and work are destroyed.

TL;DR Boyfriend broke up with me with no warning 1 week before college graduation and 2 weeks before we would be living near each other. How do I deal with this shock?"

ujkw9,357,2012-06-03,IAmA Radio/Water Tower Climber. Saw the interest on the front page today and thought I'd do an AMA as everyone was blown away by it,RDProgrammer,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ujkw9/iama_radiowater_tower_climber_saw_the_interest_on/,"My family owns a Wireless Internet Service in rural America and we rent tower space from the companies that own large radio towers, from smaller towers, from cities' water towers, and other random towers (we have ~55 broadcast sites). Our antennas are between 100' and 450' off the ground and I've done higher climbs relative to where that guy from the [""scariest video in the name of science""](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/uijtx/the_scariest_video_you_have_ever_watched_in_the/) guy got off the elevator (And really, above 50' or so you're dead if you fall anyway).

Even better some of our antennas are on water towers that have no ladder, so you just have to scurry up the existing metal work where ever you can. (Yeah, this REALLY sucks).

As said in [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCYZZPwJr_c), and argued in many responses to other places I've seen that posted, I do free-climb often (When there is not a way to be clipped in in a way that will not make me get exhausted quickly. Also, clipping in requires you to stop what you are doing, which when getting in a rhythm as you climb, is very distracting. With many designs of towers the ladders' rungs are not evenly spaced, but follow a pattern, one that you must count out in your head to make sure your feet are going to be in the right place at the right time.), but I also clip in when working if there isn't a safe platform to stand on.

Craziest thing I've seen: the tower in the pics below has a buzzard's nest about 100' up on a walkway that is about 3 feet wide and has had a chick in it each of the last 3 years. [Here is is empty.
](http://i.imgur.com/NnP1Nh.jpg) Other than that, I've been on towers and found where lightning has hit them and just blown the tops apart (mostly on water towers), have seen women sunbathing in their backyards in various states of dress (but I was at least 300' away and couldn't seem much), and had a cop order me down off the tower thinking I was up there to vandalize.

Close Calls: I've gotten my safety harness caught up in rigging before and been stuck for a while until I could get out, nearly had heatstroke on a tower, had the mount-point I was clipped into bend and make me nearly fall, and dropped a screw driver a few hundred feet onto the roof of my jeep (still has a big dent).

Best part of the job: it's always something new and rarely boring (except for driving long distances). Some of the set ups are really interesting and have evolved over the years: we have a tower that has something like 35 runs of ethernet cable going to the top (it's grown with the business), the electrical box that houses all our equipment for that tower looks nuts. That and our solar powered systems that are out in the middle of nowhere; building those are fun, imagine hauling a ~100lb battery up a tower just like that guy in the video had his tool bag (while also hauling the tool bag).

Worst part: The heat and the cold. Where I am the summers get to 110 F and 100% humidity and the winters get to 0 degrees and windy. I'd rather climb in heat than cold though, as your hands REALLY hurt after a climb in the cold, the metal of the ladder sucks any trace of heat out of them.

Is it scary anymore? Almost never, there are moments when you realize that one slip and it's all over, but its also a rush and I'm an Adrenaline Junkie (been skydiving, have a motorcycle, etc). I also get a lot of laughs out of people who I show pictures to and just get a ""nope, nope, nope, nope, NOOOOOOPE!."" My GF also lost her damned mind when I climbed a remote tower we had just had installed to install our antennas. the ""tower"" was a 70' telephone pole (about 20"" wide at base, 8"" or so at the top). I had to drive long bolts into it as I climbed to ""build"" the ""ladder"" and then sit at the top and rope components up to myself (the weight caused the pole to shake as much as 3' to either side according to my GF). That was some squirrely shit and I'll admit I'm glad I haven't had to climb it again since.


[Here is my verification](http://i.imgur.com/2PpFR.jpg) (see first picture for same face)


...and some pics from when I was up them in the past:

[Here's what I normally climb wearing](http://i.imgur.com/69nGa.jpg) it has multiple different attachments for safety gear for different types of towers.

If y'all have any questions, ask away.

EDIT: imgur links, screw photobucket

IDK If I'm allowed to do this, but throw me some upvotes, I'm constantly annoyed by how many people think tower climbing is some sort of crazy job that only nutcases would do (seriously been denied a college internship because the recruiter thought I was ""too wild"" for their company).

I have been repairing and building computers since I was 12 (first one I took  apart was a DIGITAL x386 EMM running Windows 3.1). I built and repaired over 300 computers for my friends/schoolmates/family while going to middle school and high school. In middle school my friends and I created a ""company"" (it was never incorporated), building and repairing computers for all of our friends and their families. We successfully ran that business for about 4 years till I moved away to Dallas. In Dallas, my dad needed a Linux (SuSE) Admin for his new business. So I learned how to administer a Linux Server (using CLI, didn't even touch a GUI until 5 years later), setup and maintain a webmail, IMAP, and SMTP server. Configured our local DNS using BIND command line. Even designed and maintained my dad's website and webstore. After I graduated from high school, I moved to Austin and took some time to find myself while still keeping up with my skills by occasionally helping friends out when their computers broke and keeping current on technological trends. After 3 years of staying in Austin, I moved to Killeen, TX and worked for a man who was repairing computers out of his house. He tried to convert me to Christianity, so I left that job. I started working for Acer Computers, and during my 10 months of employment there I personally repaired ~3000 desktops, laptops, servers, and projectors. The only reason I left that job was because I was moving back to Austin, and traveling 120+ miles a day for $10 an hour is not economically efficient. So, I got a job at Apple Computer doing tech support over the phone. In my 5+ years at Apple, I have assisted thousands of customers (~300 a month for 66 months) in repairing issues with their computers. My primary experience at Apple has been network and email client troubleshooting. Although, I have had plenty of experience with basic desktop/laptop troubleshooting and educational facility support as well.

Now you are probably wondering why I took the time to detail my experience to you. I don't want to be at my job anymore (it was just supposed to be a temporary placement till I got a better one). I have applied to 30+ internal positions in the past 2 years (positions that I know, realistically, I qualify for and I know I would be able to excel at). The only time I have had an interview, I was turned down for someone that I was told is more well rounded and that I am not far along enough in my career (the position was for in-house computer repair). 

So, I'm done. I am looking for a new job, preferably in the SA/NA area. What I would really like is an apprenticeship or a paid internship, learning how to do SA/NA work. I am the kind of person that as long as I'm doing what I love (building, maintaining, and repairing computers), I don't really care what I am making (within reason) and I am willing to stay right where I am. I am known for keeping good records of my case history and as a no-nonsense worker. If there is work to do, I do not slack off. If there is no work to do, I find work to do. Being unproductive when someone is paying me to be productive infuriates me to no end. I just want to do what I love, so that I don't have to hate my job and get depressed just walking in the door. It would be nice if the largest stressor in my life was not my job.

So, there you go /r/austinjobs. If you want a real resume, PM me for a link. "

Also, I need some nerd refrences, such as, ""Dear [Insert Test Subject Name Here]"" This essay is written for the incoming freshman class of a special educational program. By special I mean a rigorous and hard one, made for the smart.

  Dear [Insert Test Subject Name Here],    
   Congratulations on making what could quite possibly be the most important decision you will have to face in life. Your decision to join the Utica Center for Mathematics, Science, and Technology will not let you down. Here at UCMST, or MST as it is usually called, you will learn to make all your work MST quality work, collaborate with other students, and have many a fun time. MST may seem like a big challenge, and it is, but I know anyone who passed the entrance exam is capable of performing to the best of their abilities and will go far in school and in life in general. MST will be the best four years of your life.
    
   To start off, homework in chemistry will either put you ahead or behind. We have these things called Web Assigns, which are our homework problems that are online. We have to print them out, show our work, and submit the answers online. A word of advice, do not procrastinate, and complete your homework at least two days early, because you get .5% percent extra credit for each question you answer early. Here is where collaboration comes in handy. If you and your friends start early, you can come into school early, and help each other figure out how to solve questions they may not get. Be warned! DO NOT just tell each other the answers and have them copy the work. This is called cheating. If you copy, you also will not remember how to do the problems as well, so when it comes to test time, you will not perform as well as you would if you tried it yourself.
    	
   This next subject varies greatly from student to student, C++. Either you will love C++ as I did, or you can’t stand it and wish it over. To me, C++ is a third language, a puzzle, and a potential future career. I love puzzles as you may, so in C++ when you have to figure out ways to make your program compute something, return a value, or do anything, I found it exciting and invigorating. I loved trying to find what the simplest and most concise way to the end product would be. A C++ program may look like the code in the image below. C++ coding is a way of innovative problem solving to get a solution for a problem that may be as simple as finding prime numbers, or as complex as program that renders terrain, uses coded in physics, and a GUI engine, or in other words, a video game. Whether you like C++ or not, it will be a major help for your junior year when you take AP Java. Java is a coding language very similar to C++. The bottom line is whether you are intimidated by C++, love it, or are appalled by it, take your time when learning it, and try to understand what each thing in a program does. It can help you through the course.
    
   So far, we have covered chemistry and C++. You may think next would be advice to math, but almost everyone understood math, so I do not think there is much to advise you on. Instead, this will be about what opportunities, both in high school and out, MST can provide for you. As a requirement for our junior year at this fabulous establishment, each student has to get an internship. This means that you can get hands on experience in a career field you may find intriguing. Do not worry if you do not like the internship, you just escaped wasting part of your college life on this. Now, as for the more distant future, MST can put you well ahead of others. You will have a better high school education, and more knowledge then the competition. You will be smart, well informed, committed to what you do, and more. These are all key things for your life out of school, which MST conveniently provides. You may ask, “Why are you telling me this? I thought this was a survival guide.” Well, here is the connection. Pay attention, do your work, and find what interests you. If you do not do these things here at MST, you will not be as committed, as smart, as informed, as educated, or as capable as you could be. What you do now pays off in the future. So, try your hardest, do your homework, and most importantly, have a passion for learning. With these things, you will surely excel in school and in life.
    	
At this point, you may not know what you should take out of this. Let me help you out there. At MST, you need to try your hardest on everything, do your work, find what you like doing, stick to it, collaborate on ideas (not answers), and more. With MST comes many late nights, lots of trips to the pop machines, and stress, but MST also comes with an excelling education, many great people to become friends with, pie,  fun activities, random food bribes (basically lots of free treats such as doughnuts, cake, and more), Pi day, pie, fun clubs, afterschool events (such as lock-ins and tournaments), and more pie! MST is an unforgettable experience you will NEVER regret going through. As a sophomore this year, I can personally say you will survive school and I wish you the best of luck in your educational endeavors. 
    
Live Long and Prosper

I could be wrong since I haven't been browsing this sub much lately, but a search gave me nothing. Here are my questions:

1. I will only be 20 throughout the summer even though I'm going into my senior year (my birthday is super late). I was wondering if you guys can shed some light on the social aspect of interning and how not being legal drinking age here in the US might affect my experience outside of work with other interns as well as the trip that I've heard many people take (to Florida, etc.). I'm a little worried that a lot of socializing and whatnot might be done out at bars where I wouldn't be able to attend and I don't want to end up as an outcast (for lack of a better term) because I can't go out with everyone.

2. On a different topic, I'm also looking for others' experiences with their job offers after the internship. Did you try and get an offer in a different city than where you interned? This is an important question for me so I'm wondering how the whole transferring process has worked out for others since, if I plan on sticking with my company, seeking an offer for a different city is something I've been thinking about. This doesn't seem like something that is often allowed, but I thought I'd ask for everyone's input.

Sorry if this is a little unorganized I don't have time to look over it before I post. Hopefully by the time I check again we'll have some good discussion and I hope none of this is the same questions this sub gets all the time. Thanks!"

my sister (the main ""offender"") is 24, married to the ward mission leader, two kids, has a master's in early childhood education, a primary teacher... basically the epitome of the perfect mormon wife.

i know that what she does, she does out of love and genuine concern for my ""eternal soul"".  after all, i can't make it to the celestial kingdom without an eternal companion.  i know this because i used to believe the same thing.  but this past week she did something that for some reason has really gotten under my skin:  she set me up with a complete stranger (to her as well as me) for no other reason than the fact that we both live in the same city.

basically, she met a girl who lives in my same city (and who she described as ""very attractive"") and gave her my phone number, telling her to give me a call.  i don't know much about the exchange other than that.  what i do know is that i got a call from this girl - who just finished her first year of law school at BYU and is working an internship with the DA here - offering me a ride to church.

i've *never* been more uncomfortable on a phone call.  luckily, i was out of town on sunday, so i was able to at least delay said fellowshipping effort, but i have a very difficult time saying ""no"" to people - especially people i don't know, so i agreed to ride with her next week (though i had forgotten that i'm going to be out of town again, so there'll be another awkward phone convo where i delay again).

so here's my dilemma:  i don't know what this girl's expectations are - i'm not opposed to going on a date with her, but i *really* don't want to be a reactivation project.  i don't know exactly what my sister told her, either.

my sister at this point knows i'm ""not that into the church"".  she knows that i smoke - or at least her husband does, and i'd be seriously surprised if he'd kept that secret from her.  my father knows i drink, and he found my condoms a while back while helping me clean my old car for sale.  even if he hasn't shared these things with my sister, there are other signs.  i rarely attend church when i'm visiting her or my parents.  i didn't stand in the circle during her sons' baby blessings, and when my best friend since childhood got married last month, i waited outside the temple.  i've never had a formal ""i don't believe"" talk with any of my family, but they know i'm not the wide-eyed RM i once was.

i'm actually really upset about this.  i don't like confrontation.  i love my sister to death, and i don't want to do anything to alienate her from me.  at the same time, i can't handle her attempts to save me - especially not if it involves pimping me out to random strangers.  any advice (on either problem - how to talk to my sister, or how to approach interaction with this new girl) would be greatly appreciated."

Every single day I fantasize about how my life would be different if I had a do-over. I have a mother who loves me and is extremely supportive. If I opened up to her she would be very compassionate. I will never open up to her though. It's not how my mind works. My father and I have a very shallow relationship. He's a great guy, but I have never talked to him about anything more personal than sports or vacation plans.

Through highschool I was friendless. I had people who I enjoyed to hang out with at school, but we never interacted outside of school. This would probably be surprising if you met me because I tend to be very spontaneous and lighthearted when I'm with a group. Now I'm in college and I made a tight knit group of friends. We went on road trips and cooked together. Now for no reason I'm just backing away from them. Avoiding them. No reason at all. I'm stressed because of what I'm doing and I'm doing what I'm doing because I'm stressed.

Coasted through highschool without any effort whatsoever and did excellent on standardized tests so my parents though I was some sort of genius destined for fame and fortune. Thought this success was some inherent part of myself and I expect things to fall into place without me taking initiative. Now I'm an engineering student at a mediocre school who's grades are getting progressively worse and worse. I should study, but I have no motivation. (What a terrible excuse, eh?) I may fail a class for the first time ever when grades are released in a couple days. Classes are the sum total of my accomplishments so far in life, so that hits hard. 

I've been a lazy bum when it comes to applying to engineering internships, so it comes as no surprise that I didn't get one. I'm an engineering student who will graduate at the end of next school year with no internship, or research experience with a mediocre gpa. Hopefully I'll get a internship period to hire deal at some engineering firm.

I think I hit the nail on the head with this: ""I expect things to fall into place without me taking initiative"" 

(Summary of the ""Wah wah, I don't have a girlfriend paragraph."": I friendzone girls who show attraction to me. Why? No reason and I hate myself for doing it.) I'm only a little socially awkward and can pass it off as bashful, in fact I love good discussions. I'm not overweight or anything, in fact I'm athletic and love ourdoorsy things. Still, I've never been on a date, never held hands, never kissed (Virgin goes without saying?) at 21 y/o. There's been a few girls who were definitely relationship material. Hell, for a year and a half a wonderful girl and I had a mutual crush. Did I do anything about it? Ha! Good joke! I even went to her house a few times with a group of friends, was sitting in the hot tub right in front of her and told her to her face that I thought she was awesome, but no, I didn't want a relationship. What the fuck brain??? Why'd you say that??? You hurt her feelings and she's just laid it on the line. I'm not gonna break out of my shell. She moved away. Recently, there's been a cute girl who has been going out of her way to say hi and smiles at me from far away. I suspect that she's been interested in me for a while. I plan on doing precisely nothing about it.

I've also disappointed some other people more recently whom I respect. Purely by my inaction.

I know exactly what I need to do to get rid of my problems, but I don't do it. I never have. Will I ever? Only time will tell.

Well, that's all for now folks. If you know who I am, please pretend you don't. Anyways, I realize I'll probably look back at this in 10 years and think it's completely inconsequential, just like I do now with ridiculous 8th grade drama, but I'm angsty and frustrated at myself. Perhaps I'm a little bit depressed. Not really though... I still find humor everywhere. It's just that there's the person I know I could be and he's awesome, then there's the person I am. I know what I need to do to fix it, but for no reason at all, I don't. What the hell. C'mon! Just do it! ... Sigh ...

I think I'll feel better over the summer."

uld7b,6,2012-06-04,"Louisville, you're a great city, but...",capnthrowacct,Louisville,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/uld7b/louisville_youre_a_great_city_but/,"This has been bothering me for months now, and I'm hoping this makes me feel somewhat better. Rant ahead.

When I was first told that the internship would be at Louisville, I was a little worried. I'm from the southern part of Florida (actually I've noticed quite a bit of Florida plates), so to me going *anywhere* in Kentucky might as well been like sending me into the boonies. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised upon arrival. Everyone that comes up to visit has the same impression.

The state itself is fucking gorgeous. Coming from nothing but flatness and endless heat, anything with more than one hill in it puts me in awe. The people are friendly (though I will say it depends on where you go), and theres no shortage of things to do.

One thing though...and this bothers me to no end. It isn't the way you guys say Louisville, LaFayette, or any other French named thing most of America admittedly butchers anyway. It isn't the food. Oh dear God, it isn't the food. It is *absolutely* not the food.

Its the driving. You guys can't drive worth salt. I've been here twice, for a total of around one year, and it never fails to amaze me how absolutely horrifying the drivers are. At first I thought it was the snow. Sure, being from Florida myself I wasn't the greatest, but I made do and managed to not break down sign posts *constantly*. OK, it will definitely get better in the summer.

No, it doesn't. Somehow, its worse than before. The merging lane is for **merging**. When approaching a merge, it would be awful nice if you moved one lane over. You know, to avoid slowing down traffic? People getting on won't magically just disappear or stop. They're going to get on, whether you block it or not. The blame isn't placed solely on those blocking the merge, the mergers are pretty asstastic, too. If you're getting ready to enter high-speed traffic, you should try to *at least match the speed of the highway*. Why the fuck are you going 10 mph *less* than everyone else?

If that isn't bad enough, once you actually get on the highway, it isn't any better. Do people here know what the mirrors on their car are for? This isn't a huge game of deathly bumper cars, look before you haphazardly dive into a lane.

When it rains, the road is not trying to kill you. You don't have to **stop in the middle of the highway** (yes, this has happened) or slam on the damn breaks every time you approach a light. You can go fast, in fact, pretend it isn't even raining. Just leave a little room between cars for once, and everything will be fine. Breathe. Relax. Take a deep breath and let some oxygen flow through your system.

There is also the fact that **red lights are a totally foreign concept**. Its comical how many people will cruise straight through a red like it isn't even a thing. Bitch, *you can die from that!* I know you're probably thinking ""dude it doesn't even happen that much!"" Well, that may be true, but I will say in Miami I can count the number of times I've seen it happen on one hand. Literally. This is in Miami, where cops don't give a shit unless you're throwing crack out your window and shooting them with an automatic rifle like some game of drug dealer's skeet shooting. Even then you've got to be doing it in a nice neighborhood for it to be an issue.

Here? Dudes burning reds is called lunch time traffic. Not sure why though, because drivers here are mind numbingly slow. Its like nobody has anywhere to be ever, so might as well coast and take in the view. Gotta burn that red though, it'll slow you down from going ten under the limit, right next to the guy going the same speed. Its like some game of low speed drag racing, and the only losers are the people behind you, because we can't fucking go around.

Even nature here has a tendency to be awful motorists. Stupid ass Canadian geese, chilling out on the fucking backroads like its all good with their geeselings(?). *SERIOUSLY?!* Doesn't matter how close you get, they just waddle around with a look that I can only describe as ""What, you're gonna hit me with your pussy ass truck, bitch? Come at me, bro!"" At first, it was cool to see those geese. Now I just want to strangle them and deal with the huge fine. Get the fuck out the way, feathers!

The worst part of every day is waking up knowing that there are plenty of great places around, but getting there means I have to deal with *this shit* again. Fuck.

Edit: Added a small section about rain. No idea how I forgot about that given the rain thats been happening."

I loved the original even with all its flaws. I have had my beta key for months via PC Gamer. Being a computer science student in Boston (need interns?) I have some computery questions. What exactly does it take mathematically to manage thousands of players and millions of projectiles and animations going on in a digital world/continent. How do those discussions go down when you begin designing an infrastructure for something that colossal? I know you guys were testing for some innovative spawning options to keep people in the fight. What about any innovative chat/voice system between squads and platoons? The ability for a squad leader to have voice of their own squad overridden by command voice chat with another squad they are working with would be awesome. I'm sure everyone else will have a million questions so I will depart with a final one : Can any/some the air vehicles do a barrel roll ?

Say we consider the first 100k of a claim to be basic. What my boss would do is calculate development factors from basic claims data, calculate developable claims amounts for a given period by subtracting out 100k * number of maxed claims and then apply development factors and then add the 100ks back in. I say that this underestimates the ultimate since using the maxed claims in calculating the development factors is going to weight them down since they are fixed at 100k.

uo9iq,3,2012-06-06,Can I use MS Access for this?,Shariq1989,MSAccess,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSAccess/comments/uo9iq/can_i_use_ms_access_for_this/,"So here is the thing:


I started an engineering internship with a tug and barge company this summer. My boss wanted me to build him a vessel maintenance management system using which he could


1) Enter records of maintenance completed
2) Enter records of regulatory inspections completed
3) View a history of maintenance and inspections completed
4) View all upcoming maintenance and inspections, tiered by priority. 
5) An alert function for tasks upcoming within a given time duration
6) A way to print a report for work history (3) and a worklist (4)
7) There would be a separate workbook for each vessel. Easily add new components or inspections to book for it to track.
8) Easily copy and modify the workbook to work with a new vessel


I am a really computer savvy guy but had little to no knowledge of programming or macros. I do have a really good ability to pick up new computer skills quickly to get work done. As long as I have a defined problem, I can come up with solutions. It took me a little over two weeks to figure out how VBA works with Excel and build a system that does everything mentioned above really well. The maintenance and inspections work off of either time or engine hours. I figured out a way for the worksheet to pull the engine hours from another workbook that gets updated with running hours every month. Using ""Hours to Go"" till an overhaul or inspection is due and the average number of hours an engine runs over the course of a month, the workbook can predict when a new inspection or maintenance is coming up. All these inspections and maintenances are compiled into a sheet where they are prioritized using conditional formatting. Once an inspection or maint. is completed, my boss will select it from a drop down and hit a button which will paste the entry with a time stamp into a Work History sheet and at the same time, reset the Upcoming Work sheet so that the component or inspection gets an updated due date (satisfying 1, 2, 3 and 4). Then I figured out a way for Excel to send out an email using Outlook once a component or inspection fell within a certain ""Days to Go"" range (5). The email would contain the name of the vessel, the component or inspection that needs attention and the number of Days to Go. Currently working on figuring out how to have Excel automatically add the due dates to the Outlook Calendar. I am also in the process of streamlining 6,7 and 8, and just making the workbook robust in general. My boss is highly satisfied with this current system I built but I want to make it better. I want to explore all the possibilities. 


I have two more months to go on the internship and I have just now started looking at MS Access. The program just seems to be a lot more clean-cut and has the same VBA capabilities. I am wondering if it would be worth it for me to move this whole program into Access or if it is a total crap shoot. As it stands right now, I know nothing about the program but I can learn quick and am pretty interested in learning about databases. I have already started playing around in Access, just exploring what it is capable of. So it is time for me to reach out to you Access gurus! Is it worth it? Are there any better options?"
unk5g,1,2012-06-06,Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; probably cancer. What's this dude's deal? *Long post - TL;DR included*,[deleted],psychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychology/comments/unk5g/close_friend_lied_about_having_a_degree_probably/,"Hey guys,

I had originally posted this in /r/askreddit and it was suggested that this should go here. I apologize if re-posting this is against any rules, and furthermore apologize for the upcoming wall of text. Basic * *TL;DR* * is at the bottom. Hoping some of you Psych Redditors have the time to read this, and if so - thanks!

I'm 23 now, I first met my friend (well call him ""M"") M &amp; my current group of friends when I was 19. When I first met this dude I thought he was amazing. He claimed to have received his chemical engineering degree in 3 years while battling pancreatic cancer that had occurred while he was away at school. He also loves smoking weed as much as I do, and at that point in my life I blamed the marijuana on my laziness instead of taking a much deeper look at myself.

I was just coming back from University at the time, after failing out due to partying, playing WoW and never going to class. I was in-between friend groups at the time, leaving my high school friend group finally as they took the plunge into harder drugs that I'm glad I stopped while I was ahead. I say this so that you can understand the allure that M had to me, as solid proof to me at the time that you can party AND get your work done. What a motivation &amp; confidence booster!

Turns out that the degree doesn't exist and he dropped out of school when his high school Gf dumped him and he was too sad to attend classes (f**kin pussy). One of my friend's moms met up with M's Mom in the town supermarket and she mentioned his degree. M's mom looked at my buddie's Mom dumbfounded and was like, what degree? I guess that explains that in all of the years of our friendship I have NEVER been invited into his house or formally introduced to his family despite hanging out together just about every day.

As far as the Pancreatic Cancer goes, he had some minor procedure done and he must have told his ex they also found cancer to try and get her to feel awful. He told all of us it was cancer and rode this lie for a good 3 years until we started unraveling everything. At this point, we've started to make strides on calling him out on everything, except for the degree &amp; this. The degree is obvious, I just don't feel like arguing about it. As far as the Cancer, our bro's agree that we'd almost rather not know if it's real or not and still want to give him the benefit of the doubt due to the severity of the potential circumstance, despite never seeing any proof of this. He appears to be in perfect health, never watching his diet &amp; doing what he pleases.

I'll write more about it below, but M has a ""charm"" about him that I've never witnessed before. It's almost creepy looking back on it how people bend to his will &amp; how incredible he seems off the bat. I felt great thinking this guy was my best friend, and I get this charisma and charm to myself &amp; I can learn and grow my confidence further. Also, keep in mind I have never had a father figure so I take what I can get in those areas to supplement.

I remember one day he bragged about how charismatic he is and how he has a habit of splitting up groups of friends. At the time I was sure that there were other circumstances and didn't think much of it. I had introduced him to a best friend of mine, a kid that I've known the longest but didn't see as often due to our schedules. He and M hit it off and I thought it was great, until I started not seeing any of them often &amp; knowing they were just hanging out together without me.

I didn't want to look like a jealous asshole, especially amongst bro's - but one day it finally upset me enough and I cracked. I confided in M on a car ride and said that I felt like I was loosing my friendship with one of my best friends. He assured me that it was all in my head and that my other friend had mentioned nothing of the sort.

M ended up pissing off this kid a few months down the line (more on this to come as it's relevant) and I finally re-connected with my best friend. I told him that I had had that conversation with M about how I felt that I was losing a very good friend. To my surprise, my friend said that he had had the exact same conversation with M about me, and that M said that I had never once mentioned it to him.

At that point it was clear that he was making an effort for whatever to try and de-rail my friendship. I still don't understand why, and try not to dwell on it simply because I feel like it's utter stupidity. We're 20 something years old, this isn't high school and certainly the last thing I'd want to deal with when spending my time with dudes.

As for how he pissed my best friend off (who is normally extremely easy going) - we have a mutual female friend who is extremely over weight. One of the kindest girls I know, but due to her weight she acts out overly promiscuous and my friend likes to keep it in line as he is essentially like a brother to her. It was a topic that was discussed many times that if someone ever legitimately wanted to date her that they need only ask, if they truly were into her. You need to keep our ravenous dudes on a leash when she's hungry for some dick and the booze is flowing.

From my best friend's exact words to me were ""M looked me in the eyes and said ""Our friendship is more important that just fooling around for easy sex"" .""

As it turns out, because women have huge ass mouths, is that they'd get drunk and go screw around. I guess it only happened 3 times, but M's excuse was ""oh I was drunk"". Yeah? 3 times? My friend FLIPPED the fuck out, and this girl's older brothers (huge scary italian dudes) were about to kick the shit out of my best friend because this girls at home crying her eyes out saying that my friend is really mad at her. Obviously she isn't going to say ""I fucked this dude and here's the real situation"".

Sparing the rant, this is what pissed me off the most. I tried to take M out and talk to him about this. I told him that this kid is getting flack from this girls brothers due to HIS actions. He goes, ""oh, they're mad at him? Oh well, at least I'm ok."" - he then proceeded to laugh it off like a fucking joke. Meanwhile he'll be texting my friend saying he's so sorry, and that he's crying his eyes out and that he's sorry for being a shitty friend.

Fast forward to this week, everyone's back from school including her. When we get together and he manages to come around he has her giving him back massages and shit, since this girl is still head over heels for him. She keeps begging my friend to let them fuck again, even though M is seeing another girl. He still pulls this shit, and I guarantee none of the girls he's had since have any idea about this shit. He has absolutely no problem straight up using this girl in-front of all our friends &amp; her group of friends.

It's only as I've smartened up and stopped putting this kid on a pedestal that all this shit added up. You think you fucking know a guy man, and then you find out everything about him is total bullshit he made up to feed his ego.

I can't fuckin stand him and I still see him at least once a week. Anytime someone calls him on his shit he makes up some ridiculous crap, its mostly entertaining at this point and none of my other friends feel like upsetting an otherwise good time to argue with this idiot, but everyone is well aware. He never gets invited out, so if he finds out what's going on he'll usually just end up inviting himself through someone else who may also happen to be going and isn't in our immediate group of friends.

Just last week we were at a pool party with a new group of girls. He doesn't even have shame anymore, he's sitting in front of 3 of our friends talking to this one girls dad about how he's going for his second degree and is being contracted by the department of defense for chemical weapons development and blah blah.

THE WORST FUCKIN PART is that people eat it up. He comes off so charismatic, always has girls all over him even though I bust my ass at the gym and he doesn't do shit. After bullshitting this chicks dad all I could hear the other rents present talking about was how awesome that new guy that came over is. Makes me so fuckin mad.

The thing is, he IS smart. If he actually did anything with himself maybe he could achieve something. He still swears he has a degree, yet he's working at KOHLS. His Mom works at KOHLS, let's take a guess on who got their 23 year old son a job? If you have a Chemical Engineering degree, where's your fucking internship somewhere? Oh, he also switches the title of his degree from Chemical Engineering to Organic Chemistry depending on the situation, and I'm positive he thinks that I just don't care enough to remember.


The only great thing that's come of this is for me really. For years I was so certain that this kid was for real that I adapted the qualities that I liked in myself. I worked my ass off for a year and a half to get accepted back into school full-time, while working full-time. I just finished this semester with a full course load and received A's in all of them. I'm pretty stoked - and I still party and enjoy myself quite a bit. All in moderation. My confidence has never been higher, and for this entire experience I'm actually grateful. Losing someone you're close to blows, but I've learned way to many valuable lessons here.

Reading back on this entire post makes me seem like a bit of a pussy. I'm cautious when dealing with him on such extreme matters because I am infact afraid of him. The kid knows how to get into everyone's house, and if angry enough I wouldn't put it past him to do something very extreme. 3 of my other friends have expressed the same concern. 

* *TL;DR* * - Close friend lied about having a degree &amp; possibly pancreatic cancer. Uses his ridiculous charisma to carry himself through life while lying left and right, and it works. Actually intimidated by what he would do if truly angered and uncovered.

I've been dating my girlfriend for close to a year. It's been wonderful and after two horrendous LTRs and some ONSs, I've fallen in love. I'm 21, she's 19 and we met at college. I'm from New York and she's from New Hampshire - about 4 hours apart. Both have full time jobs (I'm a landscaper and she works at a dog shelter) over the rather work-filled summer to consume our time, but thankfully texting and Skyping on the weekends has kept it good. Since school ended in May and won't start up until August, we've decided that for a few days she should come down to me and I can introduce her to NYC, as well as get her name into the zoos here in hopes for an internship - and my parents, close family, and not-so-immediate family absolutely love her.

On campus, she's a welcomed visitor to my house by the guys I live with; her positivist attitude, cooking skills, and attempted to be one of the guys is admired by all.

Her parents however, do not love me, let alone like me. I'm Hispanic - Puerto Rican and Spanish, complete with the caramel complexion and affinity for laborious outdoor jobs at over minimum wage, while she is Caucasian and extremely sheltered. My parents have raised me with a, ""don't tell him the stove's hot, let him touch it"" approach while hers have deemed it necessary to bubble-wrap and hide everything from her. Now while I was understanding with the dislike towards me (Daddy never wants to let his little girl go), the dislike has become more spiteful and mean.

-Her mother REFUSES to acknowledge me. Going for a handshake, a hug, initiating or reciprocating a conversation leads to acting as if no one has said a word. When she came to my school condo to pick-up my girlfriend, she refused to leave the car and called her to leave, as well as denied my request to invite her in. He Christmas gift to me was a broken Navigational system, which I believed was an accident on her part (broke on transport, fell, etc.) until my girlfriend mentioned that it was a dud they had received ages ago and never threw out.

-Her younger brother's hate for me. Entering puberty, he generally can't stand me. It isn't surprising, he is the younger sibling and I wouldn't expect him to care about me too much since our similarities are bar none (He loves soccer, while I prefer going to the gym for example.) However, he wanted admission to an ""Academy"" of sorts for high school. When I mentioned to the family that at my community college, I won numerous awards in English, worked in the English department, and worked at the writing center, they asked for my help in his paper; an entry paper or, ""why should you come here"" essay. After formatting and fixing all I could while abiding to the rules I was taught, and his mother given the final lookover, when he was rejected the blame was placed on me by the parents and him. He constantly berates me for my ""accent"" that I never knew I had - it's all fun and games until I ask him to stop; then his father acts quite angrily towards me. Once again, childish antics.

-Her father believes he's competing with me for her affection and love. I'm not a sports fan, I admit baseball is boring without beer, football is good only for the Superbowl, and soccer is only fun if I'm playing with the guys at work for fun, etc while he is, thus he is extremely competitive. I've been quite understanding that yes, he must feel the pain every father feels when his little girl finally becomes serious with someone but also taken aback at some of his actions. I've said multiple times that I want to have a good relationship with him and that I admire him for being a ""self made man"", and in no way do I want to separate the family. He refuses to have anything to do with me as well; he has had multiple conversations with my girlfriend trying to convince her that I'm trying to emotionally and even psychically abuse her into leaving her family for me. He's told her many times that I want her for superficial reasons and that if our future extends beyond that of dating, I'd permanently separate the family for good. He has also done everything possible to cancel any form of communication between us - Skyping is interrupted by the immediate need to help him, texting me when he's around leads to him mocking my girlfriend and making her cry. He has also refused to pay for anything she needs since she started dating me. When they take us out (only after much begging from my girlfriend) I was required to pay for my meal after he ordered me a pricey dinner.
 
-Her family, two nights ago said that if our relationship continues that she will permanently be disowned - currently, my girlfriend is upset at the temporary disownment placed on her. Calling me crying, I was unsure what to do. I've been abiding by my mother's advice - ""never badmouth the parents, just be a shoulder for her when necessary."" She's never been the kind of child to scream and yell how she hates her parents and whatnot, but lately she feels unloved. Upon confronting them, they treat her like a two year old asking what sex is and feed her crap.

About my parents: they are both bilingual and rather ""modern."" My mother, Puerto Rican and secretary to an extremely well-off architect and my Spanish father, unable to work due to being shot and leaving him somewhat crippled and depressed, has become essentially a ""stay at home dad."" They both suggested that upon the meeting of the two families, any hate or negativity (she believes that, since where my girlfriend lives white is the only color around, her parents assume we embody the negative Spanish stereotype) would melt away and this would be a thing of the past. Her parents did NOT want to see my family nor liked the idea which have convinced my folks that there may be racism involved, something; her great-grandparents did call me a Spic upon meeting them but I credited that to their generation.

I've helped my girlfriend lose 20Lbs and counting, helped with her writing (she's dyslexic). and improved her self image and self-esteem. as well as (at first) got her to understand that her parents love her. I've slowly been introducing her to the ""real world"" and opening up politics (in a way where she can form her own opinion) and the like. I, as well as multitudes of other people - including her own grandparents - have said that we are wonderful together and I'm such a great guy. Yet her parents disagree up and down, and would swear by it. 

So here's the question and the 

**TL;DR** - what do I do with extremely spiteful parents towards me? Do I just let it roll and hope for it to end? My girlfriend is tired with the animosity from her parents, and I'm tired of the attacks at every possibility. I don't want to break up with her, but I'm afraid that this may lead to well, that, or her parents losing their daughter.

Pearce's pistol seems to be labeled a ""92-FS."" Google reveals that [this is an altered version of the Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92#92FS). Again, probably not significant.

The price of fuel appears to be $4.34 for a gallon of unleaded 84.

----------------------------------

That's about everything. Hopefully at least one of the random specific details will be important to the ARG. Even if not, at least I found some information such as protagonist background and the fact that this probably isn't too far into the future considering the price of gas doesn't seem very inflated."

Pearce's pistol seems to be labeled a ""92-FS."" Google reveals that [this is an altered version of the Beretta 92](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_92#92FS). Again, probably not significant.

The price of fuel appears to be $4.34 for a gallon of unleaded 84.

That's about everything. Hopefully at least one of the random specific details will be important to the ARG. Even if not, at least I found some information such as protagonist background and the fact that this probably isn't too far into the future considering the price of gas doesn't seem very inflated."

I tried (and failed) to secure an internship for this summer and after a rough semester (I failed one class and had to drop another) my GPA has dropped to 3.11. I have three main questions. First (I'm not sure if it's bad form to ask this on Reddit, but...) I am in the Baltimore/DC area and I was wondering if anyone knows of anywhere I could work that would actually provide any kind of tangible field experience. Second, if I can't find a job what would be a good productive way to spend my time (right now I'm trying to learn some web development skills like javascript/html, and PHP). Third, with no job experience going into my junior year (I have some volunteer stuff that's it) and my GPA where it is am I kind of screwed?

upnsk,15,2012-06-07,"Alright r/Egypt, time to vote for the new moderators!",wq678,Egypt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/upnsk/alright_regypt_time_to_vote_for_the_new_moderators/,"**Please upvote this post so it can stay at the top of /r/Egypt's frontpage and everyone can see it and vote.**


*If any of the candidates would like to give a paragraph or two about themselves and why they should be elected as a mod, they can PM me and I'll put it up in the post.*

**Candidates who are already on the list can only vote for one other candidate aside from themselves. That means you can only vote for yourself and one other person from the list.**

Please take the time to read the rules.

OK, so the idea is to elect two new moderators who will actually care about /r/Egypt's growth as a community.

I'm going to kinda pull a SCAF on your asses and add in an extra proposal for you guys to vote on.

I'm proposing that [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked) be voted in as a third moderator so that he can help with the design and look of the subreddit, serving alongside the two other elected moderators who will be responsible for day-to-day management of the subreddit. He does seem to have a life, so he may not be able to be here on a regular basis to manage the subreddit.

So you guys get to vote on that too.

OK, here are the voting rules:

Each person gets to choose two candidates from the Candidates List below, unless you're already on the list in which case you can vote for only one candidate aside from yourself:

**Moderator Candidates List:**

* [**docmosis**](http://www.reddit.com/user/docmosis) **(Bio added.)**

* [**Masribrah**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Masribrah)

* [**daretelayam**](http://www.reddit.com/user/daretelayam) **(Bio added.)**

* [**MohamedO**](http://www.reddit.com/user/MohamedO) **(Bio added.)**

* [**wq678**](http://www.reddit.com/user/wq678) **(Bio added.)**

* [**kingofthehill**](http://www.reddit.com/user/kingofthehill) **(Bio added)**

* [**iredditlastnight**](http://www.reddit.com/user/iredditlastnight)

* [**~~iNKu~~**](http://www.reddit.com/user/iNKu) **(Withdrew)**

* [**psychotiki**](http://www.reddit.com/user/psychotiki)

* [**ChutneyPie**](http://www.reddit.com/user/ChutneyPie) **(Bio added.)**

* [**zidane33**](http://www.reddit.com/user/zidane33)

* [**~~Xivile~~**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Xivile) **(Withdrew)**

* [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked)

Each person gets to vote **Yes** or **No** on the [**sidewalkchalked**](http://www.reddit.com/user/sidewalkchalked) proposal.

If you vote **No** on the proposal, you can still vote for him to be one of the two moderators.

If you are already on the Candidate List, then you vote for yourself by default and get to vote for only one other person from the list. 

*(The exception is **sidewalkchalked**. He gets to vote for two other candidates in addition to himself.)*


**Voting will start from now until the end of the 9th of June. Result will be announced on the 10th.**

I'll give my vote here to give you an example of what a vote/comment should look like:

&gt;**Yes.**

&gt;* wq678

&gt;* kingofthehill

I hope this isn't too confusing. If you have any questions just ask here or PM if you wish.

OK, start voting!

--------------

**Candidate Bios:**

Below are a few words from some of the candidates letting you know a little bit about them and why you should vote for them:

**MohamedO:**

&gt;I've been studying abroad for the last few years. Prior to that, I was born and mostly raised in Egypt. I'm an avid follower of the news, especially the news at home. I was one of the moderators of a small but fairly active message board for my university at home, so I have a little experience with that. I take a very dim view of censorship, but don't like feeding trolls either. I feel very strongly about politics, and loves me a hearty discussion. If I'm not elected mod, I still pledge to become an active member of r/Egypt. We really owe it to this subreddit I believe.

**daretelayam:**

&gt;I'm Egyptian, I've been a redditor for 4.5 years (pretty much addicted), I've been a mod of r/berserk for a year, and have seen it grow from 15 members to 600+. In short, I'm running on the 'experience' platform :D In the interest of full disclosure though, I have not lived in Egypt for a while, and most likely will not for the foreseeable future. I won't be able to organize meetups etc.
However I'd really really like to help in cultivating the growth of this subreddit and see it grow to be an intellectual meeting place for Egyptians online, even beyond the scope of Reddit.

**docmosis:**

&gt;I am an Egyptian born citizen who spent a number of years studying abroad but moved back to Egyptian shortly after the revolution take part in the political movement as well as complete my degree in political science. I love my country and I feel that as an Egyptian redditor it is my duty to make sure that this subreddit grows to it's full potential. The world as a whole has a very limited view on the reality of what is happening on the streets of Cairo and I want to make /r/Egypt an integral part in changing that. As a moderator I will work to my full potential to offer a domain where free and fair speech is available to those both inside as well as outside Egypt. Egypt is once again on the verge of immense change and I believe that this subreddit needs to follow suit to become a beacon of reliable information on what is happening in my homeland.

**ChutneyPie:**

&gt;Been living in Egypt for two years now, working in advertising. Fairly new to reddit compared to others, enjoy reading from the reddit community on the whole and also with regards to r/Egypt. If elected, would ensure a no tolerance policy towards spammers/anti arab posters as well as keeping a fresh environment that encourages new posts and comments.
Thanks,

**kingofthehill**

&gt;I am an Egyptian graduate student, currently based between Egypt and Europe. My research focuses on social media and public discourse in Egypt, and have a diverse spectrum of interests, from technology to endurance sports. I have lived in 'The City Victorious' all of my life aside from short stints in the US/Europe for one thing or another (studies, internships, etc). Reddit is a fantastic online community, and /r/Egypt deserves to as vibrant a subreddit as the country's rich history and culture. I plan on contributing to that as a member or a mod of r/Egypt.

**wq678** (I'm so sorry I took so long.)

&gt;I am an Egyptian college student who has lived most of his life in the Gulf, but who has lived the past 5 years here in Egypt. I had been living in the amazing city of Alexandria for the first four of those years, before moving last year to Cairo for my education. The first time I ever participated in a protest was when ElBaradie came to Alexandria to lead a large protest against police brutality shortly after Khaled Said's murder by Mubarak's Secret Police. I also participated in the Police Day protests on the January 25th of 2011 (the protests later turned into the Uprising that toppled Mubarak) in Alexandria. After the collapse of the Police, I decided to stay to close to home to help keep an eye out in my neighborhood and make sure my family is safe. We fought with thugs twice, and two of our neighbors were accidentally shot (one killed) by an untrained pistol-wielding idiot from our building. I voted No in the Constitutional referendum, voted for the Egyptian Bloc in the parliamentary elections and voted for Hamdeen Sabahi in the first round of the Presidential Elections. I won't be voting in the run-offs, because fuck both candidates. 

&gt;I promise to help grow this community by constantly seeking the opinion and consensus of the community and by being responsive to the community's requests. 

&gt;My aspiration is that /r/Egypt can eventually grow into being a highly-influential Egyptian internet community that will be a hub for Egyptians and residents of Egypt to organize non-partisan civic and political action for the greater benefit of Egypt.

&gt;I vow to respect everyone's right to air their opinions, no matter how hateful and morally repugnant they may be."
upjyt,3,2012-06-07,beginner here. I have to acquire data and show them in a graphic in real time. I don't know where to start.,allasui,rtgraphics,https://www.reddit.com/r/rtgraphics/comments/upjyt/beginner_here_i_have_to_acquire_data_and_show/,"I'm currently doing an internship in medical ultrasound. The company has bought a digitizer board and my project is to develop the software to use this board.

For now we managed to acquire the data in real time and show them in the prompt. Our next step is to show a graphic of those data.
 I've had just a few classes about human–computer interaction so I am really a beginner at all of this.

So with what graphic library should I start with? I've already heard about SDL, MFC and Qt; is there any others and which one is the most suitable for my project?
And where can I find a good tutorial about this library?

I hope I am in the good subreddit, if not thank you to redirect me to the proper one!"
upa47,3,2012-06-07,Advice about career opportunities,ssb8002,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/upa47/advice_about_career_opportunities/,"I'm a 0L going to attend a third tier law school in Illinois and am planning to transfer after my 1L to a second tier law school. Now, if I was planning to stay in the Chicago area, I know that I would be pretty much set because that is where I'm going to be. All my internships and what not would be here.

However, my boyfriend, career wise, does not have very many options location wise. He's planning to go into the reserve units with the air force and right now, the ones that are the most feasible to him are the ones in California, and possibly Portland or Seattle. If he transferred, it'd be to the East Coast. New Jersey or Delaware or something. 

There's a possibility that he'd be in Milwaukee but that's a long shot.

So here's my question. If I graduate from a 2 tier school, close to the top of my class, what are my chances of getting hired out of state? Should I intern where he would end up to increase my contacts? What should I do?

Any and all advice is appreciated :)"
up8qe,92,2012-06-07,"Learning game is much more than getting women, it's about total self-improvement.",cause_a_nuva,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/up8qe/learning_game_is_much_more_than_getting_women_its/,"LONG POST BUT IT'S MY STORY TO DATE


My story or whatever. Just thought a wrap-up is necessary. This is my new account for this subreddit. I will use an absolute scale for girls with 6.5 being my fuckable threshold and 10 being unobtainable. I can't put timestamps on these.

I made lots of good friends this year. It can be attributed to improving my confidence through improving my body and mind. Reading some Tolle, listening to RSD vids, going out and talking to men and women, kissing lots of girls, getting freaky, and doing well academically.


Did study abroad and kept my girlfriend back home. Did the long distance thing. I didn't cheat or anything even though I had plenty of opportunities. We broke up during my finals week and that sucked a huge one. I was really into her and it was pretty emotional for me. She wanted to ""be 21 in her city for her summer internship."" Yeah she wanted to do whatever and be guilt-free. 

My buddy had mentioned ""The Game"" to me about it was about getting good with women so I ended up reading it. It was entertaining enough but I wanted more. I searched Mystery and all those guys. They seemed kinda weird but were apparently pimps just not my style. Nothing really for a while but then youtube showed me a Tyler RSD vid that was suggested for me. This was October, the beginning. Watched quite a few RSD videos. Tyler is one crazy mofo (hilarious) but his talks made sense. I was hitting the gym and my inner game was pretty good. 

Halloween I meet a girl though a friend and I get laid (HB 6.75, busty redhead,my bed, awesome sex, we are still friends)

However, I wasn't 21 yet like all of my friends so there wasn't much I could do.

**I turn 21**

Birthday weekend I bring another girl home but then the semester ends. (HB 6.5, makeout, crashed at my place, I was drunk)

**Spring semester senior year**

Party at our house I flirt hard with a girl who is a sorority sister of
housemate's GF. (HB 7.5, fantastic body, makeout first night, become friends with benefits, 3rd base almost every other night, still friends)

Out at a bar soon thereafter, meet up with a friend, cute HB 8 in group, we talk and I make it to her sorority house and I get her number and we end up hanging out a few times. I never even get a kiss. I still regret not being forward enough.

I find out about Natural Game and I watch the Tim Method stuff.

**Level up time**

Go to a bar/club. Meet up with a girl friend who brought her friend. We end up hitting it off. Dancing hardcore. Grazing faces. As we are bouncing to another bar I pull her and against a wall. Makeout. Two hours later back to her place. (HB 8 redhead, freak, F-close, good times)

Hooked up with friends little sister. (HB 6, not that attractive, I swear she roofied me, 3rd base) 

So I'm still seeing the redhead at this point. An open relationship of sorts.

**Spring Break time (holy shit)**

Basically it's my university down in this spring break town. Level up time. 

7 or 8 total makeouts and one F-close in one week. 

One night in particular.

* Madeout with a HB 8.5 but she felt bad because I literally took her from a friend of mine who asked her to a formal (I didn't know), 
* 30 minutes later a HB 7.5 (tad chubby)
* 20 minutes later I told my friends I was in the zone. Went up to a HB8 we sorta know, told them I could makeout in less than 5 minutes for $5. I won.

F-close was the the next night. I had approached her (HB 8) and her friends (One 8 the other a 8.5) two nights before and got her number. I texted them, met up by myself with three girls. Left with all three. I thought I was gonna have a 4some. Two of the girls leave and my girl says she's wanted me since I got her number cus I was smooth as fuck and sexy apparently. 

**Back home**

I end up getting a new hookup buddy from a different sorority. HB 8.5. She's really well known by everyone on campus but she's a bit weird.


Then one of my close friends in my friend group reveals that she has had a thing for me. I've always liked her. Really awesome girl. HB 9, former cheerleader but a bad semester made her a bit chubby not bad tho. We end up dating for a while. First night we were seeing each other I was still in game mode. I accidentally picked up a girl and next thing I know I'm making out with this HB 7.5 or so and my hand is on her ass and she is wanting to bounce. I tell her no.

Continue dating HB 9 for next month till school ends. She is sad cus we are really good together, she finds out about my PUA side and is disappointed and disgusted but I respect her decision as she is truly a fantastic person.

And here I am now waiting to move down to ATL to start my new job.

I know I missed some hookups. There are more than I ever could have imagined. The best nights I had were the ones where I went out with friends and just had fun with them. This attracted others into our frame and they were aroused and by simply adding sexual energy we were all able to have a good time. 

That that girl I was dating when I was abroad? Yeah she now wants me back. Will I let her back in? No way! There are lots of amazing girls out there and once you realize that you are just as amazing you will be the prize and choose what you want. Don't settle.

""You have a nice frame on you, big shoulders son.""

I couldn't believe what I'd just heard. Trying to regain my professional bearing before tears began to flow, I pretended to have misheard him and asked, ""What was that?"" I hoped he would realize the offensiveness of his comment and change the subject, but he plowed right ahead. 

""You look like you're in great shape. Do you exercise?""

For 5 minutes I tried to endure the torturous conversation about lifting and fitness, and finally I could take no more. I excused myself to the restroom and cried in the stall until lunch time.

I don't know how I can return. Just because my polo shirt fits tight over my arms and chest and displays my swole back, I have become a target of discrimination. Im terrified that another wheelchair bound senior will crush my soul again, and I don't know what to do."
urou5,86,2012-06-08,Just something I'd like to share. New interns at work.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/urou5/just_something_id_like_to_share_new_interns_at/,"Okay so I work for a government agency and we just got a fresh batch of summer interns in my department (IT), all male. There is a pretty diverse work force here otherwise and I'm proud to say there are a lot of women in management positions. I've been here a year and I have never heard that fact mentioned, let alone in a negative light. That gets me to today. 

A coworker was helping me format some reports and happened to mention something he heard the interns talking about, at full volume, in the hallway. They were discussing how weird they thought it was that so many women were managers, they were actually complaining. They were talking about how they're glad that their female manager isn't the emotional type, and how hard it must be to get work done with all the other female managers. I was so taken aback. This from 20 year old college students? I'm glad I wasn't there. God forbid if I had gotten ""emotional"". 

It stinks because they will be here the whole summer and I can almost always hear them carrying on and being loud. They seem to talk about women a lot, I've caught snippets like ""Ew! what if you had to wake up to her every morning!"" or "" yea I'd do her, she's a little old though"". Charming. I assume they are the types that hardly have contact with women, every time I've gone into their room (they keep the 64 bit test machines in there) they go awkwardly silent. 

So, these guys have more than two months left here. Lets hope they don't say something stupid in my presence. I don't know if I'll be able to hold back."

I never really looked for an internship during school because I was able to work and pay most of my tuition, resulting in almost no student loans. It seems most employers who are offering internships aren't looking for individuals who have already graduated. 
I'm currently studying for my CTP and trying to teach myself the gist of SQL.

It seems like S&amp;T would be better academically, but most of the people who I've heard of having gone there have said bitter things about the lack of contact, how small it is, etc. This doesn't fare well with me. If I went to Mizzou could I still study well and do just as well as at a science focused school, and still get internships, good post-grad offers, and everything else?"

I come from a ClarisWorks era, ya know?  My problem is that my freaking old see-through iMac in the basement has had better longevity and fewer problems than either of my laptops.

* I had a black MacBook in college, and the hard drive died after about a year.  I replaced the hard drive, but someone stole the laptop later, and I got a new one.
* I currently have a 15"" MacBook Pro, and the Apple Store recently told me that I am having kernel panics (again... last time they said it was a faulty battery) because my hard drive is reapportioning itself in preparation of failure.  It's been a bit over two years.
* My mom's 13"" MacBook Pro, which is newer than mine and seldom even used (she really just doesn't know how), just had a hard drive failure.  What!

Can someone tell me what's going on?  I mean, I'm the first to admit I was a drunk college kid who smacked my 15"" a few times, and I took it to classes a lot (large Big Ten campus, so a lot of movement).  Apple said hard drives are moving parts, and just like cars, they fail.  I am unconvinced and sad.  Can someone tell me how to stop killing my computers so I can stop paying 200-some dollars for new hard drives?

tl;dr Why do all the MacBook hard drives fail in two years or less and how can I prevent this?

edit:  bullets

edit 2:  While I have your attention, is there a reason that a kernel panic would have zapped my old black 30 GB iPod so that it doesn't recognize it's a disc?  Also.  Is the best plan of attack to use Time Machine, then hit up the Apple Store and shell out the $215 to get this fixed?  And how to I be sure that I wiped my mom's external hard drive of... incriminating... things... when I'm done..."

usoeb,7,2012-06-08,Initial thoughts as a hospital chaplain intern: Ministry in a multi-faith context,madcowbomber,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/usoeb/initial_thoughts_as_a_hospital_chaplain_intern/,"I started working this week as an intern at a large hospital in Atlanta.  My background is PCA evangelical (somewhat conservative, white upper middle class, in my experience.)  I have a BA in Biblical Studies and am working on an MA in Chaplaincy, just to give you a bit of background on me.  

With the exception of a couple Catholics, I'm probably about the most theologically conservative person in the group of 16 interns, which includes Christians of much more liberal denominations, Rosicrucians, Buddhists, Sufis, as well as gay Christians. 

What I've come to realize is that in this context, theology becomes more of a barrier than anything else (at least for me).  It distances me from real people with real, authentic, valid life experiences of their own.  I have to let go of almost all my theology - and almost all my religious heritage and tradition - in order to be an effective minister.  One of the verses that has been rolling around in my head has been from 1 Corinthians 8, where Paul says, ""Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies.""  My knowledge may or may not be superior; it may be more theologically rigorous and Biblically accurate - but that will not help me convey God's love to my fellow interns, much less the hundreds of patients we'll see.  

The reason I mention this here is because one of the ongoing undercurrents of conversation here at /r/Christianity is the tension between Christian liberalism and conservatism, and verses and doctrines get thrown back and forth.  As a chaplain, if I got involved in a conflict like that in the hospital - with anyone - I would be wrong.  It's too easy to get sucked into theological shit fights, where no minds are changed, no hearts are softened.

One of the approaches we're learning about through this internship has to do with encountering another person, in the model of Martin Buber's I and Thou, recognizing that each person isn't an homogeneous object, but a complex mix of thoughts, feelings, and experiences that is deserving of recognition.  Part of encountering the Thou (especially when it's a patient or patients in conflict) is letting go of the outcome.  I'm not there to make sure that orthodox practice is established and followed.  I'm there to help people understand each other, make decisions that need to be made, and process their feelings in a healthy way.  Let me encourage all of us to listen with open minds and open hearts to hear each others' stories, and to lovingly respect each other."

uus4f,1,2012-06-10,Facebook Ads for Greek Life,4DaWin,GreekLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreekLife/comments/uus4f/facebook_ads_for_greek_life/,"I decided Reddit was probably the best place to ask this question. I go to a school of about 1200 students. We have 13 Greek organizations and are approaching %50 student involvement in Greek Life. In the Fall of 2010, one house was shut down by it's national headquarters due to lack of size. I noticed one day on Facebook adds showing up talking about being the founding class of a fraternity at my school (I was not in school at the time, as I was taking time off for an internship). This house's national office sent in recruiters to restart the chapter and had paid for targeted ads for students of my university between certain ages.

Recently, my house has been doing a lot of experimenting with social media and it's possible uses for rush. Having a page for our chapter has proven to be quite useful. In the past few months, we've looked to that aforementioned example as reason to experiment with using adds to drive freshmen traffic to our page. Facebook offers pay-per-click and pay-per-display options, with automatic cutoffs. We've been considering just throwing $25 towards it at the start of the term and seeing how much more traffic gets driven to the page.

My question to the Reddit community is, has anyone tried this before? Was it effective? Does having an ad make your house look desperate for new members or is it in fact a smart way to reach out to potential members?"

I took it in high-school and did pretty well, but I lost a huge chunk of my vocabulary. I've been using Memrise to try to build my vocab back up.

Any thoughts on this?"
uu76s,3,2012-06-10,"In a Community Obsessed with Violence, the Average Citizen must stand out from his Fellows",SiIence,Hungercraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hungercraft/comments/uu76s/in_a_community_obsessed_with_violence_the_average/,"Hello. My name is SiIence, and it is late at night and this is clearly a trollsome post. What follows is a collection of letters and quotes submitted to me from a number of users, protesting the recent spike in violence and killing in our community. I hope you consider this, and hopefully come to the realization that in a harsh society such as ours, violence is not the answer.            

Recent HungerCraft winner Scoola states ""I don't know about all this killing, man. I mean, it may be the point of the game and all, but I'm not sure that we are making the right choice as a gaming community, you know? There is so much we could accomplish in our hour and a half if we all worked together for once.""            

Scoola's point of view is one of growing importance and popularity throughout our community. In protest to these senseless deaths, he and several others have begun building up towers at the corn and jumping, rather than continue the violence.            

""Dear SiIence,
       Regarding your recent message to me on Reddit, I must say I agree with you on all points. As a whole, picture all we could accomplish! We could build grand cities, create lavish mines, but instead, we pilfer, plunder, and murder. Is this the way we want to live? CAN we live with ourselves this way? I know I've done things... Things I don't want to talk about, all over a porkchop midway through a game. The friends I have betrayed just to stay alive will never trust me again. Can I live with that? I don't know. I just wanted to thank you for being there for me through all this. It's been tough... (EDITOR'S NOTE: Parts of this letter were edited out due to unneeded declarations of love) And through all this, you've been there. Where was I? Oh, yes. The killing. Yeah, it's bad. We need to band together, now or never to choke this evil at its root.             Sincerely, Sup13r4367na787554327584732597289562439t43al            

Interview with Yamata4TW, dated 6/8/12, 8:43 PM.      SiIence: So, what are your views on the violence in our community?      Yamata4TW: Erm, what? I thought you asked me in here to see if I wanted to join the map building team.      S: No, I... Wait, what? Why on earth would we want you? You suck at everything! Erm, pardon. Most things. Back to the topic. What are your views on the killings?      Y: Uh, they are bad, I guess? I mean, I've never thought about this before, but it is sort of pointless. We have to stop the violence and bond together. It is our only real hope if we want to stay sane throughout the harsh enviroments we voluntarily put ourselves into. It's wrong.      S: What do you think is wrong about the killings, and how do you think we should stop them?      Y:Well, what is wrong with them is obvious. Killing in any medium is murder. We need a court system in our games, so that those who are murdered can be sentanced and tried fairly, rather than an eye for eye, tooth for tooth approach. I don't support the death penalty. Game in prison, maybe? I don't know. But as for stopping the killings, the murderers must be publicly punished. A harsh reaction is our only option here.      S: Thank you for your time.      Y:Wait, I don't even get a reward for doing this? Screw you, man, F--- *END INTERVIEW*            

Dear SiIence,      
This killing is terrible! We have to end it as soon as possible. I'm planning a rally tonight, MC1 at the corn. Be there and we can see what we can stir up.      Signed, Manastacious

Transcript of the MC1 Massacre, dated 6/9/12      Manastacious: Brothers! Stop the fighting! We must stop the fighting before we are completely lost to this! Lay down your arms! Give up this senseless violence! We must- *MANASTACIOUS WAS KILLED BY TYLERTHEBRAIN*      Scoola: He's got a diamond sword! Run! Run! *GENERAL SOUNDS OF SCREAMING AND PANIC, THEN SILENCE*      Tylerthebrain: Stupid hippies.            

Doctor M. Rasta's patient logs of Tylerthebrain, dated 6/10/12       Rasta: How have you been feeling, Tyler?      Tylerthebrain: I've... I've got this urge, doc. I can't help it. There's a voice.      R:And what is the voice saying?      T: It's... It's saying the violence is good. It's saying you have pork. And armor. It's saying I should kill you. I... I should KILL ALL OF YOU. KILL...      *PATIENT SUBDUED BY INTERNS*      R: *TO HIMSELF* I've never seen someone this completely insane. We must end the violence as soo- *TYLER HAS ESCAPED AND STABBED RASTA WITH DIAMOND SWORD*       T:No. It must continue. There must be a winner. I must be the winner.           

I hope I have convinced you tonight of the plight of our society. We must band together before we fall apart. The average man must muster his courage and somehow show his heart, be it through scuicide at the corn, hiding, or working together with his brothers to better the world in which we live before we destroy it entirely.                         Please note, this entire post is meant humorously and is not meant in any way to offend or portray in a negative light any characters."

utwy8,17,2012-06-09,"Breaking down today. (o no, female FA)",pun_about_throwaway,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/utwy8/breaking_down_today_o_no_female_fa/,"I can't handle it anymore.  I can't take the sheer lack of contact with people.  This sounds desperate, but maybe I am.

When I was younger (read, up until I was about 20), I had more friends than I knew what to do with.  I had moved several times when I was a little bit, but I thought I had everything under control.  I had a boyfriend who I was convinced I was going to marry.  I moved to another country for him (not as if I hadn't met him before or anything like that).  I had made friends in his home country, and in my own.  Then I lost my bestie due to my own anxiety issues manifesting as pure-asshole-bitchiness.  Then a few months after my visa expired and I moved back to the US, the ex told me he was cheating on me and we were over.  Of course, all the friends I had made in his home country left me.  

Then, I just slowly crashed.  I thought I solve my problems with xanax.  The ex toyed with me, telling me he was sorry and we would get back together.  A family member got ill, so I balanced a part time internship, a full course load, and taking care of my family.  (I'd often only sleep 3 hours or so a night).  The summer I turned 22 was the start of me really crashing.  I was working 40 hours a week, living on my own, having this ex tease me, and often rushing to the ER with the sick family member and spending the night(s) at the hospital with her.  I found a boyfriend for a month, but it failed.

It was then that I stopped going to classes.  I failed semester and lied to everyone about it.  I stopped leaving my apartment, unless I had to.  I was put on anti-depressants which put me in a weird manic episode where I paced around my living room and threatened to kill myself.  I stopped them cold turkey (but still took the xanax and beer to numb everything out).  It was then that I could only sleep with the benzos, and could hardly function at all.  I lost the few friends I had left, of my own volition.  (Agoraphobia is a bitch)

Somehow, I forced myself to snap out of it enough to finish my classes (with one major relapse).  I found two jobs that I enjoy, and have generally been happy with my life. It's been two years (I'm 25 in three months) since any major problems.

**tl;dr: Went a little crazy, no friends.**

What's the point of this?  I have noone around anymore, and I feel like I'm starting to fall back in to my depression.  I have no ""peers"".  I don't know anyone in the area, and I don't have any real hobbies any more.  I lost a lot of my confidence after my breakdown.  I have no real family in the area.  I have co-workers, but most are either in their mid-30s with kids, or in their 40s and 50s.  Nice enough people, but still nothing.  I gained some weight during my depression (went from a size 12 to a 16-18ish), and just feel like no one would want to be around me any way.  I don't drink any more.  I just... am alone, obvs.  And I needed to just tell SOMEONE, because I'm afraid if I don't I'm going to do something stupid some time soon.

Sorry for the throwaway."

uwi2s,148,2012-06-11,"Fuck you, Alan.",booksarepretty,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/uwi2s/fuck_you_alan/,"Warning: Long and contains language. I don't usually use this much language but Alan is a terrible human being. There isn't a classy way to express my distaste for him. I apologize if I offend you. 

Fuck you, Alan. Hard. Working with you these past 7 years has been terrible. You are a terrible co-worker and the entire organization thinks so. Do you know how hard it is to induce the scorn of nearly 300 employees? Pretty fucking hard, but you did it. 

What exactly is it that you do? I know that you lurk around our office like you think you are important, drifting into conversations like you have business there. You don't. We will let you know when something pertains to you. Promise. 

You float into meetings you aren't invited to and steal the extra lunches. Fuck you for that. I take those extra lunches downstairs to the interns, who can use all the help they can get since they are working for free, and Will, whose entire paycheck (nearly) goes to pay for medical treatment for his disabled child.Fuck you for taking their lunches when you make triple their salaries. What in the hell are you even doing at the meetings? You have been told repeatedly that you aren't to invite yourself to them but you still do. 

Our CEO is a man who loves to hand out second chances to you because you did that one spectacular thing 7 years ago when you first started. OMG, you totally brought us a supporter! I will admit that it was much needed . But when he turned his back on our organization four years ago because of you, you should have been fired. Now our non-profit is barely scraping by because you are too lazy to go out and do your actual job. You have one job, Alan. One fucking job. 

How dare you go into my office and log on to my computer when I wasn't there. You don't think I know. I do. Fuck you. You don't even work in my building. You work in the office across town. Why in the hell are you even over here? You didn't think I would reported you to HR, did you? I did. They were appalled. It is part of the reason you are under review now.

I recently got a lock installed on my office door. Good luck getting in now. What the hell were you looking for anyway? 

Also, fuck you for calling me repeatedly while I was on Maternity Leave for things that weren't emergencies. Debbie was fucking handling my stuff while I was out. You got the fucking email I sent out regarding it because you replied to it. I don't even deal with anything you would need to contact me about anyway! "" Do you have a copy of the report from last year?"", you said in one voice mail I received shortly after giving birth. No I don't fucking have a copy of the report from last year because I don't handle the reports. I don't fucking handle the reports. You aren't new. You know this. The second and third calls ( I was still in the hospital) about how the break room was out of paper towels was just fucking mean.  

Coming back after maternity leave to 200-something emails from you was wonderful. I didn't answer them because you don't need that information. It isn't even your job to know that information. 

Fuck you, Alan. Fuck you and how you take Carrie's parking spot when you visit our location even though you know she has to park there because of her recent surgery. She had fucking cancer, Alan.

Also, how dare you come to my baby work shower (that was after fucking hours) and eat the majority of my awesome cake. That was my cake. No one invited you. How do you even find out about it? You don't even work in our office. Did you just decide to stay until 7pm one day at the office you don't work at for some reason? You just stumbled into my closed office with that stupid look on your face and said, "" Er, look! Cake!"". Fuck you, Alan. I was pregnant and I was going to eat that cake. I said one piece, Alan. Not the whole rest of the cake.  

You really hurt Noah's feelings when you made fun of the way he speaks. He has a fucking speech impediment, you asshole. Not to mention you work for a fucking non-profit whose job it is to help people like Noah. 
   
Tomorrow you have a review with the Board and the CEO to determine whether the department you run is up to standards. I hope you fail. It sickens me to think that because the jobs of the individuals with disabilities who work at your location depends on your success, but I can't help but delight in the fact that you are failing. 

I will dance, Alan. I will dance and I will celebrate with cake - my cake, not yours- (quietly and alone) when they pull your expense records and find that you are mismanaging funds, and finally fire you.

Fuck you, Alan. 

You are the only thing I hate about my job.  

Edit: Thanks for the words of support and the sympathy anger, everybody! You are too wonderful. It is 8:04, my time (CENTRAL), and Alan just arrived for the meeting. My office is usually pretty quiet this early in the morning, but everyone is buzzing around conversat-ing about what is about to go down in that conference room. I will do a update post when I have the news. 

Again, thanks so much for all your comments!  

Edit: I did an update [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/uyga5/update_byebye_alan/) if anyone is interested in checking that out.  "

I have been accepted for MS in CS this Fall. 

I don't have plans on continuing to do PhD, as of now. I plan on cruising through my MS - working hard, keeping my grades up throughout, try to get a good internship and eventually taking up a good job, that pays around $70-75k atleast or more. 

I want to know if I am taking the right step ? How were the internship and jobs offered to the graduating class of 2012 ? Are the grad students happy generally about their placements ? What is the median salary package offered to an MS grad ? 

thanks guys! looking forward to joining here!

uypff,0,2012-06-12,Parsing an XML properties file with Java,brandnewaquarium,java,https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/uypff/parsing_an_xml_properties_file_with_java/,"I'm currently at my first internship, and I've been fighting with a new project.  The other developer I was working with got pulled onto other things, so I thought maybe this would be helpful.

I want to parse an XML document using Java.  The purpose of this application would be to create a very basic in-house file archiver. 

Structure of XML Document:
http://pastebin.com/6tyj8LsD

So, the ""special properties"" for the sub directories would be able to have all of the same properties as any other directory, but they wouldn't necessarily be REQUIRED.  Instead, we would have the parent directory overwrite any unstated properties for the subdirectory.  Normally, the only thing to be overwritten would be the archive location, though occasionally we may want to add a file to be ommitted or limit the amount of time for the subdirectory to be worked in.

Breakdown:
* Each directory will have its own thread from a threadpool.

* Each thread will be fed from one main function.  Basically, I'd like to have each thread be spawned per &lt;directory&gt; tag.

* But how to parse the XML document?  I've so far tried doing this recursively, but recursion isn't something I'm very well practiced at.  Should I be parsing the XML document into a NodeList or a CopyOnWriteArrayList?

* How would I pass each collection to the thread?  I never learned very much about collections in school, but I've heard things like map and hash thrown around.

* What kind of collection would be best for this type of tree?

* I'm a little but unsure of how I should be handling the XML document.  Should I be using SAX or XOM or DOM?  I'm not even entirely sure of how to use any of them - perhaps an example?

* Any other useful references, or stuff I should be aware of?"

uygy8,1,2012-06-12,Help with car audio?,[deleted],CarAV,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/uygy8/help_with_car_audio/,"I recently started an internship this summer, and I'm making pretty damn good money with it. I have always loved listening to music, especially thumpin' some songs with great beats over a great car audio sound system with friends or just driving.


anyways, I just got my first car pretty recently, a [1994 Toyota 4runner](http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/1990-to-1995-toyota-4runner-6.htm) that [looks somethin like this](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=1994+gold+toyota+4runner&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=lAeOhpYekascNM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/73331-94-4-Runner-Build-newb-thread&amp;docid=t5lTJXNLC7adQM&amp;imgurl=http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/421988_241147235966333_100002131760963_534983_107055691_n&amp;w=960&amp;h=720&amp;ei=X57XT-vQDaP42QXVp9iFDw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=1148&amp;vpy=433&amp;dur=282&amp;hovh=144&amp;hovw=194&amp;tx=119&amp;ty=75&amp;sig=103651068722960306348&amp;page=2&amp;tbnh=135&amp;tbnw=182&amp;start=25&amp;ndsp=30&amp;ved=1t:429,r:11,s:25,i:189). I love her so far. Her name is Roxanne. She needs some work and some love, but I want to fix her up (not only with engine work but also with my audio).

I'm pretty positive the front speakers are blown, but that's alright because I was probably going to replace them regardless. the problem with those is that they are in the dash, so if I install them myself I'm guessing it won't be easy. just judging from the size I believe the front speakers are 4"" speakers. I would also like to put subs in the back, most likely two 12 inchers. I've done some research over what brands are better than others, but I figured it would be pretty helpful to figure out what I would like to do on here. basically I'm looking to get a new stereo deck, front speakers, subs in the back (I have plenty of room), and an amp if it's going to help. I would like to spend enough on this system that I can keep it and place it in the next car I own (probably after college if this 4runner will last me).

Another note: I have a company car, a [2010 Chevy Tahoe](http://www.google.com/imgres?q=2010+chevy+tahoe+ltz&amp;num=10&amp;um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=775&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=shPT4Z3TjIBxoM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://beautycarsden.blogspot.com/2010/02/2010-chevy-tahoe-ltz-suv-pictures-and.html&amp;docid=Fmj_E8ycuT-d2M&amp;imgurl=http://assets.clickmotive.com/ail/stills_white_0640/4484/4484_st0640_046.jpg&amp;w=640&amp;h=480&amp;ei=tp7XT4n9Foui8ASl5bG2Aw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=324&amp;sig=103651068722960306348&amp;sqi=2&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=117&amp;tbnw=156&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=28&amp;ved=1t:429,r:1,s:0,i:115&amp;tx=110&amp;ty=62), that I get to use all summer and I will be driving around a lot in (hour long drives at a time). it's a hell of a fun drive, it already has a built in Bose system (I know I know Bose, everyone hates Bose) which has a pretty good sound, good bass too when I crank it up. it's pretty crisp, and it would really thump with some subs in it. if I'm going to do a lot of driving in this Tahoe over this summer, so I figure it's worth looking into buying subs and installing them in this Tahoe, and then moving them into my 4runner at the end of the summer. if this is indeed feasible, let me know. it would be awesome to do, but if it's too complicated let me know. I also realize that the 'runner will have different power outputs than a pretty new Tahoe, and I feel like that's what I would have to worry about most.
so yeah, I appreciate any and all help / advice I can get from you guys.

**tl;dr** I own a '94 Toyota 4runner that I'm looking to trick out my audio for, and I'm entertaining the idea of putting subs temporarily in my Tahoe.

uy56x,17,2012-06-12,"27M. I really feel like I'm taking a risk here, but I 
think it'll be worth it. (Throwaway used)",TossedAwayForReal,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/uy56x/27m_i_really_feel_like_im_taking_a_risk_here_but/,"What I mean by taking a risk is that there is a new intern that got hired where I work. She's going into her last year of college this coming fall so I assume she’s around 21 or 22. I've been in plenty of relationships, just never one where I met the person at work. I work in IT and I setup her PC and made some smalltalk. I took my sweet time because I was really attracted to her. I guess you could say we  ""hit it off"" (IT Crowd fans: It means she kept talking to me after I'd fixed her computer) but I couldn't really tell if she was being flirtatious or just friendly. I pretty much just asked things to get to know her like: ""Where do you go to college?"" ""What's it like so far up here?""  ""Where are you staying while up here?"" ""Do you travel home on the weekends?"" etc. She smiled as I asked away and didn't really ask me anything back. After the couple minutes of conversing she says ""thanks for your help"" and we go about our work and business. 

I then get to see her again because she had some general questions and just wanted some things setup on her desktop. She asks me about a home internet question and of course I give my best answer. I catch her looking at my junk and then she looks up in my eyes. I'd imagine that's a good sign, you ladies will have to help me on that one. I then just talk a little bit more about anything I can possibly think of. I ask her how it's been again so far, now that she's been here for two more weeks. I learn a little bit more about her. She seems to like being outdoors and  she said that she reads a lot. We start discussing bicycles and I talk a little bit about mine  and she seems interested in what I'm saying. Once again, smiling, and once again she thanks me for my help and sends me on my way. She seems to keep pretty good eye contact with me as well.

So far these have been my only interactions with her and I'm trying to be as detailed about it as possible. Naturally, I'm scared to death to ask her out. My biggest fear when asking a girl out is that they are already taken, it just makes me feel weird for some reason. I also don't want any awkwardness at work if she says no for one reason or another. I'm the only IT support in her area so I have to face her if she needs anything and I was never good at interacting with females that reject me.

What I want to accomplish is finding out if she's already in a relationship. Is there anyway to  figure this out without sounding awkward or making it obvious I'm trying to find out? She has no  personal photos at her desk, and doesn't wear any rings at all. That's about the best detective work I could do. If I can get that far, what would be the most appropriate way to ask to do something outside of work? She lives by herself while interning and I'm sure she would like some social interaction and a friend. I don't wanna ask her out right away anyway, I really want to get to know her first and be friendly and do friendly things and take it from there. 

TL;DR: I’m interested in an intern at work, and want to find out if she’s available and how to ask her to hang out.

Any advice would be nice! :) Feel free to AMA as well.


EDIT: Thank you everyone. I'm extremely thankful for all the advice! I'm concluding that I will just let this one go. I'm in a ""career"" more so than a job, so I want to keep everything as clean and rumor free as possible, even if it's just an intern. Other office workers know about how some people talk, so I feel I'm good. If she asks me out, maybe I'll try it, but I don't wanna be the weirdo that tries to get with coworkers. As I stated, I have no experience with dating coworkers and for a damn good reason it seems. I always felt it was a bad idea, but this girl was really different and special to me. There will be many more outside of work. Once again, Thank You :) "

**REDDITWRITINGCLASS:**  
I'll be leading discussions but I'll also be participating in exercises and reading responses. I hope (and expect) to learn from all of you. I consider you all my peers. I'm currently hawking 2666 by Roberto Bolaño.

I hope to learn a lot here. My (fiction) writing background is pretty sparse. A few stories and poems in college. I've always enjoyed writing and really enjoyed seeing other people read what I write. I'm especially looking forward to the challenge of being forced into writing with a group of folks who might actually cast a critical eye at what I put on paper.


I'm a graduate student in philosophy, so I write a lot of nonfiction. I'm finishing up the research on my thesis now, which is a historical work on Augustine's Theory of Forms. I don't know that I have a current ""must-read"" author or book. I read a few at once - right now I'm reading Neoplatonism by Pauliina Remes (history of philosophy), a collection of science fiction short stories (of mixed quality) called Far Horizons, and an old collection of Poe's stories called The Fall of the House of Usher: And Other Tales and Prose Writings of Edgar Poe.  
.  
**nichole123**  
I hope to learn more about my writing style, and what others think about my writing objectively. I write YA Fiction, so I tend to read a lot more YA than Adult. I'm also a romance and fantasy junkie, so that will color my book suggestions.


I've written ever since I learned how (I wrote an award winning book in 3rd grade, woop!). I love telling stories about honest people that evoke real emotion in people. I love writing in general, and the way it can transport you somewhere you would never think to go.


Adult must read is Kelly Armstrong, specifically her ""Bitten"" series. Great voice, and the first ""action"" books that I actually enjoyed. YA must read is Maggie Steifvater. Anything by her. She writes very poetically and draws you in to the characters.

Hi all. If you had told me I would pursue a career in writing a few years ago, I would have laughed at you. Growing up, I was always an avid reader, but I excelled in the technical and math classes. The last four years I've spent my time working towards a computer science degree. Through an internship and subsequent job making iOS/Android games, I found that passion was for story development, not programming.


I am now majoring in Journalism and Screen Studies and should be graduating next spring. I want to continue my career in story development/ worldbuilding/ narrative design in the game industry.


I have had no formal training in fiction writing (the first will be a 400 level script writing class in the fall, yikes!), so I am hoping to learn some of the finer points and experiment with different styles.


For fantasy writing, Tolkien is probably the most influential. For science fiction, I am particularly fond of a less known author, Dan Abnett, who writes in the Warhammer 40k universe, among others. Recently I have been on a sci-fi streak with Snow Crash (Neal Stephenson), Ender's Game (Orson Scott Card) and The Hunger Games trilogy (Suzanne Collins). I am currently enjoying World War Z (Max Brooks).  
.  

**CunningB**  
I currently work as a copy writer for an SEO firm and fictional writing is my way of escaping the tripe that i have to force out on a daily basis!


Personal ability wise: I was a pretty poor writer at school but an avid reader, mainly of fantasy works, which eventually inspired me to give writing a go. I've been 'seriously' writing for around 6 months now, and I'm interested in breaking out of my fantasy home to meet some of the neighbors; as i feel working around a cliché would be much easier with a larger tool box.


As for authors i love, Steven Erikson, for his convoluted plots; Elizabeth Moon, for her absorbing female characters; and my latest love affair, Patrick Rothfuss, for his voice.  
.  

**scienceisgayokay**  
I hope to refine my writing and take it to a higher level where writing is more incorporated into my daily life. i've always been somewhat of a writer, though i didn't write much on my own until recently. when i was around thirteen i started writing a short fantasy novel and got to about twenty-five pages of completion before stagnating on it and before it got deleted by an unknowing mother.


i really liked cities of the red night by william s. burroughs, and plan on reading the rest of the trilogy. this is the first book of w.s.b. that i've finished, and i know it won't be the last. his writing is so beautiful and so carnal. it's always pleasantly intoxicating to dive into his stories. i also liked snowcrash by neal stephenson, because he did an excellent job at creating a fun and believable sci-fi story. one thing that i like about it is how under the superficial layers of the story are his ideas on how symbols and language can activate latent parts of the brain.


my inspirations in terms of authors include henry miller, william s. burroughs, chuck palahniuk, and david foster wallace.

Hi.


I've been writing for about 5 years but I've yet to write anything that I feel was really substantial or worth creating. I've never completed a peace of writing that I've felt was as good as it could have been. I don't think I've ever experienced anything worth writing about either, though perhaps I'm wrong about that. I joined this course because I want a reason to write something worth reading. Also, I like Irvine Welsh and at the moment I'm reading his book Filth.

Hello everybody, my name is Jacob. I have no professional writing background, as I'm only still a student in high school. I don't doubt that I'll be the youngest of the 14 of us to actively participate in the class. I sought to join this workshop because I need a metaphorical kick in the ass to my writing. A year ago, I set the goal of finishing the rough draft of my novella I had been working on by the time I graduated. Since that day, absolutely zero progress has been made toward that goal, with me instead just whimsically writing short stories and poems with no real direction or end-goal. I feel that this workshop will help give me the motivation I need, as well as providing honest, objective critiques of my writing.


I am a fan of dystopian novels, such as A Clockwork Orange and Brave New World, as I feel they provide a sobering look at many of the problems in society. I delight in surrealist writing, as well as nonsense poetry, though I don't confine myself to absurdity alone. I also enjoy philosophical writings, ranging form the more modern works of Bertrand Russell to the classic Socratic Dialogues, and cheap paperback novellas of the 1950s, like The Green Odyssey and Strangers in the Universe. I look forward to conferring with you all and growing as a wordsmith!

**in-wonderland**  
Hey everyone! I'm an English major and about to be a senior in college. Some of my favorite authors are Henry James, Oscar Wilde, Poe and George Orwell. Most of my work is critical analysis and comparison of works, but I've always wanted to get a bit more creative. Hopefully this class will give me a chance to share without the fear that comes along from sharing with people you actually know.


I just finished The Puttermesser Papers by Cynthia Ozick and I wholeheartedly recommend you check it out. Puttermesser is an amazing character and the book lends itself to a TON of analysis. If anyone wants to talk about it then let me know!  
.  
**Totally_Straight**  
I have always enjoyed writing but only started 'seriously' writing near the end of my university career. 


After 4 years of my creativity being slowly sapped I decided that a change was needed and I began the whole ""Morning Writing"" thing as suggested in The Artist's Way. This really helped to inspire me and I have been trying to write as much as can since. 


Though i just started writing prose, all throughout University I have written sketch comedy and comics. This has made itself evident in my writing as most of my stories seem to be comedic. My favourite writers are also reflective of this; Douglas Adams, Kurt Vonnegut, Neil Gaiman, basically anyone who can make me laugh well still telling a story.


I just want to create writing that motivates and inspires people.

v0c4k,2,2012-06-13,"Need some general advice / reassurance / opinions regarding my girlfriend and myself going ""on a break.""",supersaying,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v0c4k/need_some_general_advice_reassurance_opinions/,"I just got off of a long video chat with her, so this is all fresh.

Me and my girlfriend (both 20) have been dating for a little bit over 2 years now. We both attend the same university, and have 1 more year to go before graduating. We both had our own rooms, so we were able to spend a lot of time alone together to talk, hang out, nap, have sex, whatever. We were very close, and talked throughout the day on the phone.

Enter summer vacation. I had to stay on campus for an extra month for a work contract, and she went home. She visited me on campus at the end of the month, but she was noticeably different as far as her attitude went - she was quieter, and didn't really connect with me like I thought she would after some time apart.

I'm back home now too. I live out of state, so now we are an hour and a half away from each other. She has started an internship, and I am working from home for my father. 

Last week, we video chatted and everything was great. Ever since that day, she has not been responding to texts or calls, and said a few days ago that ""she needs some time."" She said that she feels overwhelmed with things, that there's too much happening too fast, and that she will ""keep me posted.""

Fast forward to today, and I am sick of being chumped waiting for her to decide on anything. I left her a voicemail saying I have something relatively important to talk about, which led to our video chat that ended 10 minutes ago as of this writing. She and I are now ""on a break.""

I don't know exactly what this means, and neither does she, really. I asked what I'm supposed to tell people when they ask my relationship status, and she said I can say whatever I want to say. She said that she still loves me, and that I'm the only guy that she does love, and I told her I love her back. It honestly comes down to the fact that she really just felt that she needs ""me time"" for herself.

Just as it all ended, she texted me saying that she is changing her Facebook relationship to where only see can see it, so technically it's still there, but nobody will know about it. She said it's because ""we are not completely together or single. I know this sounds silly, but I just don't want to take it off.""

I guess what worries me is what she wants to do. We've been on a break before, last year, where she went on some dates with another guy to figure out if I was what she wanted, which I was. I don't understand why she would want to do that again, but nonetheless, I would still feel cheated on if she were to do it.

Did I do anything wrong with how I handled things? We ended on good terms, and agreed that whenever we want to talk to each other, we should just call and talk like it's no big deal. Also, should I be worried about anything that she might be planning on doing that would further distance us? I really feel that we are good together and would like to do something to not lose her, but I also don't want to overstep.

I might be talking / worried about nothing, but I would really like to hear some kind of feedback about the situation. In the end, I'm a paranoid parrot when it comes to relationships, and want to know more rather than less. I really didn't want to be on a break, but she wanted it, so I felt it was my only choice.

Thanks.

tl;dr: Girlfriend and I just went ""on a break,"" I wanted to stay together. Confused and worried about why she wanted ""time."""

v004r,4,2012-06-13,Step mother issues,asher8,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/v004r/step_mother_issues/,"Here's the backstory:

I'm 20 years old, and 3 years ago my father married a woman who I literally can not stand. She has some severe mental issues, including what may be bi-polar and borderline personality disorders. I could go on and on with what hardships she has caused this family. Because of her instability, she and my fathers relationship has been volatile and almost ended countless times, which started to become a problem even just a few weeks after they started dating 5 years ago.

I dislike everything about her, even when she is acting normal, I can't stand her personality. She analyzes and judges everybody, and sees me as somebody who needs her help and advice every time I open my mouth. I have so many problems with her that I will not go into further detail for the sake of making this easy to read.

So, because of my feelings toward her, I have done the bare minimum to remain civil and somewhat normal with my family. This includes saying things like 'hello' and 'good morning', and answering her when she addresses me, yet I never seek her out, or have friendly discussions with her. Basically, I pretend she is not there unless I am forced to interact. I should make it clear that our relationship has not always been this way, but after years of dealing with her and the problems she has caused, I can't bring myself to feel or act differently. My treatment of her seemed to be going fine, as things were fairly peaceful.

So here's what happened: 

Last night she called a family meeting with me and my dad, for which I had to leave a dinner with friends for. It was not so much a meeting as a full on attack on me, the way I conduct myself, and how I am not pulling my weight in this family by making her feel safe and welcome in our home. I was being treated as though I was openly disrespectful to her, or even violent. My dad told me that I need to stop disrespecting his wife or else I cannot live in this house. They both took turns saying insulting things to me, about how I am ungrateful and need to grow up and account for myself. I don't feel that I have done anything wrong, and I am really insulted by what they had to say. It is hard for me to accept the idea that I am the problem. I don't understand the approach they took with me, and how they could expect to finish the meeting with no hard feelings. I cannot change the way I feel about her, and this meeting has only made me hate her more. My other issue is with if I decided to do what they say and be friends with her, how could it ever be taken seriously, as it would be fake and forced. 

I am incredibly frustrated, and thinking about what my options are. I can either do what they say and treat her like a friend, or move out completely and become independent, which I feel capable of doing. I am renting a room in an off campus house, but I am home for the summer because I have an internship nearby and need access to a car. I think I should be able to become completely independent without too much trouble. So, should I swallow my pride and make peace with two completely delusional people, or should I drop everything and leave? Sorry for the long post, although I could make it ten times as long with details, I hope that I have explained enough."
uzhtd,3,2012-06-13,"After a few seemingly hopeless and daunting set of events in the past few months, I seem to be having the most fortunate month in quite some time.",WhoDoIThinkIAm,happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/uzhtd/after_a_few_seemingly_hopeless_and_daunting_set/,"I approached my last set of finals knowing that regardless of what happened, I had to attend school for one more semester with more than the 18-hour limit of classes than the 4 years I had expected.  That puts a lot of pressure on me to do well on finals.

First, I was offered an internship during my first final.  My entire job in the presentation was to keep my mouth shut and I did so.  During the question and answer session afterwards, though, it seemed as if my ideas really wowed them.  I was pulled aside and discretely told that if I was interested in interning, they'd be happy to have me.  Unfortunately, when I attempted to get in contact with them afterwards, they said their position had been filled, but I was welcome to join during the fall.

The rest of my finals went great with my lowest grade being a C, which was actually much better than I was expecting and my highest being an A+ which I have never received as a final grade.

Next, my first car, a hand-me-down, 11-year-old Lexus, had begun to randomly violently shake, lose traction, and become all-around unsafe for me to be in.  Although the problem was fixed, my parents had realized that this was the straw that broke the camel's back.  They had spent too much money over the years on that car and it was time to trade in.  Although my new car sounds like a step down from a 2001 IS 300, I'm very happy with my new Versa.  The MPG is great and has a ton of features I was missing, not to mention I don't feel as anxious driving it, considering the massive cost difference, but I won't turn this into a Versa commercial, I'm just happy that it worked out.

Shortly after finals ended, my macbook pro of 1 or 2 years stopped taking a charge(the remaining battery cycles had reached 0).  I took it into the genius bar, knowing I was safely inside my warranty timeline.  I gritted through the drive that was about an hour longer each way than it should have been as my local Apple store was closed for renovations.  After waiting for around 45 minutes, I was told that I had liquid damage(it took me a few minutes, but I remembered what caused it-not me, but a klutz from a few months prior) and although the battery was able to be replaced, they could not return my computer with a new battery without charging me for repairs(I had immediately dried my computer, started using what I call a ""keyboard condom"" and kept it safe, and there were never any problems in performance) which would total $1200.  I walked out, thinking I was sans computer, which I saw as needed for someone who wants to get into advertising, not to mention a student.  However, my good friend offered to build me a brand new computer from scratch without limiting me to OSX.  Using $200 less than the cost of the replaced MBP, he built me a mini-super computer(16GB of Ram, TB of memory, and the dual-slot video card which was able to run skyrim and assassin's creed 2 simultaneously with almost no blur).

After a few years of cycling between loneliness and futile attempts to create a romantic relationship, I made friendly conversation with a gorgeous Subway employee who had caught my eye.  She made a damned good sandwich while giving me some sort of feeling that I needed to talk to her again.  I came back a week or so later(trying to seem nonchalant) and she suggests I come back on a weekday morning since she works every weekday and there are fewer customers, which I thought implied she wanted to talk to me personally.  I came back another week or so later as the only customer in the store.  I couldn't see her in the front, so I was wondering to myself if I should ask another employee if she had called in sick or something until she popped her head out of the back and waved.  We shot the shit a little, nothing too personal.  Once I was done eating, I tried to gather my nerves to ask for her number, but couldn't do it(That would have been my first time to ask).  As I got up from my chair, she told me not to go just yet, called me over to the register, and wrote her number on the back of the receipt, swearing she doesn't do this often.

To make a long story a little shorter, that was 2 fridays ago.  I didn't know before our first date that she had a three-year-old son and a few months ago, that might have turned me away, but my willingness to see where things led allowed me to meet this amazing kid that is impossible not to love.  This part might sound dishonest, but I love that I'm proving myself wrong when I say that I portrayed this adventurous personality who loves the outdoors and physical activity when before her, I might have spent half a day online gaming, smoking cigs(a pack a day at the worst), pot(if I could afford it) and drinking alone to excess(not that there's anything wrong with that).  But now that I've met her and given that impression, it's like my life is starting to become what I said it was, which I've found is much better.  I've almost stopped smoking cigs(1 cig every 3 or 4 days at most), pot(For some reason I'm drug tested now that I have an ADHD medication prescription) and drinking(once every week or two, and usually not alone), I've started working out and I'm getting more active to play with Owen(I forgot how much energy a 3 year old could have).

Finally, just this past Monday, we shared our first kiss.  Not 30 minutes later, I walked into my first class for bartending school.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I feel ecstatic to be who I am where I am in life.  If you made it this far, thank you for taking out the time in your day.  

tl;dr: finals looked scary but I did pretty well.  My first car got dangerous, my parents bought a cheaper but better one.  My computer broke, my friend built a better one.

My grandfather died last easter. Both my parents were so busy when I was young I was basically raised by my grandparents (on both sides). I had exams around then and I fucked up. It was my first year at uni and I could retake without too much consequence.

This year things started ok, but went downhill fast. Nothing had gone well for me for a long time now (typical underachiever) and I started not doing work and just being apathetic overall. 

Recently, thanks to my dad, I managed to bag an internship over the summer. This really hit me and I realised how much of my university life I have thrown away. Exams are looming and I get more anxious every day, and more and more disappointed with myself for this year. With the amount of marks I have thrown away by not doing work, I am needing a very high average to merely pass.

During a phone call recently my dad heard the distress in my voice and turned up to chat with me. My whole family have always been so supportive of everything I do, even spending large amounts of money for me to go to a public school for a period of time when we were quite poor. I don't know how I can go about repaying my parents. I have been given every chance and I've failed them every time.

I haven't told anyone about this because I didn't want to be a burden. I wanted to be the guy that was mature and could handle everything, and be successful like so many others. Unfortunately it turns out I have been the most naive person around and I've lost a lot of confidence.

What do I do now?"

Im going to be moving to Vancouver from July - September for a nifty marketing internship. It doesent pay too well so I would probably need to stay with a roommate to be able to afford life in Van.

Wondering if any ents have a room to spare or know of any friends looking for a roommate. 

About me, Im a pretty chill guy. 21, Male, business student (fucking suit eh, I know)  If you want a room mate that will fuck off and just do his own thing, thats cool. If you are looking for someone who would be down to haze a j and play some fuckin games, I could be that guy too. Sports, fuck yeah. Watch some documentaries on quantum physics, OH HELL YEAH. 

Honestly, I'm easy going and could fit with most personality types. Even non-ents that you know of I would be happy to move in with.  

Thanks for reading, I appreciate any help

Anyway, I'll attempt to re-add what I had before:

Hello everybody,

Unfortunately, my second computer that I ever built has recently broken. If this were 2-3 years ago, I would have attempted to fix it and bring it back to life. Unfortunately, as a college student with an internship and a waning interest in computers at the moment (though I am pursuing a similar path in college), I've decided rather than trash it / work on it, I would rather donate some parts to those in need.

Here's a little backstory before I get started; recently, the computer refused to boot up. My mother said (this was used for them), that they came back downstairs and one day it just wouldn't turn on. I replaced the PSU and video cards to no avail, so I narrowed it down to the motherboard as there was no POST error codes or warning beeps. As I took it apart, post throwing away the case and PSU, I decided I could just donate some of the parts as long as people are willing ot pay shipping. I have more computer stuff than just the computer that I will end up getting rid of, so I might update the post or start a new one as soon as things are organized.

For now, I will start with the RAM. It is a pair of OCZ nVidia SLi ready RAM: http://www.ocztechnology.com/ocz-ddr2-pc2-6400-sli-ready-edition-dual-channel-eol.html

They are DDR2-800 and they are 2 x 2 GB for a total of 4 GB. Like I said, they may actually end up being broken, but if you're willing to pay shipping and they work, they're obviously yours.

Next up is the HSF (sans F):

(Updated with pictures) http://imgur.com/a/eSagm

I believe it is a THermalright Ultra 120 Extreme HSF. Unfortunately, I don't have the 120mm fan, so it's just the Heatsink at the moment. It also only has the socket 775 adapter and the mounting screws (no backplate if it came with one). 

Please let me know if you're interested. I'd also love if they went to a place where someone would take care of the parts as they did, and still do, mean a lot to me.

Thanks :)"
uyxsm,5,2012-06-12,GRRRRR...,Recamen,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/uyxsm/grrrrr/,"So uh, lemme start off by saying that... I think people who say that you don't need luck to be successful are full of shit.

Why, you ask? See, a month ago I was getting ready to graduate. I had a full-time job lined up with the company I'd worked with part-time over the past year. The supervisor liked me, my coworkers liked me - hell, one person there, a lead analyst, gave me a recommendation on LinkedIn. I was happy. Everything was alright.

...Then next Tuesday rolls around. ""Sorry, but ah... we had a budget miscommunication. Your position's been cancelled."" I feel like the rug was fucking yanked out from under me. Sure, the other intern who worked in the same group gets a position (albeit elsewhere), but I don't!? Don't give me that ""luck doesn't matter"" bullshit.

Since then, I've been throwing out a grand total of 48 applications over this past month. Of those, you'd think that companies would WANT a guy who worked his ass off through a Master's program in Applied Mathematics WHILE WORKING PART-TIME FOR BOTH YEARS! You'd think that after the first year of being a statistical consultant for a whole bunch of thesis and dissertation students (and even one client from the nearby medical center!) and after the second year of working for said company above, I'd be set! WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Sure, I get callbacks, maybe some even lead to phone screen interviews. Hah! I had three such screens between last Thursday and Monday, and what do I get? ""..."", ""..."", and ""Oh no, because you screwed up on ONE MEASLY PROBLEM you can fuck off.""

I'm just - maybe I'm overreacting. I realize it's only been a month, and there's plenty of time left, but I am beyond frustrated at the moment, and pretty much all on my own, and add it all up, and I'm not quite right in the head. No, I'm not a danger to anyone, but I can't think straight. I just feel like... like it's pointless! I sent out all these online applications, contacted people back if they didn't get back to me, and for what? Nothing! And this lease ends in August, and what then? I wind up living back with my parents? God, that would just crush me! I didn't go through six fucking years of school just to wind up back with my fucking parents and be put through all this bullshit!

And I can't help but feel like someone out there, somewhere, is lifting a giant bird to my face and jacking off to my anger. It-it's just... argh! It all makes me so furious, and I feel like all I'm doing with all these online applications is wasting time. It'd be great if I could do some actual, face-to-face networking, but I don't even know where to start. I'm going into my former university's career center on Thursday, but that involves waiting, and I absolutely despise waiting. And I still feel like even the network I DO have is letting me down. It's just... this wasn't supposed to happen to me. Someone's fucking with me, and I want to find them and punch them in the face."

v21wu,18,2012-06-14,My personal experience on a polycultural farm.,clickapedia,Paleo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/v21wu/my_personal_experience_on_a_polycultural_farm/,"I recently returned from a brief stay and work internship on a polycultural farm and i figured you all would be interested in hearing some stories and analysis of what i observed.  Anyway the farm at which I interned was one that raised 100% grass fed beef, in addition to ""free range"" laying hens and broiler chickens. (preface, this farm was heavily modeled on the familiar salatin method, so comparisons are appropriate)

I'll start with the beef.  The cows were rotationally grazed, and allowed 1-2 days on the pasture before they were moved.  The cows had great health, and great physical stature.  I see grain supplemented cows on pasture near my house and they are lethargic and don't seem to graze as much, as a result of the grain satisfying their caloric desire.(this is a trend i noticed much more prominently with the chickens)  These cows were active and during moves and transfers to new pasture they would run and buck and expend all kinds of energy.  It was really entertaining to watch.  The pastures were allowed to recover fully before the cows returned, some to where the grass was up to shoulder height, of varying density, but always enough to keep the cows satisfied.  If they were reaching outside the fence line consistently, we knew it was time to rotate.  While this keeps them from lingering around their own manure for too long, it didn't entirely keep the cows free from disease.  Cows have a terrible lack of awareness when it comes to their bowel movements and it was not uncommon to see brown streaks down the side of cattle, and very rarely cases of eye infections, which i believe were comparable to pink eye, as a result of fecal matter getting in there.  However in all, the health of the heard was spectacular. It was not uncommon, so they informed me, to go a season with no losses due to health issues, although it had happened.  The cows were also fed a kelp mineral supplement, a salt supplement and another vitamin mixture.  Can't comment too much on the nature of that.

The Chickens and laying hens.  This is where i feel the community may benefit.
The laying hens were brown heritage varieties, and were allowed free range during the day time and penned in a mobile coup at night( yes this is very similar to the salatin method)  The laying hens were given 24/7 access to a grain/soy based feed.  This is what made me stand back and begin to look at things objectively.  At first I imagined foraging birds eating lots of bugs, however the reality of the situation is a bit more variable.  Often the birds spend large portions of the day inside the coup, or underneath seeking shade, forgoing the opportunity to forage.  Not to say some birds aren't very active and foraging, however it is not uniform.  It is safe to say that the persistent presence of supplemental feed diminished the desire of the hens to forage.  In this respect, i had higher expectations.  This was reflected in the overall health of the laying hens.  Deaths and illness were more common than in the cattle, but less so than in the meat birds.  It was expressed to me by the farmers that the feed seems to leave a lot to be desired and could be a cause for illness. What i've learned, and what i was originally suspicious of, is that birds labeled ""free range"" still strongly resemble factory raised eggs and chickens, in that the majority of their diet is grain/soy based and high in PUFA.  While forage may contribute to a more balanced quantity of polyunsaturated fats, i fear it may not be what most of us hope for.  Some would consider this nit-picky, and i myself feel it is as well, however i don't want to shun the opportunity for progress just by being placated by the ""free range"" title.  

The broiler chickens.  These birds were the standard cornish cross, meat specific birds.  They would receive large batches of several hundred chicks, days after birth and raise them in a confined room until they were big enough to pasture.  The broiler room, they called it, was required to be kept at a warm temperature, and the method for doing this, much to my dismay, was with propane burning lamps.  I was slightly concerned about the issue of burning large quantities of propane in a sealed room( about this i would love to hear more discussion, in addition to the possible nutritional shortfalls of a solely grain based diet for birds. ex: do they have the same requirements for SFA as we do?).  I would not have been so concerned, had it not been routine to wake up and find 5 or 10 dead chicks in the morning, out of a batch of several hundred.  I have heard it said that the cornish cross is a breed with which you can expect those kind of losses.  Their feed, from birth was also a standard grain/soy combo, and i feel this may have contributed to the losses.  When they were finally out on pasture in the salatin inspired cages, they were packed about 45 chickens in a square about 12x12 feet.  This was another concern.  At each move, which occurred daily, the chickens would have access to fresh greens and however many bugs can be found on a 12x12 patch of pasture.  However they were also given 24/7 access to the grain supplemental food, which for many of the birds altogether eliminated their inclination to forage.  It's also important to note, that as the chickens matured, and the space grew more limited, so diminished the quantity of forage per bird, and so increased the accumulation of waste.  Often by morning the square was caked thick with waste, in which the birds lingered through the night.  Casualties were not uncommon as a result of general illness.  It should be noted that these birds, upon harvest, carried a sizeable visceral fat deposit, more reminiscent of a factory farmed bird than a wild bird.  

I know this is not news to most people, that farms fall anywhere on a spectrum in terms of their dedication towards profit seeking or market vaibility, versus their desire to create the highest quality product.  I really hope to prompt more discussion of the differences in the market, to make people aware that sometimes the ""free range"" title is not what the label hopes to convey, and to acquire input on what people feel the ideal diet is for poultry, based on the assumption that foraging for bugs and greens can only fulfill a certain percentage of nutritional and caloric requirements for poultry or pork.  Does anyone have any studies in a similar vein to the tokelaun study, where they observe the effect of diet on the end composition of poultry/pork/(even beef, as it would be nice to be able to enjoy a marbly steak without the pufa concern)  I remember reading that their pork was unusually low in PUFA as a result of their feeding tubers as a primary calorie source.  

TLDR open discussion about best livestock rearing practices, staple feed crops and the quality of the final product."

You know the story:  ""I just moved here from a place blah blah blah no real crime blah blah.""  

I live in the Mt. Pleasant area, and the locals here don't seem very intimidating or threatening.  But by locals, I'm guessing mostly Hispanics of different types with a sprinkle of white and black folk.  Though, sometimes there looks like a sketchy type of person.

Unfortunately, due to my work (having a job is fortunate, though!) I always look professional with nice shoes.  It makes me look like I have money, and therefore, I think, a target.  Hopefully I just come off as an unpaid intern, though.  

What I'm doing so far:
1.  Minimize pulling out my smart phone.  It's in an otterbox, so it looks like an older iPhone.  

2.  Keep my eyes to the ground, not making eye contact.

3.  Have an angry-face/""I'm not in the mood for shenanigans"" face.  

4.  Not look like I just moved here/am a tourist.

5.  Not go out at night on rarely traveled streets.  I tend to go only where there's lots of people walking, and I'm not out very late.


I keep reading around on safety, and the general consensus is ""don't be a moron and you'll be okay.""  Well, instructions on not being a moron seem pretty vague to a person who's never really had to worry about being mugged.  

Is there anything I'm missing?  Or is what I have incorrect?"

We started to chat and we hung out in a group of friends twice before she left for holidays/home for about 3 months. In this time we continued to chat on facebook amounting to approximately 2500 messages exchanged between us. 

The highlights of this exchange in chronological order:
* She invites me to come and visit her on holiday, I decline (a) I can't afford it (b) I don't feel comfortable doing that as I don't know her well enough at this point.
*She came back briefly for an interview she had for an internship, and we got to see each other at a friend's party. I was nervous as hell and also intimidated by her. While I was conversing with someone she comes over and asks if you want to come with her to a friend of hers at a slightly different location in the party. She then asks me to hold her drink, which I do, then asks me to hold her phone; I cannot as I am holding her drink and also my own, so she slips her phone in my shirt pocket, links arms with me and begins walking to her friend. On the way I say jokingly ""Did you just make me your bitch?!"". She responds with ""You love it..."". When we walk over to the friend seconds later she says ""So you two just met at that dinner and fell in love?!"", I thought this was very forward but obviously this girl had been talking about me to her friend with romantic intentions. I decided to play along and say ""how can you not"" while gesturing at the girl. Her friend then goes on about her mess of a dating life and how she is taking a break from the scene, to which the girl, who is right next to me says ""Oh I don't want to date anyone for like a year"". I don't say anything. They then immediately decide to go and hang out with some more friends and the girl says for me to come a long. I don't go with them and just socialise with other guests of the party until I have to leave early without saying good by to anyone since my friend got in a fight and we decided it was best to leave. She calls me the next day with the topic of how she didn't get to say goodbye to me, I was upset and I think my tone conveyed that, only pleasantries were exchanged and we hung up.
* She goes back on holidays so that chat continues, about after two weeks after she leaves she asks me to come visit her. I decline (a) I don't know her well enough to burden her with my own entertainment (b) I can't afford it.
*After new years she tells me about how she is feeling down about one of her exes and I console her about it. I feel like at this point I was seen as more of a friend, which is fine, but sudden and thus felt rejected, but clearly this girl had stuff to work through.
*I ask what she is doing, she tells me that she is telling the guy she drunkenly made out with at new years that she only wants to be friends.
*About a few weeks before she comes back she tells me how she doesn't want to date anyone for six months. At this point it is clear that I am only her friend, but it still felt as though the door might be open for me in the future.
*When she comes back she says we should go clubbing, I cannot as I was sick at the time, but also I admittedly had a hard time adjusting my feelings for her.


So before her birthday party, which I was already well aware of and had rsvp'd, she calls and asks if I was coming, perhaps because I hadn't really kept in touch as I was back at uni and also because I was trying to readjust.

When I get to the party she seems slightly nervous around me, and this is a very social girl, so it was unusual for her to be like this. I still don't know what to make of it.

We then chatted on facebook occasionally for a few weeks before we organizes a dinner with a few friends, which did not go well as I didn't speak at all. But she was trying to get me to talk anyway. As we walking back to the station she linked arms with me again, she is generally a touchy person so I didn't think much of it.

Two weeks later I meet her and her friends for some drinks, during which she lets on that she is seeing someone and also implied that she had slept with him(I may be wrong about the last part, not sure). As I am leaving she gives me a tighter hug than normal, which made me think that she must know something about the way I was feeling.

A few days later she impulsively throws a houseparty, I attend, she had invited the person she was seeing but he had plans with his family. I didn't really talk much with her and had generally good time socialising.

Few days later she initiates a chat on Facebook and we discuss the anecdotes of the house party, I tell her I was glad she invited me and that I was glad that it happened. She initiates chats with me approximately once a week for the next three weeks, then suggests a group dinner because she hadn't seen me 'in so long'. On the night I ask if its still on, she says she forgot and thought it was tomorrow, we reorganise for tomorrow but she cannot make it as she lost her bank card. We talk generally for a bit on the night of the dinner.

A few days later I post a picture on facebook of a beverage I made at home, this beverage is also one that the girl claimed to love. She then jokingly posts about how I should of made her one. Then invites me to meet her at a club for some drinks as a few of our friends are going there anyway. When I meet her she says she wants one of those drinks that i posted on my facebook; bewildered, I suggest to her that she make it herself, to which she retorts I want you to make it. The rest of the night she is blatantly flirting with me, I was flattered enormously, but also upset, I felt like a doormat, I don't know whether or not I am justified in feeling this way or not.

What I want to know is this girl flaky? Is she just going to hurt me when she has gotten what she wanted from me? Am I wrong for feeling like a doormat.

TL;DR Has life given me a lemon? If so can I make lemonade with it, that won't leave a sour taste?"
v2sum,5,2012-06-14,Girlfriend told me she doesn't Love me anymore,spaceman86,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/v2sum/girlfriend_told_me_she_doesnt_love_me_anymore/,"**Updated**
I'm a 26/M and she is a 26/F, we started dating last year when she was on exchange from Germany for the year, while she was here I organised an internship for her to come back to Australia in 6 Months time. After I organised that. I got a job 4000km away on a 2 year contract, so even when she get's back I'm still a 4 hour flight away.

Because of this we both said let's just see what happens as having two years with minimal contact is a big ask on any relationship. We've been apart for nearly 6 months now and she gets back to Australia in August.

I 've been waiting for her this whole time and we've stayed in contact through out this period and we were planning when to see each other again ect. I asked her where everything was going as I missed her and didn't understand were I stood with her.

A week later she sent me an email saying that I had hurt her a number of times last year and she doesn't want me to wait for her, when we talked she then said she doesn't love me or see a future with me.

She says this was based on her looking back at our relationship and seeing that what we had wasn't love. We did have a few issues when we were together which I thought we had worked through, she is now saying that is wasn't enough. I don't understand how she can complely change how she feels about me.

I poored my heart out to her in an email and tried to explain the issues she was concerned with from my perspective and what she was thinking wasn't my intentions, I apologised for any pain that I caused her last year even if it wasn't intended. In the end she said all she can offer me is, when she sees me again if she feels something then maybe.

I fell like that's a huge amount of pressure to have on me as I'm only going to be able to see her for max 1 week and it seems as if she has been playing a select few bad things over and over again in her head.

How do I show her the person she loved from the other side of the world? How do I show the issues that she has had in the past with our relationships won't be an issue in the future? Finally How do I show that the person that she currently thinks I am isn't how I was in our relationship or how I will be in the future?


Edit: I'm afraid that I will hold on to this feeling of hope that when we see each other, she'll want to be with me again.  When ever I've had a relationship end. I've never been able to accept that it is over and move on, I've always held on to a hope that I'll find a way to fix the issues? So I guess my question has two parts, how do I save the relationship and if it can't be how do I move on from her how do I not hold on to the hopw that I can save it.
Thanks

Also, please ignore the fact that we're at work. The company is fine with intra-office romances, and we currently work far enough apart that post-relationship ugliness (if it ever got there) would only be a minor inconvenience. My particular role never crosses into her territory. 

1 year ago(ish), while I was an intern, our company (huge company) hired a girl to our department as an intern. I'm in Marketing, she's in Finance. 

Her first day was on the day that the HR dept. had a company cruise on the river. She sat with me and some of the coworkers, but it was mostly her and I that talked. 

Next day all my coworkers mentioned how we had hit it off, and that she was cute (she is). I had avoided relationships for a while and I recently decided that it was time to explore the possibility again (took a hiatus from dating due to shitty relationship).

So I did what you're supposed to do. Stop by her desk and chat her up. Asked her about what she was working on, talked about my stuff...just continued the conversation. 

I did this for a number of days when I realized ""Fuck this, I feel like I'm spinning my wheels, she oughta stop over and talk to me."" She didn't, so I figured that maybe she just wasn't interested. . .

As the months went on, I stopped visiting so frequently. I'd stop by to say hi and shoot the shit maybe once a month whenever I was thinking ""I gotta talk to her."" 

Down the line, they moved my desk 2 down from her, and that was cool. We talked more often about stuff, but this one dude another department chatted her up a lot. 

I Kinda put 2 and 2 together, and realized what was going on. Kept it friendly, but kinda realized that she must've been into uncomplicated men (this dude is . . . super uncomplicated. . . if I have to put it in a PC way). 

By November 2011, I kicked the ""intern"" label, and now I'm a full blown associate. 

By March 2012, I've dated numerous women casually and started getting serious with another - who dumped me. While talking it over with some of the ladies at work, I casually mentioned ""Is finance intern single?""

I learned that not only was she single, but she wasn't seeing the fella from the other department ever. She DID have a boyfriend in the previous months, but she dumped his ass. 

So I resumed my ""crush"" and I had no choice but to not be a fucking idiot here. I started talking her up - daily. Good conversation and all that. Learned she was applying for a job in the department. Nice!

So I cockily told her the news she wanted to hear - ""Everyone loves you, the old VP talked to me and spoke very highly of you (she did), they wouldn't have to train you, you'll get it.""

And so I offered ""You and I will celebrate when you get this job."" As she questioned herself and her confidence waned, I told her ""Don't let me jinx you, we're going to celebrate your first paycheck.""

This is really risky stuff. What if she didn't get the job???

Sure enough, she got the job. 

I didn't see her in the office, so I emailed her ""Congrats blah blah, I told you I was right, I'm always right."" (she knows I'm joking around). 

She replies: ""Thanks, I'm just nervous of all the work I'll have to do. . . we have to go out and celebrate my first paycheck!""

So that brings us to today. . . 3 or 4 paychecks past when we were supposed to go celebrate. I mostly blame logistics - she's been pulling 12 hour days, I've been pulling 10-12 hour days, been busy on fridays. It sucks (I can't even go out with friends or other dates because of this shit - being in a band AND pulling a 50-60 hour work week blows). 

***

You have the story from my perspective, and I am honest about the whole thing. I'm not a looker - 26, a little bit balding, dry skin (dermatits), and overweight, but I've ditched 30 lbs since the beginning of 2012, so I'm really not looking too bad (could always lose more). I'm very charming, smart, funny, and actually great in bed (when every girl you're with gets to see the back of her orbital bone because her eyes roll back that far, you don't need to be told you're good). 

I do have a confidence issue sometimes. I don't trust others when they praise me. I was recently asked by another coworker I'm close with why I wasn't together with this girl already. 

**TL;DR I'm 26, she's 25, Been flirting on/off for a year. Both went from interns to full-associates. I feel like I'm more interested than she is. I also am mostly a prize in terms of brain and personality. Looks need work that I'm providing them as best I can**

1.)Would you say that she's interested in me from this? I only ask because I've offered opportunities here and there to take the lead, and  she's only taken the one ""we gotta celebrate"". My other female friends (not from work) tell me that it will make her day when I ask her this. Are they correct?

2.) Is this the type of thing that I'm better off exploring as friends with no outward romantic intentions and let it get there in time if it's supposed to? (again, ignore the fact that we ""sorta"" work together)

3.) Do I need to just bite the bullet and flat-out ask her to drinks some Friday? She sits in a crowded part of the office, and I just don't want to ask her there because it's not anyone else's business but ours. I'm tempted to shoot her an email, but that's lame. Thoughts?

4.) What other thoughts might you have? 

Thanks!"
v2lv8,1,2012-06-14,Long distance Girlfriend told me she doesn't Love me anymore,spaceman86,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v2lv8/long_distance_girlfriend_told_me_she_doesnt_love/,"I'm a 26/M and she is a 26/F, we started dating last year when she was on exchange from Germany for the yer, while she was here I organised an internship for her to come back to Australia in 6 Months time. After I organised that. I got a job 4000km away on a 2 year contract, so even when she get's back I'm still a 4 hour flight away. 

Because of this we both said let's just see what happens as having two years with minimal contact is a big ask on any relationship. We've been apart for nearly 6 months now and she gets back to Australia in August. 

I 've been waiting for her this whole time and we've stayed in contact through out this period and we were planning when to see each other again ect. I asked her where everything was going as I missed her and didn't understand were I stood with her. 

A week later she sent me an email saying that I had hurt her a  number of times last year and she doesn't want me to wait for her, when we talked she then said she doesn't love me or see a future with me. 

She says this was based on her looking back at our relationship and seeing that what we had wasn't love. We did have a few issues when we were together which I thought we had worked through, but I don't understand how she can complely change how she feels about me. 

I poored my heart out to her and tried to explain the issues she was concerned with from my perspective and what she was thinking wasn't my intentions. In the end she said all she can offer me is to say when she sees me again if she feels something then maybe.

I fell like that's a huge amount of pressure to have on me as I'm only going to be able to see her for max 1 week. How do I show her the person she loves from the other side of the world? How do I show the issues that she has had in the past with our relationships won't be an issue in the future? Finally How do I show that the person that shwe currently thinks I am isn't how I was in our relationship or how I will be in the future?"

v5ksa,0,2012-06-16,"[20/m] Ok internet strangers, I can't get over her [20/f]",soupisgreat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/v5ksa/20m_ok_internet_strangers_i_cant_get_over_her_20f/,"Rewind 2 and a half years to senior year of high school. We dated for about 9 months. Everything was great. When it was time to leave for college I stupidly told her that it probably wasn't a good idea to continue the relationship even though she was all for it. We went to schools that are about 4 hours away from each other and I didn't feel that a long distance relationship would work well. Neither of us had the means or time to get to each others' schools to visit. 

So we broke up. Despite this, we talked/Skyped almost every day that first semester. She even came with her dad to visit me one weekend. During our 5 week winter break through the next summer we hung out and had sex quite often. During these times I asked her repeatedly to date me again. I really loved being with her and I felt that we could work through the distance. She refused. I feel that she was extremely hurt by me breaking it off before that first semester of college. It was not my finest hour. 

When this school year (2011-2012) started, she said that we could be friends because she ""really cared about me"" and ""doesn't want to lose [me]."" So we'd text each other frequently. I started to feel that she was becoming distant but I'd keep texting her. When the last winter break came around I took her to dinner, the movies, and lunch several times. We'd have fun but if I ever tried any time of intimacy, holding hands, hugging, kiss on the forehead, she'd pull away. Again I feel that this is some sort of punishment for breaking up with her a year and a half before. She always was willing to go and she even invited me to do a few things. 

So I once again asked her to date me again. This was towards the end of winter break [Mid-January 2012.] She got upset with me. She kept saying that ""we obviously can't be just friends."" So instead of dating me again she told me that we needed time apart. She said maybe a year or so of no talking. As a way to follow this through she blocked me on Facebook and wouldn't answer my texts. She even said ""Even if we were still dating I probably would have cheated on you."" I was stunned. This wasn't like her at all but she really knows how to hold a grudge. If it had any truth to it I don't know. This really hurt me but I accepted and we didn't talk.

That was 6 months ago. Since then I have only texted her once asking to catch up over lunch right when summer started. (Might not have been my best idea but I couldn't help myself.) Unfortunately she told me that she'd be staying at her school for the summer because of an internship. I wished her luck and we haven't spoken since. 

The problem is that I continue to think about her constantly. I have been with other girls (not dated,) but I still can't get her out of my head. Its been 1 and a half years since we actually dated and about 10 months since we were last intimate. Today I saw a picture of her on a mutual friend's Facebook. She was tagged but I obviously could not go to her profile because she had blocked me. This picture really tore me up because I haven't seen her since January and she was looking as beautiful as ever. I don't know what it is, but I can't get over this girl.

On a side note, she was absolutely amazing in bed. I've been with other girls since her but they don't even compare. This is definitely one reason why I continue to hold on to hope of getting her back but not the only one. 

Also, her mother adored me and still continues to text me once in a while asking me how I am. She obviously wants us back together but whenever she (her mom) brings it up to her she gets upset.

I now have a car at my school and I'd love to try and make it work but I don't know how to get to talking to her again. Should I even try?

**TL;DR** I have been on and off with my high school girlfriend. Mostly off now a days but I cant get her out of my head. Should I even try to rekindle that fire?"

v4txm,12,2012-06-16,I'm single again after a 5 year relationship. I need some help.,breakUpHasShockedMe,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/v4txm/im_single_again_after_a_5_year_relationship_i/,"My now ex girlfriend(21f) and myself(20m) have just broken up. We had been dating since we were 15. She knows my Reddit account and I don't want her to kick me anymore while i'm down. I need to vent, I have no one to turn to. If you don't want to read the story I understand but there are questions at the bottom I would really appreciate answers to! Here is the story:


It started in 7th grade(about 13 years old) when I met her. I was an extremely overweight kid. No girl had ever given me a chance to really talk to them at this point in my life, no girl would even look at me. She did. She gave me a chance, she rolled the dice and I still don't know why. From that day on I wanted to make sure she was happy. I had a crush from the first day I met her, but this girl was completely out of my league. We quickly became best friends from then on and I would give her advice on everything she struggled with, which was mostly guy problems. I was essentially friend zoning myself and I didn't even realize it because I was only in 7th grade. But I continued to be there for her through anything. This continued for about 2 years.


We get to high school and it's a new and exciting time. I have lost around 70 pounds from training to play football at this point. Our friendship is as strong as ever. Within the first month of high school she has her group of friends tell me that she likes me. I didn't believe it for a solid month, she had never given me signs of that. I thought this was a cruel joke that her friends were playing on me. I was thinking they just wanted me to ask her out so I would be embarrassed in front of everyone in the school. I mean... A GIRL wanted me? A GIRL had feelings for me? THE GIRL had feelings for me? Well after that month I grew a pair and asked her.


She said yes to my complete surprise. People thought it was a joke that she was dating me. From then on I made sure she was the happiest girl in the world. We would get made fun of everyday because of how attached we were. We would literally be holding hands the entire time we were together. She became my first kiss about 3 months into dating. I was too nervous to make the first move so she did. I had never been happier after that though.


Well after about a year she ""cheats"" on me. She kisses an ex boyfriend who I had given her advice on. It crushes me but we remained friends. I couldn't live without her. Me dating her made other girls curious about me. I had more girls texting me and calling me than I could believe after we broke up. I ""hook up"" with a few (if you can even call making out hooking up). About 5 months pass since we broke up. She apologizes in tears for everything.


We start dating again. We lose our virginity to each other during this time. But sadly the relationship only lasts for 3 months. A 21 year old who helped out the teacher in one of her classes started chasing after her. She apparently tells him everything and he convinced her that I was only dating her to get into her pants. He told her she was going to get hurt dating me. So she breaks up with me again.... And of course starts dating him.


Well we stop talking after that and she dates him for about a year. I still love her after all this time, I'm envious of what this other guy has that I don't. She comes crying back to me again after he breaks her heart. We get to know each other again. And me being the sucker I am took her back again.


This is when the real relationship begins. We were starting our 3rd year(junior year) in high school. We were both determined to make this work. About 10 months of us dating pass and something we were never ready for came up. She had gotten pregnant. We made the toughest decision in our lives to abort the baby. We both decided we couldn't provide the life a baby deserves. It cuts me deep but I have to stay strong for her. I still to this day carry around the ultrasound of the kid everywhere I go. It has been my inspiration to become a better person. No one besides us to this day knows about the abortion. After the abortion our relationship grows so much closer.


We continue to be the happiest couple throughout high school. We communicate, we laugh, we go on dates, I would get excited to see her texts and calls come in. High school finally ends and I get a summer internship offer at Google and 3 universities offering a full ride scholarship. The closest being a school about 2 hours away. She didn't perform too well in school so she decided to stick with community college in the town we had lived in. At this point we decide we were going to stay together throughout college. Because of this I decide to stay as close as possible. I go to the college that is 2 hours away.


This is where our relationship starts to strain. I move out for the first time with roommates I don't know. My original roommate was supposed to be a 27 year old bank teller. But he didn't really live well with others so I end up with the only other apartment they have open at the time. This apartment was co-ed. I was going to be living with 2 girls for my freshman year. Imagine my girlfriend's excitement when she heard this. I can tell she's hurting at this point. She wants to move in so bad with me but I didn't want to put her in a bad financial situation. I told her it wasn't worth the debt to get the same community college education 2 hours down the road. (I understand how dumb that sounds now but if we were truly staying together long term I wanted to keep us in good financial standing. I regret that decision still to this day.) I drive up each and every single weekend during the school year to see her. I wanted her to know I love her and cared about her. I still surprise her with dates and flowers. Over the summer I would stay at my parent's house and bring her lunch at work everyday.


We go another year of doing the same thing except I live alone this time. This next year we had planned to move in together. I still drive up every weekend in order to see her. And In order to show her I love her. Well because of this and because I have to keep a high GPA for my scholarship I don't and still don't have a social life in college. I work hard all week so that I don't have any homework left over for the weekend. Our relationship is still strong this entire school year.


This last month when summer started has been where it got bumpy. She starts to tell me she doesn't want to go to my school anymore. She wants to follow her dreams and go into fashion merchandising... This kind of saddens me but I tell her to go for it. Shoot for the stars. The problem is that the fashion school she wants to go to is 8 hours from my school. We definitely would have to have a long distance relationship at that point. No more seeing each other every weekend. This puts strain back on our relationship. I tell her I still completely support her with whatever she wants to do though. We have been dating continuously for one month short of 4 years now.


Well then comes the past few weeks. She starts to ignore my calls and texts. She bails on dates I had planned for her. I learn from a mutual friend that she has been hanging out with other guys in our group when she would tell me that she's sick and can't go out. This makes me saddened inside but I didn't know how to confront her about it. She becomes moody with me all the time. She doesn't know that I know what she has been up to.


Then this week comes. The week that has crushed me completely as a person. She tells me that she has fallen out of love with me. She doesn't get happy when she sees me anymore. She gets annoyed when she sees my face. She hates how I love to spend time with my family and that I am a mommy's boy. She tells me that she hates that I give my dog so much attention. She hates what I wear. She tells me she wants to see other people. She says that she has been in relationships all of her life and she doesn't even know who she is. She doesn't know if I'm the best she wants to see if there are better guys out there. She wants to make stupid decisions and live with them. She wants to hook up with a random guy and regret it. She wants to ""find herself"". And after that she ""finds herself"" we should get back together and get married. I told her things don't work that way. I'm not going to sit here and wait while she hooks up with a bunch of guys and then just take her back. You can't have your cake and eat it too.


Mind you this all came within a couple of days. She built all of this up and just exploded these past few days. I told her she needs to tell me these things and not let them build up like this. I can try to fix things but I can't fix everything at once. I've always been fine with her talking to other guys and making new friends. I never breached her privacy in any way. I trusted her. I loved her. I tried to continue to surprise her as much as possible. I took her out on fun dates. I loved to make her happy that was all I ever wanted since I met her. I had tried my hardest at that point to be the best boyfriend I could be.


For the last few days she tried to end everything over text. She didn't even try to do that with our shorter relationships. But I told her our friendship is worth more than that and she knows that. I couldn't just let an 8 year friendship end over a text.


Well tonight ended our relationship, but more importantly it ended our friendship.


We met up at the park where we first started hanging out 8 years ago. I hadn't seen her since a week ago. This part may sound weird but I had decided I wanted to end our relationship on a happy note not a sad one. I knew she was done with me it was inevitable at this point but I wanted her to look back and constantly wonder why our relationship and friendship ended. We went and got milkshakes and went ice skating like we were just on another date. It was a great time until it came time to say goodbye. I broke down. We hugged for a hour straight. We cried in each other's shoulders for a hour straight. We didn't say a word for that hour. After that hour of breaking down I gave her a piece of me, a piece of us, to keep. I gave her my inspiration to become a better person. I gave her the ultrasound of the baby we were supposed to have from almost 3 and a half years ago. She had no clue I had been carrying that around with me this entire time. I told her the story behind it. I told her how deeply cut I was by the abortion. I told her why I carry it around. I told her everything. I thanked her for being the girl that gave me a chance 8 years ago. We continued to cry for another hour in each other's arms. She told she had to go after those 2 hours. Before she left I told her to remember the ultrasound whenever she feels down. Whenever someone breaks her heart. Whenever she fails a test. Whenever she needs it. I told her to take care of it wherever she goes. We unexpectedly kiss and she heads home. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes before I could I even move. It's insane how something that has lasted so long can end so quick. I've sat here for a hour and a half typing this. Everything is so hazy right now. I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss our relationship. But most of all I'm going to miss our friendship. I just want her to be happy again.


**My questions are:**



* I've realized I don't even know how to make new friends anymore. I don't want to stay in the same mutual group of friends as her. I know it will only hurt me and I'll never get over her that way... What do i do over the summer to make new friends? How do you even approach people without being creepy? I have a connection to get hundreds of baseball tickets to all the our local MLB team's games, would that be a good place to invite new people to try to make them become a friend of mine?


* Are there steps I should be taking right now to help this process?




* She has hurt me pretty bad this time. Should I be just completely ignoring her calls and texts?


* I need a new hobby to keep my mind off things. I'm open to any suggestions! Please let me know what you do in your free time and why you love it."
v4m8r,2,2012-06-16,I don't even know where to start.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/v4m8r/i_dont_even_know_where_to_start/,"I feel like I've lost my best friend. We were so close for so long and anything sexual us was just a bonus, and now I feel like he only talks to me in a sexual way, and couldn't give a fuck if I'm upset, like I am now. He told me he would text me early in the day so we had a chance to talk, and he didn't. When I texted him, he barely got out a reply and hasn't even responded since. Fuck that. I'm sorry you only have time for me when you're horny now. I love you, but I'm sick of having to defend you only to be treated like shit. What ever happened to you doing anything not to make me feel like a sex object? Guess words really are meaningless.

I love my mom but she just doesn't get it. She can't even say the word ""anxiety"". I'm sorry mom but I have an anxiety disorder. I get panic attacks. I have crying spells. Don't tell me that ""my down is someone else's up"" when I was told that I needed weekly therapy and to be put on medicine and you told me you didn't want that for me. I told you I didn't want to disappoint you, but at the same time I feel like you're not helping me, or letting me get the help I need. Which is hard to say because you're a great mom and you do so much but this is something you just refuse to accept, and I already felt like shit about it, and when you make it seem like less of a big deal than it is to me, I just feel worse.

I'm sick of not having a friend in the world to talk to about this. I'm sick of feeling like I burden everyone. I'm sick of feeling like nobody actually cares.

I hate that when I was a virgin, I was called prude and bullied. I hate that now that I'm not, the people who know give me judgmental looks and make me feel like a slut.

I hate that I graduated high school with over a 4.3 GPA, over 10 extra curricular activities and about 100 community service hours, a pretty decent SAT score, and great recommendations from my teachers. I'm rewarded with no merit scholarships, no scholarships at all actually, and started school in a year where there was no honors programs. Now that there are I feel like I got screwed out of it. I'm always one step away and then get screwed over. There were things I wanted to do in high school (TA, starting clubs, etc) that I couldn't do because my counselor either didn't know about them or didn't give me the right information. Now I'm getting screwed in college for not having prior experience, and living far away from anywhere that I wouldn't be able to intern anywhere or anything.

I'm just angry that I keep trying and seem to get nowhere. I feel betrayed by my family, friends, and school. I know that the answer is ""you have to start nowhere to get somewhere"", and I try and put on a happy face, but I feel like I've been doing it for years and it's gotten me nowhere. 

I'm sick of trying and just being one step too short. I'm always everyone's second. Never anyone's first. Second choice for a girlfriend, second choice for a best friend, second choice for opportunities, etc. Hell, my dad even had surgery and I heard him say to my mom that he was counting on my sister to help because he didn't think I would, even though I had already been helping him and have been helping him with stuff for over a month now.

Life is just way too frustrating.

tl;dr - Life screws you over and you have to just deal with it, I guess."

like the title says, i didn't actually get with anyone but i still had a great night. i'm kind of coming to terms with the fact that getting with girls shouldn't make-or-break my night, and if i had a good night regardless then it's still a good night. anyway, on with the FR

note: i wasn't peacocking til a bit later, so don't expect it from the start :P


* left student accomodation around 10pm, with about 20 other friends. met around 10 more on the way
* was an ""end of exam party"" at a club that we had prebooked tickets for, ~400 people from my university were going to be there (i haven't actually started my exams yet though, haha. start next week)
* got to the club around 10.30
* opened up a few sets outside, using some opinion openers
* some girls replied ""is that your pick up line?"" i wasn't sure how to reply but i just blurted out ""yeah, you're kind of getting of script, so can we get back to the question?"" 
* they weren't really responding that well, so i decided to leave them (is this the right thing to do? how else could i have approached this?
* went inside, pee'd, went outside for a smoke
* opened up a 2-set with my buddy, HB7 and HB9. both french, HB9 didn't speak much English. she was over for a few days visiting HB7 while HB7 was here doing an internship (i wasn't really too sure how to include this into the conversation. any hindsight ideas?)
* spoke to them for a bit, teased them about how little English they spoke. HB7 responded well, HB9 just occasionally laughed at stuff we said but didn't really contribute. her body language was pretty defensive (arms folded, kind of looking away)
* ended up speaking to them about the french football league and the french team in the Euro 2012. one of their friends came over, spoke to them in french. i got the feeling she was trying to get them to come back inside, but they responded in french and stayed out with us.
* my buddy was pretty drunk by this point and was saying some hilarious stuff, but i kind of got the idea that it wasn't really going to work out for us with them
* i decided to eject (""my legs are begging me to dance, try and have a nice night without me!"")
* left them, went inside
* met up with some other friends from my university, met a girl they were with a few of my friends (HB6)
* spoke to her, turns out she went to a school near the one that i used to go
* didn't stay too long with her as i kind of got the impression she was with this guy that was nearby
* left her, walked around the club. getting my dance on, was bumping into people i knew every 10 seconds. was great for my esteem, not going to lie. everyone was pretty happy to see me (""hey, how'd your exams go!?"" ""haven't even started yet, mate!"" they'd always laugh at this, haha""
* opened up random dancing sets, ""can you hold something for me?"", i'd offer them my hand and then twirl them around
* some girls seem pretty offended, others seemed to dig it. funny though, the ones that digged it were the ones that already had boyfriends who would always try and push me away instantly. shame, really.
* went with a friend to this part of the club which had this chemistry themed bar, got a pair of lab-goggles from the table. put them on
* went back, found the HB6 who i used to go school near. she was wearing this black top-hat that had glitter on it. asked her for it, she gave it
* started rocking the hat as well as the goggles
* was getting looks from everyone, i was loving it
* went back to dance floor
* walked past a 2-set. 2 x HB8
* smiled at them, they smiled back
* walked past them, one of them poked me so i turned around, ""hey, i'm telling my lawyer about that.""
* she laughed, wanted to get a photo of me and her from her friend. we did
* gave her my hand and the twirl. pulled her away to dance, she tried to pull her friend to come with but her friend left her with me
* we danced for a bit, she tried taking my hat. i tried to go for a kiss after a few seconds.
* she kept turning it down, my friends smacked my ass as they went past and i burst into laughter.
* she kind of left me after this, decided to leave the dance-floor with my friends
* went around the club, lots of high-fives from random people and people laughing at/with me at my ridiculous look
* i genuinely had no idea what to do with the attention
* lots of people re-greeting me after they had seen me before
* spent a solid 45 minutes in the queue buying a drink
* went back upstairs to one of the dancefloors
* HB8 that i danced with pokes me as i walk past
* ""you lot haven't been kicked out yet?"" she didn't really hear what i said
* ""let's go dance"" she still didn't hear what i said
* ""i'm going outside, it's too hot in here"" i think she said, so i replied ""yeah i know i'm hot but wait til you get to know me"", she still didn't hear what i said as she was turning to leave
* i grabbed her as she was leaving and said ""let's go dance"", ""maybe later"" she replied
* ""i probably won't be here when you get back"" i replied, she shrugged and walked off with her friend
* fuck it, i thought. time to dance
* spent a solid 30 minutes dancing, tried to make myself the centre of attention by jumping into the middle of the circles that the groups were making. lots of laughs.
* was playfully headbutting anyone else wearing the goggles or the hats. 
* at this point, it was ~2.30AM and despite the place still being packed, 80% of the girls were already taken and the other 20% didn't really seem to be ""on it""
* decided to leave on the high of the social proof
* got bus back to dorms
* put some chicken in the oven
* wrote this FR, haha.


so yeah, all in all i'd say i had a great night. i'm not sure what to do while peacocking. i've still got the hat and the goggles so i might wear the hat out on a different night out. but a lot of people tried to take it from me (""hey, hands off the merchandise""). like i said, i didn't get with anyone or anything but i had a great night just dancing with friends and just getting up to stupid shit. i pretty much missed out half the stuff in this FR of just the banter and stuff we got up to as i just kept it to the girls related stuff.


i appreciate all the comments/criticism/advice :)

thanks for reading! :)"

I've always had an easier time being friends with girls than guys, and there aren't too many girls at my workplace I see myself being close friends with.  I enjoy going out to find new food, but also enjoy a casual day laying in the sun by the pool at my apartment.

While I'm not actively looking for a relationship or summer fling, I'm definitely not opposed to considering  it if things really seem to click.

A bit about myself, I'm a little under 6'1"", white, have been going to the gym regularly for the last few months, not to lose weight, but to gain some muscle, and I think it's going pretty well, but that's for others to decide :P

If you want to hang out, find some good local food, or just lay by the pool with me let me know :)"

v63qt,1,2012-06-17,My life is fucking miserable and I don't know what to do about it.,Metro53,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/v63qt/my_life_is_fucking_miserable_and_i_dont_know_what/,"I don't even know where to start. I don't know why I'm writing this or what I think I'm going to accomplish doing so but since it's the most active thing I've done since finding out that I've been dismissed from college I guess I might as well go through with it.

My life, quite simply, is a train wreck. Yes, there are starving kids in Sri Lanka much worse off than I am. So i'm not so confused or dramatic as to think I'm the unluckiest or most unfortunate person in the history of the world. But still, my life has reached the point where I see nothing redeeming about it.

Throughout school I've always been one of the smartest kids but also one of the laziest, I guess you could say. For whatever reason I've always felt some sort of force field between me and work. I would never hand in homework assignments. I would half-ass studying for tests or not study at all. But when it came down to things like final exams, I would always do well. I got high scores on AP exams without even studying. I got a 1990 on the SAT's with minimal effort. My grades in middle school and high school were decent enough but could have been significantly higher if I just got my work done. Intelligence alone plus the sympathy of teachers who understand that I was a good kid with some sort of mental block helped me get through high school. And I eventually went to a very reputable college on a partial scholarship.

College was a different story. I failed two of my five classes my first semester and stopped going to class altogether my second semester. I  ended up withdrawing from those classes and taking the semester off. Scholarship revoked. At home, I did absolutely nothing aside from visit a psychologist. I at in bed all day with minimal social interaction and ate a lot of food, to the point I gained a decent amount of weight. The plan was for me to visit with this psychologist, get my head on straight, and go back to school ready to work. The psychologist, while understanding completely what my issues were on a level that most people have been unable to get, was unable to figure out the root of my issues or how to fix it. Over the summer I lost all the weight and got into the best shape of my life, and for the first time in months I was genuinely excited about going to school. Immediately upon arriving at school again, though, something felt off, and indeed it was. The people who were once my friends now barely hung out or taked to me, many walking past me as if we had never met before. This piled onto the already significant dilemma of me being unable to get work done. I withdrew from two classes and still failed my other two since I stopped going to class and didn't hand anything in from that point. The next semester, I met with a psychiatrist who insisted that there was no doubt in his mind I had ADD and that this was the root of my problem. He gave me medication.... which did nothing. I actually had a decent start to the semester but eventually stopped handing things in again. More failed classes, and now I'm kicked out of university. 

I have no clear path towards any sort of career right now. I'm not in school obviously. I have absolutely no idea what I'm going to do this upcoming year. I've had absolutely no success with girls; I've never had a girlfriend and I'm known in my circle of friends for having the worst luck, with girls treating me like shit or blowing me off one way or another. All of my friends live relatively far away from me and are doing well at school, studying abroad, getting all sorts of amazing internships, and as a result I feel completely worthless. I see absolutely nothing about my life that gives me any sort of hope for the future. I have absolutely no consolation to cling onto as some form of happiness. 

Just to provide a list of people I had at one point or another worked with to try to fix this issue:

-My parents
-My close friends
-My teachers/professors
-The Dean of Students
-My academic advisor
-The counseling center of my university
-Two psychologists
-Two neuropsychologists
-One psychiatrist
-Three different kinds of medication


And I've found no answers and have just continued to spiral downwards into the shithole situation that I am now entrenched in. No matter how many different people I meet with or how many different things I try nobody seems to have an answer for how to solve this. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to explain to anyone how this happened to me. I desperately need something that gives me hope but right now I have absolutely nothing to cling to for that. That's something even my most optimistic friends have conceded to me. I highly doubt anyone is going to read all of this but I guess it's nice enough to just write this all down and get it off my chest. And in a depressing irony it would be fitting for nobody to read this. Or give me any advice. Since that's more or less been how life has treated me the last few years. "
v62up,1,2012-06-17,"Women have never liked me before, now that they do it makes me angry and I don't know why.",[deleted],AskWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/v62up/women_have_never_liked_me_before_now_that_they_do/,"I must warn you, this post is long. Throwaway account because I am ashamed to admit this. I should start off by saying that I'm a college student who is on his way to graduate next year with pretty much a guaranteed job in my field. Before this however, I wasn't much of anything. I had interesting hobbies, nice looks, had a decent part time job and dressed well. However, that did not make me seem like a viable person to date. Also, I lived with my parents, so one could say that that was a deal breaker too. It didn't help that my sister seemed to resent me living with the family and didn't miss a chance to insult me because I was a ""deadbeat."" I felt like a burden to just about everyone around me. I felt weak and I hated it. However, that's only part of the story. There are also three other women involved in this as well. All of them I have known over a three to five year period. These weren't the only women that I pursued, but they are women that I liked a lot and tried to develop something romantic with each of them. I failed on all counts. I was massively disappointed and depressed over the outcomes, but I managed to get over it, we became good friends instead, they integrated into my social circles and vice-versa and they went off and dated other guys. This has been more or less the pattern for other attempts at a relationship with other women. I soon learned to get used to it and just stopped expecting anything to come out of any advances I made, until I eventually just stopped trying. I got much more involved with my school work, started working out more and just trying to find other social avenues that I could pursue that didn't cause me to stop and think that I was possibly never going know what it's like to have a girlfriend in college. So, fast forward to three months ago. I get news that I'm getting into my internship, at a place where I'm likely to get the job there or someplace else if I do well. I've also saved up enough money to afford a one year lease on a flat close by and I'm also on my way to graduate and get my undergraduate degree. I'm feeling pretty good about myself and my situation. I told my male friends about it, guys who've been friends with me for years, and who encouraged me to keep going when things got bad for me, and are very proud of me. However, somebody must of said something, or something else must have happened because now, I seem to be attracting women. Not just acquaintances, but women just seem to act so much more nicer to me now and want to hang out with me. Even two of three women who rejected me before (one is married now) have gotten in contact with me and are wanting to get together with me, under no prompting or pursuing on my part. For the first time I'm starting to get dates and numbers and while looking at my life now things seem like they are going great, they're not. I'm now more depressed than ever and it has become exhausting keeping a smile and a chipper attitude in public when I'm out at school and doing my job. I see all these women who now like me and I hate them. I hate all of them. It's illogical and childish and yet it has become this beast that cannot be fed and it's growing. I talk to these women and I want to like them, but I can't, I just resent them. There's a voice in my head always screaming ""Oh, so now you like me, you whore?"" it won't shut up. I'm afraid, I think I'm going to lose my mind if this continues, I've contemplated seeing a psychologist. It's like I finally get a toy for Christmas that I've been asking for for years and the first thing I want to do is take it out of the box and break it. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is the right place to post this, but I don't care anymore. I have to write this, just to get it off my chest and maybe that's enough. I'm going to bed now."

So apparently I've been completely obvious to the fact that I'm supposed to state romantic interest extremely early on according to this [thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/v5ldc/ladies_i_am_often_only_ever_interested_in_dating/). I usually try to be friends first to see if I'm interested in her personality. I've always been a SAP, and I've been trying to break out of that be trying to be as social as possible lately.

**TL;DR: Hung out with a girl (22) I was interested in this past weekend, things stall, meet her awesome friend (21) who lives in my town. Awesome friend is now single and it's obvious my traditional method of approaching a relationship doesn't have a very high success rate. I'm throwing a party next week that the new girl is coming to.** 

**Full story:** I've know this girl (I'll call her A) for a few years now, we were never really more than just acquaintances as we bother were in relationships when we went to college together. We're both recently single, and ended up talking a little bit after she found out I moved to a city a little closer to her. 

I drove to her town about an hour away three weeks ago hung out all night but I didn't make any moves as she had mentioned to me she was tired of every guy she's know in the past four years coming out of the woodwork trying to make it with her. She didn't want a relationship or a FWB situation. She gave no signs she was really interested in me.

A invited me out to an anime convention where I came to find out that I'm just not really interested in her in anything more than being friends (She doesn't seemed interested in me either as she was constantly texting a guy all night, who I later came to find out she went on a beach trip with and was sleeping with him.) Whatever, I still had a good time at the convention, I met some of A's friends who were pretty cool. All of whom made it a point to say how much of a good friend/awesome guy I am. 

**Enter girl B.** B met A last year at the same convention and became friends. I don't know too much about girl B other than she had a boyfriend who was being a dick lately. I don't know how long they've been dating. He got an internship in a different state some undisclosed amount of time and recently said, ""There is nothing here for me in (my and Girl B's city)."" 

I was friendly with girl B, she thought I was funny, and told me, ""I bet you get this all the time, but you're fucking awesome."" We got to know each other a little bit, had fun as a group and I ended up crashing in the bed with both girl A and B. Girl A was not happy with me or something as she didn't want to be next to me. Girl B however had no issue with being against me (no cuddling or anything, she had a BF and I'm not going to pull anything with another guy's girl) 

I got home from work this morning (I am temporarily working 6:30PM to 6:30AM ) to find out that girl B is now single on FB. I'm throwing a party next week to celebrate moving out of my parents house and the end of my crazy work schedule. B RSVPed to my party before her and her BF broke up.

**As for some of my questions:**

* Should I try to hang out with girl B before my party or should I just wait until my party?
* I don't have her number (I seriously squandered on that one as I got everyone else's number except hers) should I just ask her for it via FB or see if she'll text me first by posting my number on my facebook event? 
* How do I approach stating interest in dating with a girl who's fresh out of a relationship? Should this happen before the party or during?"

v8euj,0,2012-06-18,How to Troll a Fitness Nerd: JCD Edition,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/v8euj/how_to_troll_a_fitness_nerd_jcd_edition/,"**This was written for a select group of people on Facebook, it was simply uploaded via Reddit. If you clicked on this through Reddit, you will probably have no idea as to what's going on so pls**

Looking back on things, it’s hard to believe that it wasn’t even a year ago to the day that the foundation of my very internet being was shattered and remolded into the person I am today. What began as a routine venture of scouting out babes at my pool’s apartment complex and having them mire my manly complex turned into sitting under the shaded area of our pool patio talking to some short-ass Israeli kid with a Westside Barbell cutoff on – he stood out from the rest of the inebriated residents like a sore thumb. While the typical pool-goer was chugging Natty Light by the case and screaming abhorrently at the intoxicated person a mere foot or two away, he was fixated on a book regarding human anatomy, completely ignorant of the collegiate chaos that surrounded him. Slightly intrigued, I sat down next to him and ignited a conversation with quite possibly one of the most interesting people to traverse this planet: Jordan Syatt.

As many of you know, Jordan was completing an internship at Westside Barbell located in Columbus, Ohio – because of this, his time here was [unfortunately] limited. During his brief few months of a stay in town, though, he and I became good buddies as he introduced me to a whole new side of fitness; not just fitness in itself, but the revolutionary people who make fitness what it is today: “big names” like Bret Contreras and Eric Cressey were tossed around, as were the relative new-comers who are making names for themselves and who will, in time, surely make their way to the top: Nick Horton, Rog Law, and JC Deen to name a few.

Ah yes, JC Deen. His name: it’s quite pungent. It’s a *formidable* scent; it stings the nostrils in a good way.

If you don’t live under an internet rock, you knew it was only a matter of seconds before his name came to light – you could practically *smell* it.

Perhaps the greatest feat to emerge from my friendship with Jordan was meeting Mr. JC Deen – residing a short fifteen minutes from where I grew up in Tennessee, JC is a fitness enthusiast who began his own business of helping and inspiring his clientele to reach their full potential through controlled and no-BS diet and exercise. I won’t go into details because, well, if you’re reading this, guess what? You already know him. Dipshit.

I’ve made it my life’s ambition to make JC have as many notifications as humanly possible upon opening Facebook. This is done in a variety of ways: pictures, articles, messages, wall posts, “liking” comments – you name it. One thing every notification has in common, though, lies in the actuality that it’s trolling him. Even if it’s not trolling, it’s trolling.

http://i.imgur.com/GwFIL.png

What exactly is a troll, you ask? According to Wikipedia, a troll is *someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum, chat room, or blog, with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response*.

For you older, non internet-savvy folk, the above definition is a very baseline definition of trolling – trolling, much like any other social activity, has the capability to evolve as its user sees fit. Take, for instance, this perfectly-executed trolling by Jahed Momand several weeks ago, in which he posted an *inflammatory comment* which *provoked JC into an emotional response*; Jahed’s comment, however, was deleted a short moment later. The result? Well, just look at this unprovoked outlash by JC:

http://i.imgur.com/bhyjb.png

Jesus, JC. Quit acting like you have turrets. Calm the fuck down.

So, trolling is not just posting things or saying rude shit, it’s also manipulating and twisting others words and actions around to piss them off. That’s the end game of serious trolling: when it’s all said and done, the target victim needs to have so much adrenaline coursing through their veins that they could smash their monitor in without thinking twice.

What makes a good troll, though? How exactly do you troll? What’s the point of it all? And why is JC the only one being trolled?

These are all good questions. Let’s begin with some of the characteristics that define a successful troll: cunning, smugness, and wit. You read that right – trolls are, generally speaking, *extremely intelligent* creatures. They know how peoples’ minds work, how to manipulate them, and how to *piss people off.* It’s a survival tactic. Revert back to the definition. If you’re “trolling” and not making anyone upset or angry, guess what? You ain’t trollin’. Still not convinced? Let’s look at JC’s three primary trolls:

http://i.imgur.com/3VzlP.png

All of us, despite what internets may believe true, happen to be fairly educated and established individuals – not to sound conceited, but we sure ain’t flippin’ burgers at McDonalds. 

I cannot speak for the other two, but I was raised in the South, went to college up North, and met a whole bunch of people of different race, religion, sexual orientation, political beliefs, and personalities in between. I was raised in a family where two languages were spoken. I’ve travelled to foreign countries, continental and overseas. While I sure as hell don’t know everything about how people operate, I sure know a lot more than your average Joe. “People experience” is a powerful tool to have in your trolling arsenal. That said, we can define trolling as not necessarily being a learned tactic (in the sense that someone could *teach* you how to troll), but one that is intrinsically acquired through years and years of real world interaction and experience.

By this point you might be thinking, “OGM DAT’S ME LOL!” and guess what, asshole? You could be absolutely right! Without you even knowing it, that inner troll has probably been trying to gnaw and bite his way out of your cerebral cortex for *years* now, only to be suppressed by societal norms. The nerve of modern-day society – oy vey.

Trolling is an art. To break it to you plain and simple, there isn’t any definite way of showing someone how to troll; much like dieting or weightlifting, what works for you may not work for the next person. Everyone gets to be their own special snowflake and, over time, develops their own method that complements their personality best.

http://i.imgur.com/m0yS0.png

Let’s observe matberry’s method of trolling. 

Having a PhD in philosophy, he refines peoples’ thought processes (or whatever it is they do), with a heavy focus on the area of exercise psychology. Probably whips up a damn good Pumpkin Spice Crème Frappuccino at Starbucks too. You can check out some of his work at your local coffee shop or on www.myosynthesis.com – there’s good shit there.

If you’ve played on the internet at all in the past year, you may have come across some of his work. You’ve indisputably come across some of his trolling.

If you’ve seen his trolling, then, you know he’s nothing shy of an expert. But what is it that makes him so *damn* good at trolling? Aside from the fact that his profile picture has been trollface.jpg for millennia, matberry *knows his audience* and that, my friends, is his means to success. 

Much of his trolling dabbles in the area of “bro-science,” which we’ve all bore witness to with a simple Google search to bodybuilding.com – if you’re discussing optimal carbohydrate timing after your fourth meal of the day but before your eighth on a controlled bulk, rest assured that matberry will swoop in like fucking Batman with relevant yet irrelevant PubMed articles that not only use your own arguments against you, but also make you look like a complete and total douchebag moron, further humiliating you in front of your peers, xXcurlzbroXx, FKBTCHSGTMONY, and DickTalens. When you finally come to grips with what just happened within your infinitesimal brain, you’ll see matberry is nowhere to be found. Like Batman, damnit. Like Batman.

I honestly don’t give him enough credit. He’s been my inspiration since day one.

http://i.imgur.com/PDADO.png

Don’t get caught up in the specifics of his methods. Remember, *everyone is different.* With practice, you too can become a trolling superstar. Like me.

Some of you reading this may be shaking your heads thinking, “Why the fuck do you even bother? Go outside you fkn fag,” to which I say “u mad?” Think for a moment – if you’re getting upset while reading this, *by definition* I’m trolling you. But the real reason that I, along with many others, troll and will continue to troll is because it’s fucking *fun.*

Recall a couple of weeks ago. D-Day. The storming of JCD Beach. Operation Trollverlord. *His birthday.* Many of you, up till now, failed to realize that May 30th was not JC’s birthday but actually an elaborate scheme developed by yours truly, and executed by the three musketeers – me, Jihad bin Laden, and matberry.

**The birth of an empirical idea:**
http://i.imgur.com/A5dSd.png

Note the date in the photo. In the course of two days (thanks matberry for being on New Zealand time and fucking everything up), JC Deen’s wall was transformed into a birthday apocalypse:

http://i.imgur.com/jCJbd.png

Millions of Facebook users from around the globe flocked to his wall and for nearly 36 hours straight, a birthday bonanza unfolded as the “t” and “y” keys on JC’s keyboard slowly dwindled into nothingness. The battle was won. The war was over. There was nothing left of JC Deen’s Facebook page except for melted ice cream and leftover cake frosting which some fat bitch probably ate for breakfast the next day. Overall, it was a tremendous victory for the trio – needless to say, champagne bottles were uncorked and emptied out that night.

I recall a moment some time back where Rog Law referred to me as being a “monogamous troll,” in that only one person is victimized and suffers from my rampant trolling: Mr. Deen himself. To be quite frank, I had no retort. Why is it that I honed in on JC and JC only? Why don’t I spice things up and troll Bret? Or Eric? Why don’t I troll this chick:

http://i.imgur.com/TS9Xj.png

who believes (or believed) dietary fat to be filled with carbohydrates that will cause her to gain weight? Read what she said. Now do it again. Holy shit, it’s like macronutrient inception: dietary fat inside a carbohydrate inside a fat reservoir. **DA FUQ BRO**

Point is, I don’t really know why I only troll JC. I do know he’s fun to troll and I mean, he’s kinda cute. In a gay way. I’d hit it.

I hope this internets pamphlet helped some of you who may be confused about trolling and why the denizens of the internets continue to troll. Hopefully I inspired you to start your own trolling career. To that I say: Go forth. Become great."

So my girlfriend and I have been hooking up for about a year and a half and dating for the better part of a year.  We have yet to have any major arguments and things are going really great!  We share most of the same opinions and outlooks and I think I'm starting to love her.

The problem:  I'm extremely driven (professionally and academically) and she's...well, not.  I always pictured my future partner being as motivated to succeed as I am.  The last thing I really want is to be the head of a single-income household.  I'm on track for a very successful engineering career (well paying internships with prestigious companies and I was flown out to Stanford to perform research with a lab for a semester).  On the other hand, she failed out of sociology freshman year and is very uncertain of what she wants to do with her life.  Whatever it is, she will likely depend on her future husband to provide for the family (though money does NOT matter to her.  I'm confident she'd be content with a combined income of 50k/yr).

Similarly, I'm very curious and get by pretending to be intelligent while friends ask me how I can be so patient with her (stereotypical blonde).  I come from a rather poor family while she comes from a decently wealthy one.  I've supported myself since I was 16 while she has never had a job and I honestly can't picture her in a professional setting.

Ultimately, I'm not sure what to do about the future.  I always pictured being with someone as driven as myself and she's quite the opposite.  On the other hand, I really love spending time with her and for the time being, we have a great relationship.  Any advice?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I'd love to hear your opinions!


tl;dr- Our relationship is going great.  However, her lack of drive concerns me about her future.  I'm scared of having a ""trophy"" wife.  Advice?

Edit- If the community needs any more information, I'd be happy to provide it."

v7zrr,5,2012-06-18,Have you ever sabotaged your own path to success after getting yourself so close to your dreams? I'm getting there.,icedmatcha,selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/v7zrr/have_you_ever_sabotaged_your_own_path_to_success/,"When I was 18 I was shunned by my group of friends after confronting my then 'good friend' of the fact that her uncle raped me. She quickly twisted my cry for help into something far less sympathetic, and as a result I became alienated. My first real relationship fell apart a few months earlier, home was anything but peaceful and I spiralled into depression. 

I turned my basement into a bedroom and proceeded to spend almost two years hidden in that room. On several occasions I would find myself trembling in tears during the dead of night, because I felt alone, and I knew that as a result of my alienation, nobody would have noticed my absence. I had no friends, a terrible relationship with my family, poor health and no motivation. 

Finally after an aborted suicide attempt (my older sister walked in on me when I was in the process of hanging myself), I realized that I was punishing myself for people's misdoing. I mustered up all the dignity I had left - along with a small fortune, got myself in shape, purchased a new wardrobe and at 20 applied for another program that would lead me to the dream job I held on to before and during my breakdown.

I landed myself multiple jobs and internships to prepare myself for my new career, and accumulate an impressive resume. This September I will be entering an amazing PR Program and finding myself several steps closer to my dream. I am living with my soulmate, have a ridiculously wonderful relationship with my family, and plenty of friends. But as the reality of my improvement in life and happiness kicked in, I am not finding myself unconsciously creating problems. Recently I've been ignoring my friends, slacking off at work, picking fights with my S/O and hesitating to go back to school. It finally hit me that I am going to be some average asian nerd, trying to excel in a program (literally) filled with good looking/hot blondes. Now, I find myself wanting to quit.  I can't bring myself to network anymore. I try to convince myself that my intelligence and experience would be my advantage; however sitting in a room full of beautiful people who probably possess the same skills and intelligence as myself is intimidating, and almost unbearable. I am by no means pretty, nor do I have as many twitter followers, or social media contacts as them. I find myself falling further and further behind. At times I feel as if the coordinator accepted me into the program as a cruel joke, or worse: the token ethnic. "
v7xje,8,2012-06-18,[For Hire] Psychology Graduate looking for any kind of work. ,Drazirahc,london_forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/london_forhire/comments/v7xje/for_hire_psychology_graduate_looking_for_any_kind/,"*Hello there!*
I am a recent BSC Psychology (Hons) Graduate (as of two weeks ago) looking for any kind of work. Even unpaid internships will be a great way for me to develop my skills and work experience. 
I am fresh off the graduate boat so don't have much experience to speak of, but I thought this would be a great way to get some. I am interested in Psychology, Counselling, Photography and am teaching myself to code (Gone through HTML and CSS at Codecademy.com, moving on to Javascript and then hopefully Ruby).

I am a 21 year old female and I am very eager to learn any tricks of the trade, I want to get as much experience as possible before hopefully going into more specific psychology fields like a Masters in Clinical/Forensic Psychology unless I fall in love with something else. You can contact me via PM or leave your email in the comments and I will get back to you instantly.

Thanks for taking the time to read this.

v7ntp,1,2012-06-18,[Request] In the process of cutting nicotine from my life! In need of a little help (nothing huge).,[deleted],randomactsofkindness,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/v7ntp/request_in_the_process_of_cutting_nicotine_from/,"***Background:*** 

I started using tobacco when I was 15. I'm now almost 19 and have decided I've had enough with this substance controlling my life! I was a 2 pack a day smoker or a can a day chewer, ew. I've been using an e-cigarette to slowly ween myself off of the nicotine for about 4 months since I can't afford the patch or the gum and have no insurance to cover it. I've made it down to 1.2% nicotine by volume which is fairly low. 

***What I'm asking for and why:*** 

I'm hoping someone can help me out with getting a 3 pack of the 0.6% nic. by volume cartridges and a 3 pack of the 0% nic. cartridges. I've come to Reddit as a last resort. As of right now I'm at an unpaid internship which will turn into a pretty nice job in a few months, but I am ready to quit now. 

If you are willing to help you may PM me and I will give you details to the cartridges which are $10 a 3 pack. I would be very grateful.

vajy8,3,2012-06-19,Should I just enjoy the moment or try and turn this into something?,twistoffate,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/vajy8/should_i_just_enjoy_the_moment_or_try_and_turn/,"Okay so I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I'm not sure if r/relationships would quite get it. Sorry if this gets long, I must've re-written it like a thousand times before I finally posted. 

So I met this guy from my hometown on vacation last month, and I think the attraction was pretty instant. Unfortunately it was near the end of my trip so I'm only basing this off only a few days of knowing each other. The tension was practically tangible, but, we were constantly ""chaperoned"" more or less by his coworkers (I already knew them, that's how we got to talking, they introduced him to me as the ""new guy"") so he had to stay professional. Maybe part of it was that it felt so forbidden, but we managed to steal a kiss the night before I left and I can't stop thinking about it :) And we've kept in contact ever since, flirty texts and stuff. 

So, he's planning on visiting me next month so of course I'm really excited about that, but we live so far away from each other ($500 plane ride). So unless one of us were planning on moving soon there isn't much to go on... Well actually, I *am* moving- but for 6 months halfway across the world for an internship in the fall.  Definitely complicates things, but because of that I might move home for one full month in the spring (saves on rent, Ill probably be broke after my trip!), so we will only be a few minutes' drive away then. 

But basically, is this doomed from the start? Even if he wants to visit me in Europe, that brings us to a grand total of having ""met"" 4 times in a whole year, with a giant question mark of anything after that, if it even goes that far... 

I also acknowledge that I don't know him very well, and I'm wary of letting things get too heated while he's staying with me next month, I don't want him to think I'm just some international booty :|. But obviously, I really want to and don't want him to lose interest either. I think best case scenario would be like a When Harry Met Sally/Serendipity (don't judge!) sort of thing, where the timing keeps being off until finally it's right? Is that worth hoping for? Or should I just enjoy my renewed sense of having a real crush again, make him sleep on the couch and leave him (and me) wanting more?

Some background on me, I've been single for about a year after a string of long-term relationships, took the time to enjoy being single and have been dating really superficially for a while. He is the first person to come along that I really am excited about, getting butterflies when I think about him and shit like that :] I haven't felt this way since I met my last ex 3 years ago... I don't think I can just give up on it so easily :(. Also, just for info, he's 26 working in a real office and I'm 22 still a boring student with part time jobs. As for him, he does seem like a really nice guy, really funny, and although it's a secret from his work, I know they'd warn me if they saw us becoming friends and thought anything of it. All the stories I've heard about him from them before always just reinforce the fact that he's a good guy.

TL;DR: met a great guy from my hometown, trying to decide if I should vest myself into it (specifically when he visits me!) if I don't know what'll happen once he leaves. 

Pleease help, just typing this I can tell it's not the greatest idea, but I see so much potential and I haven't felt like this (so intense so soon!) in years! 

Also: I know a lot of you would kill to be able to see an SO that often, sorry in advance if I come off whiny. Its just all new and confusing so I want to hear from people who've been in this kind of situation before instead of asking people who'll invariably tell me I'm young/long distance never works/ I should forget about it.

I knew before I even graduated high school that I would have to transfer, so I went to that one college that accepted me (piece of shit, low retention rate, degree mill school) and left for a better school that was unfortunately much, much more expensive. Why was it so expensive? Because I was a transfer. Because I joined in as a sophomore, I was so graciously given the scraps of the scraps of financial aid. Now I will be in over $130,000 in student loans by the time I graduate. 

What did Dr. Asshole do?

* i went to a private school so they made us buy our textbooks. Dr. asshole assigned us *the wrong textbook* at the beginning of the school year but didn't tell us until the end. meanwhile, we're being tested by material and questions from HIS textbook while we're studying ours. COMPLETELY USELESS INFORMATION. And he had the nerve to tell us, ""I never told you to buy that textbook."" FUCK YOU, IT CLEARLY STATED SO ON THE SCHOOL WEBSITE. 

* CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY CONSTANTLY blab about his time in the military instead of relevant shit for the class. FUCK YOU. 

* assigned useless homework assignments that had no FUCKING relevance to the chapters/lessons

* created the curriculum as we ""went along"". mind you this is an AP class that was highly notorious for failing to provide their students with the necessary tools for success on the exam in the past, so he never had any real references to work from since every teacher in the past was some SHIT

* speaking of shitty teachers, Dr. Asshole teamed up with Ms. Idiot to teach the class together. Ms. Idiot was the teacher who taught this AP class last year (with little success I might add). Yes, even two teachers couldn't help our doomed souls. Oh and by the way, Dr. Asshole has a PhD in the same field as our AP class and Ms. Idiot has a law degree from an Ivy League. 



thanks to this horrible class, i've had to go to months therapy on multiple occasions. it was painful seeing my peers go on and enjoy their first and second choice schools while i had to suffered through mine at Remedial University. Now I'm in student debt from new school, ALL WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF DR. ASSHOLE KNEW HOW TO TEACH. By the way, let's not forget that this AP class was the EXACT field I wanted to go into when I applied for colleges. How do you think colleges feel when their applicant is FAILING a class that he wants to major in?

BTW: My high school was, like I mentioned, a private school. We paid for our textbooks and had a strict nun that prohibited dropping courses. Otherwise I would have PEACED THE FUCK OUT OF AP MISERY. Worst part? Dr. Asshole is our principal, and all of my peers (including our valedictorian and salutatorian) were FATASS PANSIES who refused to stick it to the man. This was his time teaching first high school.

And don't get me wrong; I did EVERYTHING in my power from asking for extra help, attending tutoring, getting help from other students, etc. to survive. Dr. Asshole was just TO FUCKING BLIND and had TOO BIG OF AN EGO to realize that he is just not as smart as he thinks. 


Pouring salt into my wounds: I want to go to graduate school in the very same field. I'm making outstanding grades, have a glowing résumé filled with lots of prestigious internships, and excelling in my undergraduate research. I want to join the Peace Corps too because my studies directly correlate with the ideals and mission of the PC. Problem is I have student debt from hell, which, again, COULD HAVE ALL BEEN AVOIDED IF HE FUCKING KNEW HOW TO TEACH. ONE FUCKING CLASS RUINED MY LIFE. The graduate school I'm looking at unfortunately requests high school transcripts. Guess who got boned in the ass when he found that out?


Why pick such an expensive school to transfer to? Hell if I know. Because I was transferring after one year of college, my high school transcript is still heavily weighted. Surprise surprise, I was rejected again from more schools but I had to get out of my first school. My school now was actually my top choice because it was famous for my program but at the price it's at, i find it harder and harder to realize what is it that I fell in love with at the first place. 

**tl;dr failed a class related to my would-be major during my senior year of high school because it was taught by an incompetent and egotistical monkey who taught hs for the first time. now i'm in student debt from hell because colleges don't like transfer students.** should have went to a community college.

vbddi,12,2012-06-20,So I've been slowly developing this ability within myself..,paddywhack,intj,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/vbddi/so_ive_been_slowly_developing_this_ability_within/,"...and to explain it I guess I'll have to share a bit about who I *was* and where I've come from **and** how the events of the last 22 months or so have profoundly impacted my life.
 
I used to be a pretty average guy all things considered. I went to a university, got a degree in software architecture and design. I've always considered myself clever I suppose, always trying de-construct whatever it is im faced with, working mentally from the big picture to finer and finer granularity. 

I was quite fortunate back in 3rd year university and made the choice to go out and get an internship for 18 months with a great company. After returning to school for a final year and graduating in May 2008 (just before the financial chaos on wall-street) it was shitty pickings for new careers.  Great IT company from internship wasn't hiring, tightened up budgets and yada yada, whatever. Ended up taking a consultant type gig in a different city, re-located myself and set up life. Within first 2 months of new career had a relationship dissolve that stung really deeply. Re-bounded within the first few months with another girl and had a tumultuous 6 months with her, great sex but complete breakdown of communication and having a common ground.  
End that relationship poorly. Begin solid stretch of forever alone from April 2009 'til my subconscious clawed at my being and I got up and took 6 weeks off work and did the whole south-east Asia thing.

Came back to a depressing cubicle, and a depressed me. ""What the fuck am I doing in life."" Never ever been one to transcribe my thoughts, emotions down on any sort of medium before.. I picked up a piece of paper one day and wrote an honest self-assessment, I didn't just think about it, I wrote it down in August 2010. I cried alone in the dark over it. I knew I had to make a change, to feel fulfilled, to dream again.
Newton's third law plays into effect here, objects in motion tend to stay in motion so my shitty slide continued until about twelve months ago. 

I got involved in a business opportunity. 

This lead me on a path of personal development that I sought out. I've always felt, as an INTJ that I can process enormous quantities of datum and time-sinks like Reddit are fuel for that internal capacity.
So instead of putting my time towards what I always did, I **chose** to spend time consuming materials that enhanced my life, adding value in trying to achieve my goals that I wrote down in my honest self-assessment of myself back in August 2010. 

It was slow at first, building new habits takes time. Read a bit here and there, was recommended new books. I enjoy reading, but often fall prey to starting and not finishing what I start. I really caught on to success audio from a monthly magazine subscription I bought. I never read the magazine, just fell in love with the monthly audio. It all compounded from there, I'm listening to atleast 3 hours a day of personal development audio. You would be surprised where you can find the time to squeeze it in.

Ni is the greatest gift we have.

Anyway's I kept at it, even when things got tough, always bringing myself back to my ""why"" ... that vision of my future self that I had a burning desire to fulfil. I must change.

Bringing this all back to the point of this whole posting in the first place, the **TL;DR**.  Tonight I was around a group of friends, and some new person was introduced to me, now this person was outgoing but I could feel the tension under her skin. Everyone was sharing insights into what motivates them and this girl couldn't even look people in the eyes. Her self-confidence was low.  Truthfully, how many of you would feel comfortable sharing feelings to complete strangers.  I honed in on this, and leveraged a skill-set I have been consciously trying to build within myself. I was able, through conversation applying tonal patterns and empathising, to elicit a powerful emotional response in this woman, this complete stranger. I brought her to tears and made her come to realize for herself her deepest fear in life is not living up her mothers exceptions of her and living in her older sisters shadow. 

The wildest and most unexpected aspect of this action tonight for me was that I was holding back the tears myself, I knew I was consciously driving this conversation to get a desired effect in this woman. And I knew that if I didn't slow it down I wouldn't of been able to hold it back I would have broken down because I realized that I was passing on the same opportunity to change her life circumstances that I had made myself.  I made her promise me right there that whenever life got hard, and when she might choose to give up on her decisions to better her life that she come back to this moment and know why she made the choice to improve her life. 

I am only consciously competent in this skillset I've been learning, my goal is to get to an un-consciously competent level .. sorta like knowing how to drive a manual transmission in a car after doing it for so long.

I am proud of myself.  I first had to share this with my girlfriend, and now I'm sharing it with you INTJ'ers because I know this will plant seeds in a few of you.

(Warning; LONG)",gagagirl,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/vb4rk/i_need_to_vent_advice_welcome_share_similar/,"This has everything to do with my SO, and I'm stressing really badly about it.

SO and I went to the same school and got the same certification as Dental Assistants. He finished his hours for internship and peaced the eff out of the field all-together. Now, he lives off tips working as a bartender at a hookah lounge and as a server at the same restaurant I work at. He lost his SUV when I was 10 weeks pregnant, and used the refunded down payment on a 2000 Yamaha R1. He crashed that when he was involved in a hit and run a few months back and couldn't do anything about it due to the fact that he did not have it insured, so it sat broken in his apartment parking lot for months while he tried to ""save money"" to purchase new plastics and new parts for it (he only got a new oil can, and spent most of the rest of his money on rent, cigarettes and beer). He missed two payments (one of which I helped him with, he still owes me $180 or so) and called me at 3:30AM to tell me it got repossessed, this happened sometime last week. He needed to pay close to two grand in fee's as well as a pay-off and only has a few more days to come up with the money or else he looses it for good.

So what's his solution? Save up and buy ANOTHER bike outright, because he cant come up with the money in time. I asked him today why he thought that was a good idea, and what would he plan on doing if he wanted to take Camilla somewhere? He assured me he'd have a way of getting her around safely, his mom's van being his first option. This saddens me and frustrates the hell out of me. He's 27-friggin-years old.

Bumpers, I love him. I really do. He knows it and loves me just the same. We're not together at the moment, but he realized just a few weeks ago that I have been one of the only people who has been stable in his life and willing to help him no matter what. I cant even count the times I've woken up early in the morning and driven across town to be with him after he had a nightmare (PTSD from the Army) and to just be there with him when he's lonely, and I dont keep track either only because I dont believe in doing so. He's rarely lifted that kind of finger for me, but I've stuck by him even when he was screwing around with our co workers. I've had to sift through countless rumors that flew around our social circle throughout this entire pregnancy and it's enough to drive someone absolutely insane. I've never once given him shit for his poor decisions because he gets enough of it from others, his mom included. I work two jobs, both on my feet. One in a dental office (and I dont get paid yet) and the other with him where I am a hostess and he is a server. I've given him rides when he needed it to and from work, as well as leaving my house to go across town (again, like a 30 minute drive) just to drive him home when his friends were too drunk to take him anywhere. All the while, he was struggling with a past relationship that he still had feelings for, ontop of a supposed ""girlfriend"" he made at our workplace among a plethora of other family problems. I stuck it out, because I knew I was better than all of them. I'm not the crazy ex who places myself in his life solely because of this baby, I stayed away unless I was called upon and even then, I picked and chose if I wanted to bail him out of whatever life threw at him. It got so bad, even his mom told me to stop coming around; not because she doesnt like me, but because she knew everything I was doing for him, he FAR from deserved. That's sad. I really want to put him in my position just for a day to know how I was truly hurt by all of this.

He told me he wants to make it work, but I'm so numb to his empty promises now. He's come to me twice in this entire pregnancy and said the same thing. First time was when I found out. He was piss drunk while I was working ( we were still together at the time) and he told me ""I love you and we will make this work"". He said it again when I was about 20 weeks post break up, said he wanted to be in her life, but wanted to be in my life later on down the road. I was fine with this. He tapers off again, only to come back a month ago and tell me ""I want to be with you and the baby. I love you, because you loved me enough to stick around when I needed you the most. I'm blessed to have you..etc etc"" and again, he's beginning to taper off. He's doing a lot better this time around, but he's keeping me on a long leash and its frustrating as hell. I told him he keeps going from one extreme to the other, and needs to knock it off because it hurts the crap out of me. He told me he wants to take it slow and get back to getting to know one another. We began dating for about a month before I found out, and he felt it was rushed (well, no shit!) but now would like to take me on dates after the baby to redeem what we lost. I am all for it, I just wish he wouldn't be so stand-off-ish in the meantime! 

Oh, and to top it off, he denied the baby up until the last phone call I spoke of earlier. He claimed the dates never matched up, until I told him there was a WIDE two week window in every pregnancy, and that two week window falls perfectly in the realm of the ""first time"" for the both of us .... the very drunk, unprotected, and stupid ""first time"". Now, he claims her and even gets mad at me if I call her ""my daughter"" and not ""our daughter""... oi vey. It got so bad, that... well let me tell that small story...

I met with him and a few friends who were all pretty wicked drunk one weekend at a hotel for a party. I sat around most of the night and smiled, giggling at the drunk people around me and mainly stayed quiet (which is not normally me, I'm just highly uncomfortable at this point because he is leaving every so often to go flirt with a few Puerto Rican girls he found, and I'm the only one not drinking or in a bikini looking cute like everyone else). I get up to go to the bathroom and his friend walks in with another friend who dont know I'm in the bathroom of the hotel room. One of them says ""Yeah, lets bring the pregnant girlfriend to the party... not my idea!!!! "" and leaves. I fight tears as I flush and waddle out, beginning to feel awful for even coming out at all, to which my SO comes up to me asking if I'm okay. I tell him what happened but asked him not to make a deal of it. Well, drunk him decides to pull aside his friend and berate him incredibly for what he said, telling him ""dont ever talk that way about the mother of my child. You're lucky I dont punch you in the face....blahblah man things"". His friend later came to me, sat next to me, apologized drunkenly a few times, and all was well after that. But moral of the story is, he's becoming more and more protective of me and the baby and I dont know how to take it. 


**SO, MY QUESTIONS ARE.**

1. How do I deal with him being so irresponsible? He's literally done NOTHING financially for this baby although he claims that he's planning on buying the $500 crib I want, also paying for my bills while I'm not working postpartum. My mom is angry at him for this, my dad is annoyed but has faith that he will pull his head out of his ass eventually...

2. How should I deal with him being so emotionally unstable about our relationship, and the relationship he is forcing on the baby? He went from denying her and me, to being incredibly protective of us. I dont know how to handle it; should I be happy? Should I be careful?


I will gladly clarify anything if need be. I wrote this scatter-brained so I dont know if I made a terribly-good amount of sense. 

Added note; I'm too scared to voice my fear in the second question to him, because he is the type to take what I say to an extreme. I'm afraid that if I do tell him, that he will pull off completely and I'll ultimately be left with nothing. Oh, the joy of pregnancy hormones."

I have no college under my belt but over 10k hours of experience in pretty much every aspect of the company. I have countless hours in practice of business proposals, presentations, renderings, T-24, code research, design, full structural document preparation, engineering markups, coordination with City/County officials &amp; meetings, DRC/ Planning Commission, structural inspections, and even some basic engineering (hardware, footings, beams, lateral analysis, etc).

I am a translator for a deaf architect and have literally been in the middle of hundreds of projects, mostly residential but plenty of commercial too. I've recently become eligible for the ARE and would like to start planning for the future. 

In addition to my experience, and soon-to-be licence (in CA), what other kind of skills should I know that would be most beneficial to the typical architect firm, preferably one focused in commercial design. 

I know the ins and outs of Revit and I am picking up Autocad and Sketchup quickly as computer programs generally come easy to me. My communication and people skills have also been improved dramatically over the last 4 years with help from personal hobbies. Aside from this what other programs, skills, etc should I invest my spare time into? Anything that will really put myself ahead of the competition would be most helpful.

I'm incredibly well disciplined and with available resources I don't see anything holding me back. Hopefully some business owners out there may have some good advice?

Thanks to all of you with experience in the field. Your guidance may just have profound effects on my future. 


Some areas I've thought about investing into but unsure of usefulness:

- capabilities of full structural analysis (at least for wood frame structures)
- photoshop / illustrator
- landscape architecture
- a second language- spanish, chinese?
- internet marketing"

Hello,

I would like to share my weird story with all of you. First, I must clarify that I'm a French guy and that I'm currently going through my nineteenth year. My english is not that perfect, but you should be able to understand without puking!

It all started when I was twelve. I moved and had to attend a new school. Couldn't make myself to have friends and most of the time I used to be really alone. Somehow didn't give a fuck about this, as I was the kind of guy who likes to be alone.

After discovering world of warcraft, I had difficulties to continue going to school, as what I where doing in this game was more interesting that the stuff at school... I eventually totally dropped school, little by little. Over years, I've repeated 4 times because I did not attend school at all.
This is where justice came and said to my parents I HAD to attend school, or else I'll have some big trouble with them. An educator came in the story (and eventually lied ; he said that I've been beating my mom...), then I decided to attend home course.

Unsatisfied with that choice, the judge thought that the best for me was to maintain the procedure. I've been followed by a new educator, after the last one made his report.

Here in France, you cannot leave school until you're sixteen. I was sixteen, but somehow, using the fact that I've been in ""danger"", the procedure kept going. On september 2010, after having proved really good grades with home schooling, they decided that they'll intern me in a psychiatric hospital, in ""observation"" and for an undetermined time. I could not escape this one, and making appeal would not have work before the internment statement. Me, my parents, and my two lawyers kept thinking this was all so wrong, but we could not find the ""justice"".

I did not known this fact until last week-end, but the judge tried to intimidate my father because we got lawyers, arguing that my father was trying to publicly discredit him... This has not succeeded, as my father was aware of how futile was this vast mascarade.

I did end up for a month in a public psychiatric unit for adolescents. At my arrival, I was ""held"" in a chamber were I could not take a shit with the bare minimum of intimacy, and with nothing to hurt myself : bed was fixed on the floor, and radiators were included inside the walls... Hopefully, I stayed in this room for 5 minutes, before they came and told me ""Sorry, that was a mistake, you should not be here""... I got pissed of and argued with the director of the ""service"", telling her that I'll take her in court and all this kind of shit... Of course, I didn't...

I was then transferred to the adolescent unit and stood there for a month before being able to being again transferred to a soften unit, which I'll detail below. I was held with other ""patient"" who where under strong medication and hopefully, I was the only one who wasn't and never were. This month was really, really hard, as I could not go home on week-ends and barely had visits, but it was not the worst!

After some tight negotiations I was able to be transferred to a less medicalized unit, which was literally inside a forest... The only ""rule"" was that I had to keep getting ""home"" schooled, and that the first month I could not establish contact with the outside world at all (a rule i've broken by using my ipod touch and ""hacking"" their wifi network, modifying my mac address with one allowed, sending emails to my father and bests friends)... This was a fucking long month, and I did not see the civilization at all except when I escaped once for an hour or two, arguing that I wanted to walk in the forest, alone.

After a month, and so much discussion with the head doctor, she said to me that she did not understand what I've been doing there... I convinced her to let me go home, and back me in front of the judge, saying I had to go home, or eventually it will become worse and I'll really start to develop some trouble. This was decided in two hours. I packaged my stuff and left the same evening, all in a hurry. I was then seventeen. I had my birthday in this center, without being able to contact the outside world, and no-one told me ""happy birthday"" except the other patient. They even made me a chocolate cake. Problem is that chocolate is one of the only things that I don't enjoy...

Judge eventually tried to get me back into court, but I did not attend any meet up and turned eighteen. During that time I started programming everyday, all day long.

Started working as freelance. Was not satisfied, decided to move Paris with only little money for a month. Living for a month at an irc mate place. During this time I found a job and got hired.
I then had to move on to one of my two best friend house, which is by more than ten years my senior. I was happy since living with someone I deeply respect, and was working hard. I was hired as an engineer.

After six months, and as I was finding myself unsatisfied to develop for externals clients, I started looking for a work that involved some research and ended up in a start-up as the referring programmer and r&amp;d developer. It's been six months then, and I moved in my own basement.


Sometimes, I just want to call all the people who was involved in keeping me inside psychiatric units and did not trust that I could work, or have an adequate adult social life, sending them my pay slip to prove them.

Ask me any details about this, I'll try to help. If anyone ever get stuck in an awkward situation like this, just keep going and does not let them take over you!!

Well, ask me anything

----------
Special thanks to the friends who rooted for me, and a deep and very special thank to my friend who kept me at his home for a year, and his daughter whose good mood and innocence made me more optimistic towards life!"

veokd,4,2012-06-21,[20m] How early is too early to get engaged to or live with my GF? [20f],throwawy112233443,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/veokd/20m_how_early_is_too_early_to_get_engaged_to_or/,"My GF and I have been dating since Sep 2010. We are now both going to be juniors in college this coming school year. Both of us have been very happy with our relationship and I would say we have both considered it to be a ""serious"" relationship since pretty early on. This past school year, she has stayed at my place 3 nights a week minimum. Sometimes is feels like we practically live together. We already have our living arrangements set up for this coming school year living separately. However, I brought up the idea of living together during the next school year. We both agreed that we would really enjoy living together, but she said that she believes that we should be at least engaged before living together. While I don't share this belief, I find it to be entirely reasonable. My problem is that I will be leaving for an internship for 6 months in January. By the time I get back, I will have to have already made living arrangements for the next school year. That means if I were going to propose it would have to be by December, which is sooner than I would like. I don't have any money for a ring (although I know for a fact she would be fine with even the least expensive ring I could find). And even if I do decide to propose some time soon-ish, myself and my parents don't really have much money to spare for a wedding at the moment. 

Again, we are very much in love and have a very strong relationship, and I can't think of any reason why I wouldn't want to marry her, but I realize that my perspective isn't as valid as it could be based on the fact that I am young, we've only been going out for 2 years, and she is my first serious girlfriend. (Is that last one a big deal, do you think?)

So, here are my main questions:

* Is it too soon to propose? How can I tell if we're ""ready""?

* How long is too long to wait between getting engaged and getting married?

* Anyone ever been in a similar situation? Anyone get married to their first SO and regret it? 

* How much does a small wedding cost?

So I have a small background with html, but am completely new to CSS, Javascript, php, etc... I downloaded Dreamweaver CS6 last week and have been teaching myself for the most part, yet I still have a LONG way to go.

The url is www.ccancer.org if you'd like to take a look.

Could I get some advice on how and what I should do in order to add more depth and better aesthetics to the website? Thanks in advance, I don't know what I'd do without Reddit!

Edit: I have a few more questions.

1. Should I be using Dreamweaver CS6 like a currently am, or should I get another program like the Sublime one that I've seen people talk about?

2. When I create a new page for the site, is there a way to change the link for a tab on all my other pages at the same time instead of going into each page and editing the link for the same tab on the menubar over and over for each page?"

vdeql,7,2012-06-21,Mother who suffers from BPD recently diagnosed with late-stage cancer.,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/vdeql/mother_who_suffers_from_bpd_recently_diagnosed/,"Hi, BPD community -- I'm new here, but I really need help, and I'm hoping someone here can offer guidance.


I'm 21 years old, and I grew up living alone with a BPD-diagnosed mother. My parents divorced when I was 7, and when my father moved away, I was left alone with my mother -- I had to become the caretaker, the voice of reason, and ultimately fulfill the role of the parent. 

As I got older, things got worse and worse. My mother would say extraordinarily hurtful things to me: ""I made a mistake for thinking you were smart,"" ""No wonder you don't have any friends,"" ""My marriage was perfect until you were born,"" ""You'll never make anything of yourself the way I did.""

The worst of these, which I will never forget, was my mother sitting me down and telling me that I was a sociopath, and that I did not have the basic capacity to feel emotions. This was not an off-handed comment -- she sat me down in the living room, looked me in the eye, and told me she thought she'd given birth to a monster. I cried for so long, I don't even remember the length of time. I never told anyone, because I feared so much that she might be right. It hurt me more than anything -- I love my mother, and I would do anything to help her get better, since it is apparent to me that she is not psychologically well. She's not at all a bad person, but there's something wrong, and I know that it's not her fault. She has only hit me once, when I defended my father's second wife for some petty action that I no longer remember the full story behind. To this day, she will not admit doing it. It didn't leave a noticeable mark, but I remember it as clear as anything. Her verbal abuse, however, was non-stop, and her emotions are entirely unpredictable.

I began to engage in self-harm when I was 12, in the form of skin cutting. This became threatening only once, at which point I was hospitalized overnight. I was only recently able to stop this behavior. I suffer from EDNOS (specifically, a combination of orthorexia and purging disorder. I am in therapy for this right now.) I started purging at around 16. My eating disorder is not the fault of any one person, and while I take full responsibility for my own actions, I find that my symptoms get much worse when I'm spending time at home with my mother. Right now, I'm living at home for the first time in 4 years -- I'm here for 2 months before moving across the country.

I haven't lived at home since I was 17 years old -- I moved away to college before turning 18, and since that time, have worked and gotten internships to the point where I could live alone or with friends in different cities over the summer. My father paid fully for my college, including housing expenses.

Here, I guess, is the big[gest] problem: last fall, my mother was diagnosed with Stage III (metastasized to lymph nodes) neuroendocrine cancer. At the time of her treatment, she told me not to come home from college, and to try my best to finish school. While I appreciate her desire to keep me in school during her treatment, I became severely depressed: our relationship had always been awful, and now, I'm faced with my mother's fairly imminent mortality.  

**My question, I suppose, is this: I love my mother, in some strange way, and I am spending the summer with her because I want her to know I care for her deeply and will always be there for her should the need arise. However, her BPD makes it nearly impossible for us to coexist peacefully. She's hurt me so much and caused me so much psychological damage that I find it hard to care for her unconditionally -- even though I know she's very sick, every time I tend to her at her bedside, I feel as though I'm doing a good deed that is undeserved. I've been in therapy since I was around 10 years old to learn techniques to deal with her up-and-down, irrational, unpredictable emotions, but nothing works for us. We've been in both together and separately, and there is nothing that has helped at all.** 

I want her to know that I love her so much, and that when I found out she was sick I had the worst few months of my life. Even though she's hurt me, she's my mom -- she lives alone, doesn't work, and is now fighting for her life. It's a lot to deal with.

My love for her aside, her BPD is hurting me quite actively, and has hurt me immensely while I was growing up. I'm moving across the country in a month, which has already been decided (I have a job offer there), and I just want to show my mom that I care for her before I leave. I'm sure that a lot of you know how difficult it is to grow up with a BPD parent, and I'd love to hear some input from others who have been through similar situations.

Thanks, and I look forward to hearing from you.

**TL;DR: Grew up alone with a BPD-suffering mother. She hurt me a lot as a child, and our relationship is very strained. Found out a year ago that she has stage III cancer -- looking for advice, how do I proceed from here?**"

Had my first appointment with a gender therapist, and it went better than expected.",AliceCode,transpositive,https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/vcyoe/ear_to_ear_grin_today_had_my_first_appointment/,"I had to travel 176 miles for this session, and I must say that it was well worth it. My therapist is a really understanding person, and I felt really comfortable talking to him. He allowed me to choose which pronouns I prefer to be identified by, and what name I'd prefer to go by. At the moment, I'm choosing to go by male pronouns/names because I'm not presenting as female, but I let him understand that I will change that when I start presenting as female.

He agreed that I'm transgender, which is incredibly uplifting to me because it took a lot to accept it myself.

He even told me that he was impressed by my perspective on life, and that I'm incredibly mature for my age. He also told me that he thinks it's amazing that I summoned the courage to educate myself, and come out as transgender, and make the steps to transition.

He's an LPC intern still, and he started counseling in January of this year, and I definitely think he's great at what he does. Very professional, and made me feel comfortable talking about personal things even during the first session.

It was also explained to me that he will write me my letter to start HRT after two or three sessions, just to cover all the ""basics"", I guess. All in all, everything went better than I figured it would, and I'm extremely happy about everything."
vfwe9,0,2012-06-22,Friends accuse boyfriend of being controlling and disrespectful,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vfwe9/friends_accuse_boyfriend_of_being_controlling_and/,"Me 22; SO 21. Together for 3 months but I felt like he was the one for a long time.

My boyfriend (of 3 months) just moved 3 hours away for a summer internship. I started hanging out with my one of my friends again, even though she had been cold to me in the past few months. Boyfriend does not like her or her reckless behavior and thinks that she is a bad influence on me and our relationship. We kept fighting about this over the phone almost every night and I'm left crying each time. Then in the morning, he apologizes for overreacting. 

He is basically asking me to choose my friend or him. She has been my best friend for over a year but we had a nasty fallout this year. Normally, this is alarming because this is not something he should be asking. Yet his reasoning sounds right, that she is not trustworthy and is a reckless fairweather friend. They used to be friends, but he has cut her out of his life and does not want any association with her. He hates the idea of me hanging out with her and thinks that she is manipulative. He calls me a tool whenever I hang out with her.

I have asked my best friends for advice because I don't trust myself anymore. I might be too blinded by him to see the truth. Last night, I learned that even before this week's ordeal, my friends do not like him. They say that he has this tone of voice where it's like ""you need to listen to me because I know more than you"". And the worst part is that they hate the way he talks to me; they see him as being disrespectful and demanding. They have been holding back because each time, I would tell them of how happy I am with him.

Boyfriend is coming back tonight. I absolutely love him but this is starting to drain me. Everything felt alright until this week when he moved away. I think he's freaking out over the LDR and he overreacts at everything. Yet it's very concerning that my friends do not like him.

I really want to make this relationship work, but I don't know how. I don't think he's aware of his behavior. How should I talk to him tonight? Should we talk a break or should we just break up? 

TL;DR Boyfriend is overreacting due to LDR this week and wants me to stop hanging with a bad friend or else we will break up. I recently learn that all of my friends dislike my boyfriend, even prior to LDR. How do I mend my relationship? Or should I take a break? Break up? I really think he's the one, but I may be blinded."

vfa8g,1,2012-06-22,Kind of a shit year,[deleted],lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/vfa8g/kind_of_a_shit_year/,"I apologize ahead of time for the length and if I somehow come off the wrong way. I know a lot of people are in a much worse situation than I am in, but I just feel like I needed to get this off my chest.

-----

I'm a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at a Canadian university and for the past year, I've desperately tried to get an internship. Most people around me were doing it purely for the experience, but I've needed to pay down my loans as soon as possible (I would be graduating with 38 grand in debt - single mother family with 2 daughters), learn the professional engineering world all while getting anything useful on my resume. Most of the people I know who graduated this year are still trying to find jobs and almost all of them moved back in with their parents (essentially scaring the shit out of me since I have family problems and scared to hell about loan repayments).


I sacrificed my free time and a lot of my school time to prepare applications and getting ready for interviews. I even invested myself to the point that I delayed planning housing with my friends. I almost got one, but I lost it because I didn't have a full driver's license. Why? Because myself nor my family could ever afford Driver's Ed for practice and my mother didn't lend me her car because it was critical for her work to feed us. That and the fact that my estranged father was in more accidents than I have fingers led to me pushing it off until this year. So I lost essentially the dream internship I wanted and it started the downward path to depression.

-


40+ applications later, I have nothing to show for it. As a result, my GPA went down significantly to the point that I almost lost my scholarship (engineering degrees are insanely expensive), I'm living as a sublet in my friend's house with no clue as to where I'm living for the new school year. I've had over 10 interviews yet for some reason I can't get anything. Interviewers won't give me feedback and careers counselling services tell me I'm strong as an interviewee so I have no fucking clue as to what's happening. Additionally, I've had 3 mock interviews to prepare. I can't confide in people because one friend got one after his second interview, and all my other friends either had 1 or no interviews at all so they tell me to stop complaining (""*at least you got interviews*"") and have since moved on. Interviews don't mean anything unless you get something. 


My friend with an internship then rubs it in my face whenever she gets the chance because she's a bit of a cunt, talking about all her friends up in Alberta got one too without even trying (""YOU SHOULD MOVE TO ALBERTA TO FIND ONE EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE BROKE"").  I have no real prior work experience due to my Chinese family's study-no-time-for-work policy in high school and the job market souring in university (especially in this shitty uni town).


I've exhausted my school's career counselling help to the point where I almost broke down during a meeting with a career counsellor. In one meeting, the lady basically drew a chart showing Baby Boomers and my generation saying ""You won't get anything until 2-3 years from now"". I graduate in a year, what the fuck. In others, they just told me to keep trying (no other advice) despite me telling them my current situation.


The worst part is that I could have fully avoided this by getting a license but I was too stupid trying to get over own problems and became complacent in not getting one until now. I feel like a fucking failure in every aspect. I gained considerable weight because I was too depressed to exercise, started to drink to cope with finishing another application (I've since stopped because I realized it wasn't helping + I'm broke). Sometimes I could barely get out of bed and other times, I've stayed until for 3 days straight trying to even start another job application but I feel vomiting when I do. I get more depressed than I should be when companies don't even bother sending me a rejection letter (I'm left hanging with hope only to be crushed as the weeks go by).


At this point, I've been trying to get any job and have been handing out resumes around the town since the beginning of May with no success. My boyfriend got a summer job after looking for two weeks and now I feel even more worthless since he goes off to his job and come back while I sit at home all day being broke and doing nothing. I'm dreading the new school year since I'm **going to be doing the exact same thing all over again for a post-grad job**.


I fucking hate my life right now, yet I'm still applying to the slim pickings that are still available. I fucking hate this so much, just so fucking much. 


**TL;DR: Life.**"

I'm doing an internship, and while I applied for a python position, after about a week, I've been told to work on developing an express.js API which interacts with a flask analytics app(which I also have to create).

Only problem is that I've never touched javascript in my life, and I don't see myself becoming an express.js expert in 2 days. I'm kinda panicking.

From what I understand, the API has to respond to the flask app's GET and POST queries, and has to return JSON data. I think I've got the returning JSON part down. Here's a small code that I think is how this is supposed to work: http://ideone.com/iFUCO

The problem is that the JSON is at api.domain.com/me of every user. How can I make it return JSON for every individual user? How could I integrate the flask app with the API? Is there any way I can use the JSON to get total number of active users at any given time? 

I know routes work in express.js, but they also work for flask, so how am I supposed to use them?

I know I could probably do this stuff if I sit down and start learning from scratch, but that'll probably take more than a week or two. I know it's not a lot to go on, and I'm not looking for anyone to solve these problem for me. I just want some help in figuring out how do I go on about this.

vh0ik,28,2012-06-23,For those contemplating law school - someone who decided not to go (and still respects people that do),cool_irl,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/vh0ik/for_those_contemplating_law_school_someone_who/,"About a year and a half ago I was right in the thick of the law school application process. I put money into testmasters, took the LSAT, applied to about 12 schools, got accepted to a few schools, and was telling friends and family how excited I was about it.  I had been working as a paralegal since the end of undergrad (2 years), and thought this was the logical next step.  I even went to a spring orientation weekend in a different state (on my own dime).  My GPA was somewhat low, LSAT good but not amazing, and I was destined to go to a school within the  30 - 50 range.  

Then, in April 2011, I balked.  I decided to make the decision and not go ahead with the law school aspiration.  I realized that I was doing it because of the situation/job that I fell into after school - which was not what I had wanted.  The cost and the seemingly infinite reports about diminished job prospects freaked me out.  

The hardest part was... telling people.  ""Didn't you spend ____ on an LSAT course?  Didn't you apply to x amount of schools?  That costs a lot of money too, right?""  It wasn't a great feeling - especially coming from a successful family that expects a lot out of their kin.  Or friends that are already knee-deep in law school and are doing very well.

Instead, I immediately applied to do a post-bac in computer science at a state school in a cheap area - a 2 year program.   My original degree was in economics.  I'm a geek at heart, had done some hobby programming, and wanted to 'do what I actually want to do' before I got too old.  Quarter life crisis, I suppose.  

Fast forward to now, and I somehow pulled off a 4.0 in both semesters, obtained two undergraduate research positions, and am doing a summer internship at an international, market leading microprocessor manufacturer (well, they may as well be the only one) doing software development.

I'm not coming here to say that law school is always the wrong choice.  It's not.  I know many, many people who are and have been successful doing just that.  I probably don't have what it takes to be a great lawyer, and envy certain qualities of people that do.  

But - I want to remind those of you who are contemplating law school because there's ""nothing else you can do with your degree"" that you are still young.  If you find yourself having to remind yourself of the benefits of law school because you're on the fence, give it more thought than you normally would.  You may find that it reinforces your aspirations about law - great!  Or, it may guide you the other way.

My experience might be an outlier, but I am so incredibly relieved that I changed paths when I did (even with the sunk costs) because it allowed me to remember that I'm not bound to some 'logical' career path just because family/society/myself expects it to happen.  You have a lot more control than you think you do.

vii6m,7,2012-06-24,THE MANLY ADVENTURES OF ABNER DEGGENT: Island of the Toroga,magwier,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/vii6m/the_manly_adventures_of_abner_deggent_island_of/,"The decade after the second world war was a period of unlimited prosperity. For a rugged few individuals it was also a time of unlimited adventure and the manliest of those adventurers was the mercenary, treasure hunter and unlicensed electrician named Abner Deggent.

It would be fair to say that he fascinated me from the very first. As an amateur writer I had become an avid observer of humanity and I knew from the very first glance that this was a man that lived life on the edge.

It began in the summer of 1947, once I had been one of the most decorated chefs in the navy but I had recently been dishonorably discharged. You might think a man like General McArthur would be more forgiving of a few tapeworms but you would be wrong.

My aimless wanderings had brought me to a bar in Singapore that was owned by a retired trainer of fighting chickens, which was why he had named his establishment ‘The Brutal Cock.’ This was an establishment that catered to the jaded desires of soldiers of fortune and modern day pirates.

Everyone looked up when the man strode into the bar; some noticed his whipcord muscles, others noticed his steely eyed expression, many more noticed that when he kicked the door open it hit a waitress and knocked her unconscious.

He walked up to the bar and began talking to the owner, his mastery of the Malay language was clumsy but he spoke with the kind of confidence only a man that doesn’t realize he’s accidentally ordered a Shirley Temple with Tabasco sauce can have.

I left my table and introduced myself.

“Deggent’s the name,” he shook my hand with crushing force. His was as deep and rich as a good souffle, “Abner Deggent.”

I introduced myself, “Ralph Brooks.”

The owner brought over his drink, Deggent sipped from it contemplatively, then coughed for a few minutes.

When his eyes had stopped watering I ordered him an expensive beer.

He smiled thinly “Much obliged Brooks.”

“Please, you may call me Ralph,” I paid for our drinks, “and if you don’t mind my saying so it looks as though you are either coming back from an adventure or are about to set out on one.”

“Everyday is an adventure for me Brooks,” he took a long swig of beer. If the mustache of dripping foam bothered him he gave no sign.

“Really? I’d like to hear more.” I said.

Deggent explained to me that he had recently undertaken a mission to help recover the twin idols from the natives of Togora Island.

“I’m sorry if I’m a bit confused,” I interrupted, “but you said you were recovering these idols.”

“Yes,” he grunted, “those artifacts were solid gold, they were priceless. Better to have them in a museum than to have them being worshiped by a bunch of savages for another two hundred years.”

I nodded with understanding and he continued his story. The expedition, he explained, had been organized by Professor Eisenhart working from the notes of a previous expedition that had disappeared without a trace. Other men might have been scared off knowing something like that but not Deggent!

Besides, no one told him anything about it until they were already on the island of the Toroga The expedition consisted of Deggent, Professor Eisenhart and their translator, a lovely native girl named Weena. They lacked the funds for native bearers and bodyguards but the Professor got around that by recruiting a small force of unpaid interns.

Occasionally Deggent would pause in the telling of his tale to place another drink order on my tab and try to entice our waitress into having sex with him for money. He started out by waving a ten dollar bill under her nose and worked his way up in increments of five.

My narrative skills could never fully capture the tale of their journey through that savage land. They encountered quicksand and ravenous beasts, clever deathtraps and rock slides, the crossed swords with another group of treasure hunters and wandering Toroga warriors. Our heroes braved it all, venturing deeper and deeper into the jungle leaving nothing but a trail of mutilated unpaid interns in their wake.

When they reached the village of the Toroga they were immediately set upon and captured, their translator having betrayed them. Deggent could only speculate to her reasons but he suspected that the check he had prepaid her with bouncing had something to do with it.

The chief of the Toroga spoke perfect English and he explained that his people were weary of one group of adventurers after another raiding their quiet village. He meant to make an example of our heroes by subjecting them to the Death Of A Thousand Screams.

Abner Deggent laughed fearlessly at this causing the chief of the Toroga to re-sentence him to the Death Of One Really Big Scream but before that could happen Deggent challenged the man, infact he challenged the honor of the entire Toroga people.

“I told him that we would have our champion fight theirs, if we won we would go free, if they won they would go forward with the executions,” Deggent explained, “luckily he fell for it.”

“Well, what happened?” I asked.

Deggent shrugged, “Damned if I know, we told them the last surviving intern was our champion and we made our escape as he battled the tribal champion in a pit full of flaming vipers.”

Of course there was more to the story? Did they ever find the treasure? How did they escape the island?

Before I could ask the owner of the bar appeared before us waving a rusty machete. It was only then that Abner Deggent discovered he had been propositioning the man’s daughter for sexual favors all night.

What happened then? That is a story for another time."

vlfn3,1,2012-06-25,Self discovery and the battle within,[deleted],minimalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/vlfn3/self_discovery_and_the_battle_within/,"I suppose my journey of self discovery started a few months ago. The seed that grew in my mind, resulting in the person I am today, was planted by coming across minimalism by accident.

Maybe you know the feeling too. I had never consciously seen my possessions as something that was causing me some level of inner turmoil and stress. Throughout my childhood, I had acquired various things from my hobbies. Over time, those items had to travel with me as I moved for university and then internships. Packing and unpacking was always a stressful activity. You know the story.

When I came across minimalism applied to living, it was as if a light switch was thrown and the mental straps that was bearing down on my mind was illuminated, plain to see. I immediately became aware that my happiness derived from experiences, and if my possessions didn't contribute to positive experiences then they were an anchor of my spirit. I started throwing away and giving away a lot, but not all, of my things. Each time I removed something that I didn't need from my life, I became a little bit calmer, a little bit more tranquil. You know the story.

After a while, I'd made a lot of progress. I was much happier with the state of my living. I started thinking a little bit deeper about why exactly I was feeling burdened my possessions, and why I felt the way I did when I lived with less. It came down to this for me: the possessions are just an intermediary in the chain of anxiety, and at the root of it, fear.

What is this anxiety? It's not the normal kind, it lays hidden in your subconscious without you realising it. It's the chain being dragged behind you as you live your life, little by little taking parts of your spirit and time. It builds up, and when you realise it, it becomes unnerving just how long you've spent in this state. The anxiety builds because when I attach parts of my identity, of who I am as a person and my life experiences, to my possessions, I become responsible for them. I become a responsible guardian, because if who I am and my worth is in possessions, then the possessions must be protected as a part of myself. The fear simply results from the fear of losing parts of yourself, and the knowledge that you're more empty inside because of it.

So here I am yet again. The temptation to accumulate more comes with occasion, and the demons in my mind want me to put value, personal value, into them. It's easy. All you have to do is buy and store, and you feel like you're a bigger person for it. You temporarily feel like you've grown, because your possessions are part of your identity, and you have more. More is always better isn't it? We know of course this isn't true, yet this is another one of those battles that we fight with ourselves quietly, unknown to anyone, even ourselves sometimes.

The battle will be won eventually, but what's next? Minimalism was a necessary and valuable step in my journey of self discovery for who I want to be, and finding our how to live the life I want to live. Myself, I don't know where my own story goes. Perhaps you do."
vld6m,1,2012-06-25,I need to rant about the completely oblivious previous generations.,Jazztoken,lostgeneration,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/vld6m/i_need_to_rant_about_the_completely_oblivious/,"My story is long, but it's summed up by the fact that my personal goal is to return to college and become a computer scientist, or possibly some form of engineer. I can't do that right now, so I have to listen to a constant barrage of ""what are you doing with your life?"". Both are very useful, profitable, in demand and realistically, not more expensive (as I already have a couple years of college under my belt) that going to trade school. For the record, I'm already a programmer.

Yet, every single time I talk to my family, they harp that I need to become a welder, plumber, or electrician- careers that have median earning of roughly half of my intended career; careers that also can't expect decent paying internships during the education. Regardless of how many perks I bring up, they seem to be brainwashed into believing the only profitable way to succeed in life is to do back breaking and dirty work. For the record, I don't think there's anything wrong with it. I've done construction most of my adult life. I just want to be *successful*.

Furthermore, I just spent 30 minutes arguing with my mother, who seems to believe that it's possible to begin a Civil Engineering apprenticeship after a four-month training program. No degree necessary.

Is the media feeding this impression that bad? I cannot understand where they're getting their information.

vl5qs,12,2012-06-25,Need advice for getting an entry level finance position,someguy82,finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/vl5qs/need_advice_for_getting_an_entry_level_finance/,"I have been looking for an entry level finance position for almost a year now with out any success.  Initially I really wanted be on the investment side of analysis, but as time passed I became less picky and at this point I am willing to take anything at all that has to do with analysis.  

I graduated in the top 15% of my class from a well known University, but every place I apply is the same story: ""We need someone with more experience.""  These aren't upper level jobs I am applying to either.  They are entry level positions asking for 0-2 years, and there aren't very many of them.  Of the few entry level positions that do get posted, there are generally about 150-300 applicants per job(based off what several interviewers have told me).  

So how do I differentiate myself from the pack when I don't have experience?

Things I have tried:

Internships-  This is a dead end.  I applied to approximately 30 different internships, but I have been told by multiple recruiters that they cant hire you for an internship position if you are no longer in school, so this option is out because I already graduated.

Networking-  I contacted all my friends and family about my job search.  My family is very small and I am somewhat of an introvert so my network is not terribly large.  I ended up with 6 informational interviews and got a lot of good information(including multiple HR people reviewing my resume), but ultimately no job prospects.  I see ""networking"" mentioned frequently here, but I feel that I have reached the end of my personal network.  If you have any advice on how to improve my networking it would be much appreciated.  

Temp agencies-  I tried contacting the three agencies that specialize in temporary finance positions in my area, but they haven't returned any of my messages.  While I don't know why this is the case, I would imagine it has to do with the fact that they are looking for people with experience.  If their clients want people with experience(and I am sure they do) then the agencies are only going to hire people with experience.  

Applying to as many places as I can-  I check my schools career website, go to job fairs, and check the websites of as many local companies as I can think of(Amazon, Boeing, Blackrock, allstate, parametric, becu, ubs, Russel Investments, etc).

CFA program- With all this spare time I have not working, I decided to start on the CFA program in order to keep my mind sharp in the areas of finance.  I find out if I passed at the end of July.

Can anyone help me with my plan moving forward?

So I had been talking to this girl for the past 4 weeks or so but we hadn't hung out in 3 weeks due to conflicting busy schedules (or so I thought). So this past Thursday we finally got a chance to see each other by meeting at a bar with some friends. Now I know that the thought of seeing her got me anxious and whatnot, but I didn't think it would make me overly anxious/nervous. Long story short, I didn't eat sufficiently, I drank a little bit, and made frequent trips to the bathroom to throw up. Of course she didn't know that because she was playing me the whole time, but that's beside the point. The point is, was it the nervousness that made me nauseous or was it the lack of food I had mixed with slight drinking? 

Now move on to Friday. Right before I left for the bar on Thursday, I got the number of one of the interns I work with and it seemed that there might be something there. So the interns had already planned a trip to a brewery after work and I knew that since I wasn't talking to the first girl anymore, I could focus my energy on the intern. But this thought made my anxious/nauseous feeling come back. Not to the point that it was Thursday, but just enough that I could feel it. I didn't end up throwing up Friday, but just the fact that the feeling was still there was troubling to me.

And now, to Saturday. Some of the interns, including the girl, went to Athens to celebrate someone's birthday. I knew that I was going to actively pursue the girl, but I also could still feel the nauseous feelling...after two days. I disregaurded it becasue I knew that this was the day I had to make my move. So I drove to Athens, met up with the girl and everyone else. We pregamed. We went out. I drank a decent amount which surprised me becasue I honestly felt if I drank anything I would throw up on spot. Then towards the end of the night I ended up at her place and we made out a bit. In the middle of it I did have to excuse myself to the bathroom but I attributed that to the drinks. It was fine and we went to bed but I couldn't sleep becasue A) I was exremely hungry, and B) I was still kind of nauseous.

Woke up on Sunday. Woke her up with a kiss. Immediately excused myself to the bathroom to throw up (maybe hungover?? idk). Came back and talked a bit, then I left. Once I left I felt slightly better but I still had that anxious feeling. Tried to get rid of it all day with Tums, soup and rest but it didn't work.

So now it's Monday, and i'm sitting at work with the same nauseous anxious feeling that I just can't get rid of. There's nothing anticipatory about today other than going back to my hotel room and sleeping. I'm not gonna see intern girl until I get back in town which isn't for another 4 days. I honestly don't know where the feeling is coming from anymore. I'm wondering if I need to actually go to the doctor? I just want to feel normal.

Your input is appreciated. This is me kind of letting my gaurd down because this whole ""getting nauseous after hooking up"" thing is not fun at all and is kind of embarassing honestly. So yea...help me out please!

**TL/DR: Lately i've been getting nauseous after hooking up with someone. It happened this weekend but the nauseous feeling is still carrying over into the week. Do I need to go to the doctor or am I just overly anxious about seeing her again?**

vkn1c,5,2012-06-25,Not Enough Bits,notenoughbits,MyLittleSupportGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyLittleSupportGroup/comments/vkn1c/not_enough_bits/,"Well, I guess this is a problem almost everyone encounters, but I'd like to get it off my chest so I'm not tossing and turning at 3 AM again thinking about it. 

Basically, my lack of bits is due in part to personal irresponsibility, part in due to circumstance, and I'm conflicted about the entire thing. 

It feels like everyone I know has money. Everyone goes out, has cars, spends time traveling, whatever. Maybe that isn't the case, perceptions aren't always reality. 

And it also feels as if everyone's parents are subsidizing them except my own. While growing up we certainly weren't poor, my parents were shit financial planners and haven't really helped me out much in terms of college. A few bucks here and there, help with a few major jams, but damn, they did not plan. Oh, and the best part is my family, after convincing me college was a great plan, likes to now talk about how college isn't a good investment. Thanks for the heads up once I'm 50k in!

It wouldn't be fair to put it all on them, though. I spend too much money. I want to keep up with the Joneses, to look cool - to do what I thought everyone else was doing. My friends have nice things and go out, why shouldn't I? That attitude isn't really good torwards saving money. And while I consider myself well-educated and I'm getting good experience with my internships, they don't really pay enough. I've considered getting a weekend job, but I don't want to cripple my social life. I think about how much money I've spent on going out I could have saved - great experiences, but damn, I feel kind of stupid and I definitely need to tailor that back. 

Then it's just unfortunate events. Car breakdowns. Parking tickets. Traffic tickets. Computer breakdowns. Etc., etc....all these compounding things kind of suck. Bad planning! My car broke down, predatory cops giving out stupid tickets, my car not selling for as much as I hoped for. I barely have any money for merch at Bronycon (the ultimate in first-world problems, but still)

I know there's people much worse off in life, both in terms of parents, student loans, education, work experience and bad luck. But I still feel alittle cheated. It's probably just me feeling entitled, and I need to shake that. But when everyone else around you seems to be doing fine, you do get abit jealous. 

I really wanted to just write this out and get it off my chest, but advice, maybe your own stories, anything like that is appriciated too. Ideas on making extra money would be awesome, too. I'm saavy with computers and know abit about web design, maybe I could do simple computer repair or website design on the side for extra cash. I liked working with people, so going back to retail is a possbility. 

Thanks for listening to this first-world-problems rant. "

I heard I might be able to call local animal shelters around asking for help - is this true?

vnkup,1,2012-06-26,Success story (and advice if you want to take it),fromcj,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/vnkup/success_story_and_advice_if_you_want_to_take_it/,"Sup dudes and dudettes,

This is a story about how anyone has a chance to beat depression. Seriously, anybody. I know some of you are like ""I've tried everything. This can't help."" but it might. So give it a shot. I promise not to offer bad advice like ""Just believe in yourself!"" or to ""take it one day at a time"" because I've been where you guys are, and I now want to see you guys get to where I am.

I had been getting more and more depressed since...December of 2009 or January of 2010. At first it was just me being totally broken up and lost after a split with my girlfriend of two years. Then I found out that she had been sexually assaulted at a party and that's what led to her retreating inwards, pushing me away, and ultimately no longer being interested in dating me at all. Then it sort of didn't cross my mind all summer, I was away from home for an internship so it was pretty relaxing.

When I got back to school in September though, it was right back down into a hole that was getting deeper and deeper. Girls didn't want to date me because I had 0 self-esteem, and I had 0 self-esteem because girls didn't want to date me. Then I started to do worse and worse in my classes. I had always had a tenuous relationship with alcohol but I basically went off the deep end at this point. I was drinking heavily. Like handles of vodka (100 proof, not 80 proof), everclear, anything that could just get me drunk super fast. And I was doing this basically every night.

So anyway, I'm gonna fast forward cause we don't need to hear all these stories about me making a fool of myself and making bad choices which all led to me becoming extremely depressed. I was pretty much thinking about suicide all the time cause I just couldn't deal with being this sad for the rest of my life.

Then one day while I was trying to get through some homework that I just had like, negative interest in, I put on an album by a band I had heard about all the time but had never tried. The band was called The Wonder Years and the album was called The Upsides. It basically saved my life because it taught me to fight. The whole theme of the album is that the guy who wrote it was too young to be this defeated by life. I'm not saying that people who are in there 40s and 50s and beyond should be okay with being depressed, but feeling totally beaten down by the world when you're still college-aged? That's the kind of stuff that leads to kids killing themselves.

I went to a therapist on campus, she recommended some guy to me, it didn't really work out. He kept trying to find a problem to diagnose me with and didn't address the fact that I was clearly depressed. He wanted me to work on my self esteem but I was like dude, you don't get it, its not that I don't have any self esteem, it's that I don't CARE that I don't have any. It didn't work out, so I went back to the therapist and asked if she had any other recommendations. She gave me two more cards for therapists that she knew personally and said they were really good. Out of the blue I asked her if she knew any physicians as well, just so I could get a physical, which I needed at the time.

I went in for my physical and regular doctor/patient stuff happened. Y'know, weight, height, blood pressure, grabbing my balls, all that stuff. At the end he asked if I had anything I wanted to talk about and I just said I was having trouble sleeping so I was hoping I could get like Ambien or some other sleep aid. He talked to me a little bit about why I was having trouble sleeping and I explained that I have anxiety, panic attacks, the idea of facing another day is so overwhelming, all this stuff. So he wrote me some prescriptions.

I got put on Celexa (citalopram) and Welbutrin (bupropion) for a while. I think I got put on them in December, so 2 years after I first started feeling this way. That's how long it took me to get help. Ridic. But they worked a little bit, and I felt a little bit better. I didn't want to die anymore, I just wanted life to be better. I left it at that and was like ok. This must be what it feels like to not be depressed. Kinda lame. Oh well.

I basically just lived my life at that point. Barely got through school, moved to a new apartment, got a new job, all that. But I wasn't feeling better. I was actually starting to get worse again. The idea of going to this job that I didn't even really like for the rest of my life was just overwhelming. Luckily, my bupropion scrip ran out, and my doctor wanted me to come in for a check up.

I went in and I told him about my issues. Still can't sleep, still getting anxiety attacks, still sad all the time, all that. So he upped my dosage of citalopram to 40mg from 20. I was really nervous about this next part and I had to fight to get it out but I told him I was thinking I might have ADHD. We went over why I thought so, I listed some of the things I do that made me think that, and he wrote me a scrip for Adderall.

Turns out that's exactly what I needed. It turns out that almost all of my problems are also problems that people with ADHD experience. Depression, anxiety, drastic mood swings, OCD, everything can co-occur with ADHD. I never even THOUGHT about it until my roommate in college got a scrip for it and it totally changed his personality from a person who did really poorly in school and didn't really care or try or anything like that to a completely average student. He did his homework, he passed his classes, he got a girlfriend, he was golden. Now that I'm on it, I feel better already and it hasn't even been a week. I've already had 3 days free of any significant, long-term bouts of depression or anxiety, I sleep better, I do my schoolwork, it's great.

So anyway, that's my story. I am the best person I've been in over 2 years, and I want you guys to know that you can reach that place too. Here are just some random bits of advice that I would give to ANYONE with depression.

* Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor about ANYTHING that might concern you because you never know what could be fueling your depression. Never just assume that you're not being effected by something.
* Don't be afraid of pills and drugs. I was, which is why I put off talking to a doctor for so long and resorted to alcohol and hard drugs.
* Establish a support network. Don't hide what's going on from your friends. They'll want to help you get better.
* Find inspiration. Find motivation. I found mine in an album (again, The Upsides by The Wonder Years. I really can't recommend it enough, I'm not kidding when I say it saved my life.) but you could find yours anywhere. 

That's it. That's all I had to do. In retrospect, it seems so simple, but I know from experience it isn't simple. All I can do is encourage you to take that first step. You'll feel so much better when the journey is over, but it can't end until it's begun. So do it for you. Get out there and do whatever it takes to feel better, because you all fucking deserve it.

TL,DR: It's not about forcing yourself to be happy, it's about not letting the sadness win."
vnj19,2,2012-06-26,Religion in Social Work Practice: Are we all on the same page?,jamminjmoon,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/vnj19/religion_in_social_work_practice_are_we_all_on/,"I stumbled into an incredibly controversial debate with my supervisor today and I just can't shake it.

It was brought to my attention today that the CSB I am working for does not have a policy regarding religion in any way, shape, or form.  My supervisor and my only co worker are both very religious and fairly open about it.  I am not a religious person.  I work in an adult day program for individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses.  

The conversation went something like this:
Supervisor:  I want to do a group on spirituality and mental illness and I found this great resource.
Me:  Oh great what is it like?
Supervisor shows me the website
Me:  Oh that stinks, I guess we can't use it because there is scripture in the material.
Supervisor:  That is not necessarily true.  We could take certain words out (e.g. Christianity, God, Jesus, etc.), and then it would be ok
Me:  Oh, I thought that the NASW code of ethics, not to mention the government which we receive partial funding from, would prohibit the use of religious material in this setting because it could hinder relationships with clients who would not be comfortable with this
Supervisor:  Well our accrediting agency, CARF, specifically requires that we discuss spirituality in order to address mental health holistically
Me:  Well what happens when the clients ask direct questions about their specific religion, in regard to spirituality, or anyone else's?
Supervisor:  You can say whatever you are comfortable with.  I have given religious materials to clients who I knew were religious and I have disclosed that I believe in God
Me:  I'm so confused...I was told throughout school, an internship, and a job in a non profit organization, that I was to leave myself out of interactions with clients, and when I was met with a direct personal question I should re direct the conversation and say something like, 'Why are my religious beliefs important to your treatment here?'
Supervisor:  You were not hired as a ""social worker"" (I have a BSW and am working for a CSB), therefore as an employee you are to follow agency policies when they conflict with the NASW's views

This turned into a very interesting, but emotionally draining debate with my supervisor, which led me to check out our policy manual.  Upon scanning the entire gigantic document and realizing religion was not mentioned once, I then spoke with my supervisor's supervisor (with my direct supervisor's permission) who said she would bring it to the management team tomorrow and get back to me.

I guess my question is, how is this handled at your agency, or if you are in school, what is the latest the NASW has to say in the matter? And more personally, what the hell am I to do if I find out that my agency is supporting self disclosure, and specifically disclosure about religious preferences while leading groups with clients? I would love any feeback!!

To make things a bit streamlined, try and answer in this format:

Industry:

Title:

Amount of experience in the field:

What you like about your job/ industry:

What you don't like about your job/ industry:

How much of your day you feel is ""wasted"" (doing things you hate/ dealing with bosses/ managers you hate):

Level of satisfaction/ fulfillment/ accomplishment your job brings you: 




If you have anything you'd like to add, please feel free, and please be honest. I'll start.





Industry: Retail Banking

Title: Client Service Representative

Amount of experience in the field: 1 year

What you like about your job/ industry: I love talking to new people everyday, and to some extent, feel like I'm helping them.

What you don't like about your job/ industry: The reputation that banks have nowadays, sales goals, and micromanagement.

How much of your day you feel is ""wasted"" (doing things you hate/ dealing with bosses/ managers you hate): I love who I work for, but a lot of my day is filled with menial tasks and reports.

Level of satisfaction/ fulfillment/ accomplishment your job brings you: Honestly, little to zero. I go home feeling like I have accomplished nothing and don't get much self satisfaction from my job. This is my biggest issue with my current path. The pay is great in banking (eventually investments or advising), but I don't get any self fulfillment from it and feel like I'm wasting my life away.

I just want to say thank you to all of you for being so supportive. My friends helped a lot too. She got me kicked out as well, so some friends let me stay in their extra room. When I went to court I ended up paying 1200 bucks and got 6 months probation (I won't start until August, when I get back from my Co-op job this summer, and it'll be shortened because of that). I've already stopped smoking though. The misdemeanor will be taken off at the end of the probation. A few weeks ago I finally got the courage to tell my boss. I'm working a software engineering Co-op job so I was scared I fucked that up, but my boss is really chill. He was fine with it and said he definitely wouldn't fire me for it. Last week I did an interview for an aerospace/defense/tech company internship next summer, and he told me to keep in touch, said he didn't know much about the paperwork and stuff but that it doesn't start until December. When I said my boss could put in a good word he told me it wasn't necessary and that the interest is enough. I told him about the arrest since I didn't want to get my hopes up, and he was super cool with it, said he and many others made mistakes in college and it just happens, no big deal. I feel a million times better and I'm so excited. His team works on missile defense targets. Fuck yea. 

So I just want to say even when things seem to not be going so well, it will get better. I was dumb and the past 2 years of amazing friends and Reddit/other internet sites put me in a daze that anyone my age was cool with it. Not everyone is. Be careful out there. Don't trust everyone. I have a hard time in that I trust people right away if they are decent to me. I'm just happy I didn't fuck up my career. Oh, I never got revenge and one of the other roommates moved out after I did.

Hello, like the title says I've been in a relationship for three years with a wonderful girl (Kara 20F) who I care for so much but the problem is, I'm (21M) gay and I'm unfaithful. I've known I was into guys since I was 14 and have pretty much never doubted it but I've tried to fight it ever since. I have known Kara since we were kids and we have always shared a bond and me in my naivety thought with her unknowing help I could beat the feelings I was having for the men in my life.

I asked her to be my girlfriend on my 18th birthday and since then on the surface everything has been great. About six months into our relationship I had my first relapse so to speak, I had to be in a different state for six weeks for a minor internship for a company I wanted to work for in the future and in my time there I met a guy (21 like me now) and fell for him completely. I didn't do anything sexual but we spent hours every night talking and it meant the world to me. That raised some flags because that was the first time I had truly emotionally fallen for a guy.

A year later me and Kara move to that same place because she had been accepted to a great school, and I followed her because I was able to get a job at the same company I interned for the year before. Well, you can see where this is going, I met him and 4 month later I cheated and I'm not going to lie, it was incredible. I was able to feel the real thing, unfortunately the aftermath was awful. Just an hour after the sex, the self-loathing I felt was at it's highest point, I drove around for two hours crying like a little girl.

I was raised in a very conservative home where if you are gay, you're dead. My dad is a pastor, and my mother is no worse but she repeats everything he says as it's gospel. I haven't spoken to my mom and dad or my brother since I was 18 so that isn't the problem, it's what they left in me. This apparent inherent hatred for who I am.
Anyways, I felt so bad that I didn't speak to him for a month. I told him I wasn't gay and it was just alcohol and horniness (I don't even drink) that made that happen. I decided out of respect to my gf(I know, pathetic) to quit my job and get another one.

That isn't the end, I went to a convention three months ago and he showed up, begged me to talk to him and me being still intoxicated with him gave in and we talked for hours, we cried, we laughed and on the last day of the convention; we had sex.
Since then we've met up three times and had sex. He tells me to leave Kara and I know it's the right thing to do, but I'm not ready to be out and somehow losing Kara means it may be me giving up on what I promised my self at 16, to hide the fact I'm gay forever.

The shame get overpowering sometimes not only because I'm gay but what I'm doing to the most decent human being I know. Kara is beautiful, smart, funny and understands me. I really do love her but not in that way... It's hard to explain. She doesn't know anything, I've become to good of a liar, one of the things you pick up being a closeted gay man.

I have no idea why I came here, but getting this off my chest felt good. Has anyone else gone through something like this and if so. how did you deal with it?

tl;dr: I'm gay in a relationship with a wonderful girl, met a guy and fell for him, cheated and feeling pathetic and helpless.

Edit: Thanks for the replies guys, it has helped. I'm going to try to breakup with her in the next two weeks. Again, thanks."

*Preface: This is a complete first-world problem, I know. Moving on:*

I have a fair bit of disposable income from my engineering internships, with no outstanding financial obligations, and I was planning on getting a new Macbook Pro Retina (RMBP).

What's making me hesitate:

1) I have a great Dell XPS 15z currently (picked it up using some lab grant money just a year prior - dual core i7, 8gb RAM, SSD + HDD combo, .97"" thick, 1080p screen, Windows8)

2) Early adopter ""curse"" with Apple - I've heard numerous times it's advisable not to get the first generation of anything Apple, even with Applecare, due to unforseen bugs/kinks.

3) Firmly Android - I have no intention of getting an iPhone anytime soon (not a big fan of the UI, as well as Apple's policies toward locking everything down, ""walled garden"", etc. - not negotiable at this point). That being said, will I lose some nice functionalities going with OS X without an iOS device? 

Will the notification center/Growl replacement and upcoming improvements in Mountain Lion not be applicable at all for me without an iPhone?

4) Waiting for Haswell (Intel's next-gen, big generation-gap architecture coming next year). I want this MBP to last me a good 3-4 years + have great resale value, but since I don't *need* it now, I'd like to get Haswell if I could. Then again, I'm not even sure if Apple would incorporate Haswell chips into the 2nd-""gen"" RMBPs next June-ish...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

I've had a fair amount of experience with OS X (my parents have an iMac, and I've hackintoshed several older computers I've used prior). No particular preference between Windows and OS X for me, I like both. I just really want a hi-res screen while my perfect eyes stay perfect :P

Please let me know what you guys think!

There was this guy that I liked for a short while that I decided to friend on facebook even though I didn't really know him. I had no clue whether he was gay or not, but I just decided to buck up and start messaging him. Pretty soon, we were talking regularly and found that we had similar interests in quite a few things so I eventually went out on a limb and asked him if he wanted to go see a movie sometime. We went on a few dates and everything was pretty great; I hadn't imagined that I would ever actually find a bf in high school (I'm 17) let alone a hot Filipino one. 

After a few dates, however, he became more attached while I started to lose interest. We have a lot in common; he is a gaymer, he has a good sense of humor, and he is smart. However, we share quite a few differences as well- he is more of a girl's guy, while i am more on the ""bro"" side of the spectrum; he is not at all athletic, while I am; he isn't a huge music person, while I am; he is also big on partying and doing drugs a lot, while I am not too keen on the idea of doing anything that is particularly unhealthy to myself. To add to this, he can't drive himself anywhere, so I have to drive 20+ minutes to pick him up from his house and do whatever. This just makes me feel like it is a chore to be with him sometimes. I know this sounds selfish, but I can't help feeling this way. Most of the time, when I suggest that we go spend time together by going out and experiencing the outside world, he just wants to go to his house and make out, which is fine in moderation, however, I find it to be kind of a turn off when it  happens every chance we see each other.

My initial crush on this guy just sort of fizzled off and I just can't feel a strong mutual connection. Being a noob in the dating field, I'm not sure if this is a common feeling or not. To add to this situation, I have yet to come out to my family and some of my friends, which makes the process of spending time with him and finding an alibi constantly very stressful. Maybe I'm just not ready for a relationship right now since I have some other issues to deal with in addition to my busy schedule and internship at the moment.

I feel the need to break it off, but I am not sure of the best way to do this. He is a really nice guy and I really want to minimize the hurt dealt on him if possible. What should I do in this situation? Should I reconsider my feelings, or should I go with my gut? I know this all sounds very naive, but this is what I need to know and I am admittedly a novice on these stomping grounds. I would rather ask a childish question than make a childish mistake.

Tl/dr-Met a great guy, didn't make a mutual connection, he is very into me but I feel the need to break up, what do?

P.S. I would like to thank everyone here at Gbros for giving me the strength to even attempt going for a relationship right now. I am almost positive that I wouldn't have even considered having the confidence to do this had I not stumbled upon this great place. You guys are the bomb!

vlx37,11,2012-06-25,[FR] Two different worlds: Chem Girl and Earth Girl,ThrowawayPUA,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vlx37/fr_two_different_worlds_chem_girl_and_earth_girl/,"I'm working on a contract job, high security, nondisclosure agreements, secure facility in a bunker on a big open corporate campus. All I can say about it is is there are two sides of this gig, the math side (the side I'm on) and the chemistry side. I wish I was on the chem side, it's just like all the STEM jobs (science, technology, engineering, math) the women are all on the chem, med, and bio side and the guys are all on the geeky math/quant side. There is one girl I have my eye on, she's a manager, she's hot and she knows it (note: yoga pants are not proper corporate attire, but I approve). I'll call her Chem Girl. She's a manager so she looks down on all the contractors like me. She is a tech woman who is rising to the top and she is hard as nails.

I was thinking Chem Girl was a woman I should run some game on, especially since she's in another department and it wouldn't affect my job. Then I overheard her Friday afternoon, whining on her cell phone to her girlfriends about how they wanted to go out and she wanted to work. It was most unattractive. I figured this is a woman with none of the personality traits I'm interested. Sure she's hot, she might even be smart. But her heart is as cold as ice. Still, when I talk near her, she turns around and I immediately have her attention. I don't know what's going on there.

So today I was walking out to a break, behind Chem Girl and the other best dressed woman in the facility (note: fuck-me pumps are not proper corporate attire, but I approve). I'm about 6 feet behind them, trying not to pursue, or be seen pursuing. I'm actually having to slow my pace to not overrun them, because they're chatting and walking so slow. So as I get out near the park area, under the trees where I usually hang out, there are downed branches everywhere. It was a windy day, but it couldn't be bad enough to knock down all those trees. Oh poor trees. I blurted out, ""oh man what is all *this?*"" just sort of talking to myself. Chem girl turns back, she's kind of edging around all the branches blocking the sidewalk, and she looks at me. ""Yeah, what the..? Oh, they're pruning, must be a gardener around here somewhere. Oh there she is."" Chem Girl and High Heels Girl stroll off to their car, and I see the blonde gardener sitting at the base of a tree, pruning some plants. She waves and gets up to come over and chat. She's kind of hot in a rugged sort of way. She's younger than me but still close to my age, she has long blonde hair, she's wearing khaki shorts and hiking boots, a flannel shirt, and leather gloves. I'll call her Earth Girl. 

When I'm on breaks, it is hard to decompress. I have 10 minutes, I spend the first minute calculating how much time I have to smoke, check email on my iPhone, grab one more cup of coffee, and get back in the cockpit for more math. My mind is a highly caffeinated whirl of polynomial factoring, linear equations, oh hell I need to stop thinking about it but I can't. But hey, here's a cheerful girl, even the type I like, I talk to everyone and she's a hell of a lot friendlier than the chems and quants.

So we strike up a conversation. ""I hate to cut down all the branches but they're all dead, they have to go."" I said, ""oh yeah, I know, when I was a kid, I worked landscaping. Nobody likes to think about cutting down all their nice plants, but they grow better when you cut them back."" She's instantly interested, we get to talking about plants and landscaping. I don't notice it at the time, but she's throwing me some classic IOIs, she's cocking her hip, flipping her hair and ""grooming"" (which is amusing me because she's smeared with dirt, which is kind of sexy). She's even playing coy, holding up her handsaw and hiding her face behind it when I tease her. She is pretty forward in questioning me, she asks me if I worked here long, no I'm just a contractor. She says she wishes she could get on full time, she's just an intern. I wish I was full time too, I could use the work. etc. etc. It is such a pleasant day, cool and breezy, unlike yesterday when it was 99 degrees, we are having fun procrastinating from our jobs, and lost track of time.

In retrospect, she was really interested, and I was probably one of the few people that might impress her or even have anything in common with her, on her rare contact with those mysterious people doing secretive things inside faceless corporate offices, while she wandered through the grounds, maintaining the immaculate campus, all alone.

And I wish I had noticed all that. What I did notice is that just as things were getting interesting, Chem Girl walks past me on her way back into the facility. Oh hell, break time is over, it will be bad if I get back from break later than the managers. I'm thinking dammit I didn't have time to check my email, and already my head is switching back to Euler's Formula, power series, and combinatorics. I check the time on my phone, and make an excuse, ""oh no I have to get back to work. It was nice talking to you."" And I completely eject, while Earth Girl wistfully waves and says goodbye.

An hour or so later, as I'm grabbing my 5th cup of coffee for the day and have a moment to myself to think, looking out the window of the break room, and wondering if Earth Girl was out there, that it hit me: I'm a goddam idiot. What I *should* have done was say, ""Hey we should continue talking sometime. Give me your number and we'll talk later."" I even had my phone in my hand, and turned on, poking buttons on it. I had a perfect time constraint to give her a sense of urgency in giving me her number. I knew to do all of this, and *I did not do it.* Suddenly, I could sense Earth Girl's obvious disappointment in my ejection. Yes, she wanted me to ask her for her number. And it never even entered my mind, I was preoccupied with work. I will probably never see her again. I might as well be on another planet.

tl,dr; attracted a hot girl and totally failed to realize it, or do anything about it. Well at least I'm creating attraction without really trying, I'll count it as a win.

vlt8b,2,2012-06-25,"2X, I'm at the end of my rope (or, be grateful you don't have a life's passion)",passionatethrowaway,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/vlt8b/2x_im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_or_be_grateful_you/,"Throwaway. 
  
I'm in my early 30s. This is what it's like to be passionate about something and not have it fulfilled.
  
I've spent the last dozen years working towards a single goal: an administrative role in a specific industry that I'm incredibly passionate about.
  
My city had an annual event dedicated to it.  I volunteered every year, made my connections, expressed my interest in getting involved deeper.  I met with the producer, and told him point blank, ""I will do anything, I just want to work for your organization"". 

He offered to allow me to work for him full time, for free, and all i had to do was refinance my house so I had enough to live on.  Wow, such a sweet offer.
  
That was a lesson.  I never should have let him smell my passion.  
 
I learned from that, and I worked to prove myself.  I obsessively learned more and more about this industry.  I worked in areas where I would have transferable skills.  I took initiative and created my own projects, most of which got little attention, but at least I was working towards my goals. 
  
I also ruined my credit by travelling to the industry's biggest conference every year, so I could network and hopefully find a job, even if it meant moving across the country. 
  
Years went by.
  
I used to think it was *me*.  That I wasn't working hard enough, that I wasn't good enough, that I just had to wait my turn.  People told me it would pay off eventually.
  
I needed to do *more*.  Work *harder*.
  
I uprooted my entire life to move to this industry's hub.  Traded in my suburban house and car for a mouse-infested apartment and public transit, in a city where I barely knew a soul.  All because I'm passionate.
  
Again, it wasn't enough.  Job applications were ignored, despite fulfilling 100% of the qualifications.  Networking led to nothing but requests for free work.  People younger than me were telling me I should be an intern to ""gain experience"".
  
I have experience out the wazoo.  I've worked a solid decade to prove, on paper, that I care about this industry.  I run a website about it, I've continued volunteering, I've been working my ass off just in general.  I don't have time to date, socialize, see movies, or otherwise have a life.  
  
I have no trouble landing well-paying jobs in industries that don't interest me.  But the industry that I know the most about, and care the most about, and will happily work day and night at?  Not so much. 
  
I'm realizing that gender is a factor.  And I hate it, because before at least I *thought* had some control over the situation. 
  
It's partly because this industry is male-dominated.  But it's also that women who are passionate just come across as desperate and naive.  The reason I've been able to get ""*a* job"" so easily in the past is because I walk in with skills and only skills.  It's all they see.
  
Passion is a distraction.  I *finally* landed an interview with a Dream Job employer 6 months ago.  We were talking about that industry conference, and who knows who, and what projects are hot right now.  We talked so long, that they didn't ask me a bunch of really key questions related to the job, which would have landed it for me.  Someone else, with much less industry experience, got the job. They didn't see me as capable, but as a good conversationalist. 
  
I thought I'd reached a really great turning point recently: I've been given a few dollars to work on an short-term project for a major organization in this field, and it's sad how ecstatic I am to have been thrown the smallest of bones after so many years.  
  
I've attacked this project like my life depends on it.  And I'm killin' it.
  
But I was talking to a colleague on this project about how hard I've worked, for how long, for so few returns, and that I really should've asserted myself ages ago and not let other people take the opportunities I've earned.  He responded by sending me a series of hateful, misogynistic Facebook messages, calling me ""princess"", a failure, useless, a whiner, and that he will refuse to work with me again.  I'm fairly certain he was drunk for the ones sent at 4am, but  sober by the time he threatened that ""you're done"".
  
So I'm back at square one.  Either he's going to be fired over it (unlikely), or he's going to bully me right out of the project. 
  
I don't have anything left in me.  I feel like I've proven all I can prove.  I don't think it'll ever be enough.  I'm tired.  
  
I have an open offer for a really well-paying job in an unrelated field, for a good boss, at a stable company.  I've turned it town probably 20 times already.  
  
But the thought of leaving my passion behind always comes in tandem with thoughts of suicide.  Neither are viable options. But I can't live like this anymore, and I can't not live like this anymore.
  
I hate it when people moan about how they don't know what they're passionate about.  If that's you, you are so fucking lucky.  If I could just walk away and think that *anything* else could make me happy, I would've done it years ago.  But I'm stuck with this bullshit, probably for the rest of my life, because it's all I know how to do. 
  
Suburbs?  Husband?  Mat leave?  Saturdays at Home Depot?  If only.
  
**tl;dr - Passion only leads to pain, heartache, and mascara-stained ranty posts on 2X that drone on too long.**"

Is it wrong?",WhatDoIDo92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vpnq2/attracted_to_someone_else_i_have_a_gf_is_it_wrong/,"I'm 19 male and my girlfriend is also 19 female. We've been dating for almost 9 months now. We love each other very much. I'm so lucky and happy to have such an amazing girlfriend. It's a LDR though, about 1.5 hours away from each other, not too bad. Sometimes she gets upset easily at small things and gets quiet with me for a little bit and when that happens I get irritated but I always keep my cool cause there's no sense in making a big issue out of a small one. But here's my problem I'm having.

I've been interning for the last couple months for summer and I have about 2 weeks left (thank god). Everyone at work is great and we all get along well. There's this one female (21) that I find interesting. I'm only PHYSICALLY attracted to her. It's odd because she's not my type at all. Different race, tattoos, she has a kid and only 21. We have small chit-chats and she's been flirty with me lately. I admit, I have a little too. I try to minimize my contact with her whenever possible but some times I still see her, like in the break room or something. I know I'm not going to let this stupid thing ruin a wonderful relationship but I feel horrible that I have this physical attraction to some other girl. I love my girlfriend so much and I just feel guilty about this. I want to be open and tell her about this but I don't think that's a good idea considering this internship ends in 2 weeks and a few weeks ago she thought I wasn't physically attracted to her, which is not the case at all. My girlfriend has a banging body. But this has also never happened to me before. 

Is it normal to be physically attracted to someone? What to do?

Sorry if it's confusing, please ask questions if have any. This felt good to write out because I've never told anyone about this and just kept it to myself.

tldr; I have an amazing loving relationship with my gf but I am also physically attracted to another female co-worker. Is this normal?

I'm looking for advice on a career move, and was wondering if anyone here had any additional information or experience with my situation. I submit to this subreddit quite frequently, but for some strange reason I find the need for a throwaway account. Below is a background about my situation.

So, all through college I was really interested in the markets. Involved with a bunch of investment clubs, extremely passionate about technical/fundamental analysis, really thought I knew what I wanted to do when I graduated. I ended up getting an internship in IB, and moved full time after I graduated. During that time, my technical skills probably doubled. The broker I was paired with was extremely helpful and resourceful, taught me a lot. A lot of my friends went to prop shops after college, but I was too scared. 20k starting salary while living in New York, while the rest of your salary is in commission scared the hell out of me.

3 months after working full time, I get laid off. This was around 2008-2009. I was pretty upset, but wasn't devastated. I was fresh out of college, pretty young, plus unemployment was sweet. I started looking for other jobs in the finance field, but was told to try different things. A lot of suggestions were to try a smaller company to get the experience. Try a different field, you're young you never know what you might like. Job offers come flying in (surprisingly) and I decided to try something different. I accepted a job at a Financial Analyst position at a Pharma firm. It was awful. Experience was really good, but I missed the markets terribly. I start trading while I work. It started off slow, but then i became pretty active. I decided a couple weeks ago I wanted to get back into the financial markets field and started applying.

So far, I've been on 2 interviews, and have a couple coming up. The ones I am particularly interested in are from prop shops I applied to. I had offers from a bunch of scam prop shops, basically 100% commission positions where you have to pay for their training course. There are a few where I can't find reviews on, Infinium, WTS, and Spot Trading. Does anyone here have any insight on those 3 companies? Can anyone offer any advice on trading desks in general? I'm still actively applying, but I really don't want to waste my time if I know the position isn't right for me.

Thanks in advance.

The last I saw of Stella was that same summer we met after graduation. Boy did we have some adventures... Endless fuckings, anals and exhibition sex. I fingerfucked her on a public bus. She blew me while at the movies. We sent naked pictures and made dares all summer. I got her to wear a vibrator in her pussy while talking to her boss. and she made me go to the midnight munch store naked. No hands. Autumn came before we even knew it and I had to go back to college and she moved out of town. That was the end of it. Or so I thought.

During my masters, I was scheduled to do my first intern job at a real laboratory. It was great fun even though the long hours, the endless cups of coffee and the boss who thought I was his personal slave. But I learned a lot and I loved every second of it. My thoughts of Stella had been replaced with telescopes, books and ramen noodles. I still remembered her beautiful hair. She colored it maroon before we left. I still remember her perfectly suckable nipples that just pointed at you once you saw them. As if they commanded you to suck and nibble at them. Her pussy and asshole that had been fucked so much by my dick it was almost engraved with ""I was here"" now. Sometimes I thought of her when I needed to rub out that easy one. I wasn't in love with her but I loved her company.

I used to spend my nights at a late café because I couldn't finish my reports at my dorm. Too loud and messy. Three cups of coffee into it and I looked out of the window, and I thought I could see Stellas red hair in the distant. ""Naah, I must be getting too tired..."" I thought and began packing my bags to head home.

I couldn't understand whether I saw her or not that night. But just the slightest reminder of our times always got me so horny. When I got home I saw a mail from Dave, an old friend, apparently he was getting married this saturday (today was thursday) in Vegas. At some fancy-for-being-vegas church. I thought ""why the hell not?! I get ramen and drinks for free!""

In Vegas, the city full of fucking, booze, gambling and more fucking, I decided that I wouldn't head home before I'd do atleast the drinking and fucking part. It is, after all, Vegas. At the reception my whole gang was here. Everyone from my old home town dressed as suave as possible as hell. Before we entered the hall I got that same feeling again, that I've seen Stella somewhere. And by instinct I got into the male bathroom, got my visitors card up of the place, placed it beside my hard cock and snapped a photo out of it. Texting it to Stella ""?"". As I exited the bathroom I just understood what I'd done... ""Fuck it.. She's seen it before."" I thought. Suddenly, my phone buzzed and I checked who it was from. ""Stella has sent you a picture."" it said. Opening it and I saw her pussy, looking just like before I left and a card just like mine next to it. ""FUCK YES!"" I thought just as I closed my phone and began looking for her. I couldn't until I saw that she had already sat down in the main room. I sat down next to her and her face lit up like a christmas tree. 

""hi stella."" I said. 
""Hey. It's about to start but come meet me after the wedding. I got something that belongs to you. But here, have these now."" and she suddenly took off her panties she had under her dress. Soaked all the way. I didn't know what I'd say or do. So I said ""oh you shoe is untied"" and went down into her dress for a quick moment. And she was, just like before, all shaved and wet as a river. It took and placed my one finger on her clit while pretending to tie her shoe with the other hand. She was wet and ready. 

The couple had wed and everyone was getting drunk at the party. I met up with stella quickly and said ""Hey.. Come with me now and we'll get away from all these party-goers."" She just nodded and bit her lip that sexy way. We went out only to find a limo parked. ""That's probably theirs."" and very drunkedly I suggested ""Lets take it."" and we did. We climbed in and the driver thought we were the couple. We began laughing our asses off until we realized that we might as well give the chauffeur something for the trouble.

Like a ninja I got my dick out and Stella didn't hesitate for a second to start sucking it off. I popped her breasts out of her dress and began touching her nipples. She began moaning ""no one does like you do.. I love the way you do it"" and I just moaned ""likewise..."". Stella removed the bottom half of her dress, exposing her perfect pussy and asshole for me and sticked her upper body out of the ceiling window. She had covered her breasts but I was below licking her tasty pussy and rubbing the outsides of her asshole gently with my fingers. She was moving her pussy to match the motion of the car and its turns. She tried to maintain herself but she began moaning and suddenly the chauffeur said ""we're here"" without even caring about what we were doing. We had no idea what he meant but when we got out he had driven us to this real swanky hotel. We said ""fuck that"" and went to the next door club. 

Inside we sat down at a small booth and continued. I fingered her pussy through her dress and she was rubbing my dick. All of a sudden more booths started fucking and we hadn't noticed it but we were inside one of those shifty swingers club. People began running around naked, breasts everywhere and dicks swinging side to side. ""There gotta be some kinky shit in this place somewhere."" and before we knew it we found it. Just down the hall there were a big number of doors and we entered one of them thinking that it was shooting pornos but as we entered and locked it behind us. We put in a dollar into some kind of machine and suddenly the walls moved and a chair was on the other side. Both of us were drunk as hell and said ""whoever gets in there will be lucky. LETS FUCK!"" and we both got completely naked. And I sat down on the chair while Stella gave me a lapdance and grinded my dick with her pussy. She was so wet and we both loved the idea that someone might sit down at watch us doing it. So I couldn't take it anymore I just sticked my dick into her wet pussy and let her ride me like a machine bull. She was riding me better than ever and I got my hand around her curvy body and stuck a finger inside her ass. While fingering her clit and sucking her nipples. She moaned harder and harder. She said she was going to cum but I didn't let that bother me. Instead I just kept on fucking her and she understood what I was doing. So as she came, I felt her twitching her body. Shaking it uncontrollably and her pussy was so creamy it was almost a creamy squirting coming out of it. Her pussy got so tight from her orgasm that I could bare fit my big cock inside. Instead I took it out and stuck inside her ass instead. She didn't seem to mind and she was riding my still as she was getting it anally. ""I've never had anal while riding before."" she moaned as I kept going and I just saw how it opened a completely new world for her. She was moaning and  could keep on fucking me eventhough she just came. But I couldn't resist to start playing around with her pussy with my fingers. She began moaning harder and higher now. I looked past her and a couple was inside the other side and was fucking too like animals. IT was so hot that I felt that I was going to cum and I tried to moan it but she just lifted herself up to start sucking it. But she wasn't quick enough so my cum shot right at the window instead. She didn't seem to mind and started collecting it with her fingers anyway. And I sat myself on my knees and started licking her pussy and asshole while she collected my cum. It was so hot I got hard again almost instantly and said to her ""brace yourself"" and stuck my refreshed cock into her asshole. Fingering her pussy with my other hand around her waist. She was moaning ""oh..my god..."" and I just smiled and fucked her more and more. She couldn't help herself and squirted all over the floor. It wasn't a small squirt either but a massive flood bigger than pee. Just flooding out of her pussy and I fingered her as she did, making it splash all over the floor and all over my hands. 

I sat down on the chair in the booth and she followed with my cock still inside her asshole. Fucking her like an animal. And I came once again, not as big this time but I felt it throughout my whole body. The sensation all the way to my roots of my hair from my toes.

I removed my cock from her asshole and she sat on my lap for a moment. We both sweating and smelling like sex and booze. ""maybe we should meet more often. It's always an adventure with you Stella.."" and she just kissed me for a long moment. Making out even. It was hard to say but this was probably the most romantic and loving moment of our lives. Both fucked until we couldn't walk and people were jacking off to us. We didn't care. We both loved every second of this.

""maybe you should follow me home..."" I said and she just nodded.. ""I got some days off."" She replied and hugged me hard. 

We left the place one hour afterwards. Stella had booked a hotel room where we took a bath together and spent the night with candles lit. The next day we both drove back to my place and recollected ourselves.

vodit,10,2012-06-27,How come I read the Ask Reddit post about the sluttiest thing I have ever done and this wall of text slowly crept out of my soul?,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vodit/how_come_i_read_the_ask_reddit_post_about_the/,"So I’m sitting here reading reddit about all of these sexy and slutty things that people have done.  And I want that.  I want a man to approach me at a party and want to fuck.  Not that I would….  Maybe I would….  But I want the invitation.  

I love my friends with benefits guy as a good friend, but I can’t help but think that he doesn’t want to be seen with me in public.  That explains why he never invites me to the bars or to hang out with his friends.  He was talking about fucking me at a bar and how dirty that would be.  I want that.  But I don’t want to chicken out or be embarrassed by my weight.  At this weight I obviously would back out.  But I don’t want to.  I don’t want to back out of my life.  Of my possible experiences.

FUCK!  I haven’t even been out to the FUCKING BARS YET BECAUSE I AM SO FUCKING SCARED THAT THEY WILL REJECT ME AT THE DOOR.  21 for almost a month in a college town.  I’m an embarrassment to the 21 agers.  My bar crawl is coming up, and I just get nervous thinking about going.  What if the bouncer says no and won’t let me in because I’m fat?  I would just want to end my life right then and there.

Not that I need a man to affirm who I am, because trust me, I don't, but...  I want men to hit on me at bars.  I want men to buy me drinks at bars.  I want a long term boyfriend.  I want a guy to ask for my number. I want to shop at normal stores.  And not pay $100 for a simple dress.

God I just need to lose weight now.  What can I do to shred the weight?   I want to wear sexy dresses and high heels.  I want to flip my hair and know that any guy at a bar would die to be with me.  Seriously, I have a beautiful face, big brown eyes, long sexy hair, a killer smile, and a coke bottle figure.  All hiding under what I have built up for myself in order to protect me.

Sometimes I wonder if I have been sexually abused when I was younger, repressed the memories, and used food as comfort.  But I think pretty deeply and don’t remember anything.  But then again, why am I so obsessed with criminal justice and bringing justice to the bad guys?...

I don’t know the last time a man looked at me with wanting or loving eyes.  This weight is just tearing my life apart.  I just want to be at a smaller size, not skinny.  I’d like to be thick with curves.  As a current size 20, I want to be to a size 14.  THAT’S IT!  It’s not even that far away of a goal.  But I really need to do this for myself.  I just need to get off my fat, lazy ass and do this.

I’m also scared about my internship.  What is an obese girl doing in a police station where everyone else will be fit?  Everyone else will be fit and in shape and I won’t be.  I will be laughed at.  I won’t be invited out with them.  They won’t smile or take me seriously.  I’m really scared about this.

I’m just afraid of what may happen though if I do lose it.  Will people still like me?  Will my friends change how they act around me?  Probably yes.  But ya know what?  I shouldn’t fucking care!  I’m tired of being the funny, fat friend who people keep around to make themselves look better/skinnier/prettier.

Literally just received this message on Plenty of Fish after I turned this guy down nicely.  “Haha fuck u you fat ass bitch.  Ur such a cunt.  Go eat some fuckin ho ho’s and stfu!  Fattie!”   Then when I said, “See, I told you we probably get along.”  The reply of, “Good I’m glad.  If u loved me I’d prolly get eaten.  Goodbye chunky!”  was received.

He’s right.  I didn’t deserve to be called these names but the truth is, a complete stranger just called me some horrible names, and I’m not even mad.  I’m not even mad because I know it’s the truth.  And realizing it makes me cry.  

I often wonder what people think of me when they see me on the street.  What’s wrong with her?  She’s young, no excuse to be lazy.  She doesn’t care about herself.  They probably call me all the names that this rando on POF called me...

I think I’m coming to the point in my life where if I don’t change my body, I will forever regret it and will likely kill myself in a car accident.  Just jerk the steering wheel really fast to the right, into this big beautiful tree on a back road close to my house.   Leaving my mother devastated and guilty for not pushing me to be better.  

I always say, “Tomorrow I will workout, tomorrow I’ll not eat fast food.”  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.

Well right now, after I’m done with this, I am going to do some sit ups.  I think I can overcome this.  I want to, need to.  

If you are reading this, and know of any way to help me, please say something.  I could really use it.

voahl,3,2012-06-27,Keyboard for work,[deleted],keyboards,https://www.reddit.com/r/keyboards/comments/voahl/keyboard_for_work/,"Spending my summer in the office coding as part of my summer internship, and I can't quite decide what to two with my keyboard situation!

I would be very surprised if I could acquire a mechanical keyboard through my company, since I'm only here for twelve weeks, although I guess it never hurts to try. However, assuming I can't, I only have my Das and my Poker, both with blues. Has anyone had problems with using a keyboard with blues (versus, lets say browns) in an office environment? I tend to bottom out a lot, although I can get O-Rings to help that (after all, I did just do that group buy...). We don't have cubicles, but the offices are fairly close together and there is generally an open door policy it seems.

I'm tempted to buy a tenkeyless MX brown filco on Amazon to add to my collection and for the middlepoint between my Das and my Poker. As the development environment is non-unix based, I have a feeling I wont be quite as comfortable on my Poker as I typically am, so that would leave me with bringing my Das in to work if I don't get the Filco.

Similarly, wristrests. I only have one... and it is a fullsize ducky wrist rest (which I love, especially considering the price, but I would look ridiculous using a full size wrist rest on a TKL, and the nearest thing I can find is $70!)

I know it is kind of a special situation as I am an intern, but anyone have any advice? Both regarding getting supplied keyboard, and keyboard/wristpad advice.

/endramble

Alternatively, how to Leopolds compare to Filco's, besides not looking as nice with the rounded, rather than clean edges?"
vo0wl,34,2012-06-26,"I think I finally know what it means to be a skeptic and how to be a ""good"" skeptic.",shaboinkin,skeptic,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/vo0wl/i_think_i_finally_know_what_it_means_to_be_a/,"Currently, I'm interning at a physics laboratory (Fermilabs to be exact) and today there was a workshop that involved various people who are working together on their new project, to come together to present their findings and results from various tests.  
  
Now, I have been to a handful of undergrad defenses, a masters defense, and a research symposium, and I seen people get grilled on their work...but this...this was crazy.  
  
A room full of seasoned physicists and engineers trying to find every possible reason to tear up one of their co-workers results. Every single possible question was asked. No result each of each of the slides went unnoticed.  
I didn't know what was going on during this bloodbath of ""prove to me you are right or else you are full of shit"", but it occurred to me. This is the foundation of being a skeptic. Question everything that is presented to you and down it until you get enough convincing data to prove you otherwise.  
  
However, there was something else I realized, which is common sense when I thought about it, but I see this as a problem a lot when it comes to anything, be it science related, or some other field. 

You can only really have the authority to down play and truly be skeptical of something unless you yourself knows what is going on. I couldn't just raise my hand and say ""None of your data makes sense to me"" for the simple fact that I didn't know nearly enough math, physics, theory for me to make an educated judgement/question/concern.  
I see this happening all over the place when people down play scientific findings. The people that never read a single credible article on the subject they claim is wrong always seems to be more vocal than the ones who tore up the research that was done to make that scientific finding.
  
I think if there's anything I pull out of this internship, I think that one afternoon watching people that are currently spending 10-20 years of their life to develop, build, and analyze data to answer a question, changed my whole way of thinking whenever I read or hear anything someone says.  
  
If you ever get the opportunity to listen to seasoned scientists argue, take it. It's pretty hilarious for one thing, but it really makes you appreciate all of the scientific theories that are employed each day. Each one of them went through a rigorous process to get where it's at now.  
  
Just thought I'd share this :)"
vnz8k,3,2012-06-26,[FR] She just kept talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one has a chance to interrupt it is quite hypnotic.    AKA She is really Dr. Vassbinder,Oldguard,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/vnz8k/fr_she_just_kept_talking_in_one_long_incredibly/,"background:  http://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/vltes/have_date_with_hb9_professor_now_have_predate/

Background music: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6oUz1v17Uo

Picked her up, I was about 5 minutes early (mistake 1?) and my former intern needed to get off the phone.  She walks out the door and walks right by and starts talking.   I open my mouth to speak, and she continues to explain that where we are going we will need to drive and where my car is.  I point out my car and pull it out so she could get in.    I glance over to her and smile as my RECARO seats swallowed her up.  That's when I first notice it.  **Her shoulders were raised up to her ear lobes.** You don't sit in a RECARO seat like that, you let them swallow you up.  **Is this a sign of her being nervous?**

She asked me to pull up at the CVS and she runs in to get some meds.  She comes back out and tells me this is the best parking space there is and that we should walk to the dinner.  The dinner was packed so we went to the Pub.  While walking I noticed that her **shoulders were raised and her head was lowered like she was, I don't know, nervous.  She was holding her purse over her shoulder on whatever side I walked on.**  I was stretched to my full height, shoulders relaxed and back exposing my chest.  I was also walking slowly, making her wait for me.  

And that's when **she starts talking in one long incredibly unbroken sentence moving from topic to topic so that no one has a chance to interrupt it is quite hypnotic.**  

Her topics she moved to (for those that want to know) bitching about work, complaining about the education system, how much money she makes, the economy, Obama, reverse racism, her lawsuit, Bush Jr, Bush Sr, GM, etc, etc.  **Seriously, how do you tell a woman to shut the fuck up without sounding like an asshole?**  I couldn't help it, I felt my eyebrows go up (Mistake 2?) as I tried to contemplate how she could breath.

I sat in the booth across from her (Mistake 3?) and had to lean in occasionally since she would speak quietly.  (Mistake 4?)
 
At this point I noticed that her shoulders were no longer raised.  ""Maybe she was nervous?""  So, I attempted some kino.  I waited for a topic (didn't take long, LOL) that was serious, it was about her unfair treatment and lawsuit.  I reached over and put my hand on her hand.  She stopped for a moment and then I noticed it.  She was raising her shoulders.  Sometime later she looked relaxed and I attempted again, she was talking about 911, so I reached over and placed my hand and got the same reaction.  **Is this some kind of shit test?**  

I go to the Mens room, I checked my MSG, since I was receiving a ton of texts from friends.  As I walked to the booth, I wondered if she was even there or did she run off.  I was getting bored. She goes to the Lady's room and I stealth pay (mistake 5?) the bill.

She comes back with fresh make up on.  And ask me if we could leave,  I say ""sure let's go somewhere else.""  She tells me she has a ton of work to do.  And then she continues talking...  At this point I was bored out of my mind and I say, ""Let's go.""  And we leave.

She still has her shoulders up, and holding her purse over her shoulder on whatever side I walked on.  I did a sudden stop and looked at an used bookstore.  And I stated how I love used bookstores.  She asked if I wanted to go in.  I was already inside when I said ""Yes!""  

She kept talking but she was asking me questions about my Family, where I was from.  I was answering as I was checking out some books.  We continue to walk towards the car, and she continues asking about my family.  That's when I notice it.  **Her fucking shoulder were not raised.**

We get into my car, she was telling the best way to do a U turn.  I ignored her.  I half throttle out, allowing my R-Comps to bite into the road, rotate the rear, and hear the TurboFart^TM as I shift through the gears.  She yelps but I noticed she was relaxed in the seat.

She keeps talking, as I pull up to her place.  **Short date, except she is not getting out, and her shoulders were raised up, again.**  She keeps talking about work.  I looked over her as she talked, I thought to myself, I would love to be with her, but not if she is going to be like this.  She tells me how busy she is going to be this weekend.  I mention how I was going on a 4 day trip on Thursday.

She asked for me to call her on Monday to set up another date.  I personally have a feeling she is going to Flake, but what rule was that?  Always assume attraction?  If I do call, it will be late, and it will be as an afterthought.  **I notice that as she walks away her shoulders where back up.**

Could one of the mPUA tell me what the deal was with the body language?  (see Bold) and confirm/deny my mistakes?  What did I do wrong/right?  And how can I improve.  


TL;DR She won't shut up.  Weird body language, then ask me to call her?  I have no clue what I'm doing.

Update:  She just emailed me that we wouldn't work out.  Dodged a bullet there.  I wrote back that I agreed and I hope she finds what she is looking for.

vrnbk,3,2012-06-28,Trying to figure out how to keep going,KeepWorking,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/vrnbk/trying_to_figure_out_how_to_keep_going/,"I've been up and down with depression for awhile now. I was diagnosed after a breakdown two years ago, and upon discussion, realized it had probably been going on for upwards of 7+ years. But, this week has been one of the worst in a VERY long time. I didn't realize how bad things had gotten until today.

I have been put on Academic Probation and Financial Aid Warning for my now failing grades in college. I have zero motivation (even while on Citalopram) and have withdrawn from too many classes to receive any Withdraw Passing grades including when I withdrew from university when I had hit rock bottom before. I'm worried I'm going to soon put myself in the position that I won't be able to return to college if I fail again.

I am on an upcoming rental house lease with a good friend and my now ex-boyfriend. We broke up about a month ago, and are now battling over the lease. My friend and I can't afford the place without him, but we haven't been able to find a replacement for him on the lease. Due to the nature of the lease, we can't even terminate it. I have to fight and deal with yelling and being put down almost every day because of it. 

Today, I was fired from my job. I had an internship position at a fairly large company. However, they had very little work for me. I've automatically put in my hours at the stable rate for weeks now. When I walked in to work today, I was met with HR and my boss. They sat me down and had a discussion that I was falsifying my time sheets. While I realize I may have had a bad day here or there (not being able to get out of bed in the morning), I had no idea that it had been so incredibly bad. I am going to be liable to pay back all the hours I wasn't there. I realize it's my fault for not adjusting things. But I'm terrified of the consequences. I feel like I let my depression get in the way of logical decisions. I'm afraid that I've completely ruined my future and career by those decisions. I don't even know what to say to them either. I feel trapped and absolutely hopeless because of this.

I am waiting to hear back from a psychiatrist to set up an appointment so I can return to medication and therapy. I have been trying so hard to get a regular help solution, but have had various failures. I have had many ""no new patients,"" no returned calls, and just general blocks. I've been to physicians that treat patients like cattle, and therapists that ignore what I say. I'm tired and want to give up. 

I just don't even know what to do any more. I feel like I'm in a place I can't escape, and that I have destroyed any chance for a happy future. I have zero friends for support. My sister is too messed up to offer consistent support and my Dad thinks depression isn't an illness. My Mom is my only rock, but even she's getting tired of my lack of progress. 

I just don't know any more.

A little backstory: my good friend, Katie (Des Moine, Iowa), is an ambitious animator that’s going to a very esteemed (and expensive) art school. Despites having more than her share of hurdles in life, she’s never once turned her back on her dreams, her morals, her family, or her friends. She doesn’t have much, but she’d give away her entire bank account and everything she owned if she thought it’d help someone out. She’s the type of person I look up to and someday aspire to be.

Recently she’s hit some financial hard times. Her computer, which she needs for her classes and her unpaid internship for school that she had to quit work for, has started to clonk out. She was saving up some cash here and there to buy a new computer before next semester but hit a few serious snags along the way- her commissions fell through, the internship started dumping other people’s work on her, and – most severe – her cat was just diagnosed with an unknown ailment that’s shaping up to be either diabetes or thyroid cancer. All the money she had saved up went straight into diagnostic tests and she has no idea how expensive the treatments will be.

Her other friends (Texas and Kansas) and I (Michigan) have been trying to help out but there’s only so much we can do since were all at least 300+ miles away and pretty much in similar financial situations ourselves. So I’m asking for some financial assistance in order to help cover her cat’s new expenses as well getting a new Macbook Pro for her so she can take her classes and finish her internship. Any amount helps tremendously.

Her Paypal address is kbolte@mcad.edu 

She also has some sculpture commissions open if you’d like to help her out while getting something in return. You can get more information here: http://iron-zing.deviantart.com/journal/#/d52g4v8

The intern (which I am giving him the benefit of the doubt that he was legit) kept bringing up that Raw 1000 will change the way the audience interacts with the WWE. 

I'm thinking that with Raw 1000, they are going to do something like they did the the AJ hashtag. They're going to start Raw shows off with a big segment (good idea, real in the audience) and then pose a question to the audience. They run a poll, and bam, there's the main event for the night. They might even have something like the real time polls that were going on during the E3 announcements. 

The Charlie Sheen hing is just a way for millions upon millions of people to see it live in action, and get it going in full effect. In my opinion, this is actually a very good move. Even if it's partially scripted (Like CM PUNK had 57% of that AJ poll...) it gives an interaction to fans, and gives an already huge media presence to the WWE when practically the entire roster is going to be trending topics on Twitter.

I'm going into my senior year.
Here is a list of my relevant courses, to give you an idea of my capabilities and knowledge base:
-modern physics (basically intro to SR and quantum)
-quantum mechanics
-statics
-astrophysics (was mostly about planetary orbits,included some visual python programming)
-AC/DC circuits
-electronics (mostly logic gates and such)
-intro to experimental design
-cslculus up thru multivariable
-linear algebra
-differential equations (have to retake)
-intro to algorithmic design 1 &amp; 2 (inrto cs courses, all programming in C++)

I'm really interested in cosmology, galaxy formation and life, gravatational lensing. I'd like to do something somewhat unique nd challenging without biting off more than i can chew. Any and all suggestions are really appreciated! Thanks!"

I'm looking to, in the next few years, be able to market myself as an independant Sharepoint consultant for small (50-200 person) companies to bring in for a few months to implement a Sharepoint solution to replace whatever aging intranet structure they do have.

2 years ago, I did a pretty self-directed internship in which I, with a little supervision, researched how to use Sharepoint, and developed a plan and prototype for the company, including some customized features. I learned a ton from this.

This summer, I'm working for a different company doing something very similar. It's being billed as an ""internship"", but they're treating me like a consultant and just checking up on my progress every couple of weeks.

Given this level of experience, I'd happily call myself an expert on this kind of Sharepoint implementation.

How do I market this? Are there MS certifications I can get? I'll have my bachelors in CS with a minor in Business by next May if all goes well. Where would I start looking for this kind of work?"

I realize that most of the recruiters here aren't located in Poland, but I'm a third year comp sci student and if anyone can help me get my internship form signed and has an interesting project to work on then I'd be glad to work with you. I don't care about payment and I have a lot of spare time.

I mostly work with FlashPunk, but I've also worked with Flixel, Box2D, and AS3 without an external framework to a lesser extent. I do everything in FlashDevelop making use of classes and OOP. Other than AS3 I also love to code in C# - it's much better than AS3, imo :D

My current project is a puzzle game called Qublox, its about 90% complete and it'll be finished this week. It's already listed on FlashGameLicense.com so if you have an account [you can play it here.](http://www.flashgamelicense.com/view_game.php?from=dev&amp;game_id=24281)

**I also have a lot of unfinished prototypes that are each about 5-10 hours into development:**

[CavernDash](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/CavernDash-AKLOS.swf) - a clone of the classic BoulderDash games.

[Stickman Card Battle](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/StickmanCardBattle.swf) - a strategic ""card game"" where the player fights against an AI by using cards from a hand of 5 randomly picked cards.

[EatTheFlies](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/EatTheFlies.swf) - this is a simple tug-o-war game idea I had. Click on the screen to ""eat flies"" before the hunger bar reaches zero and click on the frog to buy upgrades.

[BoomChime](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoomChime.swf) - a chain reaction game based on ""BoomShine"".

[BoundGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BoundGameFinal.swf) - a top down game where the player must get to the end of what is essentially an obstacle course. Press SPACE to jump, WASD/Arrow keys to move.

[BreakinBalls](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/BreakinBalls-AKLOS.swf) - a physics game where the player tries to launch a ball into other balls and break enough of them to pass a level. I used Box2D for the physics in this, as my own physics code wasn't good enough. Mouse controls.

[LDGame](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53503414/LDGame.swf) - this was going to be my submission for the last Ludum Dare competition. Mouse controls, click to shoot.

If you want to see the source code for any of the prototypes, I'd be glad to send you it. All of the (bad and temporary) art is mine as well, so I have some basic skills with vector and pixel art.

vq5b4,6,2012-06-28,[request] Kind of a weird request - looking for someone with a Denver area code to help deceive my boyfriend's parents.  Details inside!,Mirror23,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/vq5b4/request_kind_of_a_weird_request_looking_for/,"I'm currently in Denver working a summer internship and I'll be done here at the end of July. At that time, my boyfriend will be flying here and we will drive together to the city where he and his family live. We want to get a room at a nice hotel together since this will be the first time we'll see each other in 4 months. Just for the record, we are both 21 and have been together for 1.5 years.

The problem is that his parents are very strict and overprotective and will never be on board with this plan. Every time he spends the night somewhere, they always call his friend's parents to make sure he is where he says he'll be. So basically there's no way we can stay at a hotel without an alibi.

That's where a friendly Redditor comes in :) I need someone to pretend to be the parents of the host family I'm staying with here and convince my boyfriend's mom that we're staying here in Denver a night longer than we really are. I don't have any family or friends in Denver, and I don't feel comfortable asking my host family or any of my coworkers to lie for me. So I'm relying on the kindness of the Internet here.

I'm looking for a person (preferably a woman, because my boyfriend's mom will feel more comfortable talking to the mother of the family) who can convincingly play a middle-aged mother. How this works is that I will give my boyfriend's mom your phone number, I will provide you with all the personal information you need to carry on a conversation with her, she will call you, and you will tell her that we are spending an extra day in Denver so we can see the mountains. That's it!

I know this request is a bit insane, but I would be really, really grateful if someone could do this for us. I'm willing to pay someone $20 to help me out. Thanks so much!

vq3n1,0,2012-06-28,why is it so hard to get an unpaid internship in statistics? have you encountered similar difficulties?,[deleted],statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/vq3n1/why_is_it_so_hard_to_get_an_unpaid_internship_in/,"I apologize if the posts in this subreddit recently have taken to an undergrad trend, but i think what I'm asking is significantly different enough from the other statistics major post to warrant a new thread.

I have friends in various other majors who (with similar GPAs, which I know doesn't say much unless I specify the majors) have easily gotten paid/unpaid internships. I have applied to over 25 internships/jobs which I've found online. The majority of these were through my university's job database, but I also searched internships.com. I've contacted department heads to see if there were any need for help in the department and ""cold emailed"" relevant businesses. The only place to offer me an interview did not have a website or phone number and did not return my emails! 

I've been searching for positions for this summer or the coming fall and at this point it feels like I'm all but explicitly stating ""free work! please, take it!"". *i'm not looking for sympathy* though this might be a rant, because I'm still a college student (majoring in statistics if it wasn't obvious), but I would like to know whether other statisticians on Reddit had experienced these difficulties when beginning their job hunts? Some kind of assurance that I'm not missing a vital step to make this process easier would help as well.

I also understand that I may not be qualified to do much of anything with the education I have thus far attained. However, I feel that by applying to primarily unpaid internships I am compensating for the lack of an extensive skill set. 

**TLDR: Was it difficult for you at first when you began looking for jobs/internships? What are some things did to land your first job/internship?**"
vq0cj,12,2012-06-27,"I, a PC/Android user was given an iPad to use for my summer internship. My thoughts after a month.",Elpants,ipad,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/vq0cj/i_a_pcandroid_user_was_given_an_ipad_to_use_for/,"First off, a little background. I have never been much of a fan of Apple as a business. As a PC gamer, I love my Windows 7 Desktop and my small HP laptop I use at school. Last Apple product I personally owned was an iPod video I bought with my first paycheck from my first real job in High School. When the ZuneHD came out, my iPod's 2nd battery was about dead. I jumped on the chance to purge everything Apple from my computer. Been happy with that ever since. I don't know what I would do without my Android phone, I have an Samsung Epic 4G Touch (Sprint version of the Galaxy S2) that is rooted with AOKP ICS ROM. I also own a Kindle Fire, unrooted and completely stock, I don't feel this is much of an Android experience and I use it as an e-reader, nothing else. I may root it and put ICS on it in the future. I have pretty extensive use of other Android tablets such as the Asus Transformer Prime as well.

Fast forward, I am 1 semester away from graduating with a degree in Construction Management/Engineering and after 2 years of interviews with some of the largest construction companies in the world and some small local ones, I scored a paid internship as a project coordinator with a small custom home builder that builds some very large and expensive homes for some very rich people. I moved to a new town and got an apartment a week after finals to start work.

The company is small, I along with the owner, another guy and a bookkeeper twice a week are the only ones in a 1 room office. The owner had been impressed with iPads and iPhones and tries to integrate them into the business. So he purchased an iPad for Project Managers and Superintendents. When I arrived, he ordered 1 more for me. Luckily I am using the iPad 3 while everyone else has an iPad 2.

The main thing he uses it for is a service called BuilderTrend. It allows the clients, engineers and architects to keep track of building progress that we upload online via iPad or Computer in form of product selections, photos and job reports. More on this service later.

Here are my thoughts on the iPad after a little over a month of use coming from someone who is used to knowing his way around a PC and Android Phone.

* Insanely simplified. There is no denying it's easy to use and pick up on. This isn't really a bad thing, but not so great either. Customization has been sacrificed in iOS in favor for the boring stock UI. Beyond moving icons around, I can't do much. When I turn it on, I see a homescreen with a few icons, the clock up top and the ""DON'T PANIC"" background I found. I am used to useful widgets with all sorts of information and functions at my fingertips. Speaking of icons it bothers me I can't select *where* on the grid I want them, they just snap to that first available slot. I feel it's too simple and I'm being treated like I am not trusted to create my own icon layout. [My Android home screen](http://i.imgur.com/EjDU4.png) reflects what I mean and wish I could do. VS [iPad Homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/x7y9l.jpg). (Kindle Fire's nightmare of a Homescreen doesn't begin to compare to either.)

* Stock email app is absolutely terrible. Few things bother me, the first I noticed when replying to a subcontractor while on a jobsite. I had put the pdf in my dropbox folder and downloaded it to the iPad, I wrote a reasonable in length email and tried to attach the file only to realize I couldn't. I needed to open the file on the ipad then select the email option...which just opens a new draft that is not related to the current email chain between myself, subcontractors and other construction personnel. Frustrated, I drove back to the office just to reply in Outlook in the sake of being organized and functional.

* Keyboard works and does it's job fine, but where are my long press keys? I can type with 1 thumb on my phone faster and more efficiently than I can on the iPad with both hands, I gave it a month to get used to it and I have become more accurate but I feel my speed and accuracy has plateaued. Word prediction is terrible compared to many of the 3rd party Android keyboards like Swiftkey 3 or use of a regular keyboard.

* While it takes a good photo [(example)](http://i.imgur.com/FVHLB.jpg) when lighting is good, it's awkward to use. One of the things with BuilderTrend is uploading progress photos the home. I was in the crawlspace of a new home taking pictures, it was dark, dusty and tight. The lack of flash prevented me from taking the photos I wanted and I didn't like the fact to get stable picture it required two hands. I ended up pulling my phone out to finish the photos because I needed flash to get a reasonable picture.

* Certain apps are just a joy the use. I had used Flipboard on my phone, but seeing it large and in charge on the iPad has made it my favorite app when I'm not working.

* Wifi range sucks, I have seen this as a problem and people saying getting a replacement solved it, but every iPad I have used that's owned by the company is suffering from the problem. Standing on one end of the jobsite I had no wifi on the iPad and neither did the superintendent, so I pulled out my phone and had perfect signal strength.

* It's a toy, bottom line here. Everything it does for my job, I can easily do on a laptop and more efficiently. I can upload photos on buildertrend, but I can't upload spec sheets for product selections. So instead, I just do it all on my laptop. Email does not have enough functionality to make it professional and organized, I can't create folders to file emails from jobsite to jobsite, I have limited attachment capabilities. I might as well do it on my laptop and only read emails on the iPad...which I do. There are a couple of things it does pretty well, such as being able to open the engineering/architectural drawings as a pdf or with Autodesk Design Review and easily view them while walking around or refer to specific details while having a full printed version in front of me. I keep notes on it, the stock note's app is surprisingly good.

* Gaming, I'm a PC gamer, I'm not sold on mobile games being anything more than puzzle games like Cut the Rope or social games like Draw Something. Even on Android, I don't play a lot of games. Frankly I get bored of them pretty fast. iPad is no exception. I wouldn't consider it gaming, more like 5 minutes at a time entertainment. Call it what you will.

This brings me to a few things, I would like to be able to use the iPad to make myself more productive. My boss would like to know what kind of apps would be useful (paid or free). All the apps we use as a company are on the screenshot of the home page [Or here](http://i.imgur.com/x7y9l.jpg). Like I have been saying, we're a General Contractor building Custom Homes and the like, even a private airport. The only thing I brought to the table was Autodesk Design Review (PC version I can do materials take-offs). So if there is anything I should know about I would appreciate it.

I realize a few things I find lame about iOS in general could be fixed through Jailbreak and believe me, if it wasn't company property I would have jailbroken this thing 10 minutes out of the box. I'm considering offering to buy the iPad from my boss after the my internship is over, it's neat and all, I like my tech toys, but with the Microsoft Surface and Asus/Google Nexus Tablet being announced, I might just go for one of those. I'm undecided, either way, whatever I end up owning for myself will be a fancy touch screen for Reddit."
vpuou,2,2012-06-27,[DAY ONE] Here I go! My no-PMO manifesto. Also looking for advice on LDR and NoFap,FactsNotFaps,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vpuou/day_one_here_i_go_my_nopmo_manifesto_also_looking/,"Hello Fapstronauts:

So a while back I ran into this sub in a comment somewhere, and was incredibly intrigued. I have been PMOing since 15, probably, and now am 20.

I never thought of it as much of a problem, I am a pretty social guy, and was even able to get an awesome girlfriend who I have been with for 19 months now. PMO had not appeared to affect my life much at all, until probably the last year.

As much as I love her, we've had some sexual difficulty. We've maybe only had real intercourse a handful of times: I am apparently a bit too big for her (I'm nothing huge, she's just very tight and it makes it tough), but we are still very sexual in other ways. Unfortunately this aspect, combined with a very emotional year for her, have driven me to PMO on my own a bit more. Add to this that we are separated for the summer, and that she just finished college while I am returning next fall, and things have been tough. 

I was at a weird place at the beginning of the summer, seeking out new types of porn and looking up things that don't match my orientation (which I now think may be due to HOCD). This was due, in part I think, to being long distance (1000+ miles) from my gf. I recently started my internship only an hour from her, and these abnormal PMO habits slowed down.

In my preparation for my first visit from her, I decided to abstain from PMO simply so that our first time together would be awesome. During that week I seriously changed. I got a gym membership for the summer, ran nearly every day, worked out nearly every day, and was very able to make friends with all of the people in my internship (the last one isn't generally a problem for me, but I imagine my incidental NoFap still helped)

That weekend was amazing! We did lots of stuff together, and after she left I was so ready to continue with my NoFap!

Enter Chaser Effect:
The next week was a Fap-fest. Morning fap, after-work fap, evening fap. I very quickly lost energy. I changed. I was back to the weird porn. No more running, no more gym, sleepy every morning. 

I want to get back to energetic awesome me from the other week! A couple times this week I have said ""Let's do it. You don't even need to do that NoFap site, just believe in yourself. And it has never worked. I don't have expectations on me, and so I just succumb.

So here I go: I realized that a reboot is really what I need. I am posting here so that there are expectations on me. I am posting here so that I will follow through.

This summer is essential for me. This internship could be a huge in for me, if I do well. I have muscles to build, books to read, places to explore! No PMO will give me the time for this!

And perhaps most importantly, it will give me the time to think on my LDR. My girlfriend is simply incredible. But we have decided to part ways at the end of the summer, barring a huge decision to stay together. I fortunately this summer have the opportunity to see her nearly every weekend, but after that, no more. NoFap will help me to make those weekends awesome. But I will not succumb to the Chaser Effect again. I will go play sports, I will go outside and read a book, I will go buy ice cream.

So please, give me some wise words on NoFap, but also on LDR's if you have any. 

Signed,
FactsNotFaps (clearly not my main account)

**tl;dr:** The tl;dr is the same as every other day 1 post. The details are what is interesting.

**P.S. I just realized this is incredibly long. Thank you for reading it (if you did)!**"
vprj5,2,2012-06-27,"Nobody is interested in me.....Hell, I'm not even interested in me",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/vprj5/nobody_is_interested_in_mehell_im_not_even/,"I just left my fb online for a full day and a half, to see if anybody would even bother to message me. 450+ ""friends,"" and nobody has anything to say to me. I'm not particularly close with my siblings or my parents, in fact, I'd say they really don't know anything about me now that I've been away from home for a while (recent college grad). I have no dating prospects whatsoever, maybe one person who I consider a real friend, ""networking"" means nothing to me and its something that I'm apparently entirely incapable of.

It makes no sense at all. I'm young, actually very good-looking (just trying to be truthful, In person I would never brag about something that I didn't work for like that), in great shape because I exercise 5 days a week, rich (although virtually nobody knows this about me as fortunately I did have a great upbringing, and I'm actually uncomfortable being flashy or drawing attention to myself for stupid reasons like that), smart (I'll be going to grad-school next year in a fairly technical field).

But no matter what, clearly something is missing. I just don't get it, I'm a somewhat quiet guy, but not anything peculiar at all, and at this point I make a conscious effort to be nice and outgoing to people, because I've been refereed to as ""intimidating"" by some of my acquaintances before. Hell, I'd say almost every time I interact with somebody face-to-face, I'm actually forced to control the conversation, because even in person it seems like people just sit back and wait for me to initiate everything. If I don't say anything, with most people I would just end up sitting  awkwardly in silence, so even truly saying that I'm quiet is a bit of a stretch.

All in all though, I'm starting to think that despite it all, I'm just not ""interesting."" I have few hobbies, and those that I enjoy I'm honestly mediocre to awful at (I've been playing guitar for about 10 years and I fucking suck lol.....can't sing for shit either ha). I'm stuck in the city with no car, so any outdoorsy activities are difficult to organize (If I could even find anybody to do them with, which I cant.) Its summer now, and I've just been sitting around doing nothing. I bounce around between different places (home and in the city and vacation) too much to get a job or internship, and even if I applied for one, I'm entirely non-competitive (my last job, three years ago, was as a summertime late-night janitor (best job ever))

God I hope grad school is better than undergrad for me. I was absolutely fine in highschool, but I went to a small school so the kids I grew up with are the kids I went to school with (they were like family then, we are all losing touch now due to circumstances). Now I'm at a huge school in a huge city, and clearly something is missing from my personality, because out of everybody here, nobody gives a shit about me.

vtfju,4,2012-06-29,"My story. 
Back to the drawing board after 8 years of confusion.",sarrybaterson,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vtfju/my_story_back_to_the_drawing_board_after_8_years/,"I’ve been posting for a while on here but haven’t been feeling a very strong connection with this community, perhaps telling my story will help with this.

I’m a 22 year old guy, lived in the states all my life, my username is a variation of my real name, yeah didn’t put much thought into it heh.

The main reason I started this is because like most of us I could use the inspiration and motivation to meet my goals, my love life being front and center. My problems with females started way back when I was like 14, I was home schooled, and though I have no regrets about it and it provided me with many things it also cut down many chances of a social life, combine that with being very shy, awkward, overweight, happy to spend huge amounts of time on my own, and different from the home schooler stereotype (we never really fit in home schooling groups)  I had no social life through my entire childhood and early teen years.

So when I was 14 or there abouts I became curious and blindly turned to the internet as a way to meet people, and promptly I became overly attached to a girl from a member based music site, in my youthful ignorance I found myself longing for a relationship with this girl I barely knew, it gave me something to do with all of the confusing and amplified emotions most people have at that age, also there were painful issues developing in my family that I’m sure contributed, my parents splitting, my older sister’s drug abuse, the birth of my niece and ensuing custody battle.

So one day in the midst of all this, just searching for some kind of relief I plucked up the courage to tell her how I felt over text, and of course I received a very kindly worded rejection. It was at this point that I started thinking of girls as something out of my reach, I hadn’t yet learned to handle most general life problems, so I deeply internalized anything that went wrong as my failure, or that for some reason I didn’t deserve the things that I wanted, combine this with the fact that I was very religious in those days (with no pressure from my parents or anyone) I saw fornication or anything related as dirty and evil.

It was around then I got my own laptop as a birthday present and promptly began struggling with porn, it became an extremely powerful drug, during the day I would make grand speeches to myself about never doing it again (I can’t let god down, the whole 9 yards) and then at night I’d be back in my room completely overmatched by my depressed state, my age, and the urges, I would do whatever I could think of to stop, even writing to random girls on myspace trying to get a date (yeah I was clueless) and when nothing ever worked out and I was back in my room again caving to urges, I began cutting as a way to get back at myself, or to see that justice was served. 

Fast forward to about 17 years old, as the issues with my family continued to get worse, I became angry, doubt for my faith grew and grew, I listened to slipknot, I started lifting (still a therapeutic passion of mine) I lost  like 50 pounds, joined a youth group, met my best friend, which helped me a lot but I still couldn’t get a girlfriend for one reason or another, just didn’t know what to say or how to act to get my intentions across, my teen angst continued to grow.

Fast forward to 20, I was offered a position as an intern at a youth hostel, interns would live at the building, have our own rooms, and take care of whatever business was required, such as front desk work, cleaning etc. After being there for maybe 5 months once again I found myself in another dysfunctional relationship situation, but this time with another intern, she was older than me, and even though she knew how I felt about her she would use me for a shoulder to cry on, and for physical comfort, she was mentally unstable and extremely needy which was probably the biggest reason I fell for her, one minute she loved me, the next she hated me, she was a charity case. It became very ugly, I was drinking heavily on a nightly basis, smoking, cutting like never before (I now have very visible scars I hope to get removed someday) 
Towards the end of my stay there I had a very short relationship with a girl I met online, she broke up with me after a month, never really said why.


I retuned home from my internship a changed man, still angry, still had strong feelings for both women, but even though I knew it would take years to recover I knew I learned something, I learned that throughout my experiences I was never in control, I was outraged, I was broken, but I was never in control.
I’ve learned that I was always thinking of myself as the victim, and that things would not change until I changed my thinking about myself, and started doing things on my own terms, so my friends, my journey has lead me here, I’m still learning, but now I can say with pride that I’m aware of what it’s gonna take to get the things I want, and I’m willing to step up to the plate and try my best.

“So you can lock yourself away, give up, forget, go back to sleep, or you can realize that there is so much more to life than yesterday.”

My notes are one of the biggest and heaviest things in my bag, and if I could get a note taking device I could downgrade to a smaller bag.

I've been considering either a Thinkpad tablet or an Asus Eee Note EA800. Both tablets have their pros and cons, especially with the Eee Note, as it can be very hard to find. The Thinkpad tablet has received mixed reviews and is more expensive than the Eee Note, but I feel like it may be easier to use.

 Does anyone have any experience with either of these devices and can give me an impression of them? I've looked at a writing tablet attachment for my laptop too, but a couple of my professors don't allow laptops."

My husband and I live about 8 hours away from where my mother lives. We are both attending school where we live and decided to come down and stay with her for the summer due to him getting an internship in her town. She is the only one that we know in her town that we could stay with. Plus, she would be able to spend a lot of time with her 3 year old grandchild she never gets to see during the year.

Now, my husband and mother have never really liked each other, but they can manage to get along for the most part. We have been staying with her now for about a month and a half and things have been going smooth until just the other night when my mother came out of the bathroom upset over how the toilet looked. Now, I do a lot around the house when I'm not working and I don't ask my husband to do a whole lot because he has his internship plus working a part time job for a pay check. Would I like him do do more, yes.

Any way, she come out of the bathroom upset, not yelling, but upset about the toilet. Right away my husband starts to yell back and things just escalated from there.

Now I have the both of them coming to me with the issues they have with each other expecting me to do something about it. My mother loves to tell me everything that she can't stand about my husband and all my husband does is ask me if Ive stood up for him to her or not.

I just need some advice on hon how to make the rest of our trip more bearable so I can keep my sanity.

Thanks all


UPDATE

Thank you all so much for your advice. I am glad to say that last night my mother and husband sat down together and had a civil conversation about their problems with out any screaming or name calling. There was give and take from both of them and they were both willing to admit where they had been wrong. i myself, stayed in another room with my son while they did this because this was something that they had to work out by themselves. With the advice that I had been given, I learned that if I was sitting there with them, they would put me right back in the middle of things. So, thank you again. "
vsq90,2,2012-06-29,"Am I just headed in the same dead-end direction? Or worse... the same abusive direction? (Irish men, alert for you)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vsq90/am_i_just_headed_in_the_same_deadend_direction_or/,"I would apologize for this being long… but from what I’ve seen, ALL these relationship things are long, so you guys probably expect it by now :)
 

I’m currently in a long-distance relationship-ish thing with an Irish guy (we will call him Seamus). I’m American, 23, he is 22. We met a year ago while he was studying abroad, and had a relationship with the understanding he was leaving in a few months, and then simply parted ways. I sorta assumed that we would never see each other again, but definitely still had feelings for him. We kept talking online every day. During the fall, we kept getting seemingly closer rather than drawing apart so I mentioned that there was a possibility that I could get an externship for the next summer in Ireland (I’m in grad school). He seemed ecstatic about the idea, so I arranged it, and visited over Christmas/New Years to set up the internship. Everything went well, I met many of his friends, and so I planned out the externship. Fast forward through the spring, during which time we continued to Skype often and chat every day, even if to just check in. I’m in Ireland, doing my externship for nine weeks. Aaaand here we get to the issue.

 
What the hell are we?! And yes… I know I should ask HIM. But before I take that step, I want to make sure that I want to know. Because if he considers us a serious gf/bf relationship and we talk about it, at that point it becomes real. I was with somebody who was very controlling for 3 years, and at the end he became physically abusive enough to send me to hospital with broken ribs, followed by a massively messy breakup. I’m not keen to get into something like that again, and as such have taken to maintaining… distance… in relationships so I always have an easy out. Not necessarily healthy, I know, but it makes me feel more secure and like I can take my time to know someone and learn to trust them. His cousins and friends introduced me as ‘Seamus’ Girlfriend’ but Seamus himself never has. I think his hesitancy to ‘stake a claim’ is an Irish male trait from what I’ve gathered (Irish men, thoughts?). There have also been pictures of him on fb kissing another girl, back in the fall. I brought it up to him as an ‘I know about it’ sort of situation, and then dropped it since that happened before we planned on my coming for the externship and at that point, there were no plans for us to ever meet up again. More recently, there was some fb activity of his friends teasing him about being a player, which kinda bothered me but I ignored as he said they were just giving him a bad time. He has told me that he hasn’t slept with anyone else since we met last summer, and I’m inclined to believe him (a because I want to and b because it’s kinda hard to get laid in Ireland as a guy lol). 


The problem is, my past makes me suspicious. I’ve told Irish Guy about the past boyfriend, and how I am concerned about being hurt like that again. And Seamus is a very nice man. I’ve met his family (twice now) and stayed at their house. We spend every day together outside of work hours (I’m living at his house for the summer, with my own room but essentially just keeping my clothes there and sleeping in his) and go out together and do things together. We have differences, sure… not exactly the same in interests or opinions, but we overlap enough to have loads of fun. It’s just that sometimes he gets slightly more physically aggressive than I’m truly comfortable with. Not in the bedroom, ever (he is more laid back and hardly aggressive at all there) but in playing around and such… and I’m afraid to that I’m simply over-reacting because of my past. I mean, I used to play around snapping people with towels and it was fine, so I’m guessing I’m just trying to weird myself out. Or do I attract aggressive men and have the bad luck to find out about it later? Or is this normal and I’m freaking out? And how do I bring it up without being a bad person and basically making it sound like I think he is abusing me or I’m some damaged weirdo? GAH. 


All of that, plus us being across the world from each other and both in Grad programs makes it hard. Someone would have to leave their home country and go to the other person’s country in the eventuality of a serious relationship, which is an awful lot to ask.


So. Now that I’ve word vomited everywhere in a rather random fashion… what do you, the faceless internet, think? Should I be putting myself out there with this guy, or should I listen to my possibly broken instincts and just take this as a summer fling thing and not inquire further? Men, input on the best way to go about it without seeming like a typical girl saying “omg, where r we in this?”. Any advice in general? Seamus seems to be very fond of me, his friends and parents all seem to like me despite the fact that I feel like I’m tagging along sometimes (ah, the joys of being in a foreign country where you know one person… rofl).

TL;DR Unsure if I should take a relationship to a more serious level, and is that unsureness because of a past bad experience or because of common sense?"

vs85u,13,2012-06-29,Just need to rant; very very long,[deleted],BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/vs85u/just_need_to_rant_very_very_long/,"The past year has been insane and nonstop. We (my boyfriend and I) have been struggling to make ends meet since I've been pregnant. We've always struggled, but normally I'm working while we struggle. We've had to scrounge and beg, and get loans and gifts from reddit, friends, and family to make ends meet. Hell, we still haven't paid rent for this month because we're waiting on this scamming place to pay us for the work we've been doing. I haven't been able to afford the doctos bills, but I can't get medicaid because our employment has been less than legit and I can't even begin to explain how complicated it all is. It's nothing we've done. They're just completely unprofessional, and a horrible ""business"". They don't keep track of paperwork, and none of their shit matches ours as far as invoices and paystubs go. Even in the contract he signed he's not suppose to tell anyone that he works for them, share information (emails, paystubs, etc) It's just a nightmare and it's caused me so much stress. I can't even explain to his parents why I haven't gotten it yet, which has caused more stress. 

My biological mother has been harassing me because I refuse to communicate with them. (Abusive family, etc). And my boyfriends family has been crushing me with family-ness. I've never had family that actually treated me like family, and now they're treating me like one of theirs. It's not something I should be complaining about, but I don't know how to react to half the shit they do. Which puts me in an awkward position. They want to get all up in my business, and tell me how to do things, like what family does, but I'm feeling constricted; it's like I'm losing control of my life. I'm not use to people telling me what to do, or what I should do. Wanting to know everything I've done and keeping tabs on my life. And scolding me when things don't go how they want. I already know that tomorrow is going to be a fucking nightmare bc I'm going to miss my doctors appointment. (Can't find a ride). And his stepmother is going to ride my ass about missing it. But there's nothing I can do. 

Now, this week my boyfriend got hired onto a very cushy career paying him more money than I can even imagine. My whole life has been a struggle, and now we're being handed a golden goose. We're going to go from struggling to pay bills and eating on a regular basis, to making what we've been making in a month in a week. It's such an overwhelming thing for me. I don't even know what to do, or say... What should be the second or third happiest day of my life has become this horrible vortex of emotional hell. We're in this limbo between being horrendously poor (which is what I've always been use to) and unbelievably comfortable and being able to afford everything we need and more. I should feel so blessed, but I have NO idea what in the hell to do with money. And the long hours and commute means I get 4 hours a night with my boyfriend, 2 after he finishes his after work internet dates with his coworker and best friend. I'm just lonely, I guess, and things won't be as bad after we move (another stress/ blessing bc he wants to move ASAP, but there is very little that I can do as far as packing and moving atm. Not to mention it totally fucks my pregnancy plan bc I'll be two hours away from the doctor I'm currently seeing) 

There's just so much going on, and I feel like I'm being pulled into every direction imaginable... I really don't have anyone to talk to... I just feel so overwhelmed. Maybe it's just the pregnancy making this all seem so much more extreme than it is... I dunno. I should feel happy, but I honestly just feel miserable and exhausted with no sense of direction or control over anything. 


Edit: I was so afraid that everyone was going to down on me for being upset and call me crazy; but y'all totally get it! Thank you for all of your kind words and advice!

 I'm going to sit down and have a serious talk with him about the money situation, again, because y'all worded things much more clearly than I can atm :P I'm not concerned that he won't spend on baby, bc he's VERY excited about that, but I think he's just getting FAR too excited about it all. (ie: wanting to go from spending $400 a month on rent to $1000+, buying the new car, and everything else) and I think he'll get it after we talk. I just want to save ourselves a nice cushion in case something does happen, so we're not completely fucked. $4000+ A month is A LOT compared to what we've been living on, but it's really not going to amount to much after we have to pay out of pocket for the babies delivery, doctors bills, and the new place and all the deposits, getting things for baby, etc. Not to mention, we live in a small town where things are fairly cheap, and now we're moving to the city where the cost of living is going to skyrocket compared to where we are now. Another daunting reality. I've never lived, nor drove in a big city, and now we're moving to the state capitol. Any other time I would be excited about the change, but trying to find a new home in a place I've never been, adjust to the idea of living in the city, on top of adjusting to the baby, a finding a new doctor and birthing plan, packing, still maintaining the household we currently live in, AND not having my sidekick beside me as much as usual to go threw all of this with me is kind of driving me mental. He's getting the awesome end of the deal. He may work the long hours, but it's in his cushy office with his interns, lack of management, and his unlimited amount of free time and fresh coffee. The stress if VERY minimal. While he expects me just to whip this all together with no real support except the financial kind. He won't even discuss this with me he just says, ""You deal with it."" or ""You work it out"" and it's damn near impossible when I have no phone, no car, and no real idea of what in the hell he's really looking for in a home or a doctor. He gives me all the decisions, but none at all because the second I mention what I want he turns it down and says that it's not what he wants. I could strangle a man. I, actually, threw a fit like a little teenager yesterday and locked myself in the bedroom for the whole night bc he wasn't listening to what I was trying to explain. Every time I would try to explain why I was upset, I'd start crying and he'd go off about how being pregnant doesn't entitle me to be completely irrational and cry all the time. He's one of the smartest men I know, and he's completely dense when it comes to things that everyone else understands. 

 I'm also going to have a conversation with his step mother the next time I go over to their place and just explain my family background into a little more depth, and explain that she's making me very uncomfortable by prying into my life and then scolding me like a child when things don't go her way. I've lived my entire life on my own, or taking care of people; having the scenario switched is very overwhelming and confusing. We (her son and I) are going threw some major changes, and on top of the pregnancy, I just can't handle the extra pressure atm. She's a very hard headed nurse, so I'm going to have to go in with complete confidence and a firm hand about it or she'll eat me alive, but I can do it :]

vs7fo,0,2012-06-29,"Am I getting a mid-life crisis? 27 y/o friends going away, no motivation, no direction in life...",nimchip,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/vs7fo/am_i_getting_a_midlife_crisis_27_yo_friends_going/,"I'm sorry Reddit, I know there are a lot of posts about this but I just need to vent. And sorry for the length.

I am 27 year old computer engineer who is employed and lives with his parents. I am a virgin, sometimes I'm sociable and sometimes not. I find it hard to make friends, or real contacts. I find it completely difficult to talk to girls.

In college I fell into a deep depression, I felt truly alone. I had friends but I didn't really fancy going to hang out with them. My high school classmates never called me like they did those friends. I suspect because I tried to be ""friends"" with everyone that I didn't actually connect but with 2 of them. Everything seems superficial at best. I was nice to everyone and everyone was nice to me, but nobody ever called me. Those that did I quickly grew tired of their antics. My neighbor started to hang out with other people that didn't really click with me. My roommates did the same.

I dropped out of college because they didn't allow me to switched engineering concentrations and thus I transferred to a different campus. This is when it hit. I had to stay with my parents because it was closest. I just spent time on my computer every single night. It was frustrating and a suicidal time.

I beat my suicidal urges by focusing on my family. I would hate to break their hearts by doing or thinking about it. That made that stop.

Then suddenly I hung out with a friend's older brother and I met some super wonderful people through him that I've hung out consistently with for about 3 years. I really learned a lot from them both socially, psychologically and from the countless discussions we had about philosophy, religion, politics and general life (also microbrewed beer and a lot of social drinking). I also graduated shortly after I met them. We traveled a lot to FL to meet with the friend that had the older brother. It was and still is hella fun.

I learned that it was ok to be alone though some of them have GFs and whatnot. Their GFs are amazing people and I can say that having female friends was something I needed after all that. I hadn't had a female contact since High School. These friends have made it easy to actually talk to their female friends, but since I've been so ok with being alone my expectations for a relationship have skyrocketed to the fact that I want someone that can actually hold a conversation with me and not be a superficial moron (while still being sort of attractive I guess) whereas before I would have been satisfied with a girl just being cute.

Then after 1 or 2 years of searching for a job I finally found one. I was hired as an intern but then grew to be a full blown software consultant. After 1 year in work, my project is finally going live.

But now I feel... numb. I feel like I don't know what to do with my life. These friends I met are suddenly trying to find work in the states and want to move. One of them already is leaving next week. I feel like I'm gonna lose them, and go back to how it was during college. I feel like work is getting stale, boring, is too corporate-y and I haven't had any real relationships with my coworkers. My friends continuously tell me to move to the states since pay is a thousand times better.... but I can't. I feel like if I do that I will suddenly be alone again, but at the same time if I stay here I will be alone because they will move away. I don't know what to do with my career. I don't know what to do with my social life in the future. I feel like I won't have as good friends as I've had for these last years.

So these past few weeks I've been having depressive episodes... but not quite like I used to have, it's just more a ""I'm bored with everything, I wish I could do stuff, I wish I could hang out, I wish I could be more comfortable at my job, or look for something that is less corporate, and more importantly I wish I could meet friends as good as they are just in case they leave"". I have absolutely no motivation anymore.


Once again, sorry reddit. And sorry for the long post. This will most likely not be read by anyone but that's ok. The point was to vent.

TL;DR - bored with everything, my friends are going away slowly and thus I will be lonely yet again, and finally just feeling numb. No direction, no motivation in my life anymore. Terrible talking to girls, etc etc SAP."
vrwxu,3,2012-06-28,Is the change to a looser immigration laws for poor refugees a fait accompli in Australia?,otterplay,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/vrwxu/is_the_change_to_a_looser_immigration_laws_for/,"I've just been hearing the news about my how own country - the USA - has just solidly started down the pathway toward the practice of every other developed Western country - where it provides a socialised medicine program - with our supreme court upholding the right for the federal government to tax those who don't wish to buy health insurance from private companies.

It seems to me that the current debate in Australia about boat people is analagous, in that Australia is the only country so xenophobic that it doesn't want to let poor refugees from conflict areas into its country, even though it will at the same time welcome with open arms rich people arriving on planes who wish to embark on the immigration process.

I don't know any other Western country, or English-speaking country, that interns people who are seeking refugee status... and it would be considered beyond the pale anywhere in any of these countries for a person to argue that you should ""turn around"" rickety boats which are full of refugees heading for your country's shores.

Is this how Australia makes social progress when it starts feeling that it needs to catch up with the rest of the world? Is it so that both major parties adamantly insist that they want what the common and misguided sensibilities of the country demand - but then they just can't bring themselves to actually implement that policy?

Christine Milne made a wonderful speech on the floor of the Senate a day or two ago which brought quintessentially Australian social mores to bear on the topic.

Will her voice, along with deadlock between the right and the left, prevail? Given how modern Australian history has progressed over the past hundred years, do you think that it is likely that we're on the cusp of a huge and progressive change in policy?"
vukua,4,2012-06-30,"Working university student looking to pay for the rest of my tuition; Harrisonburg, Virginia",[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/vukua/working_university_student_looking_to_pay_for_the/,"**Update down below**

**What I need: $3,000**

**Situation**
I'm going to be a 5th year student in the fall and I received my award notice for my financial aid three days ago. I'd only be receiving $6,000 for the year, meaning I would only receive $3,000 per semester. Tuition for this school year is $4,404.

$4,404 - $3,000 = $1,404. I'm asking for $3,000 ($1,500/semester) in the high chance a class has some extra payments/lab fees that might be incurred.

**Factors/Situation**

- My parents have refused to assist in paying for college. According to my FAFSA, my dad makes too much for me to receive any grants or need-based scholarships. My mom isn't a full US citizen, never went to college and works as a seamstress. Recently, my was in the hospital for heart failure. He's out now, but those medical bills just deter me further for asking for financial assistance. He even refuses to cosign a private loan. It's always harder to ask for another working adult to cosign a loan than a parent. 

- I am the only child in college as my siblings have decided not to go. My younger brother found government assistance to get his GED and is training to be a nurse. My younger sister has been going from job to job trying to figure out what to do with her life.

- My GPA has been in good standing. I received a 1.9 my first semester (issue from both sides), and I've brought it up to a 2.9. Considering I work 30 hours a week, that's acceptable. With my first major, there was a GPA requirement I needed to be in the 300-level classes. When I didn't get into it the first two times I applied, I took more classes to boost my GPA. The GPA requirement changed, but I had ""too many credits"" to get into the class. I switched majors.

- I've been working at a dining hall on campus to help pay for tuition and other expenses. Because I work 30 hours a week, all of my shifts give me a meal. I've also worked with my managers and they sometimes offer to give me free meals when I'm not working that day. As of now, I've moved up to being a student manager. I get paid $12/hr but that only covers rent and bills. Over the summers, my normal location is closed and I have to work catering. My hours went from 30/wk to 10/wk and that's only if they have shifts available for me. July I am only working two shifts.

- I pay my own rent. I live in a four-person apartment. Each person has individual leases so I only pay $380/month, all inclusive

- I do not have a driver's license, so getting a second job off campus is practically impossible. At least this way I don't need to spend money on a car, gas, or insurance

- There's really not much for me to sell, if I could. I need my computer for school. It's better to use my computer at my apartment rather than staying at the library so late where the buses won't go back to my side of town. Most of my furniture came free or extremely cheap from craigslist. I don't buy clothes often since I'm almost always in my work uniform. Yes, I do have a smart phone, but I'm paying for that myself and I get a discount from my job.

- I can't drop out/take a year off because I would lose my job (""student"" manager), losing my job means I can't pay for my rent (I'm my own guarantor and I'd be evicted), and I'd have to start paying back loans with money I don't have.

- I have been able to pay the rest my tuition in the past, since it was only $500-$700 out of pocket. This year, the aid I'm receiving has been lowered, possibly because I'm a 5th year.

- Next school year, I should classify as an independent, so I won't need outside assistance except for loans. This year is the only year I really need the help.

- I have a plan for a job after graduation, and a backup plan if it doesn't work out, but that's later on. I need to pay for school to even get to the internship.

Any other details I haven't answered, I'll be happy to answer your questions.

**UPDATE:**
I tried to ask my mom if she could cosign, but it looks like she can't be approved. My dad still absolutely refuses on the basis of ""can't afford it."" I really feel like I'm out of options and at a dead end. "

I have been offered a job at a design/advertising agency in Berlin after kicking some ass during my internship. I currently attend CCA in San Francisco and have about 3 semesters left in my degree but every cell in my body wants to leave it all and move to Berlin to start my career. (I will be taking classes here in Berlin and I will be getting my degree eventually)
I will be able to obtain a German citizenship fairly easily due to my grandmothers status as a prisoner during WW2.
I am wondering what the average salary for a junior designer in Germany was. I tried googling it but I received mixed results, I thought hearing some personal anecdotes from those on reddit would help me immensely. Those that live in Berlin, how much of a salary / benefits should I be asking for to live somewhat comfortably (for a 21 year old...very low maintenance) in this city?

I have 100% decided on living in Berlin, I have never in my life felt so comfortable and welcomed by a city. It really is magnificent.

Thank you very much in advance!"

I'm looking to drop back down to a size 3 from a 5, so I spoke to the personal trainers at my gym and they said my target body fat should be 13%. What they didn't supply me with were efficient methods to achieve this (but for a mere $250 a month, they will!). 

Herein lies the problem: I'm a full time intern and I attend MBA school full time (14 hours) at night, 4 nights a week. I all of my meals away from home. I always bring my food (Greek yogurt, salads, fruits, vegetables, never anything too bad except for creamer in coffee), but since I'm away from home from 6:30 AM to 10 PM and then have homework, I'm really struggling with a proper workout routine. I'm not opposed to going to the gym at 5 AM, and I've done it, but I need to maximize the hour that I can spend there. Any advice/links/anything on exercise, diet, or motivation would be great! "

Here I am, finally can say I'm an adult graduated from high school. Heres the thing, I need a little push or guidance from those who have done it. Who've pushed through it. Here is my story!

I had an internship my senior year of school with a web design company and that helped a lot. I was developing websites from hand (HTML/CSS with the newer stuffs involved) since 10th grade and a tech nut since 8th grade. I've got a (what I think) is a pretty good resume built along with a portfolio site. I can hand code sites from nothing in a text editor, and build it into a wordpress site/blog.

How would I go about marketing myself? I've applied at as many places as I could in my area and none are hiring. I got one interview, it went to a second, and I haven't heard back since the second. I just want to be able to use my skills and do something that I enjoy more. Currently I'm a bus boy and would much rather be developing websites or ANYTHING technology related. What can I do?

If it helps at all, in my area all the school get together and create an event for all students to enter their sites and designs. Out of 400 entries I won best of show. 

Oh! How forgetful I can be... I'm going to a local community college in the fall for a CS Associate degree.

Any pointers? Tips? Heres my portfolio: http://robertdelu.ca

The equivalent Mac would cost an unruley amount. This computer can also be used strictly as a Windows or Linux machine. I'm looking to get around $1200 for it so that I only have to eat a couple hundred dollars, but I am willing to negotiate. I am also willing to trade this desktop for a Macbook of some kind (preferably a newer, higher end MacBook Air). PM me. "
