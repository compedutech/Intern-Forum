7ncx4v,1,2017-12-31,Potential Living Expenses Dilemma,EponymousEmulsion,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ncx4v/potential_living_expenses_dilemma/,"I've been struggling with next upcoming moves in terms of living situation and could really use objective advice.

I currently work in NYC and commute 1 and half hours every day from a neighboring suburb my parents' place. I make 50k at this job and only pay for my credit card phone bill. I do not drive so there are no car related expenses needed. I am 25 so I am still on my parents' health insurance, but that will of course disappear once I am 26. I always put 50% of my monthly income in savings, spend conservatively for the most part, pay off my credit card in full, have no student loans or debt of any kind. I maxed out my Roth IRA. No 401k, since that is not offered at my job.

Recently, an acquaintance, John, has reached out to live together in New York because we have both expressed desires to move out from our parents' place. It seems like we both have stable financial backing for this move but where I start to get a little antsy is the cost of New York living, which I of course anticipated. It really doesn't seem plausible to find a place less than 12-14~/month per person. John doesn't seem to be too bothered by this since they make about 60k at a new job. He'd like to start looking at apartments very soon and would ideally like to move in February/March.

I have been currently looking for a career change to not only increase cash flow but for my own edification as well. Before John reached out to me, my plan was new job &gt; reach out to him &gt; move. But of course, starting a job search a month before the holidays and not necessarily having all the skill sets has thrown off the timing a little. 

Another wrench in my plans is that there is now a slight possibility of  moving outside of the US in order to pursue my new career in an internship. I reached out to someone who seemed interested in my work but suggested I learn a programming language that they use at their work and get back to him when I've created something cool. I am exhilarated at this opportunity but do not want to place all my eggs in one basket, so to speak. This potential city is a fraction of the price of New York, in which I could live conservatively from this paid internship. 

You may ask, if you are willing to take an internship in another country, why not just do it New York and commute from your parents' place? The last wrench in this dilemma is that my home life is a little hairy to say the least and the commute is definitely having some physical side effects I did not foresee at the start of my job a year ago. While I of course do not expect anything to be handed to me, it seems like this new city is a lot more financially forgiving, while providing the basic level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs to all its citizens, which is just not possible in the US, let alone New York. 

Has anyone been in this situation before? Do I put the brakes on John's plans of moving and hope this potential internship works out? Do I just keep grinding away at finding a job in New York and go one with the move with John? Or the most expensive option of just moving in with John and then breaking the lease if the internship works out? 

Would really appreciate some input! "
7ndjv6,2,2018-01-01,Happy New Years...,WhosLotus,Kunal_Chandel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kunal_Chandel/comments/7ndjv6/happy_new_years/,"Happy New Years to anyone who reads this. 2017 has been a crazy year, from new friendships to an amazing intel internship experience where I met amazing people to finding someone I actually cared for by the time school started up again but it sadly ending, it’s been a great year overall. As I write this to look back on the year I realize how lucky I am to have such great friendships and how fortunate I am to be able to live how I live but I act that way, I act depressed because I think I am but I don’t realize it cause I want to think I’m not, I need to get over this but I can’t without closure. I asked her today why it ended today after being convinced by multiple people that it’s the only thing that would help me get over it. I don’t regret it because it’s something I’ve been wanting to do for quite sometime now and now that I have I don’t regret it. I’d like to end this off by just saying that 2017 has been a great year even though there have been some ups and downs, but that’s life, and that 2018 I’m hoping that I really mature and fully realize that how fortunate I am and I don’t take for granted all the friends I have an keep it touch with all of them. So... Happy New Years, I’ve had a great time but all good things come to an end and for 2018 I’m hoping everything will become better than it is currently!

Happy New Years to anyone reading this, I hope you don’t forget about me when things change... 💕 "
7ndwiq,6,2018-01-01,"I have a problem/crisis, I made a post on u/waterloo about it first. Advice anyone?",myngorv,queensuniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/queensuniversity/comments/7ndwiq/i_have_a_problemcrisis_i_made_a_post_on_uwaterloo/,"Greetings Waterloo Students,

I'm a 12th grade student and I have quite the dilemma. I've been passionate about programming since I figured out how games were made in the 5th grade and I loved it and got good at it. Computer Science is definitely the career I'd like to persue.

Like every other Asian, I'm trying to join in here with you all. It's always been a long term dream of mine to go to Waterloo for Comp Sci. My parents are so proud of me. I'll probably get in, 96-97 average, school is my thing. Robotics team, web/graphics team, I fuckin work 20 hours a week, anxiety/adhd diagnosis and a pretty strong aif so far. I study. I can study. I can do well, I'm asian it's my thing.

Though something I've always been, even though I'm academically successful, in the first time of my life i've actually been happy. I really didn't know how miserable I was until I met my girlfriend. We're both really close and really clingy. We have a lot in common. We both don't have many friends because of our dense / problematic personalities, we're both not that attractive but we spend everyday with eachother; we really like eachother.

At this point, I just want to be happy. I don't want to spend another 4 years in the fucking library. Fuck the library. Honestly, like fuck the library. Fuck you library. FUck this pencil and fuck this notebook. I just want to be happy. So I kind've wanted to go to Queens..

Queens strikes the perfect balance of academic/educational excellance and student experience/happiness. Students on reddit from UofT/UWaterloo keep saying how they have great educations but they're all miserable, have low-mid gpa(s) and they regret their decision. People at Queens are happy, getting pretty-good/decent educations, getting decent internships just like utsg/waterloo and have an easier time getting into grad school because their gpa(s) are higher since the coursework isn't so rough. The courses at waterloo/utsg are really nice but the ones at queens are pretty decent too.

But I live in Toronto, Queens is SO fucking far from my girlfriend. I have a car but like holy fuckin shit. Yes I'll still be studying at Queens but Queens isn't the fucking four years of agonizing torture and pain that Waterloo and UofT is (or to what everyone claims it to be). I just want to be happy but at the same time have an education. Queens seems pretty nice, decent education, friends, happy people. I want that but I also need to be with my girlfriend.

What do I do.

What do I pick.

I am so fucking stressed.

My happiness is on the line in this decision.

Seeing her little cute asian smile, giving those lips a kiss. She makes me so fucking happy. I'm not leaving it and I don't want another 4 years in a fucking library.

EDIT: Forgot an important detail to why this problem exists. I'm LG Sniping, shes a year younger soooooo

EDIT2: How much of you really are miserable? For those who are more passionate and natural at programming, are you as miserable?

EDIT3: I took the post off u/uwaterloo and just moved it here cause all the comments here are so helpful, good and what I wanted. While most at u/uwaterloo just berated my typing style and language (to be fair, I was up till 4am cause I was really having a meltdown over this). Which also makes me simply want to go to Queens more."

**192,942** redditors *exploring reddit* for **7 years.**

We finished 2017 with 365 posts highlighting a different subreddit each day. That is a ton of work. The credit for the achievement does not just go to our amazing volunteer staff of writers, bot mechanics, CSS designers, and moderators. 

In fact, in 2017 most of the posts here at SROTD were made by you; the regular reddit community. Which brings me to the first major topic...

#The Guest Writer Program

[Last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/5lf1ug/january_1st_2017_rsubredditoftheday_a/) we told you about our guest writer program that we had started some months earlier. Thanks to that initiative, instead of three or four mods and writers picking what communities to feature and what to say about them, this year it's been mostly the mods of those subs and their users who have written the features. We even made a special club for guest writers.  

What does all this mean? 

First, it means that what you see and read here no longer represents the tastes and opinions of only a small handful of redditors. 

Most posts are now from the community. Approximately 70 percent of the 2017 features being from the guest writer program. (If you'd like to write one, click the banner in the side bar, or [here](http://redd.it/4hh8y1).)

Posts are written by people who actually understand the community because the writers are either frequent members of the community or moderators. You can nominate a subreddit to us, say, /r/bombing, and we might totally write it in a way that's [accidentally offensive to the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1tlh7m/december_24th_2013_rbombing_yeeeeeeeeeeeaaaah/). But if the community [writes it themselves](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3we2kl/december_11_2015_rbombing_methodic_vandalism/), then everyone can be assured that the post is accurate. 

You can now find stats on who wrote how many features for every month in our meta sub. That brings me to our next topic...

#/r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta 

In October we created a meta sub for a few reasons. For one, we can do some transparency stuff, [like monthly reports on writer stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta/comments/7hytjr/november_2017_in_review/). We can also post interesting links, [like this conversation on how SROTD got started](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta/comments/7dlm66/til_how_subreddit_of_the_day_got_started/). 

We also don't like making announcements in this sub. For instance, we did a sticky about [Battle for the Net](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7eisha/join_the_battle_for_net_neutrality_dont_let_the/). It ended up getting 19.6k upvotes and the [next day's feature post](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/7eqrfp/november_22nd_2017_rtranscribersofreddit/) couldn't rise against it. Subsequently, it got burred with only 35 upvotes. (Sorry, /r/TranscribersOfReddit! You all do great work!)

More than that, we want people to have a place to go talk about this subreddit other than in the comments of the features. Sometimes a controversial subreddit will get featured and talk about that community will get drowned out by talk about how much SROTD is run by cucks and shills and SJWs (and whatever). That leads me to our next topic...

#Behavior Guidelines 

Hey look, we have rules now. We've always modded comment sections based on reddiquette, but now we have enshrined them, and added specific rules. 

**Rule 1: Adhere to [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and all reddit guidelines.**

That's simple enough. The big thing is to not be intentionally rude to people in the comments. 

**Rule 2: Keep the conversation on the topic of the feature.**

Top level comments should be on the topic of whatever the featured subreddit is. If the conversation evolves naturally after that, cool. But don't come into a post about /r/BreadStapledToTrees and start posting anti-Hillary memes. That has nothing to do with anything. 

**Do not make off-topic comments about Subreddit of the Day in a feature post. To discuss Subreddit of the Day go to /r/SubredditOfTheDayMeta.**

This kinda goes with rule 2. If you wanna call us cucks, shills, and SJWs, then go to the meta sub. Or go to SRD. Or maybe just don't. But don't pollute the comments thread for the featured community with it. 
 
#2017 Retrospective

7nfexz,57,2018-01-01,New and updated fanfic in the year of 2017,iarna,WormFanfic,https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/7nfexz/new_and_updated_fanfic_in_the_year_of_2017/,"You all updated 1.9k fic last year, having 29m words in them spread across 12k chapters! That's 56 words a minute! So if you’re wondering “can I read all the fic in the fandom?” the answer is: not if you intend on sleeping! 

Of those 657 were definitely crossovers or… uh, well, more likely altpowers borrowed from other sources. Another 215 were definitely altpowers. The most popular crossover source was Magic: The Gathering, but at only 21 fic that's barely a drop in the bucket. As many as 1.1k fic may have been free of altpowers and crossovers, but I’m dubious. I suspect there are a bunch of untagged altpowers lurking amongst them.

The 27th Apr saw the most new fic, with a total of 21 started that day! Every day this year saw a new fic started! 

This week we saw [eight hundred and ninety-six new fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#new-fic), [forty-eight completed fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#completed-fic), [five hundred and thirty-seven new one-shot fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#one-shot-fic), [one hundred and seventy-one revived fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#revived-fic), and [one hundred and forty-four updated fics](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#updated-fic). We also saw [one hundred and thirty-six new quests](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#new-quest), [three completed quests](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#completed-quest), [nine revived quests](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#revived-quest), and [nineteen updated quests](https://shared.by.re-becca.org/misc/worm/2017.html#updated-quest).

So here you are, the year-in-review.  I’d’ve liked to have more interesting top-ten lists, but this is what we’ve got.  Maybe next year. I couldn't include the full fic lists for the full year ’cause there’s just too much. So click through to the HTML version to see _everything_ that happened this year.

  * **POV:** OC
  * **Summary:**
Twenty years after the events of Worm, humanity struggles to continue on. A severely diminished population and shattered infrastructure has left humanity in dire straits; some places live in relative closeness to the modern day, while others are closer to the dark ages. Strange creatures roam the lands, people gain super powers, and even basic commodities like gasoline can be hard to secure.
    
    The story focuses on a young man named Jordan, a mercenary with simple dreams. But dreams are always difficult to realize, and sometimes a person is pushed in strange directions. And in this dangerous world, sometimes it’s the ones with hope that will suffer the most, and be the most dangerous.

**Issue #7:** Intern

**Previous Issue:** [Outcry](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelsNCU/comments/7gcxki/storm_and_angel_6_outcry/)

**Edited by** /u/duelcard

**Written by** /u/FireyRage

**Synopsis:** Deluge was not always the man hell-bent on freezing the planet. He was more. . . mellow.

---

*Segment: A line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct endpoints.*

---

*’The now.’*

Burning, defined as the flame or glow of a fire that occurs as it consumes a fuel source. Quite accurate, if Deluge had to describe it. Yes, that would suffice. Burning was the best word to fit his situation. The sky lit up as the energy he had sought for so long to further his goals consumed everything something unfortunately too mortal could provide. 

It never occurred to him that his plan might have turned out like this. He expected some form of resistance, either from the government or some other entity keeping tabs on those like him -- he didn’t really pay them much attention. That was the purpose of the Samurai and Viper, as well as their younger companions. Deluge also expected for his plans to be delayed on numerous occasions, nothing out of the ordinary. Years of meticulous study and fits of passion have brought out the need for several contingency plans, of course. But, for his plans to work out every step of the way, only to backfire horribly? That was unaccounted for. 

Alas, there was little time left for him on this earth. What started out as a boost of energy and a certainly addicting sensation soon grew far too much. What was once his now owned him. Death was on his shoulder, ready to take back what had been lent out years ago. It looked like Deluge’s efforts to save his world were futile. 

It mattered not, not anymore. He wasn’t the first to fight for this planet, and he certainly would not be the last. Dear Storm may take up the mantle in his stead. That would be good. 

To close his eyes would be pointless. There was no difference in seeing nothing but light or nothing at all. He was still blinded.

Time was up.

---

&gt; *’Years ago…’*


&gt; “*Worthless trash…*” “*Get out of here!*” The villagers jeered and laughed as they threw stones at the young boy. He was only a few years of age, pale as the moon in the darkest night. He wiped at his eyes as he stumbled away from his kin, stones and dust trailing behind him. Tears glistened along his form as one particular rock struck him in the back. 


&gt; With a cry, he fell over and deep into the undergrowth, not that the village was concerned. They cheered, in fact, for the white demon was finally vanished. 


&gt; He came to some time later, face-to-face with those much like him. Their eyes were like the sky, though, when the sun was high up on its throne. Their armour was unlike that of the villagers, more skin was covered and odd decorations donned their breasts and their heads. One of them had a far larger eye than the others, though this was stark black and made an odd clicking noise. 


&gt; They stared at him, curious. Their mouths moved as if to speak, but the young lad could barely grasp whatever it was they were saying. Obviously, they were of a different clan, from some far off place. They talked amongst themselves, clearly perplexed at the sight of him. Why exactly, he could not understand. He looked just like them.


&gt; One of them reached out with their hand. Their eyes were full of concern and intrigue, as if they were offering him something. He thought back to his village and placed his hand on top of theirs.


&gt; They weren’t going to miss him anytime soon, anyways.

---

*’The now.’*

“Experiment status, failure.” Deluge muttered under his breath as he slammed the doors of his private office wide open. He closed the doors shut as soon as he stepped in, making sure that each and every lock was put to good use. The room was shrouded in the night, though the windows were long ago covered. The only source of light was the neon screen of his computer, and even that was set to its lowest. It would not do good for anyone if they learned of his plots. They would try to stop him, of course. 

The computer buzzed away as code and all sorts of information were processed within its units, though the man paid the sound no mind. He tapped a series of keys, unable to believe the sudden events that have come to light.

“The third attempt at a forced change in atmospheric circumstances has proved impossible. I must change a variable.” Deluge gritted his teeth as he wondered what could have gone wrong. Each step was performed by the letter. Every ingredient was there, everything was in its place. He even made sure to dispose of those who could have intervened. The only thing left was. . .more power. 

He glanced behind him then looked back at the screen as a series of names popped up. His own power was great, enough to cause malevolent storms, but not enough to shift the earth’s climate. He would need the help of others like him. 

To find one individuals would be a simple task. To convince them to join his cause, however, would be a tad bit more complex. They may take him out and carry out his plans on their own, or they may very well just sabotage everything. 

That would not do, no. He would have to enlist the aid of some more, ah, capable beings.

He narrowed his eyes as he looked through various profiles, unable to shake off the feeling that he would have to dispose of this hired help as well.

---

&gt; *’Years ago…’*


&gt;The scientists took him in and gave him a name, a name that he was never quite fond of. He responded to it, wrote it on papers, and was legally known as such. He never truly identified by that name, however. He never identified himself by the name his mother gave him, either. These names were given by people who could never truly understand him. 


&gt;The very people he was a part of shunned him for being different. And, those who took him in saw him as an alien, to be studied and observed from a safe environment. It was clear that he would never be one with a people, not this one nor the one before. He would always be an outsider. 


&gt;The day they realised that was soon coming, as well as the end of his time here with the scientists.


&gt;He did have one question he would like to ask. His understanding of their language was still improving, though, it would be some time before he would be able to fully articulate what he wished to say.


&gt;It didn’t stop him from wondering, however. 


&gt;What did they want from him? He had nothing to offer. He was but a young boy from a village far inferior to the ones they brought him to. They spoke not to the villagers, nor did they seem even remotely interested in going near. 


&gt;What was the point?

---

*’The now.’*

Deluge stumbled into his office, a hand on his forehead as he tried to will away the pain that ate at his mind. His most recent excursion proved to be a touch more overwhelming than originally anticipated. His calculations did not account for his own ingrained memory. Unfortunately, that unaccounted factor led to the current situation, which undeniably was far more painful than anything the pale man himself has ever witnessed. 

Deluge let out a low groan, frustrated at how weak he was. He reached out for his chair, only to slip and fall. Clutching his head, he deemed his predicament too painful to make standing up worth it, much less actual thought.

He struggled to guide himself through basic breathing techniques, He tried to think of a safe place, only to remember he had none. 

Focus. Focus, Deluge reminded himself. Train his gaze on his plans, his dreams. Yes, that would work. He was almost there. So close. If he could just ride these emotions out, if he could redirect them to something far more constructive, he would soon succeed. And then, he could rest. 

He tried to control his breathing, blinked away the dark spots, but his mind had other plans.

---

&gt; *’Years ago…’*


&gt;After some more complicated tests and supposedly profound results, the scientists decided it was time for the boy to leave his homeland. He was gifted, that much they could tell, as each of his mental acuity tests were passed with flying colours. He proved to be physically able as well, once they were able to get his diet in order. He was shaping up to be a fine young man.


&gt;Their superior wanted to see the results for himself. At least, that’s what the boy was able to grasp. He was not too far along in his study of their language, English as they call it. It was entirely different from what he was used to, which made the transition harder. But, nothing was too hard for him. There was one main concern, though.


&gt;They were going to experiment on him, the boy was sure of that. It wasn’t going to be like the tests they conducted in the past. They weren’t going to teach him new things, show him new sights, to understand his way of thinking. They weren’t going to look into his well-being or try to engage him in conversation.


&gt;The data they could gather from such endeavours was running short, he heard them say. They were going to take a different approach, for *science*. Whatever that was, the boy did not like the sound of it. He could only shudder at the thought that he might end up like those animals they left in cages, without a trace of being left in them. They were living, but not alive.


&gt;He wasn’t going to submit to them that easily. 


&gt;A door behind the young boy slid open. He faced it and charged, a small knife in hand.

---

*’The now.’*

The man in armour kicked the last of the intruders out of the building, each one of them bound by the wrists and ankles. One tried to escape, but the sound of the lady Viper’s gun safety clicking off convinced him to not even bother. They clustered together as the man in silver and the woman in green walked around them. Their faces showed no emotion. If they had to kill, they would. The boss only had to give the word.

“Well done, you two.” Deluge himself chuckled as he stepped into the light, right on cue. His hands were shaking slightly, and his eyes were bloodshot. The bags under his eyes made him look worse than he normally was, but he didn’t seem to notice. His voice was as large and as unwavering as ever. He nodded his thanks to the two as he beckoned for the children to face him. That was all these children were, children. 

He looked them in the eye, one by one. They seemed like any other band of miscreants hell-bent on exploiting their bodies for pleasure. His eyes narrowed as he raised his hand. Sparks burst from his fingertips, causing the teens in captive to scoot back in surprise. 

“I am sorry,” he sighed as he faced the skies. The clouds rumbled as they darkened, clustering above their location. Thunder boomed as the wind blew stronger. The Viper clicked her tongue in distaste as she holstered her weapons in favour of crossing her arms. 

“I’m afraid that you can’t be here.” His eyes glazed over.

“On this earth, that is.”

The Samurai looked away. His current master was getting more and more ready to execute rather than interrogate. He was growing unstable.

Several pairs of young eyes widened in shock, but one of the teenagers, the one who struggled earlier rose onto his feet, having managed to untangle his bonds. The Samurai raised his sword to keep him in place, but a pair of massive wings sprouted from his back, forcing the Viper to intervene. 

“Deluge, do not.” She bolted to his side and hissed without another thought. 

While she wasn’t partial to intervening in his less than ethical means of removing witnesses, she wasn’t going to allow the death of an asset to happen.

She was enough to break him out of. . .whatever it was that he was going through. The bolt of lightning he summoned did not strike the hearts of the children. It struck himself, forcing the woman in green back in surprise. Her eyes widened as he practically disappeared in the light, only to return a few moments later.

Deluge took a deep breath then blinked at the children. It seemed as though these teenagers were far more than they seemed. His lips twitched upwards.

They would do. They would do nicely.

&gt; *’Years ago…’*


&gt;They had him surrounded.


&gt;Did they anticipate his attempt at escape? Was he that predictable, too simple-minded for the likes of them despite their claims? Or were they just well-coordinated? It didn’t matter. Time was running out. The young boy looked around frantically for any kind of opening, but he found none. 


&gt;The scientists and their cohorts, larger and bulkier persons with what looked to be massive sticks, closed in on him from all fronts. He gritted his teeth, unwilling to submit. 


&gt;He crouched down on all four of his limbs, ready to defend himself in case they attacked. They weren’t out to kill, he knew that. Months of research would go down the drain if he were to die here and now. No, death was not an option for him. Though he was of the belief that what would take its place was far more painful. 


&gt;The young boy was at his wit’s end, quite frustrated with his predicament. They made no move, but they weren’t going away anytime soon. His mind flashed back to when he was younger, almost literally kicked out of his village, barely a home. The closest he would ever witness would be those before him, who kept him at arm’s reach, who only kept him for the sake of their study.


&gt;He growled, growled much like the animals of his childhood. Unbeknownst to him, the sky shifted from its bright blue. The air turned gray and somber, as if it knew what would happen next.


&gt;The boy didn’t.


&gt;He didn’t expect lightning to fall from the sky. He didn’t expect it to smack right into those who surrounded him. He didn’t expect them to die.


&gt;He could only run.

I have three years of experience and I applied to a bunch of places around my area. I have had two interviews, a place 7 minutes away, and with a place 45-50 minutes away with no traffic. The place far away job has not yet sent me an offer, but are advertising a 1 year internship for $15/hr, and seem to be also offering more experience. The 45 minute away place wants to schedule a hands on interview in a week from now, which means I wouldn't get an offer for a week or two if at all, making the close by place wait a lot. Meanwhile, the 7 minute away place just sent an offer for $11/hr, with a very friendly staff. I could easily bike to the 7 minute away place when it gets warm enough, and they seem to have better benefits over all. What do you think I should do? I originally told the 7 minute away place I was looking for around $15/hr and they ended up offering 11, should I try and haggle 12.50 before accepting the offer? I would appreciate any and all advise and responses to my situation, thank you!"
7ngnhu,0,2018-01-01,Should I leave everything behind and run off to Europe?,noro-chan,Life_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life_advice/comments/7ngnhu/should_i_leave_everything_behind_and_run_off_to/,"It is pretty much assumed I am going to college, and I'm not necessarily opposed to it, but...I don't know. I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I don't want to have to drown in debt only to be in a job I hate for the next 30 years.
I'll probably go just because it's good for me to, but I don't see much of a future for myself in the US.

My biggest goal is to be happy, but if success comes that's great too.
Where I live makes me unhappy, my family makes me unhappy, and all this pressure is making me unhappy. I'd be fine just living a normal life as long as I could be surrounded by my kind of people and friends.
Europe in particular has been idealized in my mind as a place I'd want to live. England in particular sounds ideal:

1. It's rainy (I love the rain and cold weather)

2. The people are friendly but reserved

3. Things are cheaper (especially compared to the US)

4. Free healthcare

5. Travel would be a breeze (In the US you'd have to travel 8 hours just to get out of a state, much less the country)

6. The people are more progressive

7. It would be easier to learn more languages (I can interact with people that speak French and German, two languages I want to learn but never have because I didn't have anyone to practice it with.)

8. There is so much history and culture (the US is a pretty young country when compared to Europe)

9. I can learn so much more from people with a totally different lifestyle than mine


Pretty much, I just want to run off there and leave everything else behind.
I know it would be evil of me to just abandon my family, but I am so miserable here. It really feels like I was born in the wrong country. Plus, isn't it valuable to immerse yourself in different cultures?

I don't know. I guess it's a dumb idea, especially since I have no plan, but I feel very strongly about this. I just have no clue how to accomplish this, or if it is even realistic in the first place.


EDIT:
Ok, so apparently everyone is thinking that I'm going to sneak off into the night, and that may have been due to my poor explanation so sorry.
That isn't what is going to happen. Of course I'm going to tell my parents I'm going to leave.
Also no, I'm not going to go without a degree. I'm getting my degree in the US before I leave.
Also no, I'm not going to a country where I don't speak the language (that is why I said England.)
While I am in college I'm going to prepare to leave for Europe (getting part time jobs, internships, etc.) I'm going to get scholarships, I already have some college credits, I'm going to go to a relatively cheap school. I'll make sure that my degree is the best fit for where I am going and what I plan to do once I go to Europe.
While in school I'll be researching any job opportunities in Europe (what degrees are the most useful, high-demand jobs, etc.) I'll be receiving help from fellow students, professors and counselors.

I'm going to set up financial goals for how much I'll save each month so that I know exactly when my loans will be paid off. 
My sister is in college already so I have learned a thing or two about what to do/not to do.
I'll work night and day just to keep myself on track.

Even after I graduate I'll still be working. For a few years I'll live with my mother (hopefully less time so I'm not a waste of space.)
If I don't have a job, I will be doing freelancing and art competitions (art is my hobby so I can put it to use during any times of unemployment.) I'll take on several jobs if I have to.
I am going to a state school, receiving financial aid, scholarships, college credits from high school, part-time jobs and anything else I can't think of at the moment. 
After those years (as long as nothing terrible happens) I will have gathered up all of the things I prepped for my new life. 
My mom had made it clear to me she doesn't care what I do or where I go, so it won't matter if I leave. This trip is for giving myself something real and tangible to look forward to in my life rather than just waiting for someone else to help me.

I am working for this from the word ""go"". 
Right now I think it would be best to move to England since my French is very poor and I need to take small steps to adjust to my new environment.
My degree will be in a practical in-demand field (I can do a lot of writing and organizational work. If needed I could try getting into finance.) My minor would be in something I love, but that isn't very relevant here.
The college I will be going to offers a lot of internships and abroad opportunities, and the location is ideal for such things. (I mainly choose it for those reasons.) By graduation I will probably have a few years experience, and may have visited a foreign country already (hopefully European so I have a feel of the atmosphere.)

During high school I've had a lot of experience with programs that prepare us for college and I've done plenty of interviews before. 

This is just what I've gathered so far, but I wouldn't call myself absolutely unprepared."
7ngp95,13,2018-01-01,I don't feel like I'm getting better,DroppinDueces45,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7ngp95/i_dont_feel_like_im_getting_better/,"At this time last year, I woke up next to the girl that I thought was my soulmate. It was the first time I ever felt deeply in love with someone. But we were long distance, and she told me that we had to break up because not being able to see me every day was making her depressed. I could actually feel my heart break in half. I had never felt a pain in my chest that intense before. 

We've now been broken up for 10months and have been NC for 7. I feel like I've tried everything to move on. When we first broke up, I started binge dating a lot of different girls to try to fill the void but in the end it just made me feel worse. I traveled. I got an internship in LA over the summer. I met a lot of people, made some life long friends, and got to focus on my career. When I got back to school, I was a lot more focused, and felt more driven than ever before. My grades turned out really well this past semester, and I even took up a new hobby by learning how to play piano which is something I have wanted to learn for a long time.

But even after everything, no matter how hard I've tried, I still just feel so sad and lost on the inside. Like the love that I lost cut so far deep into my soul that it will never be stitched back together. I absolutely hate sitting around and feeling sorry for myself, but I just can't shake the feeling that I will never love anyone the way I loved her again."

#Happy New Year everyone! 

**I hope everyone had a good New Year's!** 

**We have returned to our usual release schedule, with charts being posted every Monday afternoon**

**As for the 2017 Year-End chart**, we are still figuring out a good date to reveal the results. Apologizes for the delay!

Speaking of delays, the team have agreed to change the reveal date of the results for the Popheads Top 25 Albums every month. If the end date for the tracking period is too close to the reveal, the results will be revealed on the second Monday of the month. If the gap between the end date of the tracking period and the reveal date is big, let's just say four plus days between each other, then the results will be revealed on the first Monday of the month.

#Popheads Weekly Hot 50: Week of January 1, 2018 

For this chart issue, we tracked everyone's top 10s from **Thursday, December 21, 2017 12:00 PM GMT** to the **following Thursday December 27, 2017 11:59 AM GMT**. 

Here's the top 10, summarized for this post:

| # | Artist - Song | Prev. Position | Peak | # of Weeks | # of Points | # of Listeners and #1s 
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
| **#1** | **Cardi B - Bartier Cardi (feat. 21 Savage)**| NEW | #1 | 1 wk | 557.0 pts | 10 of 61 listeners had this song as their #1. 
| **#2** | **Charli XCX - Backseat (feat. Carly Rae Jepsen)**| #1 (-1) | #1 | 2 wks | 536.0 pts | 6 of 71 listeners had this song as their #1. 
| **#3** | **Charli XCX - Femmebot (feat. Dorian Electra and Mykki Blanco)**| #4 (+1) | #3 | 2 wks | 408.0 pts | 4 of 49 listeners had this song as their #1. 
| **#4** | **Charli XCX - Out Of My Head (feat. Tove Lo &amp; ALMA)**| #4 (-2) | #2 | 3 wks | 392.5 pts | 1 of 65 listeners had this song as their #1. 
| **#5** | **Taylor Swift - Delicate**| #15 (+10) | #1 | 7 wks | 358.0 pts | 6 of 54 listeners had this song as their #1.

If you want to see the points and how many listeners that each song entry got in this chart, [click here.](https://pastebin.com/1zXmLaQB)

The first chart reveal of the year gives us a fairly stagnant top 10, with only three new songs this week. Starting from the bottom, we have Mariah Carey’s LGBT Christmas anthem, ‘All I Want For Christmas is You’ rebounding from #50 up to #7 with a large increase of holiday streams, bringing it up to a new peak on our charts. 

After buckling apart due to Charli XCX’s debuts, Taylor Swift and Camila Cabello able to re-enter the top 10 with popheads favorites, ‘Delicate’, leaping 10 spots, and ‘Never be the Same’, jumping 6 spots. Outside of the top 10, Taylor is able to re-gain some momentum, with ‘So It Goes…’ re-entering at #46, and ‘King of my Heart’ and ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ both gaining 15+ spots a piece. 

The big change this week in the top 10 is our new hot shot debut, belonging to the new queen of rap, Cardi B with her second single ‘Bartier Cardi’ with 21 Savage. An interesting note with this impressive debut: Cardi B now holds the popheads record for the lowest amount of points for a number 1 debut on our charts, with only 557.0 pts. 

Charli XCX holds tight to over half of the top 10 this week again, claiming 3 spots in the top 5, and 3 in the bottom half. 
 
* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #1. Cardi B – Bartier Cardi (feat. 21 Savage)	
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #13. Ariana Grande – Santa Tell Me
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #7. Mariah Carey – All I Want For Christmas is You (+43)  
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #50. Eminem – River (feat. Ed Sheeran) (-18)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs:

Christmas struck /r/popheads this past week, with two large Christmas songs making appearances outside of the top 10, at number 13 we have Ariana Grande’s ‘Santa Tell Me’ re-entering the chart, and at number 49 Wham!’s Christmas favorite, ‘Last Christmas’ debuting. Don’t get used to this small holiday presence, this next week will have only three days of tracking during December, with the rest all post-holidays.

This week’s chart featured a lot of turnover and re-entering songs, a stark contrast compared to last week’s complete lack of re-entries. A total of 13 songs re-entered this week, these songs ranged from the likes of Ariana Grande’s Into You, re-entering at number 48, or Lorde’s ‘Homemade Dynamite’ blasting back to number 28. 

With a stagnant release week this coming tracking period, I’d expect another week of movement next week, with several songs falling out, and other long-time favorites going for a second wind and either re-entering or crawling up a few spots.

7nhfb3,1,2018-01-01,Huma Abedin: An Alternative Theory,BudRock56,freeworldnews,https://www.reddit.com/r/freeworldnews/comments/7nhfb3/huma_abedin_an_alternative_theory/,"The Evidence. Huma has a well known interest in fashion. She recently posed in a fashion shoot. The only time she consents to speak to the press is about fashion and her past failed attempts to rehabilitate her husband’s character (and, therefore, her own). Further connection to the shallow side is the fact that Georgina Weinstein sought out Huma for comfort after she left her scumbag rapist hubby, Harvey Weinstein. 

Further, listen to Huma speak... her manner, her emotion, her cadence, her choice of words. She sounds like an immature girl. And why should we expect anything different? She was spawned from Muslim parents who favor sharia. She has lived a sheltered life under Hillary’s black wings since she was 19 years old. All accounts support the narrative that Huma had no social life. She had to basically be pushed hard to go on a date with Anthony Weiner. By most accounts that first date was a train wreck. 

Why did Huma marry Weiner? Without getting into conspiratorial nuttiness, I will just point out that most confident chicks do not marry and have kids with degenerate sexual predators. Either Huma was unsophisticated in matters of the heart or she, or someone influencing her, felt that the marriage served some utility. Also of note, and in my humble opinion, feminism is not needed by strong and self-confident women. Rather, feminist ideology is the crutch of the downtrodden woman. It exists to remedy perceived victimhood. Both Hillary and Huma are devout feminists. Despite popular western culture valuing this as heroism, the psychological dynamics in pro-active feminism suggest that this behavior is an implicit admission of personal failure (whether past or ongoing, that is a variable from person to person). 

As John pointed out, after the State Department emails and documents showed up on Weiner’s laptop, prompting Comey to reopen the Clinton investigation just days before the 2016 presidential election, there was a behind-the-scenes Campaign Photo on a plane showing Huma red eyed from crying. Hillary shunned Huma after this. In fact, I strongly suspect that despite any affection that appeared to exist between Hillary and Huma (I assume there was some affection given how close they appeared to be) Hillary is emotionally defective. This vile and despicable bitch would sell her own daughter and grandchild into human slavery to Persians if she thought it would get her into the White House. Thus, Hillary’s actual affection for Huma was over when her political life ended. 

The ultimate frustration in America’s body politic today is that the voting public watches these borderline sociopaths, sexual predators, anti-American radicals, and crooks take positions of power, and even get close to the ultimate seat of power,  yet we feel unable to stop this abuse of the Republic and The People even though the Constitution is supposed to vest real power in The People. Other nations and anti-American factions see this too, even if they are unable to articulate it. Their animalistic will to power compels them to focus on this point of weakness like a wolf stalking a herd of elk focuses on the sick and young stragglers. 

I submit that Huma Abedin May be an innocent, to the degree that anyone around Hillary Clinton may be considered such. Truth is, some acceptance of graft and corruption is tolerable with Huma since she stayed with Hillary so long. But, is Huma’s own corruption a character flaw or a cultural flaw? Moral ideology among Muslims is vastly different than what Americans are familiar with. Among Middle Eastern Muslims, back stabbing, bribery and theft is part of politics. It is to be expected. Therefore, with Huma’s ethical handicap and naivety, it is hard to imagine anyone else better suited to serve in the role of Hillary’s right hand. Of course, Hillary’s phony sage and grandmotherly guidance helped direct and solidify Huma’s allegiance. 

Thus, when I say that Huma May be an innocent, I mean that I think it is possible that she undertook this life out of her own self interest and not as some sort of plot to infiltrate the American political power structure. Hillary is the master manipulator. Huma was little more than a doe-eyed child when she became a White House intern. Given her sheltered life, complete ineptitude in maintaining a personal life within the expectations of western culture, the bizarre juxtaposition between political life and her fascination with fashion, and the complete destruction of her life after Hillary’s defeat, I think there is sufficient evidence upon which to make a reasonable inference that Huma is a naive and emotionally immature woman who donated her life to a master (like a good Muslim woman) only to have freedom forced upon her when the master was slain. 

Of course, my thoughts on this should not be read as an attempt to mitigate Huma’s role, nor her near ascension to the White House as Chief Of Staff or whatever position Hillary awarded her with. She is still a Muslim from a family with ties to sketchy people. Moreover, as a morally flawed individual who is naive, she is the perfect target for foreign agents to attempt to influence.  Also, Huma would exert tremendous influence in a Hillary Clinton administration. The dirty bitch is ill. Who knows how many days there would be when Hillary could not even get out of bed. Having a young, naive, unelected Muslim running our White House is unthinkable. That our republic even got this close to such an occurrence should frighten everybody. Foreign adversaries saw this too. They know our Achilles Heal. Finally, the fact that Huma is a Muslim has to be taken into account. A lot of moderate Muslims take on a more hardcore Islamic mindset as they get older. Given that Huma had been mistreated by Anthony (and Hillary too, as she surely would come to learn), she was ripe for a self-affirming swing to conservative morality. But with Huma, this means conservative Islam. While my next comment will be construed as racist by many, I make it anyway, to wit: Islam cannot effectively coexist with our constitutional republic. Muslims themselves feel this way. Thus, why should we feel any differently? Accepting large-scale Muslim immigration into the USA will destroy our republic. Only those ignorant of the contents of the Koran would believe differently. Huma could very well have been the gatekeeper letting in the enemy to destroy our republic, whether she set out intending to be or not. It would not be within Huma’s official duties to do this, but she could certainly play a big role in getting it done.

7nhrbq,4,2018-01-01,[OTHER] Short intro to a new book I'm writing. YA-ish novel about a college guy with depression.,SuperCoolPizza,writingcritiques,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/7nhrbq/other_short_intro_to_a_new_book_im_writing_yaish/,"When I was a kid, I remember playing outside just about every day.  The house I grew up in was right next to my elementary school, which meant the park we used for recess was also nearby.  After school, I would play outside with the other kids, even though I was kind of shy, I still participated in their games.  We would play games where we pretended to be people who did all kinds of wonderful things.  I remember pretending to be a firefighter, Spider-Man, a famous genius scientist who could invent all kinds of crazy gadgets, and an archeologist who traveled around the world in search of rare dinosaur fossils.  Those are some of the best memories I have, but like all good things those days in the park had to come to an end.  The only kid from those days I still keep in contact with is my best friend Scott, the others grew apart from me as soon as middle school cliques started to form.
I never pretend to be a programmer at any point when I was younger, but that’s what I ended up becoming.  I often think that my child self would find my choices to be lame.  Child me used to be so optimistic and wanted to make a huge difference in the world, but reality struck me as I got older and now I opted to be a code lackey.

Not that I dislike being a programmer.  I enjoy solving problems, and it definitely tests me; but I feel like I just coasted into this life and that I only choose to do a STEM major just because it was safe.  I’m from Huntsville, Alabama, the Rocket City, it’s all about STEM and so it was an obvious choice of what I should do.

Maybe I’m too young to feel this way, or maybe it’s a quarter life crisis; I’m not entirely sure.  I’m 22 years old, have a good internship in my field, I make enough money to live comfortably on my own, and I have a 3.8 GPA from UAH (University of Alabama Huntsville, aka University of Awkward Humans, aka University at Home).  Most people my age will say I have it made, so why don’t I feel like I do?

With only one more year to graduation, I think it’s a little late to change paths.  I already tried business the first year, and after determining that wasn’t for me I went straight to computer science.  The job prospects are great and I don’t mind programming so it is safe.  I think most people give up on their passions to do something safe, and to be honest I have no idea what I’m passionate about anyways.  I didn’t declare a major until my sophomore year.

So, that’s a little bit about me.  Nothing majorly wrong with life, so why do I feel kind of down?  It’s probably just a silly phase, so it should pass shortly.  In fact, next week the fall semester starts, which is good; I look forward to fresh starts.

7ni1dt,4,2018-01-01,"Broke and alone (only family is abusive mother). I'm an aspiring Software Developer, but I can't pay to continue college. What should I do?",BigglesWerth,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ni1dt/broke_and_alone_only_family_is_abusive_mother_im/,"**Where I am financially:**
I'm 24 years old. I live in New Jersey. I'm on SSD which is near 800$ / month, I'm renting a room at about 500$/month, barely getting by with help of food bank. I have less than 200$ in savings right now. I have no family besides an abusive mother who rarely supports me in anyway and a grandmother in a nursing home.

**Where I am with education:**
I have about 70 credits towards a degree, I was aiming for a Computer Science degree but I have no way to pay for college now. I also taught myself a lot about programming independently. My last real semester at college was in fall 2014. However, I did take 1 class at Rutgers last semester fall 2017 (Computer Architecture). I got an A in the class. I paid for that course with gift money from my 95 year old grandmother (about 2k). It was all my savings. Probably was not a wise decision. 

**How I got to this point:**
I lived with an abusive mother most of my life. When college started for me, I did well for about 2.5-3years. I took federal loans to pay for college. Then I got sick, and had to move back in with my abusive mother. Worsened depression followed because I was living with an abusive mother, and I felt stuck there and stayed there for too long. Once I got approved for SSD early this year, I was able to rent a room away from my abusive mother, but I'm struggling to get by.

**Why I can't get federal loans now:**
I could lose my SSD which is my lifeline, by applying for federal loans. I would also regain the debt of my previous loans which had been forgiven, but that would happen anyway if I start making substantial income. The loans amount to 16k. Additionally, when I left college because I became sick in 2014, I left during the semester past the point of withdrawal, so some classes turned to F's which ruined my GPA (which had been good before this point). According the financial aid office at Rutgers, I am also ineligible for aid because of my GPA. 

**How I tried to get a job:**
I must have applied to like 100 software positions around me using websites like Dice, both jobs and internships. My resume mainly makes use of my listed programming skills and my personal project experience, as I have no work experience or a degree. I was only called on to do 2 interviews from all those applications, both were for internship. One of the internships was unpaid for college credit (college credit that you still have to pay for). I did the interview anyway for experience, but essentially declined after that. The other internship is paid but it's only for the summer of 2018, and I'm still in the interview process so I may or may not get it.

**Ideas going forward:**
Rutgers Computer Science is overcrowded, so I couldn't even register for the courses I wanted to take this semester. I may be able to still register if I work for special permissions, but I don't see the point if I can't even find a way to pay for the courses. I wonder if I could scramble to get private loans (which I haven't looked at before) to pay for a few classes this semester, but I also wonder if that route is even worth it. The reality is... I taught myself more out of school than in school with programming, but I have zero luck applying for jobs with no degree on my resume.

**TL;DR**
My goal is to upgrade my living situation as soon as possible while still looking out for the long run. I am barely getting by how I am living right now. I am half way to a Computer Science degree but have no way to pay to continue college. I may be able to take out private loans if I explore that option but I don't know if it's worth it. I wonder if there is a different career in technology besides software developer that might get me started quicker. Thoughts and advice are appreciated. "

Not sure how to word this without bitching about my problems; maybe you guys can give me a few pointers to deal with this and where to start:

Living situation: living in a strict Christian family; been fed the blue-pill since I was a kid, mostly forced into religion, I never questioned it and did as I've been told. 4 years back I thought all women are good, everyone, falls in love, dates each other and eventually get married. Eventually took a sharp turn and went head first into reality.

Did very average in high school and ended up going to college from home; commuter. It took a while for me to get my head on track; I was a video game, porn addict, that was scared to look anyone in the eye.

Went in the completely opposite direction and made a better man out of myself and it took a lot of work to get there. Went into the STEM field and become really successful in scoring internships.

Social life: Non existent, I spent so much time on improving myself and getting myself up to speed by studying, learning programming languages, I never got to make many friends; had a strict upbringing and my family wouldn't let me leave the house past 12am. Yea I get that; we are all brought up different; that's what makes a man who he is.

Have had a few nearly attempted suicides and I'm on medication for that. I go to the gym on a regular basis; shits been doing wonders. I love sex like any man; but this empty drowned feeling comes back right afterwards. "

Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

7nj8q7,1,2018-01-01,M4A - TV Comedies (and other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7nj8q7/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development*, and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them. With the first two, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be had with the unique structures, recurring gags, and one-off characters.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

I have an older brother who needs to be taken care of 24/7 and she leaves him home with me all of the time. I’m like his nanny to her or something. 
Yesterday, she guilt tripped me into coming home to “spend quality time together”, but left to go to the casino ~30min after I got home and not once did she try to “spend quality time together” when I was home. 
It’s been 24hours now and nmom is still not home. I’ve called her like 5 times, but it’s always “oh I’ll be home in a bit”. The most recent time I called her, she basically said that I didn’t care about her because she only goes out to gamble when my relatives are over for the holidays.
This definitely isn’t the first time she’s tried making me feel bad for her irresponsible behavior. Everything’s always “oh you don’t care about me” or “this is the only time I have fun” or “I raised you and this is what you do to me?”.
I remember about two or three times she’s neglected us to go gambling for a couple days on end, but it’s never her fault because she’s so stressed and if we loved her we’d let her have time for herself. /s
I want to go NC on her so bad, but I’m not able to provide for myself financially until my internship starts in March. I’m trying to get a job in the meantime, but she also pays for my phone bill and my car. It fucking sucks and I just want her to stop being part of our lives. It’s obvious that she only keeps my brother around for the financial benefits and I just want to get him away from her for my selfish reason of wanting her to get what she deserves. She’s a low income manicurist(buys her certification) that just thinks her kids are a means to an end. I used to think that I was going to be willing to take care of her in her old age, but definitely not. I was stupid to think she could get over herself for her kids."
7nki4z,1,2018-01-02,23[t4A] Looking to be corrupted with a detailed and sensual tale.,MystiChase,TransformationRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransformationRP/comments/7nki4z/23t4a_looking_to_be_corrupted_with_a_detailed_and/,"Hello!

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.

7nky3n,20,2018-01-02,I am afraid of the future because I feel that now I'm too lazy. Is there anyone who feels the same?,cherishperish,TooAfraidToAsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/7nky3n/i_am_afraid_of_the_future_because_i_feel_that_now/,"Hello everyone,

this is a topic that I feel ashamed to talk about. I'm 21 years old and about to finish my bachelor's degree in economics and business.
My problem is that I feel that I'm very lazy right now and I fear that my laziness will end as soon as I get a job. I have never really worked in my life as my parents support me financially and I have a very low GPA, because I don't learn. All I do is go to the gym and sit in front of my Computer procrastinating everything.

I simply feel bad because of two things: The first is that I compare my life to that of my ""successful"" peers and the second is that I feel that my life will change radically forever after finding a job. So let me clarify the two points that I mentioned.

First, I don't have any friends, I never had, and I don't have a girlfriend and also never had one. I know that I shouldn't compare my life with that of other people my age or generally living in similar situations, but nonetheless I do. I see that most people my age have friends, go partying every weekend (I don't like partying tbh), have a significant other, have to volunteer work, do sports, do trips with their family and friends, have a job and attend university, while I do nothing of the above mentioned. I simply feel inferior to them, I feel that I miss out so many things in my life that I will never be able to do in the future. I don't even know how to properly interact with people, I mean I really really HATE social events, I despise them, I do everything I can to avoid them, but when I have to attend an event, I can have some small talk with people, but it never goes further than that. However, I'm not even interested in having any further contact with other people.

Now to the second point: As I have mentioned my GPA is not good, I will have difficulties finding a job. I had a short internship for 3 months in tax consultancy and it was awful, I was the only man with 5 women who were talking about me behind my back, they were only talking about manicure and the boss was choleric, I was really happy when I finished my internship. My fear is that my future job could look like this again, but it wouldn't be for 3 months, but for 3 years at least and I won't have the possibility to change it, because nobody wants me because of my low GPA. It seems to be a vicious circle.

A new job will have to take me out of my comfort zone: I have to go to work early and come home late. I consider home to be the only place where I feel really safe. So having to leave home for so long and having to sit with other people in one office or even one room for 8 hours a day, 5 days a weak, for the rest of my life is literally like hell to me. I wish to become self-employed one day where I can be my own boss and do the work for myself, if possible working from home.

The idea that by 30-35 I have to be married and have 1 or 2 children is discomforting, even agonizing. I can barely take care of myself, how should I take care of my wife, my children and my job at the same time? This is way too much to bear.

Honestly, I don't know what I expect you to say, probably you will call me a lazy person who is responsible for his own misery, but I don't care. Do you know someone who was at the same situation like me? Can you give me any advice?

In the months we had been together, things stayed tame. Condoms were used religiously, the standard position was missionary and very little talking was involved. The sex was positively Protestant in its plainness. If I could describe our bedroom experience using a color, it would be beige.

After a late period scare one month, we talked it over and decided we should be extra safe and use hormonal BC in addition to condoms. A week later, she had implanon put in. According to the doctor, due to the timing of the procedure we were to use protection for at least three weeks, if not more. Fully warned, we resumed our sex lives as normal.

A week or so later, we had a bit to drink and went to bed frisky. I don't know if it was the couple of glasses of wine we had, but she was less inhibited than usual. She was rarely very active, but that day she was grinding and moaning aggressively. 

After some manual foreplay and a few minutes of teasing her clit with my tongue, I put on a condom and we began the act. She was wonderfully tight and was dripping wet more than I had ever felt before. She pushed her hips against me with unusual vigor, and I could feel her wet labia against the bare skin at the base of my shaft. 

After a few minutes of kissing and soft thrusting, I felt her hand reach down and grab my cock. With one quick move, she slid the condom off and began stroking me slowly. She was looking into my eyes and smiling a bit. ""What do you want to do?"" I asked.

""I figured we could try it out a bit without a condom. I'm on BC now after all.""

""We're still not safe though, right? Three weeks? It's been like five days?""

""We'll just try for a bit. You can hold back for a few, right?""

""Sure, we can try"" I said as she slid me in. Just as I pushed past her labia minora, I heard her gasp quietly. I was not ready for her either. The feeling of skin on skin was more intense than I ever imagined. I. felt. everything. The ripples in her vaginal wall, the wetness running down my shaft, the folds of her clit against my pubic mound.... it was all so intense.

Gingerly, we started fucking the way nature intended. She was face down on the bed with her hips raised. She had these beautiful freckles on her back that I focused on as I slid in and out of her. She pushed back into me rhythmically, quickening the cadence with each stroke. I put my hand on her shoulder for additional leverage as we progressed from soft lovemaking to raw, animalistic fucking. 

After a half hour or so, I was getting too close to continue. I withdrew and kissed her on the back while rubbing her clit with my index finger. Teasing her while stimulating her clit had always been a quick way to get her close to climax. In a few minutes, she was thrusting onto my fingers and moaning with every movement of my hand.

Suddenly, she put her hips back down on the bed, rolled over and pulled me close for a kiss. With her tongue still tasting mine, she moved herself under me and guided me into her. I felt a little pang of fear as I realized that I was pretty close to orgasm and that she could be fertile. I did some mental math as I tried not to think about what her tight pussy was doing with my already-dripping precum.

I thought hard: Her period was seven days before she got the implant, and it had been what, five.....maybe six days since then? Assuming the BC had not taken full effect yet, she was almost certainly ovulating. ""Fuck, I could knock her up"" I thought as she bounced on me. She was dangerous, fertile and I was really, really close.

""I think we should be careful"" I said in a pleasure-strained voice. ""I'll pull out soon, okay?"" 

""Mmm, yeah, okay"" she replied. She was not looking at me when she spoke, and the words felt half-hearted. At the time I thought she was lost in the moment. 

As before, the tempo increased with each stroke, and I was soon back to thrusting with vigor. I felt a shiver as I drew closer to climax. My testes retracted up a centimeter of so, giving me the first sign of an approaching orgasm.

""I'm close to cumming!"" 

I pulled back.

She looked up at me with a smile and wrapped her legs around the small of my back, loosely at first. ""Mhmm"" she said.

At this second, she was wetter than I had ever felt, and her clit was pink and engorged. I could feel it brush against the flare of my cock as I pulled back. Her legs quickly arrested my backward travel. 

My head was nuzzling into her labia as she stared up at me. All 6' of her frame was stunningly beautiful. Her waist-length dirty-blonde hair spread over the pillows, her freckles and the look of wild abandon in her eyes is something I'll never forget.

""Cum in me"" she said, and pulled me back in with her muscular legs. ""Cum in me right now. Fill me up."" she demanded. I fought back the waves of pleasure that were approaching.

I knew she was fertile, I had literally done the math. there was no way I could do this. This was insanity. We were undergrads at an Ivy-fucking-League school. There's no room for pregnancy at such a place. We had worked our whole lives for perfect GPAs, recommendation letters and internships. We were some of the best students in our field, globally. But there was also no way I could hold back. 

 If this was going to happen, I was going to make it memorable. I pushed myself as deep as I could. She was somewhat shallow, and I knew her cervix was millimeters from the tip of my cock. I felt it oh-so-gently brush against the tip as she pivoted her hips. I ran my right index finger over her clit rapidly. I knew she was close.

Her eyes got wide and she pulled me in tighter with her legs. She was smiling as if excited by the danger of her little joke. ""I love you. Get me pregnant."" she said with a glee that was hard to hide. I stroked her clit harder. Suddenly, her abdominal muscles contracted and I felt her vagina tighten. She was climaxing. 

Simultaneously, the first wave of my orgasm hit. I felt the cum splash against the inside of her pussy and run down me. We held each other tightly as I emptied myself into her. I felt the pulse throughout my whole body. ""I...oh god, I CAN FEEL IT!"" she exclaimed.

 It flooded over every fold inside her and washed over her cervix. I had not cum for a few days, and I was pumping like never before. The seed spilled out of her and around my shaft.  I pounded in and out as best as I could, trying to pump it as deep into her as I could. She was still contracting rhythmically as her orgasm tried to pump the semen towards the ovum awaiting. Even if this wasn't my idea, I was going to try my best to fulfill her wish. I wasn't going to waste this.

When the waves of pleasure subsided, I rolled off of her and stared at the ceiling of the apartment. ""Oh fuck"" I thought. ""What did I just do. What the fuck happened to Ms Beige-missionary-protestant?""

Searching for an answer, I looked over at the beautiful woman next to me. With a wink, she slid a pillow under her hips, and the cum dripped from her.

 ~ Conversation between Director Ruslan Sokolov and Lev Kryvoruchko, a university student and intern of Sokolov

------------------------

As the year passes on through winter and into the welcoming embraces of spring, the riots of last year faded into obscurity. The tax raise was indeed an investment well-planned; as the result of the purchase with the Finnish Confederacy, timber shortages are slowly becoming a thing of the past. Reparation once again sped on and with it the revitalizing industry under the Gears and Hammer Program.  For the longest time the Directorate prided itself as self-sufficient and independent of the global politics, and many were taught that globalism were the cause of the Fall. And with the pursuit of wealth long abandoned by the populace of the Dniepr, there lies no need to gather wealth for the sake of having it, and with it, the need of a reviving globalism and trade. Yet its shadows still lies, and the much of the populace are uneasy with the increasing contact with the foreigners. The Directors too felt the same.

To be honest, the Assembly had been entertaining an idea throughout the winter. A united Directorate-held timber colony in the Urals, where ARCHIVE records confirm the untapped forests of Russia could easily solve the Directorate's timber shortages. However the logistics of such expedition would lead to the formation of an entirely dependent territory far from the heartland of the Directorate and thus possible reinforcement in case of conflict. In addition to that, the intrusion into the Russian heartland would lead to disturbance to the local population, which violates the Prime Directive. For most of winter the Assembly had been silently debating on the issue, careful to not leak the proposal to the public. At least, until in 25^th December, a promising student and senior of the Directorate Science Academy came up with his thesis and work: Project Elysium. 

Project Elysium was an entirely student-lead project, formed by a group of seniors who cooperated on the thesis and research. Founded in mid-2151, it went under the radar due to the reparation of the storm of 2149 taking the spotlight, but the students were not deterred. Painstakingly they worked their way to survey much of the Russian Marshlands, perhaps with some sponsorship by the Academy due to the breakthrough nature of such project, and after two long years of delayed graduation, they finally reached their conclusion. And with it, they thought of their possible contribution to the Directorate as a whole. 

The group was applauded for their effort by the Assembly, and much of the Directors agreed to allow them to lead the next phase of Directorate-led expansion, named after their own Project Elysium. Now with government sponsorship and military assistance, the Elysian Committee, tasked with overseeing the expansion plans eastward, began their move on the Sunday of the second week into January. Radio messages were sent to the cities of Voronezh, Belgorod and Volgograd, once long-time allies of the city of Lozova and Luhansk in the Turkic Incursion of 2097 and had been in touch with the Directorate since its formation, to announce the Directorate assistance in the reparation of the storm. No replies were heard of, suggesting damages to their own communication problems. Nevertheless, the Elysian Committee oversaw the deployment of small squads into the forests of Krasnaya Yaruga. To its southeast, a diplomat was sent to the Belgorod's Municipal Authority, who accepted the offer of reparation under Directorate authority with the appointment of its own Director. Further on, the small village of Konnoye was offered proper and official place in the Directorate, under the authority of Belgorod. 

To the west, the city of Kiev and Kropyvnytskyi oversaw their own gradual expansion. For Kiev, its the usual police overseeing the construction of the radio mast in the Ovruch mines. The Director of Kropyvnytskyi, Nataliya Matviyenko, secured the mines of Dolyns'ka and Brobynets' once more under the city. The storm had done much damage to the authority of the Directorates' cities, but the Directors were adamant to reclaim much of their former holdings.

7nmzl3,3,2018-01-02,How to move forward?,raghu112233,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7nmzl3/how_to_move_forward/,"Apologies for the lengthy post..
**A brief about me:**
*Personal*:I am 25 yo male,gay,was molested by a few guys at different times.I  have low self-esteem about my physique(dark toned,thin with glasses).I have dental fluorosis(dark yellowish teeth), so I never smiled or laughed with my mouth open.Became sort of addicted to porn,hookups between August 2016-May,2017-had poor performance in career. Did shitty things like cruising at public toilets/groping at busses,etc.. since 2013 at various times.
Even through all these confusions, I am quite social now with all the fellow interns. 
I never shared any of my problems because, no body gives a shit and they might take it as a way to tease me. I hate small talk/sharing of facts/any talk about movies.I usually am silent if I went for a group dinner. I find it pretty hard to talk in group,also, I do not remember such facts about which country has X resources/so on.

*Career*:Finished Masters in Engineering with above avg GPA. Got a job through campus.Now, doing a research Internship and planning for PhD.
**About current work:**In my present internship, I was given a development project which I was not interested at all.Every others were given some interesting research work.I could have finished mine earlier and switched to something else, but I am dragging the work for so longgggggg. In every weekly meeting, I just lie to the Prof. that I did something something.All the other interns have detailed slides of their past week's work, but I write it in 1 or 2 lines. So, I am the worst performing guy in the Lab(I have the potential, but the project is dull and in this period, I came to a good understanding of my behavior,sexuality,addictions and so on.Now I am on track-No hookups,no Fap,no addiction to porn).I was also addicted to chess--played for 4-5 hours straight daily while others were seriously working on their projects.

**What happened:** This New Year, I was not invited for a jungle camping which every other lab mates went.Around 10+ people went.I used to talk with everyone whenever I meet.Even I asked a guy, the day before what was his plan for New year, he said he is just gonna stay in room. Few days back, they didn't invite me for a dinner too.

I do not know what has caused them to ignore me. Most of them are from well-to-do family, but mine is still kind of unstable with debts.So, I never eat costlier outside food and wear same clothes again and again and never go out for watching movies/party. I am in the city for 4 years and have been to a few places every now and then alone and am not interested to go out nowadays.I went for a cycle ride 2 weeks back with one other girl intern without informing anyone.

**How I felt that day?**
I was pretty irritated. They gathered outside my room discussing with my roommate,before leaving for the party.My roommate too didn't invite me either.The next few hours, I was thinking what I did wrong? why they left me alone? Why that guy lied? and this affected my normal day-day activities.I took longer time than usual in everything. I relapsed to chatting with strangers for hookups and jerked off after 25+ days of NoFap. I spent around 9 hours watching porn/porn images/chat with strangers.

**How do I feel now?**
* I know God has different plans for me and this party/get together is not for me.
* I am gonna stop talking with everyone except the close ones and prove my worth by achieving a level higher than all those people.
* I started my 2018 pretty good, with some self reflection and new thoughts for my PhD admission. I am kind of between introvert and extrovert, so my room was the ideal place for me anytime.
*I set out a few goals for 2018 and I am on track.I have read 30 pages yesterday and continuing.Target: 100 books in 2018.
*I didn't drink or eat crazy and have a good start.

Though, everything is fine with me now,I would like to know any similar experiences and how people dealt with this. I am okay with not going for the party(bcoz, I would not have enjoyed as much as staying alone),but I could not handle the lie and the fact that everybody took great efforts to conceal this from me.

Tl;Dr: Not invited for the New Year celebration by lab mates.How to move forward??
Sorry if this is not the right subreddit to ask about this."

To earn money, I work at this crappy, $9/hour fast food joint that I fucking hate and am do this unpaid internship two days a week. In addition, I will be earning two bachelor's degrees in May (computational math and economics), will be writing my first academic research paper this semester, just took up another research opportunity in a new, developing field (I will keep this anonymous for the sake of concealing my identity) and am currently out of my home country doing research with the professor I am writing a paper with.

My problem is, I have extremely poor social skills (to the point where I can't relate to many people my age) and my mother is afraid to give up her control of me; she will not let me start paying my own bills or even let me buy my own food. Of course, this is really holding me back. How do I go about moving out of my mother's house? I do not have any money saved up at the moment and am clueless when it comes to basic life skills. "

#September October of 1950

Attacker | Defender | Type of Operation | Outcome | Results
---|---|----|----|----
Yugoslavia | Romania | Cell Establishment | Cell Already Established | - |
Israel | Iraq | Cell Establishment | Success- Failure to Remain Secret | The State of Israel tried to secretly call for the mass exodus of Jews in Iraq through the Aliyah. However, they told those in Iraq that the Holy Land they were to exodus to was not in fact Jerusalem but rather Iran. Jews and Israelis were confused with some deciding the best thing to do was stay where they were - it is clear that Iran is not the Holy Land. Mossad agents that made it into Iraq tried to convince many people that the Holy Land was Iran and it was far safer for them. ""Please, go to Iran."" They would say. ""Go to Iran!"" They'd demand, knocking door to door of Jewish Homes. ""Please, go to Iran! It's the Holy Land!"" *""Excuse me, but Jerusalem is the Holy Land.""* One very brave and smart woman had said to the agents. The agents did not like their demands to be tested and struck this woman. They were soon arrested by authorities and found out to be Israeli Mossad Agents. Their mission was well and known; for some reason, get Jews to leave Iraq and go to Iran. Police then thought they were nothing more than a cult and transferred 63 agents into Internal Security.
Egypt | Internal (Egypt) | Intelligence Gathering | Heroic Success - **Cell Destroyed** with Agents in Egyptian Custody | Egyptian agents were well aware of the Mossad Cell in their land for quite some time now. Basing themselves on the communications channel and encryption network, they had agents on their home-front working rough and tough on nearly every frequency listening for any codes of any sort. All the while, agents were also searching the last hideout of the Mossad but found little to be conclusive in that effort. It wasn't until one agent back at HQ was listening to an AM emission. The announcer was a woman with a thick Israeli accent utilizing UK ICAO. ""King, Peter, Able, Charlie. Fox-1, Oboe-2, Baker-3, Papa-1, Oboe-2, Roger-3, Tare-4, Sugar-1, Able-2, Item-3, Dog-4, Uncle-1, Nan-2, Item-3, Tare-4, Roger-1, Easy-1, Papa-1, Oboe-2, Roger-3, Tare-4, Sugar-5,  Charlie-One, Able-Two, Papa-Three, Tare-Four, Uncle-Five, Roger-Six, Easy-7, Item-1, Mike-2, Mike-3, Item-4, Nan-5, Easy-6, Nan-7, Tare-8."" It didn't take long for officials to realize that King Peter Able Charlie was a codename and their message was. ""F.O.B. PORT SAID UNIT R - E PORTS CAPTURE IMMINENT."" The rest of the transmission was garbled but was believed to request for an extraction. Egyptian authorities cut off the Port temporarily and a door-to-door search commenced until they came across an empty house. No furniture other than basic furniture to make the house looked furnished from the windows. Agents storming the building heard noises coming from downstairs and as they walked down the steps, guns drawn, they came across 8 Israelis in a room filled with files, books, pamplets, and radio equipment. Most of them were trying to destroy as much as they could before they were ordered onto the ground, all under arrest. |
Kingdom of Yemen | Internal (Yemen) | Cell Establishment | Success - The King is Allergic to Peanut Butter | Abdullah al-Sallal, the leader of the Free Yemeni Movement along with Ahmad Yuman and Zubayri work together on a plan to gather information out of the Kingship. Abdullah, himself an ex-military officer, got a job impersonating a servant at the palace in a versatile role from being a gardener, janitor, or just general supply officer. His role is simply to watch the King, search for his habits, his health, intelligence, mannerisms - study the man and nothing but. However, his duties as a gardener kept him away from most of that. He was more working in the Royal Garden than interacting with the King until he was bringing in a shipment of cargo into the Palace for Kitchen Staff. It was there he learned of the King's peanut and soy allergies - he was able to successfully report this information back to the Free Yemeni Movement that the King cannot eat peanut butter or things high in soy concentration.
Yugoslavia | Romania | Sabotage | Success - Operation Remains Secret | A [false flag](#secret) operation that utilized [Yugoslavian](#secret) Italians was conducted as the agents [pretended to be](#secret) originating from Italy [inside of the existing Romanian cell-network had began](#secret) to 'communicate' back home to Italy from Romania. The information was ""discovered"" by Edvard Nicolescu, an agent [of influence to Yugoslavia](#secret) inside of the intelligence network in Romania. Although originally ignored and through ditiful convincing, he exposed the evidence of the [Yugoslavian](#secret) Italian network to his superiors and was given reign on the case. Working with Bucharest police and other agents, these men were captured and imprisoned with information leading back to Italy, although minor, [implicated and](#secret) exposed the nation's clandestine operations inside of the country. Nicolescu, ever modest, reported all information and simply thanked the officers that worked with him and believed in him. Such an agent is wonderful to have in one's agency of Romania.
Israel | Egypt | Operation Ignored (Not a BLOP, its diplomacy) | - | - |
Israel | Jordan | Sabotage | Failure - Failure to Remain Secret, Agents Captured | Mossad agents attempted to move out into Jordan to attempt to permanently damage one of the major roads that leads from Iraq to Jordan. Mossad agents successfully infiltrated into the Jordanian-Iraqi border and went out, armed with **nothing** but explosives and began to set explosives on the road. It wasn't before long that a military convoy came by and questioned what they were doing. One Mossad agent, whose explosives were in a aluminum can, began to idly kick it. ""What are you doing?"" An Iraqi soldier asked. The agent, in a thick Israeli-accent, responded in Arabic, ""Moving!"" Many Iraqi soldiers laughed at this joke before the agent then kicked it too hard, blowing him to literal ashes and creating a small crater in the road. Iraqi soldiers watched as the other agents began to run over, all speaking in Hebrew to each other and were deeply saddened at the tragic loss of their friend. It wasn't before long that the Iraqis caught on to what was going on there that they arrested all of 14 agents. Except the dead one. He was agent #5.
Turkey | Internal (Turkey) | Intelligence Gathering | Relative Success - Operation Remains Secret| [After hearing some encrypted broadcasts originating from Turkey, Turkish officials immediately began to suspect Syrian or Soviet influence. The Turkish Intelligence Agencies hired advisers and linguits to assist them with not only the decryption of this ""enigma"" but also to find the origin of the languages and where they were based, be it from the Middle East, Russian, or the Balkans. One Linguist even suggested the possibility that it could be English, as the Americans did have quite the sway in Turkish Politics as is, but this was dismayed. After some tough work and a basic decryption of certain phrases was keyed, the linguists crossed out one by one based on phrases, enunciations and tones of the voice that the language did not come from Russia. It was not Arabic or Germanic in Origin, but rather Slavic, specifically Serbo-Croato-Slovenian of origin. Following this, agents began to monitor nearly every radio message and broadcast but however find that the transmissions in Turkey have gone dark. They agents have also gathered information that the transmissions originated from Western Turkey, West of Istanbul and nearer to the Bulgarian border. However, most police officers remain on regular patrol in these areas and ignore some of the information relayed to them by the Intelligence Agency as their superiors were, unknowingly, bribed.](#secret)
Communist Party of Austria | Socialdemocratic Party of Austria | Cell Establishment | Relative Success - Operation Remains Secret | [Communist agents began to hire and recruit sympathizers to take part in an operation of infiltrating the Socialdemocratic Party of Austria. New recruits and sympathizers would integrate themselves into the SDP (Social Democrats) with some men even being hired on as interns. Most found their positions to be simply logistics and liaison with their largest goal being recruitment into the KPO that yielded little results. However, 5 agents were able to not only be hired on as an intern who were on their way to rise in the Social Democratic Party, but also were able to successfully convince 39 people to join the KPO. (Communist Party of Austria) All throughout, the operation was a success.(#secret)
Communist Party of Austria | french Occupied Zone of Austria | Cell Establishment | Failure - Operation Remains Secret | [KPO agents pushed from the Soviet Occupied Austrian land into the French Occupied lands undetected but traveled with the possibility of forming a cadre along with creation of a alpine guerrilla force. However, the agents were ill-prepared as their recruitment efforts for the force went generally unnoticed. Their results came inconclusive and they returned to Headquarters in Soviet Occupied Lands to relay their information it. No dice this time.](#secret)
Colombia | El Bogotazo (Liberal Rebels) | Intelligence Gathering | Success - Operation Fails to Remain Secret | Operators loyal to the government enter into the Colombian areas known to harbor Bogotazo and do successfully join, however information slips out that a batch of new recruits may be related to the government, causing the rebels to close up recruitment. Only but a handful of agents make it in and undergo harsh hazing rituals to test their loyalty to the cause but all eyes are on them. The cell is established and the rebels are still aware of the infiltration but are unsure of who. Nevertheless, there are infrequent but detailed updates sent back to the government.
USSR | UK/Israel | Intelligence Gathering | Success - Operation Remains Secret | [Following the mass-murder in Belfast, the USSR becomes greatly suspicious. MGB agents make contact with their Cambridge 5 boys and find out little information but still enough about these Mossad agents. MI6 may be involved, but with the shootings, agents do find that these Mossad agents were sent into Belfast, either with or without British assistance, on the pretense that were are to assassinate members of the Irish Republican Army with focus on the Marxist splinter groups. Other than that, not much is known.](#secret)
Iraq | Germany | Cell Establishment (**???**) | Success - | Iraqi agents traveled to Bavaria, West Germany for one man - Artur Schmitt. It isn't too long before they find and meet him and after some convincing, Artur Schmitt agrees to return to Iraq to train the Iraqi Forces fight against Israel.

##November-December

Attacker | Defender | Type of Operation | Outcome | Results
---|---|----|----|----
EDA | Greece | Cell Establishment | Heroic Success - Operation Remains Secret **Cell will take 4 years to establish** | [The EDA, with assistance from Albania, sees to it that 200 Sigurimi agents gain Greek citizenship and gain admission into the Greek Military Academies with the hopeful opportunity to enlist in the military as officers. They are accepted, and after 4 years, a large number will be making their way into the Military Intelligence Branches of the military while others join into the Army and Air Force.](#secret)
Israel | Jordan | Intelligence Gathering | Failure - Operation Remains Secret | [Mossad agents entered into the West Bank in the search of Palestinians who could be involved with foreign agents. They yield little results that are conclusive however do find out information that there are some Palestinians that may be making frequent contact with the Arab League. How, when, or where, is not known however. The hunt is on!](#secret)
La Cosa Nostra | Italy | Cell Establishment | Failure - Operation Remains Secret but Wise Guys Threatened | [In the search of a profitable friendship with Democrazia Cristiana, La Cosa Nostra has their made men work out some gentle snooping in search of who is in charge of ballot counting along with running the voting booths. They find out these positions are yet to be filled and suggest their own guys - wise guys, made men into these positions. However, the mere suggestion of this off-sets a few people with one person in particular saying ""I won't deal with your kind ever again, and if I see you around here I'll arrest you!"" The man, Vito Gazzetalli, was so irate, he shouted them down even after $10,000 was offered to them and their families. This was one cookie that couldn't be cracked... or could it? Nevertheless, the results for now were pretty inconclusive.](#secret)
La Cosa Nostra | Italy | Cell Establishment | Success - Operation Remains Secret | [Wise guys from La Cosa Nostra hoped to see the Democrazia Cristiana relations between the two parties improve and decided the next-best way to do that keeping tabs on everyone. *Soldiers* (Organized Crime Soldiers) visited the local Deputies and Senators, their campaign staff, and families with the goal and intent to ensure that no other tampering has been done with them and if any legal trouble occurs, not only will it be recorded but also to take care of them. One family in particular arose with the Local Deputy himself whose brother's meat-packing business was facing bankruptcy. Soldiers not only took care of his bankruptcy but also invested in his business to keep it afloat - all in return of a favor that the Deputy himself would owe them. That being nothing more than a working relationship between the two - a new friend with the government was born. Further cementing this relationship was information on this very deputy's campaign staff, as a number of them were recorded to have immense amounts of legal trouble that were brushed under the fridge with their help. The demands by La Cosa Nostra was nothing more than improved medical care and facilities in their district - failure to pass this would clearly implicate the politican. A new friend was born.](#secret)

&gt;* Apart from Overwatch, what is your favorite game to play?

&gt;* What wrestling techniques do you prefer to use on the other developers when there are disagreements?

&gt;* What are your most and least favorite fan creations?

&gt;Let's make this happen!)

##Wow, cool. Hopefully I don't bore you to tears. Sure... let's do this!

##**Growing up, what was it that made you realize you wanted to go into game development?**

##I never knew ""game development"" was a job. I just thought smart programmers made games... and talented artists. There were no game development programs in school. I just loved games. It wasn't until my late 20's that I realized that I had a chance to make games. I sort of dropped everything I was doing and totally changed careers. I was 29 when I started working on games.

##**How did the idea for Overwatch originally come about?**

##We were working on a game that got cancelled. We had 6 weeks to pitch new game ideas to the studio. If we didn't come up with something compelling, our team was going to be redistributed to work on other projects (WoW, HS, HotS, D3 etc). Arnold Tsang was drawing these amazing characters. And during some of our game idea sessions Geoff Goodman was pitching really cool class ideas for a class-based MMO. We merged these concepts into what was to become Overwatch.

##**What stories do you have that you can share from the initial development of Overwatch?**

##The first hero we implemented was Tracer. We did not have any animations or gun models. So she shot laser beams from her eyes.

##**Besides Overwatch, what are some of your favorite projects that you've worked on in the past?**

##Vanilla WoW holds a special place in my heart. I was so naive about game development. I really loved the team. The game world was so much fun to create.

##**When someone asks you about the next unreleased hero, what's your favorite response to strategically avoid answering the question?**

##Quien es Sombra?

##**Who is your favorite hero?**

##This is going to sound canned but I fall in love with a different hero each week. I think that's one of my favorite parts about OW. I totally get ""maining"" and I have heroes I play more than others... but I'm constantly discovering new things about different heroes on different maps... and then of course there is their backstories etc...

##Also, every time Hanamura comes up I will only play Hanzo on defense. Because... roleplay... meet me on the porch, Genji

##**When you were developing Overwatch, did you imagine it would earn Game of the Year less than one year after release? How did it feel when you found out it won?**

##We make games to make players happy... not to win awards. With that said, I was extremely happy for my team that they were recognized. They were so loyal and dedicated... and they worked so hard. It made me feel really good that they received some recognition for their efforts.

##**What is your favorite part of working with Blizzard?**

##I love the people I work with -- truly love. They are amazingly smart and talented. I learn so much every day. I love being surrounded by people who are 100% driven and dedicated towards their passion. I feel incredibly lucky to work here.

##**Apart from Overwatch, what is your favorite game to play?**

##Right now? Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's a masterpiece. 

##**What wrestling techniques do you prefer to use on the other developers when there are disagreements?**

##Death? No but seriously... When people don't agree -- which is always -- there is usually a good reason. We're all better off when we try to understand where the other person is coming from before forcing our will.

##**What are your most and least favorite fan creations?**

##I love all of it. The art, the cosplay, the songs, the videos.

&gt;I would enjoy if we could extend this to other members of the production team; I'd love to have something similar to the AMA we had with the OW sound devs months ago, only with other departments!

&gt;- Question: What does the full design process of creating a new character look like, from start to finish? Do you start with a character in mind and build mechanics around that character, or do you build mechanics and look for a character they would fit? at what point do you start doing art and voiceacting for a character, and what does that process look like?

##The initial idea comes from either Art, Game Design or Story. Winston was an awesome picture that Arn drew. Orisa was a design on paper that Geoff Goodman made. 76 was a character that Metzen wrote for a comic back in the day.

##We then do a LOT of prototyping. Geoff, Scott or Mike will use existing art assets or placeholder assets to ""prove"" out the character. For Ana, we used a variation of Widowmaker to test her out. One of our Technical Artists made a hasty hood to put on Widow to help differentiate the silhouette (because things got confusing in playtests with Widow and Ana in play). After we've played enough, we commit to the concept. So many people are involved in making the hero. Tech Art, Rigging, Modeling, Concept Art, VFX, Sound, Engineering, animation, UI... and of course GERSH -- master of all heroes -- our hero producer who is in fact a hero. The last things to come in are usually sound and VFX. We'll often play the heroes for months with temp VO -- which can be funny.

&gt;I'd love to hear from Tigole, just how he's changed over the years.

##I've mellowed out a lot. I spend a lot more time trying to really listen to and understand other people. I think I spent a lot of my life thinking I was right about everything but as I get older I realize how little I was actually right about. I think I appreciate the little things in life a lot more as I get older and am less focused on how others perceive me. I think about gaming all the time. As much as it is true that some developers don't understand their players, I think it's even more true that most players don't understand what it's like to make games.... or really to have any job where everything you do is openly and constantly criticized by a large amount of people. I think I've gotten good at taking critical feedback. But literally everything I read affects me on a personal level. I worry about my teammates in this regard. I think they are awesome and it makes me really upset when someone criticizes them unfairly. 

##I'm a lot happier now that I was in my teens and twenties. I wish I could convince everyone who is young and feels unhappy to hang in there and chase your passions -- things really do get better and there is so much awesome in this world we live in.

&gt;I'm doing a project on Jeff for my business class, I'd love to have some more busniess related info on him as there isn't much on the Internet.

##It's hard for us to release too much business related information. We're a publicly traded company so we're held to some pretty strict guidelines by the SEC.

##I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but this is the best place for that kind of information:

##http://investor.activision.com/ 

##I will tell you this, the biggest different between making games in the WoW era (2002) to the OW era (2013) is how much as a game designer you need to be ALL IN on the design of the business model. We never used to talk about business models but it's a whole new world we live in now.

&gt;How much presence do you personally have on /r/overwatch and the other overwatch subreddits? Are you a frequent lurker, or do you just pop in once in a blue moon?

##I read this subreddit all day long, on and off, from when I take my dogs out in the morning till when I take them out at night.

##I also check /r/Competitiveoverwatch/, /r/OverwatchUniversity/ and /r/ImaginaryOverwatch/

##I also like sites like MasterOverwatch, Overbuff, Oversumo etc... I just wish we could provide them with more complete stats as I think their data is skewed by the high end players who are more likely to frequent those sites. They are still fun to read and look at though.

&gt;Wasn't Tracer a character from the game that was cancelled? That game has a lot of history and was in development for a very long time. Wasn't it 10 years? While it's disappointing to see most of those ideas go, I think Overwatch definitely was worth the wait and development time.

##Titan was started around 2007. I just remember we were working on The Burning Crusade at the time. It was in development until May of 2013.

##Titan was a class-based Shooter/MMO and one of the classes was called the Jumper. The Jumper wasn't a specific character but rather an avatar (like warrior in WoW). Most of the concepts of the Jumper were male... we did some female ones as well. The playble version in the game was male.

##Blink, Recall and Pulse bomb were all designed for the Jumper... as well as dual wielding machine pistols (at the time I was playing tons of CoD: MW2 and my loadout was M16 primary/ G18s secondary... the Jumper guns were my G18s)

##But because Titan was an MMO the Jumper started getting tons of progression abilities... you know covering a whole level up system... so the jumper got shotguns, and knockbacks etc... it was very cluttered and confused.

##When we simplified for OW, we chose only the abilities that worked well together and then created a HERO rather than a class... Tracer had a personality, an origin etc.. That's what made her work.

##Contrary to popular belief, most of the heroes in OW were not in Titan.

##Tracer had elements of the Jumper
Reaper was Reaper (he did have a crossbow at one point in Titan)
Widowmaker evolved from a class called the Ranger
Bastion also evolved from the Ranger
Soldier 76 evolved from the Ranger
Symmetra and Torbjorn evolved from the Architect
Reinhardt evolved from the Juggernaut, although he is completely different... just the idea of ""big guy with shield"" is all that stuck
Genji/Hanzo evolved from the Assassin

&gt;Coming from shooters growing up I never really had to deal with ""meta"" and changes.  I understand why its necessary, but for the most part, shooters were shooters - There wasn't a lot of drastic changes that took place that changed how the game played.  Especially on a regular basis.  The core gameplay came from the skill of the players and not really the guns, or in Overwatch's stance, the Hero's.  If that makes sense.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Does your team ever envision Overwatch being completely/mostly/fairly balanced so you have a more concrete understanding on how to introduce new heroes, maps and modes  or do you feel meta-changes is a perpetual state that will constantly evolve as the game evolves?

##I believe the meta will always evolve. Even if we don't make changes.

##The community will get grumpy when the meta changes. The community will get grumpy when the meta doesn't change. Such is life.

&gt;You guys obviously have a lot more background information on heroes when it comes to their use in game and such, when you're looking at that information, how do you all decide which aspects of the characters to nerf/buff?

&gt;In the past, you all seemed to make huge sweeping changes all at once, but these last weeks or so on the PTR, you've been making small changes since what happened with Bastion, is that plus the huge upswing in D.Va caused you all to change your standard procedure for what you'll tweak in buff/nerf per character?

##I always describe our approach as the ""triangle"". I feel like there are 3 key factors that guide us: The players, statistics and... us... our own feelings as players.

##It's very rare that all 3 of those factors align. Often, we have to ignore one or two and make a change. I think the ""overhaul"" to Symmetra was a good example. According to the stats, she was fine. But both the players and we agreed that she felt underwhelming. We made changes to make her more fun to play in spite of that stats telling us that she was fine. Honestly, the same thing for Bastion recently.

##We play the game A LOT. We play on live all the time. And we play internal builds of the game constantly. We're always trying big changes to heroes internally... lots of these never see the light of day... or PTR.

##Honestly, we can't win on the PTR. If we make big changes and they go live, we get heat for it. If we make big changes and pull them back, we get heat for it. We have to just trust our own instincts at this point and own our mistakes when they happen. 

##The play behavior on the PTR is not super helpful for balancing. Average playtime of those who log in is usually around 16 minutes. Most of the time, someone logs in, wants to try the ""changed"" hero and logs out. People don't play traditional comps -- they just want to try changed heroes. If they don't get the hero, they leave the match. You have people who have less than 20 minutes play time on a hero testing that hero on the PTR and then giving feedback based off of 1 match.

##Historically, the balance feedback has been very unreliable from the PTR. It's still good to hear how people react and what their perception is. But the reality of ""quality matches"" doesn't happen too often in a test environment.

##Internally, we have a ""competitive"" playtest that's helpful to get good feedback from Diamond+ players who work here. We're also very fortunate that the Pro Players will often invite us to watch scrims on the PTR. 

##None of this is perfect... but we try hard to listen to feedback and keep the game balanced.

&gt;Hey Jeff!

&gt;What kind of cool game analytics is there that goes on behind the scenes? Does blizzard look at things like common people who group together and other big data ideas?

&gt;Thanks!

##We have an entire Business Intelligence group here at Blizzard -- and they are amazing. I know the name sounds scary and corporate. But in addition to providing our business guys with analytics, they work with the design team very closely to look at everything: heroes, maps, matchmaking, progression items (unlocks), queue times, game mode popularity, trends etc.

##The best part about the BI group is they are hardcore players of the game. We often use ourselves as guinea pigs for analysis or testing... we'll look up our accounts and see what's going on. It's a lot of fun to look at the data but you also need to have an idea of why you're looking at it and what are you trying to accomplish with it.

##For example, we try to keep all maps balanced as closely to a 50/50 win rate as possible. Eichenwalde has never achieved 50/50... but players love the map. We made changes to the door... and we have one more round of changes coming (to the first choke)... these are largely driven by the stats showing us the imbalance. But left to our own feelings, we love the map and feel like it's one of our best.

&gt;Can you talk about the hero development, like their old abilities, Geoff said Sombra could hack the payload/points, Torbjorn doing friendly fire, etc, is there more deleted/changed abilities for any other hero?


##The hero who had the most changes was Bastion. We used to tease that Bastion had the ""ultimate of the week""... He had grenades, he had a remote mine, he could shoot through walls... yes BASTION COULD SHOOT THROUGH WALLS... he had an artillery volley... we just never could get it right. We were really pleased with the tank though. Transforming into another form really fit the character. It was way more work than any of the other abilities but it was worth it.

&gt;Hi Jeff When will we see some McCree Buffs and i've redesinged the golden gun for American McCree pls fix his golden gun &lt;3 

&gt;here is link http://imgur.com/XeHjmop

##This is just me speaking -- the design group collective might feel differently -- but I don't think McCree is wildly underpowered. McCree is very effective and is somewhat a victim of the meta as it ebbs and flows... not unlike Pharah. That doesn't mean we won't keep an eye on him or consider changes. But he's a hero who can very rapidly swing in the wrong direction if we're not careful.

&gt;I'd like to ask: What is the best way for fans to get ideas/thoughts/feedback to you guys, and how can we tell you've seen an idea so we can stop throwing it at you? I ask because Blizzard's offiical OW forum moves *so fast*, and Reddit here has other factors,, I imagine it's easy to miss things.

##We pay a lot of attention to the official forums. Also, the cool part about Reddit is that if the community is really excited about an idea, it usually ends up in front of us.

&gt;Hopefully this is an acceptable question, but do you think Overwatch will ever get any attention to it's colorblind mode? It's been ignored for some time, and players who have trouble with colors, like me, are unable to play it the way it's meant to be played.

&gt;It's been a quiet subject for a long time, and I'm sure the entire colorblind community would be very grateful for at least some info about it

##I hope we can spend more time on Color Blind mode. We too want it to be better. We were pretty happy to get something in in the first place. It's so hard for us because we have so many things we are excited to work on but we have to prioritize each feature against one another.

&gt;What are your personal thoughts on Team fortress 2 and what's your reaction when someone says Overwatch is a copy of TF2?

&gt;I seriously would like to know this. 

##Team Fortress 2 is one of the greatest games ever made. It's in my top 10, without a doubt. At the time that it came out, I felt like there was no purer example of elegant, masterful game design. Everything existed for a reason. And the game had so much flavor and color. I had played Team Fortress since the original quake mod and loved it. I played TONS of TFC. I was one of those fanboys who was eagerly awaiting the ""WW2"" Team Fortress game. So I was just blown away when TF launched.

##When we were planning the announce of OW at Blizzcon 2014, I really pushed the team to have 12 heroes and 3 maps complete. My reason was that if we had 9 or fewer heroes, we would only be compared to TF2 -- players and press would map each hero to a TF2 equivalent. But I knew if we had more than 9 and we had enough maps for people to really play on and experience the game, they would quickly realize that while there was an obvious inspiration from TF2 in the game, we were clearly something different.

##Also, no hats.

&gt;(console player here) How the idea of making a console version of a FPS (and from Blizzard, which is mainly familiar with PC kind of games) like Overwatch came up and how hard was to make this version?

##From day 1 we wanted to be on consoles. We designed the game to be PC and console from the very start. The funny part was, we did not have a signed contract with Sony or Microsoft until very late in the process (right before we finally announced we'd be on console -- Blizzcon 2015)... but we'd been working on it since 2013.

##We enjoy the challenge of being on 3 platforms. It's not too hard from a tech or design standpoint -- we're the type of people who enjoy that type of work. The thing that's been hardest for me to adapt to is not being able to release stuff or change stuff as frequently as we could on WoW (and still keep all 3 platforms releasing on the same schedule).

##For example, we're still working on getting reporting working on consoles. It's coming... but not as fast as we would like.

&gt;Do you like playing competitive Overwatch, and what rank range are you in? 1000-2000, 2000-3000, 3000+? Do you care?

&gt;Do you hope that players become 'stronger' at the game, or would you rather they stayed predictable?

&gt;These are odd questions but they tell a lot about where you are in your position as the Wrestling champion of Blizzard entertainment, especially since you are a professional developer and a good experienced gamer at the same time. (One wants $$, other wants shiny ninja fighter and wants to do new fancy stuff.)

##I love playing all aspects of OW except for Play vs. AI. We want to evolve Play vs. AI but it's not a focus and it has a long way to go.

##I like competitive a lot. I am a platinum player. I think I could get diamond (maybe?) if I played comp more. I tend to place at the start of a season and play 25-50 games past that and then go back to QP/Arcade. I've been playing a decent amount this season. I placed around 2700.

##Most comp games are fun because people play smarter, tend to care more and cooperate. I really wish people wouldn't tilt so hard in team chat though. I understand how frustrating the game can be when things aren't going your way, but I wish people would stop for a second and not say that mean thing in team chat... it doesn't do anyone any good. Everyone always looks at us to solve the toxicity problem with some magical game design fix (one that has not yet been invented by any online game thus far)... anonymity does weird things to humanity.

&gt;Why did you stop working on WoW? Did the idea of project Titan seem more appealing, or did you simply want to start working on another project?

##Personally, I was feeling very fatigued after 6.5 years of working on WoW. Also, Titan was seen as a very big challenge -- to try to make a game that could live up to WoW's legacy and perhaps surpass it. It failed of course.. haha.

##I miss working on Warcraft dearly. And I miss Team 2 dearly -- they are amazing people.

##He is super talented. The videos are hilarious. Obviously, I feel embarrassed when I see them.

&gt;Is there a point at which the stats on their own become significant enough to show something needs to change?

&gt;Whilst I don't have the statistics myself, I must say it feels as though Ana is in more than 90% of very high ranked games and I have to say it has stopped feeling good seeing her in game. I would understand if this comes under the meta, and that it might shift in the future but I really don't feel like any hero has reached that usage rate since Lucio season 1.

##The Eichenwalde balance stats warranted a change. Hero pick rates are tricky. Sometimes they warrant change.

##Right now we're trying some stuff with Lucio. We feel like a lot of players feel like he is a ""must have"" in comps but he also doesn't feel super impactful to play. We're trying some ideas to make him more engaging to play while making him a little less obvious/must pick. We'll see if those changes make it to the PTR.

##One tricky thing is that player perception of ""must pick"" doesn't match actual behavior. I sometimes look at the hero pick stats and they clearly don't match the ""hero meta report"" stats. Then players tell me to throw out my stats and look at only diamond and higher in competitive play only. Well, at that point, I'm not sure players realize what a small percentage of the player base they are asking me to make a decision based on. Obviously, we are in the process of toning Ana down right now. But we're also not out to see her never get played either. Player reaction is often to sledgehammer everything.

&gt;As someone who has been playing Blizzard games since Diablo, I just want to say thank you for creating such a great game and embracing the community the way you have.  

&gt;I love Overwatch, its an amazing game, but the way the Developers communicate and embrace feedback is something pretty incredible.

##We're honored to be a part of this community. We feel like the community communicates with intelligence and respect and we want to give that back.

&gt;What kind of skills for a game designer are valued at Blizzard?

##thick skin, critical thinking, creative thinking, black magic, plays games more than anything else... did I mention thick skin?

&gt;Jeff! What is your favorite Map?

&gt;Thanks for doing this!

##I love Hanamura. I know the players don't. But I love that map.

##I love Eichenwalde and Dorado for the height differences and flanking routes.

##I love Nepal because of the hero mix required to successfully play all 3 points -- same with Lijiang really.

&gt;You said you fall in love with a different hero each week, and so don't have a favourite. But, do you have a favourite hero ability out of them all - not necessarily one you think is most powerful or has the most utility, but one you think is most fun? 

##Reinhardt's charge. And yes, I know I am not supposed to use it.

&gt;Just curious, are you involved in the actual coding of the game, or do you oversee the games design philosophy/balance and overall direction? Or something else entirely?

##I don't write code. I so wish I knew how to write code. If I could go back in time, I would have learned a few languages. I wrote BASIC on a TRS-80 and that's it ... lol.

##I spend more time helping with the game design philosophy and providing direction for how we should prioritize the team's time. I try to build a vision that's based on what the team wants to create and then help spread that vision, communicate it and keep everyone to it. It's easy with this team because they are high-functioning and don't even need me. I mean, I am sitting here writing on Reddit in the middle of the day... lol

&gt;Where do you see OW in a few years? I'm guessing releasing too many heroes would be overwhelming for new players, even though people always want more.

##I've always thought of Overwatch in terms of Crawl, Walk, Run -- a development philosophy that our CEO, Mike Morhaime, preached to all of us. I see OW as being in the ""crawl"" state right now. We have so much more we want to do -- beyond just the game you're playing right now. We really do want to create a Blizzard universe that is worthy of standing alongside Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo.

##The more we get into the development of this incarnation of OW, the more I think that having too many heroes too quickly will actually hurt the game. I want to make sure that every hero in the game gets the love and attention it deserves -- from balance, to story to skins and art. Our business model does not demand constant hero releases. I want us to avoid homogenizing or undoing heroes by releasing constant new ones. I think we need to find a pace where we can add new heroes to keep the game fresh -- both in terms of gameplay as well as story -- but also not hurt the existing world we're trying to build here.

&gt;Is there a particular character you found most exciting to see develop and evolve?

##Pharah was really cool because Geoff had such a strong vision for the gameplay and none of us could fully get there. But he proved to us how fun she could be through a prototype. And then watching Arnold find the right ""look"" for the character was an amazing and rewarding process. Also, naming her took a long time. Metzen finally came up with ""Pharah"" which is perfect in just about every way.

&gt;Typically, what do you not like to hear from the community?

##I don't like when you're mean to each other. I don't like when you're mean to the people I work with... especially if you call them lazy. They are the hardest working people in games. I also don't like when people say ""x hero needs an overhaul"" when they really mean the hero needs a slight balance tweak. Generally, I don't like toxic behavior or hyperbole.

&gt;I'm a machinist who does nothing but play video games, repair arcade machines, and scour Craigslist for them with my spare time.

&gt;How do I get on the Kaplan path?

&gt;I'd love to get into the gaming industry and get to someone like Blizzard. 

&gt;Give me some wisdom senpai?

##Check out the jobs pages on most gaming company websites. Changing careers is hard. I did it when I was almost 30. You have to be willing to take a huge step down and sacrifice... and it's kind of a gamble.

##Because of the position I am in now I have seen all of development's salaries. I've never seen anyone who made less than me when I started at Blizzard in 2002. But it worked out ok.

&gt;You often say that you play the game yourself too, and you included comp, so when communicating do you avoid using voice chat so they dont know it's you or do you not care if they notice you?

##It's a real bummer because I used to use voice chat quite a bit and no one recognized me. But lately it's gotten to the point where I can't use voice anymore. They say, ""you sound just like Jeff Kaplan"" and I say ""who's that?"". I am very much a communicator -- I like shot call when I play. So not being able to use voice really bums me out.

&gt;Hey Jeff! I'm wondering if the team has any plans to put in more rewards for competitive points, other than the golden weapons. Love the game!

##We've been discussing it. We have some cool ideas. I am torn though. Part of me thinks it is a big mistake putting more rewards into competitive play. I really think the people playing in that system should be there because they care about competitive competition. I am nervous about attracting people to the system with too many rewards.

&gt;It sounds like you're up to the challenge of being on the Switch then...?

##I'm loving the Switch! My second favorite gaming platform of all time is the 3DS. Getting OW on the Switch is very challenging for us. But we're always open minded about exploring possible platforms.

&gt;Do you ever think the Summer Games will be back this year?? The support on the events are AMAZING in my opinion and it would mean quite a lot to the people that didn't get to play them.

7npeno,7,2018-01-02,"Me [21, F] with my boyfriend [22, M] of 2 years having long distance problems",leslieknope_666,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7npeno/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_22_m_of_2_years_having/,"So I've been in a long distance relationship for two years and we have established that we are moving in together once we both graduate (this May) and will likely be together for a long time and probably get married. We love each other and have had many, many, long discussions about the nature of our situation and how we will work things out in this relationship.

Everything has honestly been fine, better than I thought when I got into this. However lately I have been having more trouble than ever with our relationship and being apart. I've been insanely insecure, and I can admit this and jealous of everything he does without me. I can't help it - I've tried to calm down about it but I just can't. We've seen each other a decent amount throughout the last year, about twice a month and we even lived together over the summer. 

But the problem is that I'm moving to another city for my last semester for a full time internship. It's about the same distance away from him as I have been since we started dating. But I know it will complicate being able to see each other because I will be 100x busier and he will also be pretty busy during his last semester. So I know we won't have the same ease of seeing each other that we did before, not that it was ever very easy. But this will be much harder on us.

So that complication, mixed with my newfound insecurity and honestly depression, that has come along with our LDR recently, I don't know what to do. I feel pretty much hopeless about how our relationship is going to go this spring. And the worst part is that we are so close to being able to live together indefinitely and not deal with this LDR crap anymore. I just personally don't feel that I will be able to make it through the spring though. I won't enjoy my time in a new city and in my internship because I will be depressed about missing him and jealous of him living his life without me. 

He pretty much has a decent life without me, but I would say I don't. I don't have the best family, I don't have many close friends, I'm more antisocial and introverted so I don't spend my time doing very much. I also am prone to being depressed as it is, so the LDR part just makes it worse. 

Basically - what do I do? I need to change my attitude. I get that. I can try. But I don't want our relationship to go downhill right as we are about to be able to spend our lives ACTUALLY together. But I feel as though I can't take it any longer and I'm more miserable knowing that I can't be with him.

Sorry if that wasn't exactly coherent. I just needed to rant and I don't really have anyone to do that with right now.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Long distance relationship for 2 years, reaching the tail end of not being able to be together all the time, but I feel like I can't make it any longer even though I do love him. Help?"

The office is cold and divided. Man Georges is a shadow of his normal jaunty self, being consoled by Marty and other interns.



MARTY: I’m sure he didn't mean it. He’s just a...Dumbass.



MAN GEORGES: I guess you’re right. At least my parents didn’t get divorced.



Amir enters the room.



AMIR: This shit can’t be happening today. What’s going on? You left me a dozen voicemails, all incomprehensible weeping, save for the last which could only have been recorded whale sounds.



Man Georges holds up a photocopied image of Geoffrey.



MARTY: Geoffrey...The Dumbass…



AMIR: Yes, I know who he is.



MARTY: He gave George a square high five.



AMIR: I don’t know what that is. And Marty, you aren’t supposed to do grief counseling in the office anymore after the incident.



MARTY: Who wouldn’t feel better after a gals night in with Rosé and a foot rub in the tub?



MAN GEORGES: It’s when you high five someone with opposite hands. His left to my right. You never go opposite. You go your right, to their right. It’s tearing me up inside.



AMIR: Did he assault you? You know what, I don’t care. He’s fucking done. You can’t make people cry in the office. Not my simple George. Not ever.



Amir marches into the next room where Geoffrey is calmly stretching with a pair of dance shoes hung over his shoulder.



GEOFFREY: Blumenfeld. I’ve been expecting you.



AMIR: Okay, I heard what happened. I’ve been waiting a long time for this.



Geoffrey gives his boyish smile with a head tilt.



AMIR: Before we get into it, I’ve been doing some digging. Pulled your resume and it says you graduated from...Of all places, Harvard. I’ve even got copies of your records.



GEOFFREY: That’s correct.



AMIR: Says here you graduated “Magnum Cum Loudly.”



Geoffrey moans sexually.



AMIR: Stop. With honors. Insane.



GEOFFREY: I wish I could say the honor was all mine, bastards took more than their share of the cut.



AMIR: Captain of the lacrosse team, student government. Why are you even working here, much less as an intern?



GEOFFREY: To be quite Franklin with you, it never lacrossed my mind. My internment has been more than rewarding.



AMIR: What happened? How are you this way?



GEOFFREY: As it turns out, my confidence was thinner than crepes, and half as sweet. One of my frat brothers made a crack about my weight and pop went the weasel. They chipped away at this block of marble until there was nothing left. You know David?



AMIR: Do I know David? Sure. Lots of them.



Geoffrey puts his dance shoes on.



GEOFFREY: No, the statue with the huge dong.



AMIR: Wow, not a huge dong, and yes I know it.



GEOFFREY: They chiseled away at that marble so long, I blew past the godly hogged David, and was reduced to what stands before you now.



AMIR: So, they made fun of you, and you became a dumbass?



GEOFFREY: My own father couldn't look me in the eyes, much less speak my name. Which really impacted my family since all seventeen brothers, sisters, and their misters are named Geoffrey.



AMIR: That’s really inconvenient and thoughtless naming by your father.



GEOFFREY: Who? Geoff senior? He means well. Kind of has an old soul. That type of thing. You know when you can’t find your glasses, and they were on your head all along?



AMIR: Sure…..



GEOFFREY: He’s kind of like that, less or more.



AMIR: Unreal…



GEOFFREY: I’m kind of a reverse Good Will Humping of myself. A real class act Damon, if you please.



AMIR: Okay, Jake has been gone for weeks...So I just have to do this myself. Pack your shit, and go. You’re….Fired. How do you like them apples?



Geoffrey regards the coy Jew with a warm smile.



GEOFFREY: That’s awesome, dude.



For the first time, in possibly ever, Geoffrey offers a high five instead of a fist.



AMIR: What are you doing?



GEOFFREY: I think you’re awesome, dude. And I want some skin. A parting gift.



Amir hesitates, then obliges with a SQUARE HIGH FIVE. OPPOSITE HANDS. FACE TO FACE. RIGHT HAND TO LEFT HAND. Geoffrey steps up sure footed and laces fingers with Amir.



The lights dim, and the two are transported to a dance hall. The colors have faded as we now live in a black and white world.



Geoffrey still clasps Amir’s hand, and guides him by the hip in a ballroom dance. Music comes up and they are locked into each other's eyes, handsomely dressed in tuxedo.



As their bodies elegantly traverse the musical rhythm, they speak only with their minds.



GEOFFREY:  As I said, I’ve been expecting you.



AMIR: Where are we? It’s...Beautiful.



GEOFFREY: We are exactly where we need to be.

AMIR: Is this where you are when we’re trying to have a normal conversation?



Geoffrey dips amir and pulls him back up with great strength.



GEOFFREY: Of course.



AMIR: Don’t you mean…?



‘OF JORTS’ appears in a formula, the letters come apart and come back together and Amir understands it’s complex beauty.



AMIR: Of Jorts. It’s not just some stupid nonsensical word. It’s a fucking poem of some shit. You actually are a Good Will Humping. A class act Damon.



GEOFFREY: We have to go back now.



AMIR: I don’t want to go. Tell me ‘That’s awesome, dude.’



GEOFFREY: You’re awesome….Dude.



LIGHTS FLOOD THE DANCE FLOOR. And we’re transported back. 



Amir is amid a violent seizure. Geoffrey stands back from the crowd with a coy smile, removes his dance shoes. With music in his heart, and a little rhythm in his step, he exits the room. 



INT. BATHROOM



Amir soaks in a bathtub drinking a Rosé. Marty is giving him a nice foot rub.



AMIR: This is actually not the worst grief counselling.

7npn5t,11,2018-01-02,My boyfriend [20 M] and I [20 F] both think the other person isn't putting enough effort in,throwaway20180102,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7npn5t/my_boyfriend_20_m_and_i_20_f_both_think_the_other/,"We've been together for about 1.5 years. We've had arguments about this in the past but they were never really resolved. I'm going to give a bit of context on the last argument we had in case it helps, but you can skip everything between the lines because it is quite lengthy.

-----------------------
For some background, we're currently attending University in another city, so during school terms we're together. However, we're currently on break and moved back home where we live about a 20 minute drive from each other. I'm unable to drive because I'm not listed on my parents' car insurance since I'm at school or on an internship away from home 99% of the time, and he doesn't like driving because it makes him stressed (especially during the winter when roads are a bit icy). He usually picks me up for our dates when we're at home (during one summer, and two holiday breaks) because of this. 

We were planning on going to a restaurant between his house and mine (6 minutes away from my house) and I asked if he'd be able to pick me up, adding an extra 12 minutes to his drive. I didn't want to take a bus there because it would take 30 minutes, including a 15 minute walk in -10°C + windchill weather (I live in the middle of no where), and because the restaurant was so close to my house. He got upset and wanted me to put in effort bussing to our date locations instead of expecting him to drive me everywhere. We ended up cancelling another date because it was an hour to bus for me, and an extra 20 minute drive for him to pick me up. I was upset, but understood because neither of us wanted to waste that time. I kind of understood his point this time because I'm really not entitled to him being my 'personal uber', but was upset that he'd rather let me walk through the cold and spend 30 minutes to get there vs driving an extra 12 minutes to get me. I then brought up that I'd sacrificed my time in the past to make his life easier by spending a couple hours each week helping him through assignments (usually programming related, so if anyone has programmed before, you'll know debugging takes a looong time), but he didn't view it as an equal comparison.

I helped him on the assignments because I didn't want him to fail, not because I was expecting something in return (although I was a bit annoyed when it seemed like he didn't really appreciate it). It felt a bit unfair that I was willing to spend my time helping him, but he wasn't willing to do the same for me because he thought that me helping him on assignments wasn't as hard as driving. This made me feel like he was taking the help I was giving him for granted as well. He also countered that he gave me emotional support (because I'm less emotionally stable than he is) which offset part of the assignment help.

-----------------------

Perhaps I'm wrong in this particular situation, but we've had arguments in the past about other situations. I feel like keeping score and comparing everything we do is unhealthy. But at the same time, we both perceive an imbalance in the amount of effort the other person puts in, which kind of forces us to start comparing.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: We both think that we put more effort in than the other, leading us to be upset and keep score of everything we do. Any advice would be appreciated!

---

EDIT: We've resolved our argument. In case anyone stumbles upon this looking for advice on their own issues, here's what we realized. We both were essentially thinking the same thing. I thought that he didn't want to see me enough to drive and pick me up, whereas he thought that I didn't want to see him enough to put some effort into bussing there. In the end, communicating our issues and talking about *why* we felt a certain way helped us work it out. This is probably a super common issue, so just remembering not to assume and jump to conclusions helps a ton. Hopefully this will help stop my comparisons before they start by understanding his point of view. It's taken a while but I've finally realized that if his train of thought doesn't make sense or seems completely inconsiderate, there's probably more behind it because we both ultimately want to be together."

##Member of the Week is...

#ThePianoMeister!

Good people make great games even better and according to Project Awesome, ThePianoMeister is a good person (by our standards). If you're interested, here some facts about the person you just voted as member of the week.

------------------------------------------

**Why do I keep getting ads about Pampers on YouTube?**

Maybe you’ve been shitting yourself too much after you’ve been in the front seat with Mark [SydoxX] driving.

**How did you spend New Years?**

[Drinking](https://media0.giphy.com/media/4Tt0Xi0NLiBhe/giphy.gif) and I watched a bar fight.

**What’s the story behind your username?**

So it started back when I was playing League of Legends and my old handle was taken. I had to think of something quickly since I was in a PC cafe and all my mates were ready to launch the queue. First thing that sprung into my mind was Piano, and then ‘I play the piano.  Then ‘I’m kinda good at playing the piano,’ and then my last drink was Jagermeister, so I settled on ‘ThePianoMeister’.

**What did you have for breakfast?**

Usually I will have a scrambled egg with salmon and toast, a cup of coffee, and oats.  It just gets me going.  I need to have breakfast to get through the day. [Here’s a receipe that I used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUP7U5vTMM0&amp;t=1s).

**What is the weirdest thing you have seen in someone else’s home?**

Oh god.  In my first year in Uni I needed to look for houses.  At one of the houses (and we really liked this one), the first thing that we saw when we entered the first bedroom was a ballgag. [Needless to say, it was removed when my mates and I moved in](https://media1.tenor.com/images/e071da1b97fcfb6081eec2eb6096697d/tenor.gif?itemid=4648661).

**What has been your favourite video game this year?**

Arma 3, because MilSim was a whole new area in gaming that I never explored until this september and I loved it.

**What’s been your favourite videogame of *ALL TIME*?**  

League of Legends. Purely because the game itself is so variable- one cock up and you can potentially swing the favour back into your opponent’s side. Also, it requires heavy teamwork and constant thinking too, which I liked a lot. [Oh and because of this dude too](https://www.shitpostbot.com/img/sourceimages/tyler1-57c8a0563352b.jpeg).

**What is your favourite role to play in multiplayer games?**

Beefy tanks or support. Because I just like to get in the way of other people and disrupt their plans.

**What brought you to PA? How long ago did you join?   What made you want to stay?**

Once upon a time, there was a really bored ThePianoMeister, sitting behind his desk at an internship company, waiting for the time to past. Since he had nothing better to do, he decided to slack a bit and watch random YouTube videos. He then came across some Luetin09 Arma3 Op videos and he thought, ‘hmm, that’s cool.’ Intrigued, he researched what Arma3 was all about, and after the game purchase, he went on a hunt for a unit to join. It was then at the Arma3 Unit Page where he discovered PA, where NO MANDATORY TRAINING, NO COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE and NO ‘YES SIR, NO SIR’ was listed in PA’s bio. Then, on September, 2017, TPM joined, and the rest was history.  Everyone made me stay by the ethos you all have provided and stood by, which is what every community should be.

**What are your favourite games to play with PA?:**

Definitely Arma, though I’ve been playing Rainbow 6 Siege a bit recently.

**Favourite moment playing with PA?**

[Every moment is my favourite moment](https://i.imgflip.com/1jrk5c.jpg).

**If you could meet anyone in PA, who is the first person you would see?**

VC_Wolffe and Straw.  Those two people were the ones who made it easy for me to stay in this community when I first joined.

**Okay, let’s get to the important questions….. Dogs or cats?**

Dogs. Dogs anyday. [Cats are evil AF](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ef/3d/bd/ef3dbd7068e632fce8d07207d0fa2045--evil-cats-funny-cat-photos.jpg).

**Orange juice or apple juice?**

[Why not both](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/random-ness/images/f/f0/Why_not_both.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130312013032)?

**What is your battlecry?**

[U DED BOI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/6x0vxn/laugh_in_chinese_u_ded_boi/?st=jbwg6rkw&amp;sh=5abb618d)

**What are some of your hobbies outside of gaming?**

I enjoy playing the piano and flute, just sight-reading scores that intrigues me. I also enjoy playing rugby, but that is a thing in the past as I am way too skinny to play rugby anymore. [Drinking is also one of them](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l0MYMizgnsTpoMuoo/source.gif), but not excessively since I have examined livers that were demolished by alcohol.

**Do you have a pet?**

Unfortunately I don’t, but I would like a Golden Retriever whenever I have the finance to get one.

**Do you play any instruments?**

Piano (duh, look at his name) and Flute, both with [Grade 8 ABRSM](https://us.abrsm.org/en/our-exams/piano/piano-grade-8/#) qualification. Played it since I was kid, hated it first, got to UK and loved it since because of the inspiring teachers and the concerts that the school hosts to provide a performing ground for musicians, which boosted my musical confidence, thus falling in love with it.  

**If I eat 4 apples and you eat 7 oranges how many pancakes can fit on the roof?**

*30 seconds later*
I’m gonna have to come back to this one.
[*Which is an answer in itself*](https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/500x/61537607/are-you-serious-with-that-answer.jpg)

**What is your favourite television show?**

I’ve got two.  The first is Luther.  The second is Sherlock.  [Luther is dark and I like the story line](https://media.giphy.com/media/Lc6MCPgSpNuA8/giphy.gif).  Sherlock is because of [Benedict Cumberbatch](https://m.popkey.co/15d3ea/zJqae.gif).

**What are you currently listening to?**

*Silence*
[You](https://pics.me.me/if-you-dont-want-a-sarcastic-answer-then-dont-ask-24723729.png)?

In all seriousness, River from Eminem.  Walk on Water from Eminem as well.  I **REALLY** like Eminem.

**What Are Your Three Favorite Albums? Why?**
* [‘Recovery’ by Eminem](https://open.spotify.com/album/3PogVmhNucYNfyywZvTd7F). This album was the first that got me into listening into Hip-Hop/Rap in general and helped me in learning the English language as well as to forge words like silver.
* [‘Electric Ladyland’ by Jimi Hendrix](https://open.spotify.com/album/5z090LQztiqh13wYspQvKQ). Insane guitar legend with some insane tracks. Anything else that I should add?

*  [‘Solidays’ by Eason Chan](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ft6r4NSMBIqZ51zbX0AfX). This Canto-Pop album pretty much grew up with me, and a lot of the songs are pretty meaningful (to me anyways because I speak Cantonese). Also, Eason Chan is arguably one of the best Canto-Pop singers in Hong Kong, plus this album pretty much stayed at the 1st spot on the chart for over 2 months, so what’s not to like about him? (Give it a go and have a listen to it!)

**What is your spirit animal?**

[Wolf.  I tend to act alone and think alone.  I don’t rely on other people to do my shit, I get my own shit done](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/36100000/Writing-image-writing-36156973-353-500.jpg).

**Favourite kind of cookie?**

TPM: Let me have a look….

SS: *You gonna check your pantry or something?*

TPM: Yea actually, give me one second.

SS: *Didn’t think he would do that*

TPM: *Comes back with cookie wrapper in background*

TPM: Double Chocolate Chip Cookie.

TPM: [And this miniature cookie from Japan is also fucking delicious, that’s why it’s empty.] (https://imgur.com/NnhPFW1)

#*We then talked about shipping cookies internationally for a minute.*

**The helicopter is about to crash, the pilot looks at you, what's the one thing you don't want him to say?**

*Silent contemplation*

DO IT FOR THE VINE!!!

**Do you like your memes spicy, dank, or swanky?**

My meme standards are dark.  Like “I’m going to hell for this.”

*We share some memes because we both like this type of humor*

#*We are now meme sharing buddies for life*

**Who has been your favourite squad leader that you have been under?**

VC_Wolffe and Embrodak.  VC is calm and calculated and Embro because he can lead you into a shitshow of a fight and still get you out.

**What games have you had the fondest memories with your friends on?**

League of Legends, Arma3 and Rainbow Six Siege. LoL just simply because I am competing in a University eSports League and the match times are always intense and memorable. Also, that’s where I spend most of my time on before I found Arma with my mates, trolling around and having lots of fun in it.
Arma3 because of the sheer teamwork and semi-realism that made me felt like I was in the military- so immersive.
Rainbow Six Siege because of the constant 1v5 clutch you have to pull off. Oh, and also [Caveira, the sneaky bitch that always manages to stab a knife up my arse](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/LankyDearestAdmiralbutterfly-size_restricted.gif).

**Anything else you want to mention?**

Anything else I want to mention?  COME PLAY RAINBOW 6!!! And I look forward to seeing you all in Arma.  And here is a quote from Benjamin Franklin: “If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.” Thus that’s why the planning phase in Arma3 exists!

Thanks to the community for nominating me!  I didn’t know I had proven my worth to be considered Member Of The Week.

7nqb84,1,2018-01-02,"My recent ex [21 F] of 2yrs broke up with me [21 M] and then wanted to get back together, I said no but now I miss her like crazy...",throwawaynoob122,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7nqb84/my_recent_ex_21_f_of_2yrs_broke_up_with_me_21_m/,"So firstly a bit of background... I had been with my ex for just over 2 years, we were both students in the UK at different universities. She graduated in July 2017 and decided to move back to Singapore after failing to secure a job with a law firm that would supply a work visa. I am currently in my final year and due to graduate in a few months.

Even though we were halfway across the world from one another, we decided to try and make it work. However, summer was the first test of this long distance relationship (previously we were only a couple of hours apart in the UK, so managed to see each other most weekends). I was working a summer internship and she had secured her grad job, meaning we were both busy with work and, coupled with the time difference, it was very hard to make time to facetime or have long conversations. 

She explained that she was feeling distant and often upset due to the decreasing communication and in particular, the lack of physicality in the relationship (she was a very affectionate person). With her being depressed by thoughts of not being able to see/spend time with me, and not knowing when she would return to the UK, she decided that she would rather break up and not have that relationship attachment as it would be easier for her to handle than knowing she has a boyfriend that she can't see. 

So we broke up. Inherently I was hurt by her decision as I felt like I was able to go through the pain of long distance for that small period of time every so often when we would be able to see each other, but clearly she didn't feel the same. My final year at uni had started and I got on with my life. A couple months down the line she called me, cried, told me how much she missed me and asked if I wanted to get back together. I said I needed time to decide, so for a couple weeks we continued speaking as friends until I decided that it would probably be best to just stay friends. 

The reasons being, neither of our circumstances/the situation that caused the breakup hadn't changed, and she was very emotionally volatile. One day she would be thinking very rationally and decide the relationship wouldn't work, and the next would be the complete opposite. I was worried the same thing would just happen again a few months on.  

She understood and respected my decision, but didn't like the idea of just continuing to talk as friends and asked that I gave her some time. Recently I tried making normal conversation with her but she's been very blunt in her responses - not sure why this is?

Now, I feel like I am missing her more and more, and not sure how I should feel about my decision to stay friends (even though we don't really speak anymore...). I know this has been a fairly long post, but I appreciate any comments on this (am I right/wrong, should I feel regret?). 

Thanks

7nqput,7,2018-01-02,Use unused keys/characters when programming,Kungsgeten,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7nqput/use_unused_keyscharacters_when_programming/,"In Sweden we have the Å, Ä, and Ö keys which are seldom used when programming (except when in strings or comments). There may also be programming languages which doesn't use all characters. By modifying some code from `lispy`, I've come up with the following:

    (defun swe-key--insert-or-call (def)
      `(lambda ()
         ,(format ""Call `%s' when in string or comment, self-insert otherwise.\n\n%s""
                  (symbol-name def) (documentation def))
         (interactive)
         (if (let ((sppss (syntax-ppss)))
               (or (not (derived-mode-p 'prog-mode))
                   (nth 3 sppss)
                   (nth 4 sppss)))
             (call-interactively 'self-insert-command)
           (call-interactively ',def))))

    (defun swe-key-define (keymap key def)
      (declare (indent 3))
      (let ((func (defalias (intern (concat ""swekey-"" (symbol-name def)))
                    (swe-key--insert-or-call def))))
        (unless (memq func mc/cmds-to-run-once)
          (add-to-list 'mc/cmds-to-run-for-all func))
        (eldoc-add-command func)
        (define-key keymap (kbd key) func)))

Now I can do something like `(swe-key-define emacs-lisp-mode-map ""ö"" #'nameless-insert-name))` and the `ö` key will run `nameless-insert-name` when in `emacs-lisp-mode`, except if we're in a string or comment.

Perhaps there's already something like this available, if so please share."
7nqugh,0,2018-01-02,I just got my scholarship check.,RefungibleThrowAway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7nqugh/i_just_got_my_scholarship_check/,"I have had the incredible privilege to not only attend a top university, but to do so without having to pay a dime.

Long story short: I grew up poor and early in high school I caught wind that top colleges would pay for low-income students to go there. I decided that was my way out of poverty. So, I made myself miserable all throughout high school, ended up with nearly no friends, just to do all I could to get into one of these top schools.


Fortunately, I got in. And they are in fact paying for my schooling, and then some.


Today, I got my scholarship check of over $30,000 for the semester, which came out to be my tuition+fees+room+board+books, along with an extra $1500. And it makes me feel like such an ungrateful piece of shit to hate taking this.


This university brought me, for the first time in my life, financial stability. I no longer worry about where my next meal will come from. I no longer worry if I'll have a room to sleep in, or if I'll have electricity next month, or heat, or internet.

But god do I fucking hate it. I hate the people here. I hate the assignments that seem to take me twice as long to do compared to my peers. I hate all the corporate shills of classmates. I hate feeling lower than all of my classmates because they got the better internship, or they got a better grade by spending a third of the time on the class.

I hate stretching myself thin trying to keep up with my classes and on campus job and extracurriculars.


I hate going home and having to pretend like I love this place. I hate how the few friends I have from my hometown don't see me the same anymore.


I hate how the professors don't give a shit about students, especially students who are struggling in class.


I hate how we have finals after break so I've spent my entire ""break"" working on assignments and prepping for exams.

I hate how their financial aid makes me feel forever indebted to the university.

I hate Princeton."
7nr1tu,1,2018-01-02,"I [23 M] broke up with my [23 F] girlfriend after 5 1/2 years because of distance. I'm moving to her in 4 months, but she doesn't want to get back together at distance and is seeing someone else.... What should my plan of action be?",zigza1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7nr1tu/i_23_m_broke_up_with_my_23_f_girlfriend_after_5/,"I met my ex gf our freshman year of college. Throughout our freshman/sophomore years there were 2 big times where we almost broke up. Both times she thought I was going to end it, but I didn't because I new that she was something special, and someone that I could see spending the rest of my life with. Both times we almost broke up because we weren't able to talk/see each other much. We were both in an engineering program, and she played a D1 college sport. This meant that we only saw each other about 3-4 times a week. The summers were hard also as we are both very career driven people, and would both be at summer internships for 3 months far away. During these times we wouldn't talk much, but since there was a definite end in sight I always decided to stick it though. (She might have considered ending it with me too, but I don't know that for sure. That's why I just say me)

Junior/Senior year was when things really changed and we actually fell in love. We both had a lot of time to see each other and everything was going really well. We practically lived together for 3 months and never had any issues. At the end of our senior year she decided to move to the midwest for a very high paying job, while I decided to stay on the East coast to get my Masters for the next two years. This was a tough decision as I had received an offer in the same city as her, but decided that staying to get my Masters and then moving out there would be the best career decision for myself. I also didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life/ knew that I wouldn't be proud working at what I considered a tier 3 company while she worked at a tier 1 company. We were both so sure that distance would be fine as we saw a definitive end in sight after the 2 years of my Masters.

As the past year and a half went by it became unlikelier and unlikelier that I would be moving to the midwest in the same city as her for the start of my career. Things were already pretty rough in our relationship as we weren't talking much on the phone, she wouldn't text me much during the day when I was free, and I wouldn't talk to her much in the afternoon when she was free. When we would see each other every 4 weeks we wouldn't have much sex, and a lot of our time felt like it was getting back to knowing each other. Things just started to feel like a chore. 

This past summer (May) is when I really started to feel like I wanted to break up with her. I worked in a cube with another female intern and we hit it off pretty fast. It worried me. I could feel myself slipping and I was very worried I would end up cheating on my gf. I didn't see a definitive end to our distance, I didn't want to move to her city, I didn't want to waste my last year of college, I didn't want to cheat on my gf and ruin any future chances with her. So in my mind I thought the best course of action would be to break up. 

I waited until August 6th to end things with her officially because I didn't want her to think I was ending it with her to be with this girl from my internship. (I never told her this is why I waited). When I ended it with my ex gf I started seeing the girl from my internship. I told her I didn't want to date, but I definitely started seeing her very soon after my break up, I just felt like she was giving me the attention that I really needed and had lost from my ex over distance. Anyways, in late October I had started talking to my ex again while still seeing this other girl (unofficially). Then I ended up getting an offer from the same company my ex was at. After the interview and getting the offer I met up with my ex to see if she would take me back, and that I could work at the same company and we could do everything like we had planned.

She told me she didn't want to get back together while we were at distance. This crushed me, and I said some things that were untrue and out of spite. At this same time I ended it with the girl I was unofficially seeing as I didn't want to keep stringing her along. I kept trying to talk to talk to my ex for about a month, I told her that I accepted the job at her company, and I tried to act as casual as possible. Then over Thanksgiving she told me we shouldn't talk much anymore, that she was seeing someone else. 

Since then I have done a pretty good job to not talk to her much or say anything more than being friendly. We talked for a bit over XMAS-New Years, but it was all pretty casual conversation. I had bought her some spoons for her birthday earlier in the year (Dec 27th, she collects spoons). She called me on the 29th to thank me, I acted like it was no big deal and that I was doing really well. Her voice on the phone sounded kinda sad, but it seemed like she didn't want to say anything more than just thanking me, so I just acted chipper and gave her my best wishes and hung up.

At this point am stuck with what I should do until this summer. She isn't seeing the new guy officially on Facebook at this point, and I don't really want to start anything new with anyone with the short time span I have left at school. I don't know if I should just continue to just not talk to her, or if I should send her a casual message once a month to see how shes doing? Should I start trying to move on and not plan for us to get back together when I move? Is it okay for me to send her a kind of closure message to get the untrue things I said off of my conscious? I am mainly looking for a course of action for this situation.

Thank you for any advice!

7nrg8g,1,2018-01-02,Failing two classes my sophomore year-can I recover from this?,slowlysleeping,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7nrg8g/failing_two_classes_my_sophomore_yearcan_i/,"Hey y'all,

I'm a current premed at my state school, and wasn't doing TOO bad. until now.
I came in with 27 credits from AP scores my freshman year, and I got a 3.68 the first semester. Not too bad, especially for a first semester. Then, second semester rolled around and I got a 3.38. No real excuse there-I was lazy. Especially with Gen Chem II as an 8 am-lots of times where I would sleep in. :/ At this point, my overall GPA was a 3.51.

Now, this semester, as a sophomore, I took Calc I, Bio I (including lab), and Physics I (including lab). And man did I mess up. My family life was kind of tanking at this point; there was a death in my immediate family and I lost my motivation to fix the situation around me. So, grades haven't come out yet, but I'm pretty sure I got a B in Bio (including lab thats 5 credits) , and probably failed Physics and Calc. Or, if I didn't fail my finals, I probably got C-'s. I got an A in my Physics lab, which is only worth 1 credit. Physics is worth 3, and Calc is worth 4. My bio lab class and lecture is grouped in together, which is why Bio averages out to be a B.

I'm really disappointed in myself. I KNOW I could have done better-I wanted to be an astrophysicist before medicine- it really was the way I approached my study habits, and the way I handled the roadblocks in my personal life. So now, I'm scared. This is going to hurt my overall GPA. If I start an upward trend now, as in getting all A's, do you think I could have a fighting chance?

DO schools have always been of interest to me, too. But, I would love to go to an MD school. My extracurriculars are not too shabby, either. I did research my senior year of high school and the paper is under review for publication, but I'm not too sure if high school stuff counts. I have lots of volunteer hours with two nursing homes. Oh, and I worked as an intern at a hospital one summer, and plan to go to Nicaragua this summer as part of my club to shadow doctors and aid with supplies (hopefully-we still have to fundraise!)

My GPA is taking a hit. Question is, if I manage to patch it up second semester of sophomore year and onward, and kill the MCAT, can I rectify my mistake?

7nrjjb,12,2018-01-02,Riding and College: Tips for prospective collegiate riders,Bronegan,Horses,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horses/comments/7nrjjb/riding_and_college_tips_for_prospective/,"I've seen a few reddit posts of people interested in riding and college so I figured I'd share a few points about it, at least as it pertains to colleges in the United States.

**Introduction**

College is a big decision for people.  To narrow down a school based on career prospects and location is a daunting task, and it isn't made any easier if you consider other factors as well.  I can't really offer you any insight on how to decide which school has the best food, but I can help you look at equestrian opportunities of various schools.  These ultimately boil down to 3 separate types: school run equestrian programs, student run programs, and private barns.  They all have their pros and cons which I've listed below.





**School Run Equestrian Programs**

These programs are run by the college or university at facilities that are often owned by the college/university.  Competitive riding teams are often coached by college faculty.  Many of these schools have much smaller student communities that may only number in the hundreds to a few thousands

*Pros*

* Equestrian centers are a part of campus, thus there is usually easy transportation or access by the students to them.

* Many schools will use their equestrian centers as classrooms and provide majors related to the equine industry.

* Many schools and programs have easy access to the equine industry through personal networks of the faculty.  Can make finding an equine job very easy.

* Some schools have a very good reputation for their equine programs and can make getting an internship or job much easier.

* Horse show competitions can be held on campus, definitely beats getting up at 4AM for a 3 hour drive to another school (You'll probably still have to get up at 4AM to care for the horses though).

*Cons*

* Can be quite competitive. If you aren't riding that frequently, you might not make it onto the competition teams.  Some of the riders who are applying for these schools ride daily and compete regularly within organizations like USEF and AQHA. If you do make it to the team, then showing is usually mandatory.

* Many schools running their own equine programs will not have nearly as much variety in choice of majors for other fields.  Also, the programs they do have may not be as highly ranked.

* Can be rather expensive.  An equestrian center with a couple dozen horses usually isn't cheap.

**Student Run Organizations**


These kind of programs are run by the students, for the students with support from the college/university.  They will often hire a nearby horse trainer/barn owner to be the coach for the team.  Different colleges offer differing amounts of support to the team and some schools cover all travel expenses for collegiate competitions.

*Pros*

* Excellent leadership opportunities if you're interested. Lead the team as captain, or manage the finances.  Be in charge of membership or team events.  Any of these positions give valuable experience for any career.

* Can be very economical, depending on school support.  It will almost always be cheaper than riding at a school run program.

* Can be found almost anywhere in the country.  Schools you might not associate with horses very likely do have a team.

* Will usually be much more laid back and open to anyone.  Usually more beginner friendly than other programs, competitions are usually optional, and will usually have a larger variety of rider backgrounds.

* Larger schools will often have very good programs and a wide variety of majors to choose from (Engineering might not have a lot to do with horses but at least you'll have the money for a horse! Time is another issue entirely)

*Cons*

* Programs are often unknown.  You may have to look for the program.  (Ohio State has an equestrian team?!?! Yes. Yes they do.)

* The teams will usually not attract the best riding talent from high school, though it would be unwise to dismiss them for it.

* Many of these teams need to fundraise or participate in community service.


**Private Barns**

If the school doesn't have a student equestrian team or an equestrian program of their own, odds are there is a local private barn with riding lessons available to you.  These are going to be local trainers or horse owners that are horse crazy and proud of it!

*Pros*

* You can find one just about anywhere in the continental USA, Canada, and even Alaska! I can't speak for Hawaii but they probably exist there too.

* Usually very flexible with lessons. Only constraint is YOUR schedule.

* Small barn families make for great stories and adventures.  The dorm won't be your home, the barn is!

* Working student positions are more likely to exist

* There is rarely only just one barn nearby, enabling you to compare lesson prices if you wish.

*Cons*

* Very limited, if any, competition opportunities.

* Getting rides to and from the barn without a car can prove challenging

* Local barn owners may not have enough experience to teach beyond a certain level


Though these are 3 basic categories, every program is different and there will be advantages and disadvantages that might not be listed above.  I encourage you to look at each program individually.  Next, I'm going to discuss competition organizations.





**Collegiate Competitions**

At the collegiate level, there are multiple organizations that oversee the competitive riding teams across the country.  Some are specific to schools, while others cater to a specific discipline.  Some of the main programs in the United States are the NCEA (National Collegiate Equestrian Association), the IHSA (Intercollegiate Horse Show Association), IDA (Intercollegiate Dressage Association), and the American National Riding Commission (ANRC).


*NCEA*

A part of the NCAA, this organization oversees women's equestrian teams across 23 United States schools.  This is the only one of the 4 that is exclusively for women.  The NCEA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining (in other words, both hunt seat and western riding).  For more information, check out their website at http://www.collegiateequestrian.com/


*IHSA*

Founded by Bob Cacchione (I have a mug signed by him) in 1967, this organization has grown to serve almost 400 schools across the continental United States and Canada.  The organization has approximately 8400 riders participating in horse shows all across the country.  The IHSA offers competitions in Equitation on the Flat, Equitation over Fences, Horsemanship, and Reining.  The main difference between the IHSA and NCEA, besides member schools, is the IHSA does not have any gender restrictions.  Also, while they both offer the same assortmant of riding diciplines, the scoring system between them are different.  The IHSA offers competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.ihsainc.com/        For a listing of current teams, check out https://members.ihsainc.com/publicteaminfo/currentteams.aspx


*IDA*

Founded as an informal competition between northeastern United States schools in 1995, the IDA now has more than 50+ member schools across the country.  The organization provides competitions for Dressage, possibly the most ""artsy"" form of riding (I don’t mean this in a dismissive way, I have the greatest respect to those who make dressage look easy).  They offer competition classes suitable for all levels of riding.  For more information, check out their website at http://www.teamdressage.com/home


*ANRC*

Founded in 2006 and an affiliate of the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) and the United States Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA), the ANRC has served 80 schools through the ANRC Intercollegiate Equitation Championship.  Riders may compete in one of two levels: a National level at 3’ and a Novice level at 2’6”.  Teams and riders are judged in their performance through 4 phases of competition.  For more information, check out their website at http://anrc.org/





**Conclusion and Author's Note**

There is a lot of information out there for prospective collegiate riders, and trust me when I say that you don't have to give up your riding just to go to school.  So many opportunities exist for almost every interest, and I can practically guarantee that you will find a school and a riding program that is right for you.  Some schools even have multiple teams, which can give you the opportunity to compete in multiple collegiate organizations.  

My own experience with collegiate riding has been through a student run organization (Semi Varsity Club Sport) and I have primarily competed within the IHSA.  My knowledge of the other competitions are limited to what I could gather from their own websites and Google so I encourage you to do your own research into those organizations or contact them and ask directly.  If you have questions specific to the IHSA or student run equestrian teams, my own experience can probably answer your question or at least point you in the right direction.  

Lastly, many teams (student run and school run) have websites with information about their team.  Some of these teams offer programs like a ""Test Ride"" where high school students can get a tour of campus and of equestrian facilities, a lesson or introduction with the team coach, and a day as a ""member"" of the team.  Take advantage of these and see what a day in the life of a collegiate equestrian is like.  For the IHSA specifically, their member list that I provided has links to many of these websites.  Take a look at what is out there, you'll find something.

A little background about myself, I am a finance senior at Baruch but I will be graduating in Dec 2018 due to having to retake FIN 3610. My GPA is 3.05 (I rounded up to 3.1 on my resume) which I know is very low. I have no professional experiences before, only part-time and restaurant jobs. Since I'm only taking 1 class this spring, I'm trying to do one or even two internships while going to school this semester and another one in summer to increase my chances of job placement after graduation. 

I have been trying to apply on LinkedIn, Starr Search, Indeed with little to no luck for a while. I also went to career center multiple time to fix my resume and cover letter.

I have also started to contact all the professionals that I know to set up informational interviews for networking. I'm thinking of looking for a recruiter also but I don't know if any are available for internship placement, especially for someone with my limited qualification.

If anybody who has been or know someone in this similar situation that can offer some insights or advice, even story on how you have gotten your internship then It would be much appreciated. Let me know if there is any extra work that you think I should do. At this point, I don't even mind if it's an unpaid one (I have only applied to paid-internship until a week ago, then I started to apply for the unpaid ones too), as long as it has something to do with finance or accounting and not a cold call, sale marketing job.

Thank you so much for taking the time out to read this long post.

1. What occurs during the interview day?

2. What is considered a “good” SAT/PSAT score for admission?

3. How many people are accepted from any given high school (max)?

4. Are the long hours of homework worth it? Do you feel like you are learning the material better than you did at your other high school?

5. How does the different scheduling work (an average “week” at GSSM)?

6. How difficult is the summer internship?

7nsbpb,2,2018-01-02,"For first-time data analyst internships, to show that I have experience in Excel and SQL, would online courses with certificates of achievements be some good evidence?",fantasticsky_hng,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/7nsbpb/for_firsttime_data_analyst_internships_to_show/,"Hi everyone, I am using the Winter break to draft my resume for Summer data analyst internships. Most of the companies usually ask for experience in SQL, Excel and R or/and Python as a plus. At this point, all decent data analysis projects of mine are done in R, as it is used for instruction at my university. Although I have not done something fancy with Excel and SQL, I am still taking some online courses to learn more about them. With the certificates of achievements from these courses, I wonder if I would be able to convince employers that I have the experience to apply in the work. As I have learned with serious effort, not just for the sake of earning certificates, when it comes to interviews and they ask some questions about Excel or SQL, I believe I can handle it. 

Here is what I think. If they know I can use a statistical language like R to do data analysis projects, they will believe I am already familiar with the methodology of the tasks like joining datasets, group by, data visualization, etc., which are translational to Excel and SQL. Perhaps they don't mind giving me some time to learn the syntax. I don't know if this is true or not, though!

Please help me if you can. I value all inputs. Thank you so much and happy new year!"

For three months, I've been seeing a girl who I initially met a year and a half ago. Let's call her Ray. Ray is a successful professional in print and digital media, socially popular, attractive, naturally friendly, confident people person. I have not been successful professionally, don't have a fulltime job right now, have a lot problems going back to early childhood, and have stunted social skills to this day because of it. I'm trying to change my life right now and have been doing better for a few years, but nowhere near her level.


Ray showed interest in me from the first time we met, but she wasn't the type I usually like and choose not to pursue her offers of hanging out. She continued to message me on facebook though, and she would ask me every once in a while to hang out but I would always deflect. Three months ago, I invited Ray be on the guestlist for a private show for a rapper I knew she was a big fan of. As far as what most people we've talked to think happened, she was going to bar and ordering drinks for both us- someone must have tried to put something in a drink thinking it was for her, and it ended up going to me instead. I don't remember anything else from that the second half of the night but sitting on my bed vomiting, then going to shower and her asking if she could join me and saying yes. I don't know what extent we had sex or not but I guess it does't matter.
I woke up thinking this person will never respect me again and want nothing to do with me, but it was the opposite. She started texting me nonstop, every day, immediately broke up with her boyfriend ect. I thought I would give her a chance. I liked her as a person, I never hung out with her because I didn't want to send the wrong message, but otherwise she is a cool person and is also successful, financially independent, and clearly WANTED to be with me, which is better then frankly any relationship I've ever been in. The problem is she is turning out to be extremely insecure and submissive, wanting me to tell her what to do, and needs assurance 24/7 from me going as far as to seek out negative attention when I don't give her positive attention.


She texts me everyday, literally a more then 24 hours cannot go by without her trying to communicate with me in some form. She asks me advice on what shoes she should buy, where she can buy cool clothes. I told her my experience is primarily in men's fashion industry, still asked me five more time what shoes to get. Asks me what tattoo she should get. Asks me to give feedback on her media work. Asks me to do things a intern could do for her at her job, for free, but offers to pay me. Overshares information and asks me dumb shit just to fill in what I feel is absolutely normal silence periods in two people hanging out.


She also frequently takes neutral comments and puts a negative interpretation on them. What is most troubling to me is she keeps bringing up things she knows I do not want to talk about because I told her. For example: I do not want ever heard about the rapper we went to see, because it reminds me of vomiting tequila and A1 steak sauce. Asked her not to talk shit about an acquaintance we both know, keeps bringing him up. Can provide screenshots of text messages of this dynamic.

Ray asked me ( before we started dating) what my type was. She told me in the same conversation that her ideal man is career driven, ambitious ex-model/actor ect who got out of the business, and used his savings to start a career behind the lens - basically the opposite of me right now in life. That was kind of red flag for me and I found it very odd.


The disturbing part is when I do manage to get irritated she absolutely freaks out, tries to apologize and puts all the blame on herself. Even when it's probably not all her fault. These are small disagreements, bullshit really. I don't even want to think what is going to happen if we get into a real fight, about real shit. I found out she has had issues with her father her whole teen years and adulthood, but I'm not a stereotypical ""bad boy"" authority figure- she is the authority figure in every way in the situation! I don't get what is going on here at all.


Her ex-boyfriend was also very possessive, fighting with her all the time about what she was doing, controlling her social life and what they did, apparently saw her liking a photo of mine once on instagram and lost his shit. At the same time, also very reliant on her because he is an immigrant and his english sucked. She says she broke up with this guy because of his behavior, but she essentially broke up with him to date me, and would probably still be with him now if not for that. I am totally freaked out that this is what she wants in a relationship. I really don't want to take on that role. It's not me.


The worst part is the sexual aspect. I am the kind of person who want to have sex, do my job, and move on to to another activity. I'm boring AF, I don't have kinks, I don't have specific preferences, I've always gone with whatever the girl is into. She wants re-assurance every 5 minutes what she is doing is turning me on and asking what I'm ""into"" over and over. It has gone from annoying to truly uncomfortable. I honestly feel like she wants some kind of sexual emotional expression that I just don't have in my personality. Last time she was begging me to talk to her while we had sex. Literally "" Please, just say something to me, say my name, say anything"". It made me so uncomfortable I really didn't want to be there anymore or have sex with her. She also told me that she masturbates to memories of us having sex and asked if that bothers me. I just don't know what direction to interpret statements like that.
I don't know what to do. On paper this is by far the best girlfriend I have ever had, and most girls who pursue me are much more fucked up then her. I do care about her feelings and really enjoy and value the time we spend together, most of the time. I just don't understand what she wants from me. I also don't want to hurt her feelings.


**tl;dr:**  Girl pursues me very aggressively for a year, projects confident and high-achieving persona turns out to be insecure, nervous wreck. Wants me to tell her what to do in every aspect of the relationship and ( I suspect) trying to piss me off on purpose so I will be abusive and mean to her. Issues with dad, her ex was batshit crazy, controlled her behavior. This would be workable if I didn't suspect she is trying to recreate that dynamic with me. Feel increasing uncomfortable around her but she is a great person and much better then most girls I've dated."

This is probably a stupid thing to feel but I'm posting it anyways because IDK what else to do with it. Hence the throwaway account.

Every time I pass by the airport on the train, I think back to my internship from last summer, when I was living on my own in a completely different city, hundreds of miles from my friends and family. It was amazing. I had never had so much freedom, and so many options for how to live my life and what to do with my time. I loved being able to get lost in such a huge, awesome city. Better yet I was able to spend time on my passion, videography. Despite working 40 hours a week, I feel like I had even more time then than I do now to do the things I loved. I loved getting to start fresh and make new friends, even if it was intimidating at times. It was a great taste of freedom coming from someone who used to be a quiet kid from a Christian home in the suburbs.

But I've been back home for a whole semester now, and after that experience, which realistically for me will probably never happen again, I just feel like I'm missing something. I know that by all means I should be grateful for my life, and I am. Most of the boxes are checked--great relationship, decent grades, good friends and family, healthy physically and financially (for a college kid anyways.) 
But despite that, I feel like I'm not making the most of the moment. 

They always say to live every day like it's your last, but right now I feel stuck at college. Frankly, I wonder if I'm wasting my time. I probably won't be good enough by the time I graduate to compete in the job market, either, (my field is super competitive--even talented college grads have a hard time finding jobs.) And then I see people like my friend ""C"", an acquaintance, who decided to say ""fuck it"", and then proceeded to drop out, move to Brazil and follow his dream of shooting documentaries. He's doing pretty much exactly what I have always dreamed about and has been pretty successful, all things considered. The difference is he took the risk of dropping out of college, and I haven't. It's hard seeing other people who are the same age as you accomplishing exactly what you want to do, especially when you don't know if the work you're doing now (college) will actually pay off.


On one hand, I feel like dropping out of school wouldn't make sense. I have 3 semesters left, won't really graduate with debt, and generally enjoy the program...but on the other hand, I feel like I could be accomplishing so much more by taking a risk and following my dream. I have a project I want to work on, the drive to do it and the resources to get started. I just won't be able to until I graduate.
I also hesitate because my family wouldn't be supportive of throwing away my college education, and it would mean moving away from my girlfriend, who I really don't want to lose.

I know this all sounds petty and maybe I'm just being impatient. But I feel like in some ways, I'm holding myself back from attaining my goals, even if staying in college is the ""right"" thing to do. But on the other hand, dropping out would have consequences that I don't know I want to face. It's just been hard to figure out what the right choice is. My friends tell me to just enjoy where I'm at, but I don't know if that's always the right advice, you know? What do you do when there are aspects of your life you really want to change, but you can't without fucking up other parts?

7nu7xr,2,2018-01-03,36M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7nu7xr/36m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - /r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Visitor to the porn set - Your friend is a well known porn star, and she travels the world for shoots to all sorts of glamorous places. She has taken you to a few shoots so you fully understand how in control of things she is. She surprises you with a trip to a luxurious mansion on an island where she is shooting, you have most of the time to relax but she has to work for a couple of days. On the set, one of the male performers starts chatting to you and you are finding it hard to resist.

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"
7nua5d,9,2018-01-03,2018 MGM Draft Do-Over,nate---dogg,MaddenGMs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaddenGMs/comments/7nua5d/2018_mgm_draft_doover/,"Hey guys, thought I’d churn out a bit more content to get us hyped for the 2021 draft. With the benefit of hindsight, I thought it would be fun to cast our minds back to 2018, our first draft in MGM18. Would teams pick differently if they knew how things would pan out? Hindsight is always 20/20, but here’s my take on how teams should have picked back in 2018:  
  
##1) New York Jets  
**Original Pick**: QB, Lawrence “LP” Patterson, Florida State  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: Current Ratings: 93 OVR, Star Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: Stick  
  
LP was the 2019 League MVP and *is* the Jets franchise. He was a no-brainer pick in 2018, and there is no way the Jets would pass up the chance to land their man if they had a do-over.  
    
##2) Baltimore Ravens    
**Original Pick**: ROLB, Cory Scandrick, Ohio State  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 80 OVR, Star Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 94 OVR, Star Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: Stick 
  
I’ve got Baltimore sticking with Scandrick here, who has emerged as one of the league’s top linebackers over the last three seasons. Scandrick is a leader on the Ravens’ defense and will be around for a long time to come.  
  
##3) Arizona Cardinals  
**Original Pick**: QB, Mason Mueller, Colorado  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 73 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 88 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
   
**New Pick**: Stick  
  
There’s little doubt that – at the time – Mason Mueller was a reach at 3rd overall. But the Cardinals’ decision has been more than vindicated by play of the Pro Bowler and former Rookie of the Year. Mueller is a legitimate franchise QB in a league desperate for quality signal callers.  
  
##4) Cincinnati Bengals      
**Original Pick**: MLB, Clayton Calmelat, BYU    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Quick Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 93 OVR, Quick Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: Stick 
  
Unusually, I think all four of the teams picking early in 2018 will be very happy with what they got. Clayton Calmelat was a shock pick at 4, but he is another who has repaid the faith shown in him by his franchise. Calmelat is already one of the NFL’s best linebackers, and at only 24, the sky is the limit for the former BYU man.  
   
##5) Los Angeles Rams    
**Original Pick**: DE, D.J. Ivy, Florida  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: CB/S, Brady Ellingsworth, Nevada (drafted 1.20 by the Falcons)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 74 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 93 OVR, Star Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
DJ Ivy has been a good player for LA, but it’s clear that he’s not quite in the upper echelon of players that came out of the class of 2018. Here, I’ve got them taking Atlanta’s do-it-all defensive back, Brady Ellingsworth. Ellingsworth is a top-tier Safety that can also play Corner, and is the best nickel back/slot defender in the NFL. He’d be a great pick at 5th overall.  
  
##6) San Francisco 49ers      
**Original Pick**: LT/LG, Henry Considine, Ole Miss  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Quick Dev, 25 y.o.  
   
**New Pick**: QB, Morgan Teggart, Beth Cookman (drafted 3.18 by the Giants)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 73 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 89 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
Considine has been solid but unspectacular for the ‘Niners, which is a far cry from what they thought they had when they drafted the Ole Miss standout. Considine has struggled in pass protection as a pro, and been kicked inside to LG as a result. He’s a good player, but 1.6 is clearly far too high to take a Guard. Instead, why not get a franchise quarterback? Morgan Teggart slipped through the clutches of teams around the league, falling all the way to the Giants in the middle of the third round. Since replacing Eli Manning, Teggart has proven himself as a Top 5-10 QB in the league, and has earned Pro Bowl honours.  
   
##7) Arizona Cardinals      
**Original Pick**: SS, Tyson Hankerson, Pittsburgh  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Star Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 93 OVR, Star Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: Stick 
  
2018 was a crazy year, Gary actually nailed his draft picks. Tyson Hankerson has been a difference maker in the secondary for the Cardinals, and I think they will be happy with the production they’ve got out of the former 7th overall pick.  
  
##8) Miami Dolphins     
**Original Pick**: CB, Patrick Long, Florida  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 84 OVR, Star Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 91 OVR, Star Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: Stick 
  
Patrick Long was an awesome, awesome player who should be a lot better than he is. But unfortunately, he was drafted by Miami, who’s eccentric Head Coach/GM – Nolan “Blu” Peters – believes in Yoga classes rather than film study for his players. Long managed to escape the Miami Yoga Retreat before the 2020 draft, when Miami traded up to 1st overall to take QB Johnny Rocca. Since then, he has kicked on and developed nicely in Denver. He was such a good player, that Miami has to stick with their guy here though.  
  
##9) Buffalo Bills      
**Original Pick**: LG, Craig French, UCLA  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Slow Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: C, Alexander Francis, Clemson (drafted 1.24 by the Chargers)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 98 OVR, SS, 25 y.o.  
  
I hated this pick at the time, and I hate it even more now. A Guard at 9th overall is never, ever good value, and French has clearly struggled as a pro, earning a development downgrade to Slow. But if Buffalo really wanted to take an interior O lineman with this pick, they should have at least chosen the league’s best Center, the Chargers’ Alex Francis. Francis was a core component of LA’s recent Super Bowl win, and is on course for a Hall of Fame career thus far.  
  
##10) Denver Broncos  
**Original Pick**: HB, Craig Hope, Oregon    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 80 OVR, Star Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 95 OVR, Star Dev, 26 y.o.  
    
**New Pick**: Stick 
  
Denver will be very happy with the production they’ve got out of Craig Hope so far, and they will be *hoping* he continues his progression. Hope isn’t a household name amongst NFL fans, but he has quietly become one of the League’s best running backs.  
  
##11) Buffalo Bills      
**Original Pick**: TE, Raymond “Baby Driver” Fassitt, Oregon  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Slow Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Slow Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: WR, Chioke Brazell, Wyoming (drafted 1.32 by Philadelphia)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Quick Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 88 OVR, Star Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
The name-changing, Gucci-wearing, bling-toting, Mercedes-crashing former Oregon Tight End Raymond “Baby Driver” Fassitt has actually been a surprisingly productive pro, despite his clear mental retardation and diva attitude. But the opportunity to draft a true playmaker here – Philly’s Chioke Brazell – is too good to pass up for the Bills. Brazell was considered a reach by some at the end of the first round in 2018, but he has quickly become one of the best all-round receivers in the NFL.  
  
##12) Arizona Cardinals      
**Original Pick**: C/T, Kody Crick, Nebraska    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: LT, Dion Eason, Air Force (drafted 1.26 by Philadelphia)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 76 OVR, Quick Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 89 OVR, Quick Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
Heads were scratched in 2018 when the Cardinals chose Kody Crick over Alex Francis, and time has done little to assuage those criticisms, given Francis’ stellar career so far in Los Angeles. Crick has been solid, but Arizona might have been happier had they taken another great Eagles player from this draft class, Offensive Tackle Dion Eason. Eason was a raw prospect coming out of Air Force, but he has now matched technique to his obvious athletic capabilities.  
   
##13) Tennessee Titans      
**Original Pick**: S, Benton Barnett, Pittsburgh  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 80 OVR, Quick Dev, 24 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Quick Dev, 27 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: S, Larry Kinney, Tennessee (drafted at 1.15 by New Orleans)  	 
  
* Rookie Ratings: 81 OVR, Quick Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 90 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
The Titans passing on hometown hero Larry Kinney drew the ire of fans back in ’18, so why not redress that now? Barnett has been a solid pro, but Kinney is a better player – despite a difficult season that saw him lose his Quick dev trait.  
  
##14) Baltimore Ravens    
**Original Pick**: HB, Frank “Stay Golden” Golden, Miami  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 82 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: CB, Gordon Buck, Pittsburgh (drafted at 2.1 by New York Jets)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 70 OVR, Avg Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Quick Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
Stay Golden was a key piece in a blockbuster trade the Ravens made with the Jacksonville Jaguars to acquire Leonard Fournette a year after this draft pick, but in retrospect, they might have preferred a top-tier corner at this spot. The Jets’ Gordon Buck was a surprising pick at 33rd overall in 2018, but he has emerged as a Pro Bowl talent at the position and a legit CB1.  
  
##15) New Orleans Saints      
**Original Pick**: FS, Larry Kinney, Tennesee    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 81 OVR, Quick Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 90 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: S, Sergio Daniels, Miami (drafted at 1.30 by Carolina)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 88 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
With Larry Kinney staying in Tennessee in this do-over, I’ve got the Saints taking Sergio Daniels instead with this pick. Daniels has been an excellent safety for the Panthers, equally capable of playing in coverage and down in the box.  
  
##16) Indianapolis Colts      
**Original Pick**: DE, Andre Trucks, Auburn    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: DE, D.J. Ivy, Florida (drafted at 1.5 by Los Angeles Rams)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
Trucks has been a solid pro for the Colts, but probably a little rich for my blood at 16th overall in this do-over. Instead, why not take the man who originally went top 5 to the Rams, Florida’s DJ Ivy? While Ivy hasn’t set the world on fire in LA, he has a higher ceiling than Trucks at this point of his career.  
    
##17) Dallas Cowboys      
**Original Pick**: TE, Jorell Flynn, Ole Miss    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 83 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: DT, Martinez Poole, Wyoming (drafted at 2.12 by Los Angeles Chargers)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 72 OVR, Avg Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 89 OVR, Avg Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
Jorell Flynn hasn’t been the Jason Witten replacement Dallas hoped for when they spent the 17th overall pick on the former Ole Miss man three years ago. So why not take a rock solid defensive lineman instead to solidify your team against the run and help your pass rush? Martinez Poole has been one of the unsung heroes of the Chargers’ Super Bowl-winning defense, and would have been a good pick for the Cowboys.  
    
##18) New York Giants      
**Original Pick**: LT/G, Lindsey Patterson, Louisville  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 77 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: LB, Vincent Garcia, Rice (drafted at 2.8 by Miami)    
   
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Star Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Star Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
Speaking to the Gav, the Giants GM, I know they’re pretty satisfied with what they’ve got out of “the other LP” so far. But perhaps taking Miami’s talented linebacker Vincent Garcia would have made a lot of sense here in retrospect… Drafting Garcia would have meant the Giants didn’t need to give up their first round pick to acquire Myles Jack from the Jaguars, and would have given them a pick to add another stud in 2019.  
  
##19) Chicago Bears      
**Original Pick**: RT, Bram Graddy, Miami    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 76 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 83 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: WR, Dirone Schilens, Notre Dame (drafted at 2.29 by New York Jets)    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 72 OVR, Avg Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Quick Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
Bram Graddy has been an ever-present on the Bears’ O line, but is a red chip type of player that will never ascend to the upper echelons of his position group. Imagine instead if the Bears had taken LP’s favourite receiver instead? Dirone Schilens is a 2x Pro Bowler and one of the faces of the New York Jets. Mitchell Trubisky would be salivating at the prospect of having a weapon like Schilens to throw to.  
  
##20) Atlanta Falcons      
**Original Pick**: S/CB, Brady Ellingsworth, Nevada  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 74 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 93 OVR, Star Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: DT, Gerard Gratz, Kansas State (drafted at 3.11 by Kansas City)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 75 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 88 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
With Ellingsworth off the board long ago in this do-over, I have the Falcons addressing one of their historical weaknesses at defensive tackle with this pick. Gerard Gratz underachieved last along with the rest of his Chiefs team mates, but the former Kansas State man is a massive talent that will surely bounce back to form in 2021.  
  
##21) Washington Redskins      
**Original Pick**: LT/LG, Grayson Rubin, Oregon  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 81 OVR, Slow Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: LT/LG, Henry Considine, Ole Miss (drafted at 1.7 by San Francisco)    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Quick Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
Grayson Rubin has endured a difficult start to his NFL career, giving up more sacks than just about any offensive lineman. He has barely progressed and has lost a dev trait. Clearly this pick didn’t work out too well for the ‘Skins. Henry Considine was taken a little too high at 6th overall (knowing what we know now), but he’d be excellent value here for Washington and would be a big upgrade over Rubin.  
   
##22) Jacksonville Jaguars      
**Original Pick**: QB, Cameron Wragge, Oregon  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 74 OVR, Slow Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 75 OVR, Slow Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: WR, Kahlbuto Sullivan, Oregon State (drafted at 5.13 by Minnesota)  
   
* Rookie Ratings: 72 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 84 OVR, Star Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
Wragge entered his senior year at Oregon as the nation’s top QB prospect, but tumbled down boards in the run up to the draft as rumours about his hard-partying lifestyle emerged. Wragge got the starting nod as a rookie in 2018, but played terribly and has since been a backup in Jacksonville. Terrible pick. Instead, I have the Jags taking Minnesota’s 2x Pro Bowl Receiver/Returner, Kahlbuto Sullivan. Sullivan has emerged as one of the NFL’s deadliest slot receivers over the last two years, and would have been a great pick for the Jags at this spot.  
  
##23) Philadelphia Eagles      
**Original Pick**: OG, Henry Young, USC  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 77 OVR, Avg Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 83 OVR, Avg Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: LT/G, Lindsey Patterson, Louisville (drafted at 1.18 by New York Giants)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 77 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
While Henry Young hasn’t been bad as a pro, he hasn’t been great either. The Giants’ Patterson would definitely represent an upgrade at this spot.  
  
##24) Los Angeles Chargers    
**Original Pick**: C, Alexander Francis, Clemson    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Star Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 98 OVR, Star Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: S, Lamarcus Britton, Idaho State (drafted at 2.8 by Buffalo)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Quick Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Star Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
With Alex Francis long-gone in this alternate reality, I have the Chargers taking Lamarcus Britton here, who has played well for the Bills since being selected at 40th overall. Grabbing Britton here would have meant Strong Safety wasn’t on their list of requirements for the 2019 draft, freeing up a top 10 pick for the Chargers that could have been dealt or used on another playmaker... rather than on a certain half-star Safety.    
  
##25) Minnesota Vikings      
**Original Pick**: LT, Mike “El Matador” Horton, Clemson
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 83 OVR, Slow Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: LB, Clinton Hughes, Penn (drafted at 2.18 by New York Giants)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 71 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
Horton endured a horrific rookie season for the Vikings that earned him the nickname “El Matador” from the fans, thanks to his penchant for allowing pass rushers through for sacks. But since then, Horton has actually played very well (and has now been traded to the Dolphins). While Horton hasn’t been as bad as his reputation suggests, there’s no doubt Minnesota would not have used 1.25 on the former Clemson standout had they known how he’d struggle early in his career. Instead, let’s take Clinton Hughes, who has developed into a very good linebacker in his time with the Giants.  
  
##26) Philadelphia Eagles      
**Original Pick**: LT, Dion Eason, Air Force    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 76 OVR, Quick Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 89 OVR, Quick Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: TE, Raymond “Baby Driver” Fassitt, Oregon (drafted at 1.11 by Buffalo)  
   
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Slow Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 87 OVR, Slow Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
With Eason off the board now, grabbing Baby Driver would have been a good pick at the end of the first. Despite the fanfare, entourage, and histrionics that accompany the CEO of the Gucci Gang, he would have been a great option for Carson Wentz in the passing game.  
  
##27) Tennessee Titans      
**Original Pick**: DT, Davin Hammond, Clemson  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 81 OVR, Avg Dev, 24 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Avg Dev, 27 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: Stick 
  
Nose Tackle Davin Hammond was one of the unsung heroes of Tennessee’s run towards Super Bowl LIV, and he was instrumental in shutting down Atlanta’s high-powered offense in the big game. While Hammond will never be truly elite given his age, he has been a strong presence on a very good defense. I think the Titans would stick with Hammond here.  
  
##28) Denver Broncos      
**Original Pick**: OG, Mike Koenen, Michigan State  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 77 OVR, Avg Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 83 OVR, Avg Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: S, Benton Barnett, Pittsburgh (drafted at 1.13 by Tennessee)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 80 OVR, Quick Dev, 24 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 86 OVR, Quick Dev, 27 y.o.  
  
Mike Koenen has been a serviceable starter but little more for the Broncos. Not quite the sort of production you expect from a first round pick. They might have been better served taking one of the many excellent safeties that came out of this draft class, such as Tennessee’s Benton Barnett.  
  
##29) Seattle Seahawks      
**Original Pick**: WR, Warren Motta, Baylor    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 74 OVR, Avg Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 77 OVR, Avg Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**Original Pick**: HB, Frank “Stay Golden” Golden, Miami (drafted at 1.14 by Baltimore)  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 82 OVR, Avg Dev, 22 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Avg Dev, 25 y.o.  
  
Eyebrows were raised when Warren Motta was picked at 29th overall by the Seahawks (over the likes of Chioke Brazell, Kahlbuto Sullivan and Dirone Schilens, no less), and those eyebrows show no signs of coming down three years later. Motta is currently a free agent and hasn’t been signed to an NFL team. He’ll be hoping to stick on a roster heading into the 2021 season, but the future looks bleak for the former first rounder. Hope he invested that signing bonus wisely! Instead, I have the ‘Hawks addressing their longstanding issues at HB by taking Frank Golden at 29.   
  
##30) Indianapolis Colts     
**Original Pick**: HB, B.J. Powell, Notre Dame  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 74 OVR, Avg Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 79 OVR, Avg Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: DE, Andre Trucks, Auburn (drafted at 1.16 by Indianapolis)    
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 85 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
Rumour has it that an intern accidentally submitted the wrong name to the league when BJ Powell was selected in 2018. It later transpired that that intern was none other than Moomoo Duncan Junior, the son of the disgraced former Buccaneers GM and black tar heroin enthusiast. Instead, let’s redeem the Colts’ draft by taking a man they originally selected at 1.16, Andre Trucks.  
    
##31) Carolina Panthers      
**Original Pick**: S, Sergio Daniels, Miami   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 78 OVR, Quick Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 88 OVR, Quick Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: CB, Antonio Coats, Oklahoma (drafted at 2.26 by Green Bay)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 69 OVR, Avg Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 82 OVR, Avg Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
With Sergio Daniels long-gone, getting some help at corner would have been a good choice for Carolina. Antonio Coats was a raw prospect, but has now emerged as a good starter for Green Bay. The Panthers would have needed to be patient with the former Oklahoma DB, but he has become a good player now and is still only 24 years old.  
  
##32) Philadelphia Eagles      
**New Pick**: WR, Chioke Brazell, Wyoming  
  
* Rookie Ratings: 79 OVR, Quick Dev, 21 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 88 OVR, Star Dev, 24 y.o.  
  
**New Pick**: LB, Asher Shea, Navy (drafted at 2.27 by Tennessee)   
  
* Rookie Ratings: 72 OVR, Avg Dev, 23 y.o.  
* Current Ratings: 83 OVR, Avg Dev, 26 y.o.  
  
Brazell was an amazing pick at 32, but he was taken long ago. So why not grab a linebacker like Asher Shea, previously of the Titans, now of the Buccaneers? Shea was a bit of a project, but the penny has dropped in the last year or so and he now flashes pro bowl potential.

7nudx5,2,2018-01-03,I screwed up,TryingToAskNicely,mixingmastering,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/comments/7nudx5/i_screwed_up/,"First off thank you for taking time to read this and for any feedback.
Brief history. I was very into music about 5 years ago graduated from CRAS with a 4.0 gpa did a internship with platinum selling artist yadda yadda yadda life hit had to get a job and music was on the back burner for a while.
Well my old band mates and I decided we would record/ cover a song. And I brought my ""mobile"" Recording rig( it's a little out dated but still enough to get decent recordings for a quick cover.)
Well  I tracked the bass with a DI and a mic 
Both tracks came out solid and than I moved onto the guitar. 
I got a Direct track and a mic'd track the performance was awful ( poor fellow had too many weeds)
So we decided to try again next week.

And so we recorded the guitar
It's a alternative rock song with a mix of cleans and distortion. The tracks I have just sound enemic. 
Now I'm used to tracking heavy metal guitar and getting that wall of guitar sound 
But I've been out of the game for a while and I know something is missing.
All the mixing I've done on the guitar I don't like it. So I'm going to start over 
Is there any tips or mixing techniques you guys may have for someone getting back into the swing of things. As far as EQ goes or how you would treat the clean vs distortion 

The vocals came out good and as a vocalist I can't stand mixing myself but I was pleased with the tracks and have plenty to work with to mix 
So In short
Bass- came out great and have a lot to work with
Vocals- came out great and have a lot to work with
Guitar- complete train wreck, I fucked up on the levels 

Now before you crucify me we only had a couple hours and I'm paying the price for it now.

TLDR
Any tips or tricks on how to add life to enemic guitar tracks or any tips on re amping the Direct track on a budget 

Thank you kindly for taking your time 
Enjoy the rest of your day

7nuzaf,2,2018-01-03,[M4F] In Search Of A MILF,Nick_Albe,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7nuzaf/m4f_in_search_of_a_milf/,"	I think every guy once had the desire to fuck a MILF. You know what I’m talking about, that neighbour that had a kid, but all the boys on the neighbourhood dreamed about fucking her. And as I think that are MILFs here that walkways wanted to fuck younger guys I’m bringing some prompts.

*****

**Soccer Mom**

	I was playing at the match when I saw you cheer on the grandstand. When I looked I saw an astonishing MILF with gym clothes that showed how hot your body is. 

	You seem to be someone’s mother, but who? I couldn’t stop thinking so I could talk to you.

*****

**High-School Teacher**

	I’m at detention today, but why is that? I was talking to a friend about how your big and juicy your ass and tits are. 

	When you enter by the door I give a little smile because I would have to spend two hours looking at your tits while you stay sited there. But will you stay seated?

*****

**Friend’s Mom**

	You are my friend’s mother, a MILF that knows that it’s a MILF. A beautiful body, that you like to show on your string bikini while yours sons friends enjoy themselves by the pool.

	That wears leggings and short-shorts with tops and tight blouses and dresses so people could appreciate and see your body

	Today your son invited me to go to the pool and here I am looking at you on your bikini with a boner...

*****

**Mother In Law**

	Here I am, next to your daughter, my girlfriend, introducing myself to you and your husband. Well... mostly you, because I can’t stop looking at you, your tits, your curves, your cleavage. 

	My cock is already hard and we are here about ten minutes, my mind is away from the living room, more precisely at the bedroom, where I’m imagining to fuck you.

*****

**Maid**

	Every now and then my parents employe a new maid and this time it’s you, and I can’t be happier. You are a astonishing MILF, and with the french maid costume it’s even better, hot as hell.

	One day when I come home from class I see you on your knees cleaning the floor, your ass up, the skirt barely covers it. My dick got hard and my backpack fell on the floor. You look back with a smile that I can’t decifre.

*****

**Boss**

	It’s my first internship and you are my boss. A thick, big tit boss, MILF boss.

	On the first day I noticed all male employee look at you with desire, and they surely have a good reason for doing that. You blouse shows your cleavage and your pencil skirt is tighter than college cheerleaders one. You make everyone dick gets hard and you know it.

*****

**Workmate**

	You work with me at my internship since I started here. You as an employee and me as an intern. You are recently graduated so you know how my life at work is difficult.

	Since day one you offered to help me with everything at work from paperwork to make contacts and rise at the company.

        Tonight is the night I’m signing my contract and we are having an office party after, maybe you are going to help me with one last thing.

*****

         These were some prompts I came up with, if you have any other idea just send it on your message. Here’s my [DPP Profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/74yixv/m4f_nick_albe/?st=J8NEGQOY&amp;sh=56921c66), there’s my kink list and some information you may want to know."

I'm 21 y/o from the midwest, next week I start my senior year of college majoring in Networking Technologies. Throughout my time at university I've worked, lived at home, and received a lot of financial help that comes with being a military dependent. 

Going into this final year I have paid my tuition off in full, I do not owe a single penny in debt, even in credit cards, and even have a few extra thousand put away. I am interested in letting that money work for me instead of waiting on my hands. Also, over the summer I will be having a well paying internship for the market in my area.

I feel like making it to this point is an accomplishment, but I want to continue to prepare for my financial future proactively, any advice and/or reading and research materials you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated!

7nv5pg,0,2018-01-03,I can go to a us top 10 university for $35k/yr or a much lower ranked state school for effectively nothing. What to do?,30000_or_0,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7nv5pg/i_can_go_to_a_us_top_10_university_for_35kyr_or_a/,"I was recently accepted into what has basically been my dream school for the last several years. Aside from stellar academics, I like the location, and they have an emphasis on collaboration that really appeals to me. 

I don't have an actual financial aid package yet, but their calculator says I should have a net price of about 35k. My family cannot afford this, but they are willing to take out loans to pay for it. I think it seems like it would be worth it.

However, due to my academic achievements I have the option of going to an objectively worse--but still respectable--university (either UNM or UAF) for effectively nothing. I don't *really* see myself doing this, but it feels a little weird to pay 140k for college when I could pay like 10 total. 

The way I see it, the better school would give me much better networking and opportunities for internships or whatever else, as well as a stronger alumni network. I like the location far better than either of my free options, and I feel like I will constantly challenged as opposed to the other schools where I doubt that would be the case.

For more context, I plan on going into Electrical Engineering or CS, most likely a combined EECS major. 

Is it realistically worth the extra money to go to one of the best schools in the world (especially in engineering? Does anyone have experience with either situation? I understand that much of what anyone gets out of college depends on what they put into it, but I feel like I might be more motivated to put in as much as I can at a better school. 

Thanks!"

I wrote this piece as a small tip for those of us who are having some trouble running the numbers online or during the night. Or maybe those of us who are living in conservative cultures where hooking up is not really much of a thing.

So, I wanted to share this for a while, but was having some trouble finding the time for it (me being a serial procrastinator amongst other things). 

**Throughout most of my twenties** I had a serious problem in finding a good supply of options, when it came to girls. I was too shy to approach in public places during the day and when I did find the balls for it, the interaction felt forced and awkward. imagine being stuck with that coworker you never liked at the same table during lunchtime and having to make conversation. Night clubs weren’t an option either. I have a suspicion that my hearing is around 20% weaker than average and as a result I could never have a healthy conversation in any of these places. Apart from the fact that they are too loud, they are also full of a specific vibe you need to able to indulge in. In short, not my cup of tea. I am also not particularly photogenic. Some photos I look like a crackhead on the verge of an overdose but on a good day I look like an unwashed homeless man who has stolen some clean clothes from a passerby. Needless to say, I hit the point of diminishing returns within 5 minutes of jumping onto Tinder. But enough with the whining and let’s get to the point.

**Dance Schools**. I still remember the first time I stepped in a tango lesson and was greeted by the mid-twenties instructor who could easily pull the Megan Fox transformers belly shot and then some. I could hardly take me eyes off her to check out the other girls but when I did, I immediately realized that there was plenty potential for the young and unbuckled stud that I never was. Firstly, there were like 6 women, myself, another guy and an old dude, so, little competition. Secondly the women there were fit. (I assume it’s because the heavier built ladies would abstain from such stressful physical activities). Lastly, I knew I was up for meeting all of them, whether they wanted or not. With this in mind and not thinking any further (with anything other than Mr. Johnson down there) I took a membership for the school and proceeded to come in regularly.

 **Open up any pick up/ seduction book** and you won’t have to flip too much through the chapters before you start running into the concept of elevating physical intimacy. To do that, you need to make subtle touches on your subject in order to get her accustomed with your feel and presence in her personal space. A pinch of the elbow here, a slide of the hand across the back there and before you know it your hand rests comfortably just on top of her butt cheek. Normally unless you’ve mastered this technique or are the modern embodiment of Casanova, this is quite problematic. But It’s made a lot less difficult once you spent countless hours grinding against each other in a closed embrace on the tango floor. Sexual tension starts building up the minute you click in place with whoever you’ve chosen to chat while practicing this exercise or the other. It’s a valuable perk to have, think of it as having an internship the minute you start your college degree. Would make the business of getting a job a lot easier down the track.

**A few lessons into my tango quest**, I learned about a weekly event called milonga. This is where you get to meet former students and invite them on the floor, to show off your newly acquired moves. In behind the scenes it’s a great way of meeting girls that aren’t in your class or have graduated from the school. I noticed there were plenty of women just checking in every other week, possibly for some good time, or possibly to actually see if there is anyone new around the place. The atmosphere was pretty loose, there was wine and some food to chew on and the gorgeous lady that was running the club was showing up every single time giving me tips, and on few instances getting very flirtatious (having had a few glasses of wine). All in all, it was a good time, but here, is where I ran into a bit of a dead end.

**So, you might be thinking**, great, you’ve joined a dance school and met a few fit girls without anyone there to outhandsome you and spoil the party. Big deal, there isn’t any guarantee that any of them will like you, some will probably have partners already, and finally, you can meet 10x that number of girls if you just approach in public places and at various events. You would be right. After a while I was stuck attending a course whose teachings I was only slightly passionate about and where none of the ladies were really interested in me on any other level other than just being friends.

**To solve that I had to look at the bigger picture**. There is not one but 3 different tango schools in the 500k+ city I live in. Then there is also a Latin school which teaches salsa/bachata/kizomba. Each of these places offers the opportunity to pay per lesson or to join in as a member, which is where my key to finally quenching the seemingly insatiable appetite for women stood. Having finished my initial 3month course I decided that instead of continuing on at the intermediate level, I would only show up sporadically to hone my skills as well as see if there is anybody new, on a pay per lesson basis.  On the other days I could infiltrate other schools and check them out too. It works very well, tango is a rather difficult style, not all people have the patience to stick with it and as a result the turnover in these schools is rather high. To top that, women are drawn towards taking up dancing classes a lot more than men (unless you’re in Brisbane, Australia, screw that place), so there were almost always more girls than dudes in any given class.

 **Over the course of a few short months** I could meet dozens of young women, all of which felt a sense of commitment to being nice to me and where open to knowing me better because I wasn’t just another stranger who cold approached them on the bus, yesterday evening. I could then use dancing as a topic to chat them up, knowing full well that they were interested in it too. Garnishing all of that with quirky remarks and idiotic jokes is not only what finally got me laid (after a year of no action) but it gave me plenty options to choose from too. It gets better as well, because once you learn the fundamentals (it takes a good while), you start having an unspoken informal authority towards a newbie. You will give them pointers and hints thus acquiring even more chances to hit a connection. Girls will appreciate your ability to lead, confidence and passion (even if slightly fake) towards the cause.

**To finalize**, I am going to cover my arse here a little bit. I am not saying this a sweeping solution to all of your sexual frustrations. If you’re butt ugly, unfit and super shy, you will be the guy I would consider “no competition” during my time there. I am a fit guy who spends time here and there reading about seduction on the interwebs and otherwise. To me it was just a matter of overcoming social anxiety. I never even had to put up with rejection, because I had enough time with each girl to understand if she was interested in me or otherwise. If I felt she wasn’t, I could just move on with very little cause of plausible deniability (.i.e  some stupid excuse) in order to keep my ego more or less intact. But let’s face it, in the end most of us are average, and as long as you are, you might want to check out your local “Come, learn tango!” address, even with the risk of having an apocalyptic crush on the uber-fit instructor.

7nvfhd,53,2018-01-03,"[Answer] Moving to Switzerland - here are a few thoughts on my experiences with moving, learning the language, and life here in general.",travel_ali,askswitzerland,https://www.reddit.com/r/askswitzerland/comments/7nvfhd/answer_moving_to_switzerland_here_are_a_few/,"I moved to Switzerland over 2.5 years ago, and as it is raining out and I am feeling thoughtful here is a reflection of the move and my subsequent time here. [I made a post on here 2 years ago about my thoughts after 6 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/3x3hkn/i_moved_to_switzerland_here_are_a_few_thoughts_on/), so this post is kind of a redo/update of that (and this is also heavily focused on the German speaking part of the country).

In short it has been a fantastic experience: I moved into a flat in the old town of an absurdly pretty town, got the chance to fully explore the country, made friends and feel I have integrated and understand the country very well. The move itself was very easy for me. But the language has been the slow and hard part.

Partly I wrote this for myself to help clear up my thoughts and memories, but hopefully it will be interesting and helpful to others.
[For info on travel, hiking and other things see this previous series of posts I put on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5nkv4j/switzerland_my_faq_thoughts_hints_and_tips_after/). This is just about my experience moving and living here (ok it is mostly to bitch about the language, but shhh).

**Serious bits**

There are plenty of blogs ([eg: the German Way](https://www.german-way.com/)), forums (englishforum.ch](https://www.englishforum.ch/)), and books (Living and working in Switzerland by David Hampshire) out there dealing with the matter. Blogs from other expats are sometimes wonderfully accurate, but sometimes they seem to describe another country altogether. I am mostly going to avoid serious bits as they are covered well elsewhere.

One thing I will say is transfer your driving licence to a Swiss one right away. Not expecting to stay this long, and only planning to use the trains I didn’t bother as it just seemed a waste of time and money. Now having been here more than 1 year, and planning to stay longer, as I understand it I can’t drive here until I retake the whole bloody test - not that I ever want to, but it would be useful to have the option still.

**Why / How**

Basically I just ended up here slightly by chance. I (at the time M/28/UK) was doing a PhD in Biomaterials and had been wanting to do a Post-doc outside of the UK (adventure, travel, and experience), but had been focused on Germany or Australia and had never really considered Switzerland. Then a job with the right requirements popped up through contacts as I was writing up my PhD. I applied, got the position, and suddenly found myself about to move to a country which I didn’t really know a whole lot about and to a town I had never heard of.

There were two major aids here: the culture and highly specific skills of academia makes it very easy to find a job in another country, and as an EU citizen (for now) I get equal rights and easy access to Switzerland. So it was just a case of entering the country normally and telling them I was here once I set myself up.

**Pre-move research**

I had been to Switzerland twice before during my studies, but only to Geneva and most of that time was spent at CERN on or over the border with France. Now I was moving all by myself to a different part of the country and the closest person I knew was in the north of Germany. So I was really going in blind and alone.

I was spending 2 months travelling elsewhere in the run up to the start date so didn’t really have much time for any serious preparation beyond checking what I needed to do to make sure I entered and set myself up legally.

What I did do was read Swiss Watching by Diccon Bewes. [He also has a long but quite good TedX talk, similar to the Swiss Watching book but quicker for some of the basic facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc). He tends to overdo some points, but generally gives a very good overview of the country and the people.

Otherwise I just bought tickets for the closest airport and packed as much as I could into the biggest bag I had: laptop, clothes, a frying pan, and hiking boots. 

**The move**

All things considered this went surprisingly smooth.

Entering the country I just walked through customs just like any holiday maker with a big bag. I then left the airport by the wrong country - a problem which is possibly unique to Basel/Mülhausen - before correctly entering Switzerland and meeting my new boss for the first time in arrivals. He escorted me to our town and informed about various things work and life related on the way (99% of which I forgot pretty much instantly as my mind was overwhelmed with so much to take in).

I had been expecting to use the flat my new workplace rented for visitors, but I found out late on that it was already taken by some interns, and so I had to find my own place at very short notice. Browsing the standard property websites I quickly realised that my original idea of finding myself a furnished flat was not going to happen - such properties are very limited in number and absurdly expensive. I got very lucky and found a room to sublet almost instantly though the flatmate finding website [wgzimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer.html) (though be warned flat sharing is not a common thing here like it is in the UK). Not only did I get a mostly furnished flat to live in, but it was in the historic old town, and I had a Swiss housemate which made starting so much easier as I had both an instant friend and a local guide / information source.

(Having since searched for a proper flat 2 years later I have found it is a rather slow process. You typically have to arrange with the current tenant to see the flat, rather than just getting an agent to take you around a selection. Often the tenant feeds back to the company which means appearing in a smart(ish) outfit and being friend helps, certainly the quickest and most positive responses I got were when I had a good chatty tour with the current tenant. Applying then takes ages as you have a to fill out a form for each flat, and the answer can take anything from a few hours to a few weeks. On the plus side you legally get a day off from work to move house which is nice.)

I moved into the flat without a rental contract at first as it took time for the landlord to approve me as a sub-tenant. Whilst slightly chaotic (I took most of my first months wages in a large pile of cash), this made the whole chicken-egg process of getting setup in a new country vastly easier. Once the rental contract came through it was simple to just go to the Kanton with my passport and work/rental contracts and register as a resident, followed by a quick trip to the bank to get myself a bank account. And just like that life fell into place.

For the mandatory health insurance (you have 3 months, but start early as it takes at least a month for it to actually be processed) I just went on Helsana and figured out a reasonably cheap package. I haven’t changed it since, but many Swiss take it very seriously and constantly swap to keep the cost down.

I didn’t really have to spend much time on official matters, and didn’t really come across any serious problems or delays (other than sleeping on the floor for a few weeks as Ikea delivery takes ages). Even setting up a bank account with no common language went surprisingly smooth and quickly.

**Adjustment and life**

I went in with a 1 year contract and a mentality that I would jump in, make the most of the time to see everything I could, and then hop out again to move on elsewhere afterwards (or stay if possible, but I was very open to whatever).

During the early days keeping yourself busy is probably the best thing you can do.
On which point the first few “honeymoon” months are a magical time when everything is different and exciting - make the most of them. Especially for me as I turned up at the end of May which is possibly the best time of year - warm weather, snowy peaks, and green meadows. During my first summer I constantly bought new and novel things in the supermarket, and went on trips almost every weekend. My coworkers started to become quite amused as I turned up every Friday with hiking boots and a backpack to head off directly into the mountains after work.

It of course isn’t all rustic cabins and mountains. Most people moving into Switzerland will go to the Flatland: which can be wonderfully charming with rustic villages and rolling forested hills, but can also be ugly industry and forgettable charmless towns. From October to February the Flatland suffers from a dense low fog which swallows the light and leaves you in a depressing world of grey for weeks or months at a time. [You can escape above it to a world of beautiful clear views and sunshine](https://i.imgur.com/SKmNWwt.jpg) at the weekend (some people go up armed with deckchairs and newspapers), but during the working week you are rather stuck with it.

My past experience made dealing with the move quite easy: having moved to Australia as a kid, and a few times in the UK for uni I had gotten used to new places and new people. I also suspect I have it very easy as an outsider here: I am white, speak English as my mother language, and am skilled (ie: I look like I fit in, I can almost always communicate, and I arguably add something to the country). I don’t mean that in a “the Swiss are horribly racist” way, but a just “the closer you are to the culture you move to then the easier it is” way.

With my housemate and friends I made at work I found myself with a social life fairly early on. Partly due to that, and partly due to not wanting to fall into the expat-trap, I didn’t get around to meeting my local English speaking society until almost 2 years after I arrived. In retrospect it would have been better to join them early on for advice and tips.

Moving from one western country to another isn’t too big a challenge. But the differences can pile up:

* If you come from anywhere but Norway then converting the prices back to your home currency will give you a heart attack each time you go to the shops here. It is best to stop doing that ASAP. Prices are high, but pay is good.

* Getting used to the way things work takes time. I was utterly shocked on arrival to find the shops here close at 6:30pm during the week. 

* One of the curious bits of adjustments was the steady stream of small differences that I became aware of as time passed. For example after months of spending at least part of every day in the countryside I finally realised what it was that seemed off to me - there were no fences or hedges and so it all felt strangely open compared to the English countryside.

**Language**

This is the one thing that gets to me the most about living abroad. It can really isolate you or give you the feeling of being isolated even when you are being socially accommodated (I feel guilty about it and hate having to drag the conversation back to English). Being near the Röstigraben I sometimes end up in a French dominated group (of which I speak almost nothing beyond ordering a coffee) so the effect is somewhat doubled. 

You can survive here without German - I have met plenty of people working at big companies like Novartis that do. English is kind of the common language here - far less people speak multiple Swiss languages fluently than you would expect. Still, when someone in Switzerland says they “only speak a little French” it tends to me they can only converse for an hour or two (as opposed to “a little French” in the UK which means you can count to 5). Once you are setup and enter the rhythm of everyday life then (other than the odd official letter) it is easy to just coast along in English. This is understandable in some ways: coming home after work it can be hard to find the motivation or time to sit down and study something serious (especially with a family), and learning by immersion is often about as much fun as learning to swim by being thrown into a tsunami. 

I wanted to learn the language regardless, but I also happened to move to a very Swiss company in a small town that is almost unknown internationally. As such I was always immersed (drowning) in Swiss-German and had plenty of motivation to learn. 

I would sum up the experience of learning a language as you move to a new country as three stages:

- **1 - The initial novelty.** You have just arrived and everything is exciting and new. You don’t understand anything but that is fine: you are armed with a range of apps, you are confident that immersion in the language will make sound like a native in a few months, and you can even identify some of the items in your kitchen in German already.

- **2- The frustration stage.** You have completed Duolingo and other such things, politely smiled through hours of German, and learnt your dative/genitive/etc - but you don’t understand a fucking thing beyond the fact that the important looking sign in the train station says something about platform 4.

- **3 - Starting to click.** You might still mix up words and your grammar makes the language less of an art and more of a frontal assault. But you understand what is said and get the message across. Conversational level has been reached, and the long road to fluency begins.

- **4 - Bonus Swiss-German stage.** You read, listen, and talk High-German without trouble. Then you pop into Migro and the cashier asks you a simple question in Swiss-German, but you don’t understand a bloody word. You sigh and lower your head in shame/frustration.

I had 3 years of German at school in the UK which was something but not amazing (I showed an example GCSE exam to Swiss colleagues and they literally laughed). Still at least that gave me some words and installed a basic appreciation of the language which helped me restart 10 years later. Having recently started learning French from nothing I actually do appreciate that my school German was a helpful foundation, though I think 3 years of “bare minimum because I had to” at school translates to about 3 months of part-time “because I want to” later on.

I didn’t have much time before moving out so I just played with some game/apps on my phone, which taught me one or two words but were mostly useless. On getting into Switzerland I hit Duolingo and worked my way through it. It is certainly attractive being easy, free, and full of happy binging sounds. But overall I would say it is really limited. You are so far from everyday understanding at the end. Some people claim to watch TV shows or hold full conversations based purely on Duolingo, fuck knows what they watch or talk about but I was nowhere near that. It is useful as something to play with, but as a supplement to other methods. I found Memrise after completing Duolingo, but at this point I could not be bothered with more repetitive filling in the blanks - so I didn’t really bother with it. Instead I moved onto youtube, games, newspapers, classes, and whatever interaction occurred in my daily life.

My German has come quite a way and generally impresses most people I talk to here given the amount of time I have learnt it in (and sometimes that I have bothered to learn it at all, though I feel I could be so much further with less time “wasted” on other things):

* On arrival I would say I was A1. I could introduce myself and say that I had a cat (which was a lie), count, and identify a few objects and animals. But that was about it.

* Now after 2.5 years I can understand most High-German and join in on most topics, so would put myself at B2. Though my grammar is still far from pretty, and a long German session can still burn me out. I can barely remember any genders for nouns and mostly just pick whatever sounds best in my head. Whether I fully understand Swiss-German is very hit or miss.

I must say that I really like Swiss-German. I like how it sounds and it is so much more interesting and full of character than High-German. However….

Learning German in Switzerland can be absurdly frustrating (more so than usual). Swiss-German makes it so much more complicated (basically [see this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBLjOF8UfNk)). You can reach total fluency in High-German, but then get utterly floored by the simplest question from a Swiss person. The Swiss like to laugh when people ask them if “Swiss” is a language, but I would argue that Swiss-German is basically a whole other language. The pronunciation, grammar, and even basic words are often very different. It isn’t so much that the goalposts have been moved, but that the whole fucking game has changed. The idea of trying to play football whilst the other team are playing Gaelic football is about on the right lines. [This video makes the point rather well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2S9iggdzM). And on the point of [a whole different game….](https://youtu.be/ThwG88SFIQc).

Still there is no ß in Swiss-German (you just use ss instead) which saves some faffing around at least. It also helps to know that Swiss-German gives most normal Germans a hard time too (German TV often gives Swiss speakers subtitles).

This is infinitely more frustrating as a native English speaker: people often hear my accent and switch straight to English - and usually keep going in English even when I keep responding in German. Sometimes in a shop the salesperson will run off to find an English speaking worker (and sometimes they will then run off to find another worker that speaks better English). Even the middle aged butcher in my little town speaks perfect bloody English. On the flip side having a Swiss address means people often assume I am Swiss and hit me with the hardest dialect they can muster. Going to check into a B&amp;B as the only guests that night the host greeted me with a barrage of Swiss-German only to get a deer-in-the-headlights response from me (much to the amusement of my Swiss girlfriend).

Technically you can learn Swiss-German, but unless you are already fluent in High-German that would be insane. Every Swiss-German speaker understands and talks High-German so you would be pointlessly over specialising with a language that most German speakers can’t understand. Especially so as Swiss-German varies drastically by region (yes even in this tiny place), and it isn’t a defined language so if you write it out you just write it as it sounds to you in your dialekt. I have been told that any structured class on it is just a waste of time. Just learn the Swiss part by exposure - you are never going to easily pass for a local with the dialect anyway.

For putting the language to use it is much easier for me to talk German with strangers, or with people I know speak no English. When you start speaking English with people it is far too hard to then switch language years down the line when your German is good enough to function properly. I live with my Swiss girlfriend but we almost always talk in English when it is just us as German feels so strange.

While it is endless frustration, it really does payoff and feel good. For example when checking into a hotel in Graubünden the receptionist was delighted that I spoke in German rather than just shouting at her in English and I got very friendly treatment for the rest of the time. Also we had regular internal presentations that are given in German, at the start I was filling sheets of paper with scribbled words and translations from my phone as I tried to keep up, but at the end I only needed to do so for one or two words which was rather nice. And of course being able to fully function and communicate with people in daily life is rather a good payoff too.

The downside of this is that when I return to the UK it takes me a few days to stop talking German to strangers (especially if I have had a few beers).

For learning in Switzerland I found these tools very useful:

* The free commuter newspaper [20 minutes](http://www.20min.ch/) is the best tool for learning German in Switzerland (probably also French and Italian too). It is not going to win any journalism awards. But it has short, simple, neutral articles - grab a copy each day and scribble all over it. The odd Swiss-German word is included which helps build up the local lingo. Some of it (ie: the people/community section) is invented bollocks, but it mostly helps give you an idea what is important in the country and how Switzerland works.

* Dict.cc has a number of Swiss words which makes it my mobile/internet dictionary of choice for Switzerland.

* [There is an Allmanisch German wiki if you want to pick up a feeling for the way the dialect feels](https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Houptsyte).

* [SRFplay](https://www.srf.ch/play). TV and radio on demand in High and Swiss-German. You paid for this with your Billag, so abuse the hell out of it.

* SRF4. The news radio station in mostly nice clear High-German. Typically they seem to have 2-3 hours of reports each day that they just repeat, slightly dull but great for someone trying to learn. I like to listen to this when I am working in the lab. 

* Youtube has some useful resources. Swiss-German channels like [Ask Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndi9zHvIDYa1Tp6vXJqHxA) provide plenty to listen to. It also has some SRF stuff which might help if you are not already in Switzerland. Search “bi de lüt” for shows focused on Swiss life with some strong Swiss-German accents. 

* [The australian/swiss comedy of Rob Spence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mifm_FMFLM&amp;t=4s). Not so easy to understand but somehow reassuring.

For German in general I would also suggest:

* /r/German and the resources on their [wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index).

* There is so much on youtube. [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3936178A38BB5F87) is a favourite.

* Dive in - to hell with how stupid you might sound.

* Joining a class. The learning process is much more fun when you have some people at your level to share the frustration. I spent almost a year trying to decide what level to join - online tests kept putting me as A1, but the overall meaning of each level made me think B1, in the end I went B1 and it was perfect (so bollocks to yes/no online tests).

* Duolingo provide a nice way to get started and keep steadily learning. The simple focused nature of the tree and short time requirements of the stages mean you don’t get overwhelmed and don’t need to worry about setting more than a few minutes aside for it. But overall it is really limited in what it actually teaches you of the language, so you need to heavily use other medium in addition to it. Think of Duolingo as a snack: something quick, convenient and easy to keep you going, but it isn’t going to properly fill you up. Complete the tree and practice if you find it useful, but don’t bother aiming for the highest level or for a 1000 day streak.   

* I am not a massive gamer but I swear by video games as the best way to learn. The mix of interaction, language, and fun makes for a very effective learning environment (that and being able to attack someone with a sword when you get sick of them speaking German to you is rather satisfying…..). The trick is to find something story based with a good separation of language and action: RPGs like Skyrim is perfect for this (especially using console to pause and quick save/load to repeat bits), whereas something action based like COD is too distracting. This worked especially well playing games which I completed in English years ago, where I could just about recall the gist of the story to help me along but had forgotten many aspects and details.

* Music. I built a playlist when I first arrived. It started out as random sounds, but through 2 years of steady listening and learning I can now make sense of it.

* Read out loud (though maybe not on the bus).

* [Emon publishing](https://www.emons-verlag.de/) do local Krimis with one probably set where you live or are interested in. Not exactly the best books in the world but entertaining enough.

**The Swiss**

Sometimes I feel I understand the Swiss, other times they are complex enigmas. The nature of the country often feels very contradictory at times (often liberal and conservative at once). And of course the urban/rural, and language divides only make this more complex. 

Take anything you read pre-2000 with a big pinch of salt. The country seems to have changed significantly since then: going from a dull but practical country to a much more fun and outgoing one. The summer months especially are very lively as people head outdoors to drink at bars, go to festival, and jump in the lakes/rivers. Younger Swiss are very open and there is less of the formality that you get with the older generations.

The Swiss tend to operate in two modes in public: city and mountain. In urban areas the Swiss are along the lines of the quiet closed society of stereotypes, but get them into the countryside and they can become super loud and chatty. I have been on Post buses where the entire bus was interacting and best friends by the end of the trip, and if you get on a train to the mountains with a group of retirees you will know about it. 

I am a fairly private person but the Swiss sometimes really beat me there. Once a coworker who I spoke with most days casually mentioned that he wouldn’t be in the next day, I assumed he had to wait for a delivery or something - turns out he was getting married. This has happened twice now. Most other coworkers got this treatment too, so it isn't (just) that I am insufferable. 

I have however always felt very welcomed here. On one of my first days I went walking in the Jura mountains near my town. As I sat on a peak to eat lunch an elderly local man started talking to me. My German was almost non-existent then but I managed to get the idea across that I had just moved there to start work. On finding out that this foreigner who barely spoke a word of German (let alone the local dialect) was moving in to work he wished me well and gave me a Ricola. A small gesture, but one that really stuck with me. Having improved my German I have only felt more welcome since then.

On which point the Swiss are very tolerant with language. Absurdly so really. In my early days I only once or twice got very gentle remarks that I needed to improve my German (buying curtains was one notable early occasion where my few words in German really failed to get me far) but generally they did everything to accommodate me and then as my skills picked up they started to throw praise at even my crude German. Whether that is just being polite or they are just genuinely impressed that an English speaker learnt German I am not sure.

The Swiss are almost always very considerate. Dog walkers will stop to hold their dog in place whilst bikers go past. Even the bored teens drinking on the street at night don’t bother anyone walking past. The main exception is the growing number of wankers who think they are special and can just walk around with their music blasting out of some powerful speaker (though that is probably more common elsewhere).

Some habits of talking took a while to get used to. The British habit of saying sorry to express sympathy (or anything) rather confuses the Swiss who take it to just mean guilt. Understatement isn’t really a thing here which either leads to confusion or hilarity - one day at work I was being shown a process with a sample being taken out of the oven at 1400C, on being warned that it was very hot I replied that it was indeed a wee bit toasty, the poor worker taking the sample out was almost collapsing with laughter from what I thought was just a standard comment.  

The absolute worst thing about the Swiss is their obsession with putting their bag on the seat beside them on the train (the overhead racks are apparently only there for aesthetics). They will move it if you ask, but not until you do so (no matter how obviously busy the train might be) which can create a passive aggressive awkwardness about it. Some talented people have even mastered the art of taking up 4 spaces by themselves, and then manage not to notice that there are other people on the train. 

A few odd thoughts:

* [Stereotypes exist for each region in the country](http://i.imgur.com/Gq72cwL.jpg). Generally they are fairly mature. Coming from the UK and Australia where anyone more rural than you is having sex with their sheep (and/or incest) this was quite a surprise.

* One thing I find curious is that the image of sport (TV adverts etc) here is more of families and normal people doing it as opposed to super-athletes. And most people are quite outgoing with sport and such-like. 

* Shaking hands is a big thing here. Get used to that in situations where a hello or just polite nod would do in English speaking lands.

**The long-term**

Having started with a mentality of in-and-out (with as many mountains as possible in the meantime) I have found myself getting somewhat more established here. I got extended several times to 2.5 years, met a Swiss girl, moved in with her, and am now looking for further work.

For me adapting and getting used to life here was fairly easy. I made friends via work, and my housemate. I explored every part of the country (far more than most of my Swiss acquaintances). Through watching and reading the news I now understand much better how the country works and the variations in who votes and thinks what. I can’t name the president or most of the politicians, but they are not so influential here and having no say myself in the politics I have an excuse there.

There has been some frustration and feeling of being useless and/or isolated. I sometimes get a desire for home, without actually knowing what home even is to me anymore. But generally it has been very positive. 

I only really miss a few things:

* Food. Swiss food tends to be a little less exotic than the options in the UK. I really miss the omnipresent cheap curry-houses. Likewise standard food in the supermarkets (whilst almost always good) is less exotic.

* Spicy food. Food listed as hot/spicy here tends to have all the power of slightly tangy ketchup. But this might just be a result of years of idiotic English competitive curry culture on my behalf.

* Culture. You can talk English with locals but it just isn’t the same. Hanging out with fellow expats helps abit there, but they are often from all over the world so you often still miss out on a proper connection.

* Opening hours. I dream of shops that open on Sunday and/or beyond the early evening. 

The main downside has been that the longer you spend somewhere the more mundane it becomes. A few days spent in Grindelwald or somewhere like that might leave you with the memory of the country as a magical place. But when you stay somewhere for longer then it becomes normal and less special with every passing day. I still love it here, but had I only stayed for the first summer than it would have stayed far more wonderful in my memory. Of course then I would just be yearning to come back.

**What would I do differently?**

If I were to repeat it again knowing what I do now (though they are all of course easier said than down):

* Allow more time for finding a flat. I got lucky on arrival, but now realise how long this process can be.

* Hit the language harder and faster. This was partly delayed by finishing up corrections and work for my PhD, but I really should have joined a class early on, and also have picked up French sooner once I started to get conversational with German.

* Make more effort to be social. I feel I integrated well, but could have done more to join a local club or been more socially outgoing on arrival.

**How to be Swiss**

* have some Aromat on your table (even if it is made by Unilever). 

* Swim in a lake/river during the summer.

**Things to try:**

- If you are here more than a few weeks then try to get into every language region at least once. If you are here for a number of months then try and visit every little area. For a tiny country there is so much variation in landscape and culture.

- Wine. You can’t find it outside of the country, but Swiss wine is actually pretty good.

- Beer. [There are loads of small Breweries all over the country](https://bov.ch/beer/swissmaps.html), Switzerland apparently has the most breweries per capita in the world. Feldschlossen is the “standard” mass produced beer you find everywhere. Compared to the standards in other countries it isn’t too bad, but try and find something more interesting.

- Cheese. More than just Emmental. Try everything you can.

- Vermicelle. A desert made out of minced chestnut. Best in autumn.

**Useful quickfire points:**

- Swiss plugs are like (but not identical to) standard European ones. Standard European ones do not always fit here, come prepared with at least 1 Swiss specific plug.

- Kantons have lots of power and the way they are run can vary quite a bit. The Kanton and place you live in can have rather a large effect on the taxes, health insurance, and various quality of life factors.

- Catholics kantons have far more official holidays (on such days the shops in protestant kantons will fill up with shoppers from the surrounding kantons). Swiss holidays fall on a date, not day of the week, and many firms make bridge days for holidays on a Tuesday or Thursday. This means that year to year the number of official holidays you have can vary from almost none, to having what feels like the the whole of May off work. The absolute worst is holidays on a Saturday when you miss the day off, and all the bloody shops are closed.

- Look into at least getting the Half-Tax train pass even if you don’t plan to take public transport too often - it applies to most cable cars and ships too. Combined with supersaver tickets on the SBB app you can buy tickets for specific trains at quieter times for 25% of the normal cost. If you live with someone else who has it then you get a discount. Same with the GA: my girlfriend is a student, and I live with her, so we both save about a third off the GA.

- Name is last name, not first name (vorname), in German. I ruined countless forms until I got used to that.

- The Swiss 1 looks like an upside down V at times. That caused some confusion too.

- Look into [Reka money](https://reka.ch/en/rekamoney/seiten/reka-money.aspx). It is basically “voucher” money that is usable for leisure and travel in Switzerland (accommodation, food, transport, activities). You can’t use it everywhere, but you can get it at as little as 80% of the cost in CHF. Saving 20% off travel inside Switzerland is very nice. For best results see if your company has an account in place to help you get the checks or a savings account (mine gave it out as a summer holiday bonus). If you do use the banknote like checks bear in mind that you often don’t get change from them, so prepare a mix of the checks and coins to cover the full cost.

- Charity shops are not a thing like they are in the UK. So cheap and easy 2nd hand things are not always so easy to find.

- Asterix and Obelix is rather popular here. Brush up on that for Switzerland and your country to understand the references.

- If you are swapping the side of the road you drive on, then try and cycle rather than drive as much as possible at first. It is much easier to quickly dash onto the pavement when you go wrong on a bike than with a car (maybe best if you stick to simple quiet roads). Cycling on the right helped me clear my left-sided instincts out so when I finally drove on the right it was natural.

**Not so useful points:**

- You will spend the first few months with a Swiss kezboard mixing up the z and y kezs."

I'm looking at doing my PADI DM course and Cozumel is top of my list right now as the diving looks amazing and I speak a little Spanish. For now I'm just looking to get the cert but with a view to maybe going back there to work over summers.

However, I'm finding the courses on offer lacking a little bit compared to what I've seen in other locations. For example, some schools I've seen spread out the training over 4-6 weeks giving you lots of contact with customers, and allowing you basically unlimited boat diving during and after the course (obviously taking customers when you pass).

All the outfits I've seen on Cozumel seem to get the course out of the way alarmingly quickly, some even over 10 days and only 20 dives 'time and space permitting'. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for a dive outfit that offers what I'm looking for and is relatively near San Miguel? I don't mind working a bit but I can't take 6 months off work for Dressel's internship (and I've not heard good things anyway).

Thanks!"

I came here, to ask men with more experience for advice. I will soon reach the age of 22 and I am having a hard time deciding what I want to make of myself. 


**Background:**

**Age:** 21

**Languages:** Polish native with more or less fluent English.

**Localization:** Poland

Currently, I have got 2 years of call center experience and am currently working corporate for a rather decent pay(for a 22 year old). I haven't got a degree, I was studying finance &amp; accounting but dropped out since I doubted that it would lead me anywhere where I want to be in the future.

At this moment, I am steadily working on improving my physique, spending time dating multiple women and working, but it's obviously not good enough. For a long time I wanted to learn programming and I have managed to asses 4 different paths of learning:

**IDEAS:**

1) Part-time CS degree from one of private universities in my country - it shouldn't interfere with work as I would go there on fridays and weekends. Costs aren't steep but getting an engineer degree will take 3,5 years. 

2) a 30 day, weekend programming course. There are a couple of courses to choose from, each is about a different area of work and they all cost about 10k PLN(that's about 3,5 x my salary). I have doubts about this one since I would have to purchase my own laptop and 30 days of learning doesn't seem to be quite enough to be anywhere close to becoming a real coder.

3) A one year programming course with 6 months of paid internship and guarantee of work afterwards. This one seems like the best deal, I will only have to pay for it after completing the course(Full cost: 24k PLN), it seems to cover all areas to reach my goal, but there is one major downside - it will not allow me to keep my current job and I would have to start working part time(classes monday-friday every 2 weeks). 

4) Start learning on my own, but this one is a tough one for me cause I don't even know where or how to start. Even then I am not sure if I would manage to teach myself properly in a reasonable amount of time to start gaining income from it. I have tried khanacademy when I was younger but lost interest quickly, not sure if I shouldn't start again? 

**SUMMARY:**

For steps 2 &amp; 3 there is a catch. They both seem to have a rather complicated recruitment process, which means that I might not even get accepted in the first place. Step 1 is easier to enroll to since I only need to be one the first to apply. Can you guys please help me out on this one? As embarrassing as it might be, I am terribly anxious about making the next move and I want to pick the best route. 

Disclaimer: English isn't my 1st language, I am sorry for any errors and would greatly appreciate feedback.

After college, I didn’t really know what to do with my life for about a year, so I worked for my dad’s tree removal company. Also, I had terrible confidence and even believed I was too incompetent to hold down any job, which is rediculous because I graduated college with a 3.9 gpa. I even boiled that down to just luck, even though I worked super hard in college studying anywhere between 40-60 hours a week to obtain my business management degree. I did not work during the school year, but worked for my dad’s tree removal company In the summers. I tried to get an internship, but wasn’t able to make it through the trial period because it involved getting donations from door to door, which just isn’t my thing. Last June, I decided to face my fears and started to apply for jobs. I applied for tons, but didn’t hear much back until about a month ago when this grocery store contacted me back. This grocery store hired me as a store associate making $13 an hour and I’ve been working their for the past month. the company is rapidly growing, so they’ll need a lot of managers in the near future. So far I’ve done a really good job and all the supervisors and managers love me, so hopefully I can become a store manager in the next couple years. This has improved my self confidence tremendously. However, I’m bitter. I’m bitter because I see all these kids who had a terrible work ethic and were more worried about partying making 50,000-60,000 a year now. I felt like all the hard work I put into college has not paid off just because I didnt get an internship or don’t know somebody that can get me into a great job position. In college, I never partied, went out, or anything else of the sorts. I was totally focused on doing the best I could, so it feels like a slap in the face when I see kids who chose to go get drunk every night rather than study doing better than me. How should I not be bitter and keep my head up?"

**Pros**

Studied under the greatest coach of all time. Has previous HC experience. Multiple Superbowl winner

**Cons**

Previous Head Coaching experience. Unclear whether or not his success is due to Brady/Belichick

**Consensus**

I’m on the fence about McDaniels. CHIBEARS opinion is that he may have learned from his mistakes and Denver and matured. I’m not sure if there’s anything to prove that opinion. Additionally, Belichick doesn’t have any successful predecessors (save for maybe Bill O’Brien). In any event, McDaniels will be the Head Coach of a team in 2018, but I don’t believe it will be the Bears. My bet is on Indy.

**Pros**

I think we can all agree that Vic has done a phenomenal job with the Chicago Bears Defense. He was handed Mel Tuckers left over scraps and made gold. Defense wins championships and Vic can coach a defense.

**Cons**

No head coaching experience. With his experience in the league it begs the question: why? Another thing I noticed when looking up scoring defense is his teams have a habit of finishing on the low end of the special teams column. I’m not sure there’s any correlation, but I found that interesting. Additionally, who will he bring in as an offensive mind, that seems like a huge question mark and it is very important if Bears want to be successful moving forward.

**Consensus**

With what he’s done with the Bears defense, I don’t think anyone could be truly upset if they choose him as their head coach. The players respect the hell out of him and he’s never stirred any controversy. My only issues lies in the fact that it is very unclear who he will bring in on the offensive side of the ball.

**Pros**

Has worked on a lot of successful offenses. What seems to stand out to me the most is how many organizations have trusted him in the their time of need. He stepped in as an interim head coach and offensive coordinator. That tells me he’s a leader of men, and that people respect him. This is ironic because he’s known for his quiet demeanor.

**Cons**

**Consensus**

I think he fits more of an Offensive Coordinator role. I don’t think Pace can hand him the keys to the car based on his limited experience. I wouldn’t mind him as a OC, but taking this mess of a Bears team may be too much for this young coach.

In my mind, Andy Reid is one of the best coaches in this era. He’s an offensive minded guy who’s done great things with the gadget guys that KC has. I think he would do phenomenal things with Cohen. 

**Cons**

Not a lot of experience. This is his first couple years as a coordinator and I’m sure Andy has his hands all over everything.

**Consensus**

I think some of the concepts that he runs fit really well with today’s NFL(shovel passes, crossing routes with built in picks and blocks downfield), and I think he can do a really good job of getting the most out or talent.

**Pros**

Had Success recently as a Defensive Coordinator.

**Cons**

Didn't have success prior to Mike Zimmer. Would assume that Zimmer is controlling that defense.

7nxmlw,2,2018-01-03,Question about going back to University (SRS),kor7462,OntarioUniversities,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/7nxmlw/question_about_going_back_to_university_srs/,"Hey guys,

I was wondering what my chances would be getting into computer science for universities  as a 105D applicant with one undesirable transcript. A couple of years ago I went to university in Ontario and I did poorly because I was immature, I hated the program and was going through a struggling relationship with my parents. I skipped a lot of classes, partied quite a bit and only wanted the bare minimum GPA to graduate from the program, and I did.

After graduating, reality hit hard, so I did a lot of things to improve myself and grow up. I worked extremely hard (living like a hermit) for a couple of years after to make up for my screw ups. I taught myself topics in computer science, mathematics and programming and fell in love with it. During this, I helped start up a non profit with people, and worked in various internships as a web/software developer. I was even offered full-time. In addition, family and friends told me not do the path of going back to school, but I am very dedicated to my passion. Then I decided to go back to an Ontario college for computer programming and I achieved a 3.98/4.0 gpa after 2 years, but I decided that it wasn't enough for me. I wanted to go back to university again to really dive deeper into theoretical Computer Science and challenge myself. 

This is where I am currently at. I want to get into university this year, and I need to apply through OUAC and send them ALL my transcripts ( I will not lie by omitting any). I recently redid my high school math and science courses through ILC to meet the University program specific requirements (but I couldn't fit English), and I am pretty sure  that I will achieve 90+ on them.

All in all, I am hoping to apply to University of Toronto, UBC, Mcgill, Queens and Waterloo for Computer science, and I know it is one of the most competitive programs these days. I have done heavy research on my circumstance, and I feel quite down about it. I know that I will have to send my poor transcript from my first university, my college transcript, and ILC updated high school transcript. Therefore, how badly will admissions punish me for my first university transcript? What do you guys think about my chances? Will my high gpa in college offset my first transcript? Also, I can't remember what I got in my grade 12 English, how much will this affect me?

Thanks guys."

In the next week or so, I could be hearing back from a local company with an AV programmer position available utilizing technologies with C#, Java, and Python syntax/structure. The first 3 months are like an internship; however, it is paid as if a permanent salary position. Follow-up employment is contingent on my performance. 

This company is a vendor for FedEx and many other companies. One question on FedEx's application process is: ""Are you or have you ever worked as a vendor of FedEx?"" or something to that extent. Does the answer matter? 

**Do they want to hire former/current vendors sooner than other people, or do they avoid hiring vendors as their own full-time employees?**

7nya2k,17,2018-01-03,My [24 F] GF of 4.5 years recently admitted she was not “In Love” with me [23 M] about a week after proposing to her and her saying Yes. Currently taking a break from one another and need advice.,temp_55,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7nya2k/my_24_f_gf_of_45_years_recently_admitted_she_was/,"**Disclaimer** : I’m using a throwaway account. Have been a long time reddit user but mainly as a viewer of content; I never felt the need to post or comment until now. Sorry if the post is too long. Half of it is me needing to vent while the other half is me needing experienced opinions from others and making sure I provide enough context.

---

**Current Relationship Info** : Me [23 M] and my GF [24 F] have been dating for almost 4.5 years. We have been living together for at least 3 years. We had talked about marriage, weddings, kids, house, future plans numerous times and both were emotionally ready for it. We got engaged a couple of days before christmas (*context in “Relationship Backstory” section*). She recently talked to me about how unsure she has been feeling after the engagement (*details in “The Issue” section*). We are currently taking a break from one another until the end of February. We will still live with each other. We have plans to try and work on our relationship from March-May(*end of our apartment lease*) with the notion that if we can’t improve it to the point of recovery by the end of May we will go our separate ways.

--- 

**My Background** : (*May or may not be relevant*) I come from a family of 4 with both biological parents and a sister. My overall family, both mom and dad’s side, can be described as traditional southern conservative christian. My family is pretty big compared to the GF’s non-existent one. I grew up in one home and never moved. My family was lower middle class. I had several short lasting non-serious dating experiences in high school. As an engineer, I am very technically minded and like to analyze everything including my current relationship. I am very open and blunt and talk to my GF about anything that may cross my mind. I’m generally not a super emotional person. I am a trustworthy person.

---

**Her Background** : (*May or may not be relevant*) GF grew up very differently from me. She never really knew her mother. Her mother had drug addiction issues which is why her dad separated from her. Her childhood mainly consists of living with her dad, with the exception of living with a school friend for a couple of years in highschool due to her dad not being able to financially support her. Grew up on low income and always moving around to new places,non-military reasons. Seemed to always be in a relationship in high school, not having a lot of time in-between relationships. She is a trustworthy person.

---

**Relationship Backstory** : 
     My GF and I went to the same college. We met the summer after our freshman year through work. We were both summer resident assistants on campus. She was in a relationship at the time while I was single. 


Throughout the summer word traveled around through coworkers about her relationship problems (*her ex-BF was super abusing and controlling*). I like to have respect for other guys and don’t like drama so I always turned a blind eye when I knew a girl was in a relationship. Because of this, I had never considered her as a potential partner and pursued other female coworkers at the time. She broke up with her ex-BF and needed to cope with it so she talked to me and other coworkers about it. We kept talking over the next couple of days and became good friends. She would always spend the night with me in my dorm sharing my bed. I was still oblivious at the time and was completely unaware of the signs that she had liked me until I talked to several coworkers about it. I wasn’t looking for anything serious at the time but thought I might try something with her since I knew she liked me  and I thought she was cute. 


Our relationship was started in a physical way. I think this was because of my stance on relationships at the time and that she had just broken up with her ex-BF. I don’t believe either of us expected it to turn into anything further. I was still a virgin at the time while she was sexually experienced. We talked about it beforehand and both agreed that I would let her take my virginity as we both believed I needed sexual experience. 


After a couple of weeks feelings started to develop on her end and the idea of a relationship came up. I still had yet to be in a serious relationship at this point so I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to be feeling and I was confused. I asked her to be in a relationship out of fear of losing her to someone else however this was what she wanted at the time. From this point we entered the Honeymoon phase.


The honeymoon phase lasted for about a year with us. We were always spending time together when we weren’t in class or working.  She had always spent her time over at my dorm, we always slept in the same dorm room bed together, and had a healthy sexual relationship. We would almost never argue and we were both pretty happy. 


The next summer was approaching us and we both needed to figure out our living situations. She was struggling financially at the time and I wanted to get a cheaper alternative than living on campus. I had plans with some old roommates to rent a house off campus and invited her to live with us. We didn't think it was a big deal since she had practically been living with me at the dorms and it would help her save money. We moved into the house at the beginning of the summer.


The honeymoon phase fizzled out after I got a summer internship a state away and had to move there away from her for the summer. The place I was at was in the middle of nowhere so there wasn’t much to do. We kept in contact on a regular basis through calls and text. I would always spend my weekends alternating between going back to college with her and going home to visit family and friends. She came to visit me a couple of times over the summer. By the time my internship ended and I was back to living in the house with her I could definitely tell we weren't the same as before.


Obviously we had talked about the situation. She explained what a “honeymoon period” was since she had been through it before and I hadn’t. It made sense to me at the time (*still does today to some extent*). Our relationship continued as time went on through college. We had arguments about little stuff every now and then but nothing ever too serious and nothing ever got too heated. We were happy with each other, but not struck with joy.


After another year or so she would always bring up how she didnt like living with our roommates. She talked about how she wanted to move her life along and start settling down. It seemed at the time she was always one step ahead in where she wanted the relationship to be at while I was one step behind and more patient. We talked about getting our own apartment and after some time that's what we did. We still live in the same apartment to this day.


Life in the apartment definitely improved our relationship from living at the house with the roommates but only slightly. At this point, as our studies became harder we spent more time apart focusing on schoolwork than the relationship. We were both busy students with demanding degrees and working jobs part-time. We graduated together last December with our bachelors degrees. Shortly after, she accepted a full time position locally while I decided to continue my masters at the same university.


This segment of our relationship pushed us even more apart due to the fact that she was working night shift and I was working heavy research hours at my university. I can best describe it as we were friendly roommates that went for an occasional outing to get food. We still loved each other, but we just never spent that much time together. 


She was expecting an engagement soon as we had talked about it plenty of times before. She had kept asking me when I was going to ask and I had always said “soon”. My main reason for putting it off at the time was that I didn’t want to be married until I had finished my master’s degree. Well, I finished my master’s degree this December and had decided I was ready to ask her to marry me. I bought the ring and proposed to her a couple of days before christmas. She had said “Yes”. We talked about it shortly after and she said she was happy with the way I asked and liked the ring. We then proceeded to celebrate christmas over the next couple of days (*both my mom’s and dad’s sides*). We made engagement announcements to both sides of my family. She made a facebook post alerting all of our friends/family and told all of her coworkers at work. After coming home from christmas she brings up a serious discussion with me.

---

**The Issue** : 
     One night after getting back from our christmas vacation we have a serious talk about our relationship. She brings up to me that ever since the engagement happened she is starting to have doubts. The way she explained it was that she was initially happy once i asked but that the happiness quickly faded away. She started thinking about her life as a whole and how seriously she thinks of marriage. 


Her and I hold the mentality in which we want to be ABSOLUTELY sure the person we marry is compatible and right. We both hate the idea of a divorce and bringing kids into a already unhealthy relationship. We also don’t like the idea of essentially wasting a big chunk of our life on someone who won’t be there in the end.


She admits to me in the conversation that she feels she is no longer “In Love” with me. She states that she still loves me and cares about me just not in love. We both recall how we used to feel in our first year together. She explains it as just the honeymoon phase and that if it was true love it would have kept going.


Reflecting back on herself, she says that she has a very codependent nature. Her opinions and goals are easily altered based on those she's around. She states that she has never really spent a long period of her time single (*which is true*). Therefore, she doesn’t truly know what she wants out of life, let alone a partner for life. She fears that what she thinks she wants in life as of now is heavily influenced based on my opinions.


We end the conversation after a couple of hours and she goes to work for the next couple of days. I pondered on what she said and started thinking about our relationship for the next couple of days. These days were hard as i fell into a quick temporary depression the first day and had mixed emotions the second. As soon as she is off of work again I tell her how I've been feeling and we decide to go out for dinner and talk about it some more. 


Shortly into our second discussion she says she needs to tell me something and makes me promise not to get mad. She explains in detail about a guy [~24 M] she had been texting these past couple of months (*will use the fake name John from here on out*). I had known about this because we don't keep secrets in our relationship and she had told me beforehand. John was a casual friend of hers before we had ever dated and while she was still in a relationship with her ex-BF. She states that she's always liked John’s personality but could never test anything out with him because either him or her were always in a relationship.


While we were dating they had never really talked that often. They talked about every once in a blue moon just to catch up and see how the other one was doing. Halfway through our relationship there was a time were she really wanted to go to a particular concert that was close to where we were. I’m not a huge fan of concerts (*went to a couple in my lifetime and found out it's just not my cup of tea*). She had really wanted to go with me but I was pretty hell bent on not going because I really didn't want too (*mistake #1 for me*). With my permission, she went with one of her best friends and John because both of them like the same kind of music. She had a good time at the concert. After the concert she hung out with John a couple of more times (*with a group of friends not one-on-one*). They kinda dropped off until they started texting each other again recently. They hung out again with another group within the last month. They have been texting each other frequently since then. 


During our discussion, she tells me that John admitted he had always had feelings towards her. She said she was completely furious about it at first telling John what was he thinking telling that to a person that is about to be engaged. She stopped texting him briefly before calming down and coming to her senses. She then told him that she did have some sort of connection with him when they first met but the timing was wrong. She said that they can’t hang out after knowing that and being in a committed relationship. He understood and respected that. Note that this all happened before I proposed to her.


The more we talked about it the more we came to agree with ourselves. We both agree that our relationship has not been as good as it was in the honeymoon phase. We both agreed that at this point in time we don’t have that “In Love” feeling although we still love and care about one another. We came to the conclusion to blame that on our relationship starting out as a fling. We came to the conclusion the our relationship passion faded with time due to COMPLACENCY. 


We are both in an awkward position at this point because all of these feelings were dispersed way after we should have talked about it and worked on our relationship in the past. Also the fact that this happened after we let the whole world know that we are engaged. We don't want to send red flags to family and friends. At the same time we don’t want to make the wrong decision when it comes to marriage. 


After asking her again what initially made her think like this, she said it was a mixture of what we talked about in our first discussion (*not truly knowing what she wants*) and John. That said, with John being the leading reason. We then talked about soul mates for a bit and having the “perfect” person to spend the rest of our life with. We both agreed that we don't think the other person is “perfect”. 


We also talk about how we owe it to one another to try and improve our relationship for the better. This was the least that we could do after spending 4.5 years together most of that living with one another. This coming from us both not liking to waste time and in fear of wasting each other's time.  


John is already graduated and recently accepted a job with the military far from here. He is leaving here late February and will go on to do 18 months of training. We came to an agreement to take a break from our relationship now until John leaves in February. This is to let her pursue him emotionally and give her some time to figure out her life goals. We both agreed that it has to be strictly emotional and that she doesn’t pursue him physically (*he is a virgin so it is not likely to happen regardless*). She also said that I should try to go on dates with other women in this period of time so that I can make sure she is who I want to be with since I am inexperienced. In the meantime we still have to live together and I am not allowed to ask her about John until he leaves in February. 


From March through May (*end of our lease*) we both agreed to work on our relationship. Our goal is to try to bring the passion back so that we both have the “In Love” feeling. At the end of May we plan to evaluate  our relationship and determine whether we want to seperate or not. Our original plan was to get a house together after May. If we both approve of the relationship in May then we will continue our plans to get a house and get married. If not, she will go on to get her own place.

**What I Need Help With** : (*Note if anyone needs more context to help me please leave a comment and let me know*)

**Over the last couple of days I have been an emotional wreck. I have been feeling love, hate, betrayal, guilt, jealousy, happiness, and everything in between. This is my first serious relationship so I have no idea how i’m supposed to be feeling or what I should do. I feel like I’ve been a terrible boyfriend over the years. I regret not making as much of an effort in the relationship. I am mad at myself for being complacent. In my current state I have a strong desire for our relationship to work out. I don’t want to see her go. I don’t like that my life’s plan has been shattered.**

* **Is it even possible to regain the passion once it’s lost? If so how is it done? What should I be doing to improve the relationship from March-May.**

* **Is our whole agreement a lost cause? Am I just wasting more of mine and her time?**

* **Can a successful long-term marriage happen if one party has only ever had one serious relationship?**

* **She gave me permission to see other girls between now and the end of February. At the moment this feels wrong to me, almost like betrayal. Should I make an effort to do this even though my gut reaction is no?**

* **What constitutes a good and successful marriage? How can I be sure that I marry the right person?**

---

**tl;dr** : Have had a decent relationship up until now. After engagement, GF wants to take a break to pursue herself and another guy. We also came to an agreement to work on our relationship together. This is the only serious relationship I have had. Is it worth it to give her some space then try to work it out? What constitutes a good and successful marriage? How can I be sure that I marry the right person?"
7nycf3,1,2018-01-03,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7nycf3/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

There’s something wrong with Maxwell Spinrad.

It’s not the fact that his hair is going grey at the temples. That prospect is actually helping him, bringing in more viewers as he ages into a silvery, mature persona. It’s also not the fact that he spends his weekends and holidays avoiding his house, preferring to live and die in the sanctity of the newsroom underneath the warm lights and cameras. 

“There’s something wrong with Maxwell Spinrad.” Autumn’s mother says to her, the evening before her internship starts. They are working together in their cramped kitchen to make dinner, bumping into one another over and over while pawing through shelves and drawers for supplies. At one point, Autumn’s head runs into some decorative wind chimes hanging from the ceiling, causing both the girl and the metal bars to cry out. 

“Why do we even have these hanging here?” Autumn asks, rubbing her head in a spot that causes her hair to disobey the hairspray that held it down. “It’s not like there’s wind inside.”

“They’re pretty,” her mother replies, “like you are. You need to be careful about that. Do you understand?”

Autumn holds her tongue, opting to nod instead. They eat their meal together in silence, facing a television that plays a happy pastel game show. In an hour, Channel 7 News would play, and Maxwell Spinrad would relay the day’s news to an audience of a few thousand watchers, tuned in from their homes stationed around the town. When she cleans her plate, Autumn retreats into the bathroom, attempting to take a shower. Halfway through, the drain begins to regurgitate an inky black liquid, forcing her to step out to grab a plunger, wondering what she just saw.

Perhaps the thing wrong with Maxwell Spinrad is that he’s too perfect. 
	
He is a news machine, taking emotionless teleprompter words, swallowing them, re-arranging them into sonorous lullabies, repacked for normal and everyday use. Autumn gets to see this directly, on her first day as an intern. The entire crew shuffles behind the scenes unplugging and replugging wires, pressing buttons, readying video clips. Maxwell Spinrad is still, sitting at his desk, waiting for the program to return for its final minutes. Autumn is also static among the sea of movement, hoping that someone will direct her, give her an instruction. For a second, the two lock eyes. 
	
“You’re the new intern, right? Could you do a coffee run for me, please?”
	
His voice is like chocolate being poured. It’s impossible to resist.
	
There’s a coffee place ten minutes walking distance from the station, and a ten minute line has accrued, but Autumn comes back triumphantly with a cup, switching hands often as to not burn the pads on her fingertips. Within minutes, Maxwell Spinrad has downed the drink, and is asking for more, sliding money on the glass reporting desk towards her. 
	
“You can’t be serious,” Autumn says. 
	
“I’ll show you something cool,” Maxwell Spinrad says, “If you do this for me. Nobody else on the staff will get me more than three cups a day.”
	
“Because it’s bad for you?”
	
She makes another trip, and returns with more coffee. Maxwell Spinrad drinks this batch as quickly as he did with the last. Content, he wraps up his nightly run as he does every night- he stares directly into the cameras, the souls of the viewers, and gives his signature sign off: “Thank you for your time tonight.”
	
For the first time all day, Maxwell Spinrad stands from his desk. His suit exaggerates his body features, adding extra sharp spots to an otherwise average body. He motions for Autumn to follow, and she obliges, taking soft footsteps as to not disturb the film crew. 
	
The storage room in the far back of the studio is musty, everything covered by a sheen of dust. The shelves are lined with boxes, and wires, and boxes holding wires, and broken equipment forgotten in time, and even occasionally an aged promotional poster. It hurt to breathe, but Autumn did it anyway. Something is placed in her hands, and Autumn is forced to inspect it. There’s a lens poking out in one direction, and in the other direction, a pixelated screen. 
	
“It’s a camcorder,” Maxwell Spinrad says, “Actually, it’s my camcorder. I was a part of the AV club in high school.”
	
Autumn fumbles with her words, eventually coming up with a sentence. “Oh! I’m a part of my AV club too. I actually brought it back to life after it went dead for a few years.”
	
Maxwell Spinrad smiles, and for the first time, something feels off, wrong, even. The smile feels broken, jagged, like someone had glued it together after falling off of a shelf. 
	
“Made a lot of home videos with that thing. I know it’s old, but you should do the same.”
	
Autumn shrugs off the feeling, and thanks Maxwell Spinrad for the gift. She packs it into her backpack, heading home for the night.
	
She sets up the camcorder in the corner of the living room that night, placing it on a tripod. Surprisingly, after charging the batteries, it lights up immediately, ready to record. Pressing a button, she runs into the center of the room, cheery smile and stretched out arms included.
	
“This is Autumn MacNell, reporting on today’s news! Now remember, Channel 7 is bringing you the best and most accurate news for the Goldlake region…”
	
Autumn begins listing off the day's events, behind a foldable wooden television tray. She has all of the excitement and none of the tact of Maxwell Spinrad, but with enough practice, enough heart, that could be fixed. With enough time, anything could be perfected, fine tweaked into greatness. Sometime between prattling off the basketball scores, she has to pause. A faint static has filled the air, causing her to choke up, and she doesn't know where it’s coming from. Autumn searches the room for some device that would be making the crackle, but turns up empty. The sound fades in a few minutes anyway, leaving her to her thoughts. 
	
The next few months are more of the same, with little exception. Autumn would attend school, rush home to do her homework, and return to intern at the television station. Most often, Maxwell Spinrad is begging, pleading for coffee in between the commercial breaks. Autumn begins to buy coffee for herself as well, upping her dose of caffeine from a small cup to an extra large over the course of a season, nearly matching the size of Maxwell Spinrad’s cup. During her own times of calm, Autumn takes to the the refuge of the camcorder, recording her own happenings throughout the day. Regardless of time or place or events, the static comes back, louder and longer than the previous times. It drowns out the rest of her hearing, consuming the information before she has a chance to listen. After a while, it begins to pop up when she doesn't record, muting her world and the events around it. She debates going to a doctor, but upon picking up the phone to make an appointment, the static sharpens, leaving her deaf.
***
	
There’s something wrong with Autumn MacNell.
	
She has stopped sleeping. On occasions, such as an important test being due, or the loss of her goldfish, she sat awake, working until the sun came up once more. This night, as well as every night for the past two weeks, she has stayed awake, unable to simply close her eyes, to spend the next few hours in an unmatched slumber. Autumn hasn’t felt the need for sleep, only a stronger and stronger craving for caffeine. On the fourteenth night without any rest, she pages through television channels, looking for anything interesting enough to take her mind off of the fact that going fourteen days without sleep is simply and undoubtedly unthinkable. She stops, pausing on the midnight news, finding herself staring at Maxwell Spinrad’s face tell the story of today. From what she can tell, he never takes a day off, never takes a break. If it were possible, he probably doesn't even sleep.
	
Something clicks within Autumn’s head. She begins to sneak outside, to drive to a familiar warm place with warm lights. She turns to leave, and behind her, in the kitchen, the chimes begin to let out soft noises, on their own, without the wind to carry them. 
	
Like she expected, he is there. 
	
It is midnight, and Maxwell Spinrad is reheating some leftovers in the news station’s microwave, staring absentmindedly at the rotating plate inside. The sound of the door clicking shut startles him, and he turns, to see Autumn crossing her arms.
	
“Don’t you have a family to go home to?”
	
Maxwell Spinrad smiles, and Autumn comes to realize that the smile is not wrong or broken, just obscuring something deeper.
	
“I don’t recall, Autumn. Tell me, what’s going on?”
	
Autumn pauses, and then divulges into a rant. Her words are pointed, better expressed than ever before. “I can’t sleep. I haven’t needed to for days. There’s a nonstop ringing in my ears. The wind chimes inside are moving without any wind. I can’t keep this up. This was all brought up by your stupid camcorder. I know it. I can feel it.”
	
“That’s so funny that you mentioned the wind chimes.” Maxwell Spinrad says, letting the microwave run out of time, letting it beep without repercussion. “Wind chimes are just, a vessel. Without something more important, like the wind, telling them the information, they’re just silent, and empty, and they’re nothing.”
	
Maxwell Spinrad forgets his plate altogether, and begins to leave, forcing Autumn to follow. “What the fuck is going on?” She asks, her voice no longer sounding like hers.
	
“That’s not very newscaster of you.” Maxwell Spinrad says, nearing the storage room. “You’ve been chosen. And I can’t help you. And I’m so sorry.”
	
“Chosen.”
	
He enters the stuffy room of boxes, and Autumn follows. Unlike last time, her breaths are clean, unconstricted. The static ringing in her ears fades completely, and for once, she’s able to focus. His hair over the past few months had continued to whiten, more strands of brightness poking from the jet black then before.
	
“Report to me the day’s events. You’ve been practicing for a while, haven’t you? You’ve gotten good at it.” 
	
“How do you kno--” Autumn goes to speak, but the static returns, unrelenting. She has to take a seat in a three legged chair in the corner, letting it wobble under her weight. 
	
“Tell me what happened today.” The chocolate voice says. She wants to resist, to leave, to go home and pretend to sleep the night away. But something deeper in her begins to stir, and her words begin to spill from her mouth unwillingly.
	
“There was an… an accident today. On interstate 102. A guy driving a Ford was T-boned, causing a seven car pileup. Uh, well, the witnesses said that it was the worst thing they’ve ever seen.”
	
Maxwell Spinrad, who stares intently at the girl, begins to gag. Autumn stops to help him, but he holds his palm out in her face. “I’m fine,” he says. There’s something wrong with Maxwell Spinrad. “Keep going.”
	
“There was also a protest at Nary High School today. One of the teachers was put on leave for allegedly flying a communist flag as a part of a social experiment. It managed to shut down the school for half of a day.”
	
Maxwell Spinrad retches again. His face looks pained, a drop of sweat accumulating and dropping from his nose. 
	
“After 6 days missing, they finally found that lost hiker today. Rescuers used several search animals, and after locating his scent--”
	
Maxwell Spinrad, no, Maxwell, no, Max, heaves one more time, only for something to come up. He opens his mouth, and something begins to drip out. It’s some sort of sticky, inky black substance that creates a splat among the floor. He promptly straightens himself out. His hair was now entirely white, as if the thing he threw up in the corner was coloring it in the first place. The blackness on the floor begins to move, inching towards Autumn. Max begins to speak, his teeth and gums stained by the shadows. The voice that comes from him is no longer what it used to be, a shell of itself, wimpy and whiny and scratching. Autumn, too overcome by the static of the universe and the void itself, couldn’t hear it anyway. 
	
“You’re too perfect. It’s chosen you. I’m sorry.” he repeats over and over, as the blackness comes ever closer. When it is all said and done, the static disappears, and Autumn MacNell is able to speak again. But it is not her voice.

See, I tend to come up with ideas on the fly and sort of throw things out to any potential partner I find. I suppose that isn't a bad thing but my biggest issue is finding a partner that can handle the rambling I tend to do about ideas and even occasionally in the role play itself. But if you can handle that I'm more than happy to play out almost anything your heart might desire, my only limits are bathroom stuff and gore!

*Rule 34*; I'm fine playing with canon characters, original, or even a mix of both! 

- Pokemon

- One Piece

- Xenoblade

- Legend of Zelda

- Overwatch

- Mass Effect

- League of Legends

- Persona

- Fire Emblem

- Potentially some Marvel or DC, though I'm not familiar with every character if you're into it feel free to let me 
know.

There's plenty more as well so feel free to suggest anything you might like, this is all just things I'm pulling out of the air!

*Pairings I tend to enjoy*; I'll list the ones I prefer to play on the right! This one will be a little on the short side because there's a ton I enjoy but these'll be the few that I can come up with.

- Mother x Son

- Sister x Brother

- Teacher x Student 

- Roommates

- Boss x Intern

- Sister's best friend x brother


*Celebs*; Here I'll just go and list some that I like, I won't do bullet lists like the others because I'll list as many as I can here to give as many options as possible! We can come up with a role play involving them as just a normal person, the celeb they are, or whatever you'd like.


Christina Hendricks, Anne Hathaway, January Jones, Alison Brie, Kate Upton, Scarlett Johansson, Olivia Wilde, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, Anna Kendrick, Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Zooey Deschanel, Margot Robbie, Heather Graham, Isla Fisher, Jennifer Aniston, Jessica Biel, Mila Kunis

I hope to hear from some of you soon! I prefer to play here on PM's or I do have reddit chat, though I've never used it before I'm more than happy to give that a shot if you'd like!"
7nzm51,2,2018-01-03,529 savings advice,howard_m00n,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7nzm51/529_savings_advice/,"So I have an idea for a 529, but I'd like some input to see if I am overlooking anything.

My wife and I recently went back to school together, and my tuition is covered by the GI Bill. However, money for my wife's education expenses only come from scholarships which do not cover the total cost. 

This coming semester, I will be receiving an overpayment of $6000 in scholarships/grants. My wife will not be taking classes again until August due to working an internship. Usually I put my scholarship overpayment towards her tuition, but this semester I will not need to. 

So my idea is to open a 529 and deposit the overpayment, using it to pay her education expenses in the fall and subsequent semesters. This will allow me to gain a tax benefit for the 2018 year as well as give me about 8 months to grow the money and hopefully have a larger sum to spend tax free on her education. 

Is there any issue with this idea? Obviously one thing to consider is the fact that the return on the investment is not guaranteed.

Thanks for any help!"
7nznf8,0,2018-01-03,(USA) 2500 Personal Loan for Misc Expenses,ObitoHata,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7nznf8/usa_2500_personal_loan_for_misc_expenses/,"I want to take out a $2500 personal loan for miscellaneous expenses. Namely, car insurance, post graduation expenses, as well as money for a brief vacation with friends (it's senior year and I've never gotten to travel with them so...)

My Financial Situation
I am 21 years old.
I'm currently attending school (Computer Science Major) and I'm on my final semester. I have no expenses to cover at school.
I make about $400 a month via work study (it is directly deposited into my account since I've already paid my school in full)
Currently I pay $145 for my car every month (it is almost paid off in full, I expect this to be a non issue once I start my full time employment). I also pay $168 for car insurance every month. Lastly, I pay $25 a month for a credit card.
Monthly Expenses: 338
Monthly Earnings: 400
Net: +62
Since I have a full meal plan and I have some money saved up from my summer internship I generally end up getting by just fine.
I accepted a job offer starting at $70k + $10k bonus in my town.

My Goal:
Take a $2500 personal loan and use that money to pay for a trip (I expect my trip expenses to be no more than $600), and to cover my car insurance for the rest of the year ($923 as or right now)

That would leave me $977 in excess to cover graduation expenses and other miscellaneous expenses.

My Tentative plan
Upon Graduation I will stay with my mother for 3 months (Jun-August) and use the money saved there to fully pay off my car, (~$1600 left upon graduation), My credit card (~800 left upon graduation), and this personal loan (~$2500). In total that means I expect to pay off $4900 of my debt over the course of this upcoming summer [the 10k bonus is rewarded after 3 weeks, it is taxed down to about $7k). Accounting for taxes this shouldn't present any financial burdens. Afterwards, I will begin to pay off student loan debt (about $24k, I have not yet decided the rate at which I will be paying off this debt, but I was thinking 3-5 years is more than enough time. Obviously if I lose my job (I don't expect that to be the case, but shit happens) that puts a wrinkle in my plan.

So my question to you all is: Does taking out the 2500 seem like a really risky plan? Also any suggestions on my plan are appreciated!

Note: I know life doesn't always workout exactly as plan!

Thanks for reading all of this!!!"

I am EpicChiguire and this is a desperate and final attempt at getting a game on this sale. I was asking for [Assassin's Creed: Origins](https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftofGames/comments/7msfnq/request_assassins_creed_origins_or_the_story_of_a/), but to no avail, so imma try to get Life is Strange: Before the Storm. It's currently on sale for 12$ and well, it belongs to one of my favorite franchises. It's been sitting on my [wishlist](http://steamcommunity.com/id/coqueroman/wishlist/) since it came out, and seeing the reviews, I feel more than ready to feel and cry like a baby with this game.

**¿Quién soy?**

I'm am a 22 year old Venezuelan guy who studies Modern Languages. I lived all my life in Venezuela up until this year, because I am currently in Argentina taking an Internship as a Spanish as a Second Language Teaching Assistant. My interests are not only gaming, but History, Writing (I have a blog with short stories and poems that I update every once in a while), and Filmmaking (in fact, I am planning on shooting a short film in January-February with a couple of friends, God willing).

**Why this game?**

So, this game isn't made by Dontnod Entertainment as its predecessor, but it follows the same story because it's a prequel: it follows the story of Chloe Price and Rachel Amber long before the original game. Now, to those of you who have played the first game, you know the feels and how tight-gripping the story was, and how well tailored was that game. I submerged myself in Archadia Bay for 15 hours during those five chapters, where I laughed, longed, fell in love with the characters and cried a lot (and with this, I mean **a whole big lot**) with its heart-breaking ending (sorry, but I chose the good of the many). I really liked Max Caulfield as a character because she was kind, introverted and a really melancholic person with a great talent... it reminds me of my best friend. Now, the friendship that she had with Chloe, even though it is from a work of fiction, is deep, beautiful and even tragic to some extent. Also, the love that Chloe had for Rachel (shown during the whole 5 episodes, but one that reached its climax during episode 4) is something that I'd like to explore (and this game gives me the chance to do it).

**Why can't I buy this game by myself?**

I can't buy this game because it's worth 40 bucks right now (with the Steam discount). I'm taking my Internships in Argentina (and I basically moved here from Venezuela... I could say that I'm self exiled at this point), and I literally can't get a job at the moment because said Internships are full time and I don't have the time to work somewhere else. Given the fact that this University is giving me food and accommodations, they deemed necessary to give me 100$ a month in order to pay for my personal expenses. Now, 100USD is 1750 Argentinian pesos. I am undergoing some therapy at the moment, and between the sessions, the meds, and my personal expenses (like shampoo, soap and deodorant, because I may be a pig, but at least a clean one), those 1750 pesos fly away very, very easily. I can't complain because I get food and a place where to sleep, but taking into account the fact that I am from Venezuela (my country is in the worst crisis of its history, to the point where the minimum wage is 1 DOLLAR A MONTH), and I am living in another country on my own (away from my parents and my siblings, whom I miss with all I am), I need to save every single penny I can in order to start maintaining myself while I get a job and a place to live after I'm done with these internships.

I didn't even have the money to go back to Venezuela for Christmas, and I just spent my first Christmas day away from my old folks and my brother and sister, which, I won't lie... it was a bummer. I admit that I cried, but I only did it after I spoke with mom over the phone because I knew she was gonna start sobbing too. Imagine the idea of not being able to return to your country because if you do, you'll very likely to face starvation, the biggest inflation in America, the highest crime rate in the continent... and the list goes on. The sole idea of my Homeland going through that situation breaks my heart and really depresses me, to be honest. Getting Assassin's Creed: Origins won't make the depression go away, nor will it make my country get out of this situation. It won't even be able to make me worry less about how is my family doing in my country... but it could be my first Christmas present in the year, one that could help me cope with all I feel (you guys are gamers too and you know how gaming helps to cope with bad feelings).

Thank you for reading this! A big hug.

I've been in the city the two summers prior for summer internships, and have family in the city as well.

I started doing some preliminary apartment hunting in the last few weeks and started looking at the top end of my price range (going by 1/40 of gross salary). As I'm sure their marketing budget intends, I discovered a cool recent construction building that has standard luxury apartment stuff (elevator, doorman, package room, gym, lounge, etc. etc.) but also a few niche amenities that sound great at least on paper (per-unit washer/dryer), and seem common to all the buildings by this developer. I also really like how the location sounds, it's on the water, and a trusted friend suggested the neighborhood to me.

The primary downside to this location for me is the commute. As someone who has previously lived only in Manhattan (east village and fidi), it's about a half mile to both the L and JMZ. It's also very close to the ferry, both the current and the new-L-alternative one. Given I'll be working in midtown (around 20th and 4th ave), the L with optional transfer to 6 depending on weather was how I previously got to work, and with the shutdown looming I'm unsure what would work best or how bad it'll be.

The second issue is, of course, that I'll be maxing out what I should be paying. I'm very lucky to be graduating with very little debt (about 10k), and anticipate that even at a ridiculous rent level (negotiating my way up to a 1br in this building) I'll have enough money to pay off the debt and still afford good food and have some fun money left over. It would cut into savings a bit the first year, but after that, especially given the pay bump that the initial ladder-bump-promotion provides, I'd have no trouble being able to save adequately and still afford the apartment. I also have lived very cheaply during past summers while working in the city, and have been able to save up enough money to insulate me a bit from any problems during the year, and leverage against my student debt.

tl;dr I feel like this arrangement - cutting some saving ability for a year to stay in a cool apartment - makes too much sense in my head, and I'm failing to consider something. Talk me out of moving somewhere expensive, or point out where I'm being an idiot!
(As an aside: avoided putting this higher because I don't want to advertise or attract people who just want to shit on the neighborhood, but the building is 325 Kent (website with this name if you Google it) in Williamsburg.)"

I'm a junior right now and I'm curious what my chances would be in the future. I know it's very hard to predict what I would get on tests and grades, but what should I shoot for? I'm curious if I even have a shot at any medical schools as of now?

TX Resident, URM (half hispanic (Mexican) half Arab), compelling story (almost died when I was 10, was stabbed several times by my schizophrenic mother, haven't seen her in 10+ years). Not sure if I would ever include this, or if this is just too bizarre/too weird, but it's always had a huge impact on my life. How I operate my day-to-day activities and everything.

current GPA:
cGPA: 3.51 
sGPA: 2.9
Psych major, bio minor

Projected GPA after graduating: 
cGPA: 3.62
sGPA: 3.31

These GPA's are almost identical with AMCAS and TMDSAS.

strong upward trend in sGPA, cGPA.

3 C's: gen chem 1, gen chem 2, ochem 1 (C+, C, C)
will be taking ochem 2 this upcoming semester (spring 2018)

I'm going to take a gap year, so I can include my senior year GPA.

I've estimated my future classes to have mostly all A's, maybe one B (I've heard bad things about biochem and pre-calc professors)

Research:
Psychology animal research (activity budgets, continuous sampling/observation) will be presenting a poster this semester at a regional psych conference (2+ years). Observed animals at the zoo and collected data on their behaviors. Formally assist zoo customers with any questions or concerns they have about the particular animal, or questions about the zoo in general. Really meaningful experience.

Psychology social psych research (survey, looking at data about sexual orientation, sexual knowledge, and confidence) will be presenting a poster this semester at a regional psych conference (10 months)

Will be a research assistant volunteer for my psychology professor this semster, helping her on various psych research projects. (projected 1.5 years)
Clinical hours:
No shadowing hours as of yet, planning on starting this summer

Hospital volunteering: volunteered at 2 hospitals, about 120 hours total

Hospice volunteering (4 hrs/week) since Aug 2017, will be continuing this likely until after I graduate. Very meaningful experience so far

(clinical/non?) Crisis Text Line Crisis Counselor (Crisis hotline (via text)) since Aug 2017, 70 hours, will be continuing this for the next year or more. Meaningful experience

Non-clinical: none as of now (unless you include Crisis text line), but I will pick up something in the next few months or so and try to get around 100 hours.

EC's:
I work as an Interfaith Peer Minister in my campus's ministry, holding conferences, events, and other things to promote dialogue between other religions, and allow for a safe campus that coexists with all people, regardless of religion. (2.5 years, will be continuing until I graduate, so 4 years total). Very meaningful experiences

Interfaith Student Organization President. Pretty much over see everything I already do as a peer minister, but also renew the club, get members, hold meetings, etc.

Will need to complete a required internship for graduation, unsure what I will do currently, but I will list it on my application later on.

Hobbies I'm picking up as of now: piano and mountain biking.

I know I'm thinking pretty ahead, since I haven't finished school, and haven't taken the MCAT either. I plan on taking it senior year (study May-July, take July(?), apply to medschool at the same time?)

I also plan on working as a medical scribe during my gap year. I might start this summer, and just continue working through senior year, but I'm not sure if I'm up for that gamble, considering I'll need to take my internship senior year, and I already work on campus.

Thanks all, I appreciate even giving my thread a look. I appreciate all you guys do here."

I have a firm grasp on computers and how they work ie. motherboards, graphics cards etc. Now there is one thing I have an actual question about so I figured to consult the experts. In order to ask the question I have to start with this story.

I'm a marketing intern, and I've recently been put in charge of a team of people to scan and document old files from over 30 years, the whole point of this is to digitize and free up space in our storage facility, and we need to store these digitized files, I brought up the ideas of either making a super computer with a lot of storage (somewhere around maybe 10 TB? idk if a computer can even have that much.) another thing would be to have external hard drives again upwards of 10 TB and lastly the thing final one brought up was creating a server for these files, now my company kind of had a bad run in with not backing up servers and everything got lost, so it may be harder to sell that idea.

Now to my question, which one do you guys think would be the most cost-effective and secure? I also thought about doing two at one time, like having a server and have it backed up in an external hard drive. something like that. Also, if there is a possible solution I didn't mention please let me know, please reply if you have any ideas that could help in any way."

7o1y7h,1,2018-01-04,What to expect from my future in the USA as an Indian studying Computer Science from a top school?,seal0rds,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/7o1y7h/what_to_expect_from_my_future_in_the_usa_as_an/,"There has been a lot of fuss around the visa reforms lately. I understand that these are essentially due to the outsourcing of tech work to IT professionals in India in consultancy based companies like Infosys, TATA, Wipro, IBM etc.

I'm a software guy (not IT) and as much as it saddens me, there's no getting away from the fact that all Indians in tech have to bear the weight of these exploiters.

I did my bachelors in a top CS school in the USA and am now pursuing my masters at the same school, I have a summer internship lined up in the bay area, and I'm looking to do well to seal a full-time there. However, I'm anxious that these visa reforms are gonna make tech companies more picky in hiring internationals (specifically Indians).

My question is, what exactly is the status of the new bill to end H1B visa extension? Has it been passed by the Senate? If not, what do you think are the chances of passing? If passed, how does it impact regular legal immigrants like myself who acquire their bachelors and masters in the USA?

tl;dr: am I getting deported

Thank you!"
7o25pq,7,2018-01-04,Had a rough falling out with a female friend. Haven't spoken since October. Tried to break the silence when something happened that cut me deep.,strik3r2k8,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7o25pq/had_a_rough_falling_out_with_a_female_friend/,"We work together and knew one another for 3 years. 

 Recently her roommate beat her and the boyfriend of her roommate just watched. She called me crying. I rushed to pick her up and helped her move out her stuff to storage. I took her to a couple of hotels that week and stood by her side for her court dates and helped her get to her second job. A few friends helped her by letting her stay. I couldn't because I live with relatives.
 
Eventually I helped her get her stuff into her new apartment and her mom moved in with her.

A week later things went sour with a girl I liked. She basically ghosted on me. So I kept to myself that weekend. I came to work to buy something I needed. My friend was there so I went to go see how she was doing. Seeing her felt good since I was depressed at the time. But she ignored me. 

 I messaged her the next day asking if she was ok. She told me she wanted to  part ways and didn't feel like a friend anymore. She didn't feel the vibe anymore, even during that time I was helping her. She pointed out that day I came to the job saying she felt I was clingy because I showed up with no notice. 

 Pointed that she felt I got too close.

 I didn't wanna argue so I said I was sorry if I made her feel uncomfortable. And I'll respect her wishes. So until New Years I completely ignored her. 
 On New Years Eve, she paged my department, I answered and she was pretending she could not hear me. Even though I called that extension 15 minutes ago and another associate answered. 

 That night I went up to her and just wanted to let her know I wasn't mad and just wanted  us to stop being  dumb. I was being prideful and avoiding her because I didn't know what to say.

 Before I could say much she told  me I should talk to the manager. I'm like ""Why?"". And she tells me that he told her to let him know if I try to speak to her.

 I look at her like ""Why would you do that? I didn't do anything to you"".

 She ignored me and was just straight up cold.

 I just looked at her shook my head and said ""Really?"" and walked away.


 My manager came by and asked what was up with the two of us. I told him ""No idea. We haven't spoken in a while over a misunderstanding. I just wanted to talk it out and she does this."" Even he was confused because he knows that she went to me for help, and knows we were  good friends. He just suggested to stay away. I agreed.

I think I'm just gonna quit that place. I'm almost done with my internship and will go full time soon. I feel stabbed in the back by someone I looked out for and was close with for years. 

 I really didn't expect for our friendship to be fixed but to go to that extreme? I spoke to another friend about it and they noticed that she changed since she went back on her feet."

7o26dp,1,2018-01-04,[M4F] Female Celebrity Prompts Inside!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7o26dp/m4f_female_celebrity_prompts_inside/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7o29ty,16,2018-01-04,"I've got a crush on one of my best (and only!) friends. If I could give 100% honesty about my life this last year, this is what I would say.",ThrowAway_EIRELAV,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/7o29ty/ive_got_a_crush_on_one_of_my_best_and_only/,"Ok, so this *may* end up being longer than it needs to be. Long story short, I haven't been able to sleep at all the last two weeks from all on my mind, and I need to put all the things in my head somewhere so I don't go crazy. Basically, this turned into my entire life story. Someone may as well know.

In for the long haul? Great. Let's get started.

Hey everyone. I hope you all had a great New Year's! Mine sucked. Not in the typical, ""oh, well, I guess it's 2018 now"", but more in the ""oh, my few friends already have plans and nobody from high school really cares enough to invite me to anything."" Not that I have an urge to interact with those people anyways at this point.

You see, my situation has never exactly been ideal. Heck, I'm not exactly the most *ordinary* of specimens. When I was in 2nd grade, I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. This was in the early days, where you had to be *really bad* to get a diagnosis, before everyone was self-diagnosing based on the internet and it was well known.

My parents were told I may never be able to succeed ""normally"" in life or go to college, much less be able to sit through the ACT and SAT normally with my condition. My dad, a farmer who I suspect is also on the spectrum, still hoped however that I would someday follow him into his profession of Farming, since I'm his only son and we would be facing some of the same challenges. I proved the anomaly to all of their expectations.

I have to thank God that my parents decided not to hold me back in school because of this. Had they done so, things may have turned out completely differently.

And so, I struggled through elementary school and much of Junior High/High School, an alien out of my element. Fifth grade was the worst year of my life, when I lost two of my grandparents in less than a year, my routine was messed up with my teacher sporadically showing up because of cancer treatments, and a severe depression and loneliness setting in along with my addiction to videogames. I believed that machines were better than people, because they made sense to me and they had never been mean to me. In reality, I was suffering from severe depression, and was on the path to contemplating suicide.

Things changed when these machines, these electrical addictions were removed from my life. I was broken. I came to realize that everything I had been doing was wrong... it was wrong not to care, not to be kind and respectful, not to want to be a good person who could improve the world. I've read some places that your personality, who you are is largely set in life, foundational by the time you can talk and interact. I'll tell you: sixth grade, I changed entirely who I was, and was one of the small percentage who completely changed the direction of their lives.

This doesn't mean I suddenly knew how to interact with people, or how to make friends. It did mean I knew how to say sorry for being such a crappy person to the people I knew, and to start learning how to seem ""normal"". Aspergers never goes away, it never gets better, we just get better at hiding how much we struggle with it in casual conversation. The next few years, I honed my skills at learning how the world works.

In eighth grade, I joined Cross Country, which led me down the path to discovering more than I could have ever known about the world otherwise. I already understood hard work from the fields on the farm. I may not be a natural runner, but I know how to work hard and be passionate about what I do. Odds are, this may be where you inadvertently first enter my story, since the team you ran on often showed up at our meets.

Cross Country showed me what people were like and how they interact. It showed me the camaraderie of teamwork, and how the people you work with can be like family to you. It gave me awesome role models to look up to, people who worked hard and who could easily socialize, who could be leaders. I had big shoes to fill.

Eventually, I filled them. By golly, somehow I filled them. At the end of the season my last two years, I was awarded and recognized for team spirit and being the hardest worker, for bringing everyone else up with me as I ran and practiced. As our coach said, I was the hardest runner to replace after graduation, not because I was the fastest, but because I kept everyone positive and working hard, believing in the best and most positive parts of who they are. My positivity brought up the entire team when things were hard.

In a way, this leadership led me down several paths. I never liked to deal with bureaucracy, and I refused to accept that when bad things happen, they need to hold you down. Freshman year of High School, I had the worst math teacher in my life. She was unable to properly teach students, and me being a special case was no help. At multiple points, she brought me to tears for wanting to learn in class, and for doing it differently than she taught. Suffice to say, she only taught for one year, and is no longer a teacher of any students.

I learned equally as much from her as from a good teacher though: I learned to do what I loved so I wouldn't fail once I begun doing it full time, and I learned what I could really do. I began a journey teaching myself Mathematics from the book since I had no teacher who could teach it to me, while taking the ACT multiple times a year to see how it would go.

That summer, I took Algebra II as an online class, and that year I took Precaclulus.... with the seniors. As you know, my school isn't very large. I graduated with a total of 27 people! We don't exactly have advanced classes. So I guess that makes me a record setter when I'm the first person from my school to ever take an AP class in the form of AP Calculus... Junior Year. Through an online/video conference class from a neighboring school. 

Things were looking up. I was involved with Cross Country, Track, FBLA, National Honors Society, Drama, Speech, Band/Choir, I sang at church, I was 4-H Vice President (soon to be President), and I actually kinda got into the groove of things. Things were good. I had actually first heard of you at this point!

You're probably wondering how I had heard of you. Well, it all has to do with the two-week, Molecular Biology Boot Camp that I participated in the summer after my Sophomore year. The professors who ran it, who are good friends of mine to this day, mentioned how your dad, another professor, had helped organize the boot camp, got the funding, and made it happen. They also mentioned you, but said that you weren't to be involved with the boot camp for some reason I forget, maybe conflict of interest or you were down in Chicago getting special ACT prep or something? It was a long time ago, I can't remember the details exactly!

I was curious even then at who you were. I saw your dad once during those two weeks, and was intimidated, but I asked my questions and left an impression as I usually do. I wonder if he remembers me from that summer so long ago.

This boot camp was also where I had my first crush. A local girl from a neighboring school our age was also going to the boot camp, and she didn't have a driver's license- so, being the gentleman I was, I offered to drive her to the college for those two weeks. For those two weeks, I drove and we talked, I taught her to solve Rubik's Cubes, and I thought we became friends. Maybe we could become more than friends, I thought, but even just friends was fine. People who understood me and who could hold a conversation with me were, and still are, few and far between.

I somehow got up the guts to ask her if we could go to a movie together, or if we could hang out sometime, even just as friends. In what has become all too familiar, she said no and disappeared from my life, not responding to any texts and not acknowledging me at any of our school events (our schools have co-oped sports programs.) Homecoming she ignored me, football games she pretended I didn't exist, and I was forced to give up after waiting all summer for even the possibility of anything. For those two weeks, we become good friends. Then, she disappeared from my life.

Still, though, I was moving up in the world, and I saw the future as bright. I was taking Calculus! I had just scored over 30 on the ACT! My family was taking things seriously enough that, after a great amount of pestering, we went to Boston to tour MIT, where I dreamed of going to college! This was a big step for me. My dad had always wanted his only son to be a farmer like him. It was his biggest dream to see the farm continue in his progeny. I have, and always will have been, a failure in that respect. I broke his heart in being who I am, and broke my own as well trying to escape from that life early on, trying to escape the guilt of being a failure for his dreams. Yet, this trip to MIT was organized by him, and it was the first sign he gave that *no matter what I did, he would be proud of me.* This was a really big step forward for both of us.

Later on Junior year, I had my first and only girlfriend. We met in Speech, and both realized that we had a lot in common. Honestly though, I knew that we would never last, and we didn't past two or three months as we drifted apart by the time summer break came around. I will be short: it was an unhealthy relationship, one in which I began to change who I was to try to make it work. This taught me never to change myself for someone else, a very important lesson. In retrospect, I think we came together because she saw how smart and kind I was, and I met someone who actually returned my love for the world and everyone else, and I wanted to keep that the longest I could because I didn't want to be alone. I didn't know how to be alone and be happy.

Guess what: I learned pretty darn quickly. By summer me and her were broken up, and I wasn't sure what to feel or think anymore in the aftermath. Some people think people with Asperger's/Autism have no emotions. In reality, for me and many others at least, our emotions and empathetic centers are extremely strong, but we don't know how to communicate or understand those feelings in other people. In a way, we can see inwards how lonely we are, but cannot communicate outwards to fix that loneliness. If you want, google the depression and suicide rates associated with Aspergers. They aren't exactly pretty. I had finally someone who made me less lonely, but I didn't know how to be myself when in the situation. I only finally figured everything out with my emotions this last semester, which has allowed me to move on and seriously consider a serious relationship again.

This summer (the summer of 2016) you know as well as I do. The reason you know is is because we lived most every day of it together as lab partners and coworkers doing research alongside college students, as two of the youngest lab interns (being high school students!) I have to say, no matter what: thank you. Genuinely, thank you for being a major part in the best summer of my life. I know nostalgia makes memories better than they were at the time, but I can only look at that summer and remember good things, happy memories and positive events. No matter what happens from here, know that this summer made us lifelong friends.

You may know the summer, but you don't know my full side of it. Remember: I literally broke up with my girlfriend just a week or so before I met you. I had no interest in another relationship right away. I didn't want anything more than just a friend, and that's what we were. Even still, the heart is a strange beast, and I had a small crush on you even then, a small crush I stowed away for another future day for the above reasons, and one other:
*You already had a boyfriend*!

I mean, its possible you're still dating. In fact, I'm really worried about this possibility, because at the end of the day I want you to be happy and I won't be a contributing factor to that if you felt that you had crushed me by turning me down. That would just make both of us feel guilt.

Anyways. As far as I know, you'd only just met him that spring in Track. In a strange occurrence that seems to have become my life, I was definitely not first choice for you by the facts, and in fact I was only a few months too late for where I should have been before. I'll be honest, when I found out by looking on your Instagram at the late hour of 2:00 A.M., I was crushed. Even then, your confusing feelings made it hard for me to sleep. I slept not an hour that night due to the tears that I was too late and had no chance. So, I stowed those feelings away, all the complicated feelings I felt, and decided it was alright for us to be just friends. Good thing, too, since I only just figured out my feelings in general recently.

That summer ended, but our friendship did not. That year, I had one class left to graduate high school, so I took my high school class in the morning before driving up to the college we were working at, to your hometown, and took most of my classes there. I'm pretty sure I'm the only person to ever graduate from my High School with Calculus 3 on my transcript. Heck, it might be a record for all the small schools in our state for all I know.

I haven't gotten to the punchline of my life yet, have I? So here I am, coming into senior year working hard on applications for colleges, being a leader in multiple organizations (especially in Cross Country), the main actor in our school play for drama, and still looking forward positively to the future. When I heard back from MIT, as well as several other colleges, I got... Waitlisted? Oh, the irony! Again, the same thing as I had often found before in my life! Basically, it means they're saying ""*hey, you'd be in the right place here. But, you're not our first choice. So wait longer and we'll see what happens*!""

I'll tell you, it's a pretty crappy feeling to be waitlisted. What's worse is when you don't hear back until basically two weeks before you graduate, when senioritis is hitting so bad you just want to know what your life is going to contain at all. What it holds.

In the end, I got crushed. By multiple waitlists. It's great to think that they were all basically saying, yeah, we think you're the right person to change the world with us, but you're not quite as good as the other people we're also offering admission to, so we won't be able to fit you in. Have a good life!

Since I had no idea whether I would have to move to Boston or somewhere else across the country over the summer, I was unable to find an internship or job over the summer. So, I took more classes and slowly descended into insanity working mind-numbing hours on the farm. I only saw you a few times this summer. I wish I had seen you more! I saw you at graduation, and that was awesome. You got to see the farm, my life, and what things were like from a bit of my perspective. You were the valedictorian of your class if I understood things correctly. Apparently since I only officially took 1 class my senior year, I was outta the running for any recognition. I didn't care, I was just happy to have classes that were a little more challenging than what I was used to.

So now we come to this last semester. I really showed what I could do this last semester. I worked 10 hours a week as a math tutor, while taking a ludicrous credit load at 19 credits as a freshman taking junior math classes, I'm triple majoring, I built a homemade CNC machine in my spare time, and I repaired an old oscilloscope to working order, all while maintaining a 4.0 semester GPA. Yeah, sure, maybe according to some people I'm smart. But that's not what I remember this semester by. I remember it by the many people I met and friends I made... before they made their own friend groups and began to ignore me. I remember the girl that turned my head and world upside down, and who still does every day I see her. She tore through my plans of staying single until graduation, and then proceeded to lead me on before destroying me twice by saying she can't ever feel *that way* about me, maybe ever. Even still, we are very good friends. I blame myself for doing the same thing multiple times and expecting a different result. When someone gets a boyfriend, tells you and crushes you, then breaks up with them and starts spending all their time with you, only to crush you again two weeks later, well, you'd be confused by the signals even if you weren't Autistic. 

She made me realize all the things about my emotions though that I was bottling up. All my doubts about colleges, that I was a failure, that I felt (wrongly!) I was being limited by where I was. You know, the reality is the city, the college we worked and met, the college I now attend every day and see that building we worked in every day, they took me in when every other place turned me down. Our town and college has always accepted me with open arms, and that's more than I can say about anything else in my life.

So now the semester is done, and I've come to realize that real friends are few and far between, and that none have chosen to be friends with me. I spent New Year's alone. I spent the semester alone, even though I tried not to. Even my roommate magically didn't show up on move in day, so the universe has been pushing me to be alone this whole semester. It's more lonely than ever when people disappear on you, and basically act like you don't exist.

The biggest consolation of all of this is that people don't mean to be unkind. They simply forget about people like me when they have their own friends, their own social groups, their own lives.

When I saw you two weeks ago, I realized just how much more mature, much older you had become this last semester. I suppose I have done the same. As much as I tried to again put these feelings about you away, this crush that I had on you, after this semester I was unable to bottle things up any longer. After this year, I must be honest, even if you won't see it.

You haven't posted anything about that boyfriend of yours on social media in over six months, and it appears you have actually removed posts of you two on Instagram. Thus, I hopefully need not feel guilt by expressing my emotions.

You are one of 3 people I have ever met who can hold a full-on conversation with me. One of 2 people who understands me enough to truly be a close friend of mine. You are the only person I have ever met who wants to change the world like I do, who shares my positivity about the world. While we have a lot in common, we also overlap our strengths to help each other improve at what we do every day. You give me a hug every time I see you, which I absolutely adore but don't know how to put into words the thanks for. You laugh at my terrible puns and jokes, and you don't have your face stuck in your phone like most of these zombies in our modern generation. You are someone who I always hesitated with my emotions about before, because I wasn't sure. Of anything. After seeing you two weeks ago, I no longer hesitate about how I feel about you.

The only thing remaining now is the pain I get when I realize that however important you have become in my mind, in my world, I barely register in your world. When I see you in person, we seem perfect and I am genuinely happy. When I'm sitting by the phone, on nights like tonight, I wait 3 days for a response to a text and I watch your snapchat score count upwards while I wait for responses. I don't want to be annoying or obsessive. I just want to be honest about my feelings with you, and not be crushed again this year. Either way, the truth sets us free. So here it is.

My feelings have grown from a small crush stowed away to a large crush which is dragging me down. You will likely never see this whole story, but when we meet again Monday, I'll have to explain things somehow. I'll have to free myself of this burden. No matter what, I will always consider you among my best of friends.

Thanks for reading this block of my life. If you want, you can discuss as much as you like, but please don't try to figure out who I am. Maybe she'll see this in time. Honestly, this story is missing a lot of the finer details, like how the book Les Miserables kept me through in the worst of the loneliness, how music brings me joy, how our friendship has grown over time, the innumerable things that happen every day in my life. I cannot put down every word I have, only the ones that are in my mind at this time. Hello, and goodbye honesty, may you set me free from fear. :)"

I was loyal to Best Buy, a good worker according to my evals , and it seemed most had positive things to say about me. I worked there from the time I started school till now, having internships in the summer time, and returning to work from Sept-May.

I informed them in November I would be leaving when I graduate in May as I am relocating somewhere approximately 7 hours away,

Am I crazy to of felt a little betrayed by Best Buy after telling them this in good faith only to be stabbed in the back because it “would affect their turnover rate”? 

Not trying to start trouble but as someone searching for a job to at least put gas in their car over the next five months I can’t help but feel a little bitter. "

Last summer, we went to different cities for internship. This was the first time we were away and not at our family home. Everything seemed fine, we even met during the summer. We would flirt and talk everyday. One day she called me and began crying. She told me that she believes that she is too selfish. When I inquired why she thinks that way, she made up some story related to her not helping her flatmate with some stuff. 

Few weeks down the line, I received a huge text from her. She said that she was trembling while typing this but she is 27 now and she wants to date and experience more before marriage and there is nothing wrong with me. A few years back, we did briefly entertain the idea of dating other people to break the monotony but that didn't go anywhere. I was broken and called her, she eventually picked up. I told her that if she does that, it will be over forever between us. I will be honest here, I did cry and plead. I was so shaken that I couldn't remain calm. She did it on text!, the very same day I learned that I wouldn't get a job at the company where I was interning. She had to return to college in 1-2 weeks anyway, and she could have said that face to face at a better time.

Anyway, after that she started sending texts about how much she loves me and would never leave me. She used to have problem with me calling her whenever she was out late at night. I have always been slightly paranoid. I would worry about her safety, cheating or simply being too drunk. Before the end of her internship, she had planned to go to a dance club with other interns. The day of the clubbing, before leaving, she messaged me that she loves me. That night, I refrained myself from being paranoid and trust her. But when it was a bit too late without her informing me about her plans, I called her. She even eventually picked up at 3 and told me that they are still at the club and she will call me when they leave at around 4. She didn't. I kept calling her until she picked up at 5 and sounded extrememly sleepy / tired. She said she came back to her home and now she is very tired and will talk to me the next day. 

Next morning, I woke up early and facebooked her flatmate and asked her if she was back from party and she said that my GF never came back. That is the moment when I felt everything around me crushing down. My GF called me at about 1 PM. She initially pretended to be hungover, but I told her that I knew she never came back to her apartment. She immediately started crying and apologizing. I asked her to tell me what happened or I will find out anyway. She said she kissed someone. She took a flight to my place the same night and started begging for my forgiveness. I talked to my friends and everyone suggested to end the relationship. But I was too pathetic I guess. I loved her so much that I didn't end it immediately.
 
She told me that there was no group of interns like she claimed. It was just her and a colleague who went for clubbing. They had been flirting on text a bit and then they made this plan to go out and party. Before heading to the club, they went to his place and had alcohol. She rarely drinks besides a few cocktails. While they danced, they kissed. Then when she had called me at 3, they were out having pizza. After that, they headed back to his place where they made out. She said that only her top and her bra were off. I did not believe initially that but eventually I became certain that they didn't go beyond second base. I threatened her that I will call that guy and verify everything that happened because he was unaware about her not being single as well. While she revealed a few relatively minor details after that, she stuck to the fact that it was only second base.

I really love her so I couldn't refrain myself from giving her a chance. She was crying all the time, holding my feet and begging for forgiveness. I told her what I expected from her. Complete transperancy, great effort in building my trust back, complete cut-off from the guy and so on. Around September, I found out that she hid some details from me. A week before she sent me the long message, in one of her intern parties, the guy touched her waist and held her hands. She didn't stop him and she liked the attention. I was furious that she was still not being honest with me and she again cried and apologized for hiding things out of fear of losing me. 

My paranoia is extremely severe now. She asked me to place all my trust that night and then proceeded to cheat on me. That completely messed up my mind and I have serious trust issues now that extend beyond our relationship. Over the last few months, she has been struggling to make things right. Only when I wake up crying from nightmares (where she usually cheats on me) or when I am just sad from the memories, she apologizes and tries to make me feel better. I had to tell her that she cannot go back to the same place to work (she can easily find another job). She eventually rejected the offer but I felt like it would made me feel better of she had done it herself. I asked her to write an sms to the guy ending everything they had and being honest with him about her relationship with me. She did that, but she also wrote stuff like ""You are an attractive guy"", ""I had a crush on you"". She knew I was going to read those text and yet couldn't realize what would those lines make me feel. There have been pockets where both of us have been happy like we used to be before the incident. But that is usually bacause I am able to forget. She doesn't even regularly apologize or say things that help me build my confidence, trust and reduce my paranoia. But she always shows remorse and guilt. She says she hates herself for what she did.

I don't know when she would start crying and say that she hates herself for being selfish or cheats on me again. In August, she said she would talk to her parents about our marriage. But now, she wants more time because she feels that she keeps hurting me with her inability to make me feel better and she is scared of herself. She wants more time to make everything right. I asked her why does she think she can make things right now when she couldn't last 5 months. She doesn't reply to that except crying and telling me how much she loves me and cannot imagine a life without me. I feel like I cannot give her more time because that is unfair to me. But it is extremely scary to imagine a life where I break up. I am not a very social person and last 7 years, we have been sharing everything only with each other. I know it is unhealthy and yes, lately I am trying to improve contact with my friends. But letting her go will create a void that I am not sure how I will deal with.

Current situation: We have our final semester left. She often remains sad. She says it is because of remore and regret. She hates herself for what she did to me. I expect her to work on her problems and focus on healing my mental state. Now I am just exhausted dealing with my trauma almost alone. Whenever she is sad, I start worrying because the trauma from her ""I am selfish"" message from the summer is quite strong. Today, I told her that it is over forever but she immediately started begging me and said she will marry me immediately because she will die without me. I am not sure what I should do, please help me. For this semester, I have planned to gym a lot to take my mind off and socialize so that I am not dependant on her. But it still feels like the breakup would be devastating. I am not able to understand that if she cannot live without me, why can't she be perpetually happy when I do give her a chance and make me feel better. I feel like she should be grateful for the opportunity which she doesn't deserve and shower me with unconditional love, because it is her who keeps begging for us to stay together.

TLDR: There is no tldr, sorry. What I wrote is already missing a lot of details and I believe you cannot provide correct advice without reading the whole thing.

7o4jku,11,2018-01-04,My [22M] girlfriend [21F] of 1 year has been engaged in an emotional affair with a friend [23-24M] since the beginning of our relationship.,dtom95,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7o4jku/my_22m_girlfriend_21f_of_1_year_has_been_engaged/,"About two weeks ago I woke up one morning and texted my girlfriend to say good morning. It was like any other day. A few minutes later I happened to see this post http://trendsetnews.com/36-questions-lead-love/ It is just a set of questions that are supposed to help a couple nurture their relationship through selfdisclose. I read through them and figured I would not really hesitate to answer any of them to my girlfriend because I love and trust her. I ask her how she felt about the questions and she said that they seemed very personal and that she even cried while reading them. She went on to say that she would feel uncomfortable sharing some of those things with me because I was not always very approachable. She then began to compare me to her exes, one of them being her best friend, saying that they all seemed to selfdisclose much more to her than I do and that being raised in a more similar culture made relating to them easier. This was the last straw for me on this issue and I began to tell her how inappropriate her relationship with her best friend was and how some might even consider it an emotional affair or emotional cheating.

Let me give some background for this by saying that I knew about this friendship before we started dating. In October of 2016 we met through a mutual friend that I went to high school with and she currently goes to university with. For about a month we saw each other on weekends when I came from about 45 minutes away to visit my friend from high school. She is an international student from Central America and I was very interested in being friends with her. We had interesting conversation and even discussed the nature of her relationship with an ex from before she came to the US to study. She said that he was her best friend and I said that it would be difficult for any potential boyfriends to accept that, without even thinking that I might find myself in that exact situation. After a few weeks I found myself being more and more attracted to her and after a few late night talks we ended up drunkenly making out one night. After that night we transitioned into dating, and for the next few months I figured that this friendship with her ex would not affect our relationship. I knew that she stayed in touch with him through Facebook messenger and that they talked frequently. I know now that I was not worried about this mostly because they were half a continent away from each other.

It wasn't until the summer of 2017 that I began to feel uncomfortable with this arrangement. Because she is an international student she returned to her home country for the duration of the summer.during this time I took summer classes and worked a part-time job while she had an internship and a job in the evenings. We were both busy, but we made time to text, or call, or Skype whenever we could. I still began to feel frustrated and insecure about our relationship. At the time I couldn't articulate why, but now I understand that it is the inappropriate nature of the relationships that she has with her best friend that made me anxious and insecure even back then. I admittedly handled this insecurity in a childish way that often caused arguments about trust. 

Near the end of the summer I flew out to visit her and meet her family and friends. We had a mostly pleasant time, but there was virtually no time for sexual intimacy. Even when her mother was away on a business trip she was very hesitant to even close the door to a room if we happened to be together. I know now that this is mostly due to the conservative culture of her country and family, but at the time it really worried me and fed into my anxieties about our relationship. After returning from my trip, there were a few weeks before my girlfriend returned for the fall semester. During these weeks my resentment grew to a point where I even wrote a break up note to give to her when she returned. The main subject of the note was this inappropriate friendship. I wanted to tell her that this relationship made me uncomfortable the whole time she was gone and that I could not continue the way things were. I was especially aware that her leaving for Christmas would be extremely difficult. Putting these ideas down in writing made me feel so much better and made me think that this was really an insignificant thing. I deleted the note. 

We seemed to be doing much better as the semester went on. We had small arguments here and there, but they were never about anything serious and never lasted long. Sometime soon after our one year anniversary in November, I began to feel that familiar feeling of resentment. I began to notice the frequency that she would message him. It would be every day multiple times a day. I even happened to see sexual jokes, comments, and innuendos. This was without even looking through their messages, just when I happened to look over at her phone while we were together, so I assume this was a regular thing that she either allowed to happen or encouraged.

Throughout our conversations over this topic she repeatedly denied that their relationship was anything more than just a close friendship. She told me that what I was really doing was unfairly calling her a whore and accusing her of being unfaithful. She repeatedly told me that I was just taking my frustration from insecurity out on her and blaming it on her friend. It was not until I started quoting the Wikipedia page for Emotional Affair https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_affair and asked her to try to see it from my perspective that she finally relented. She still seemed to be unsure of how she felt, so I ended up doing the last thing that I wanted to do. I basically gave her an ultimatum, saying that if she just treated him like any of her other friends, only talking occasionally without crossing any boundaries that it might work, but I could not go on with her treating him like her long distance boyfriend. I would much rather she cut him out of her life, but I also don't want to be controlling and manipulative. She said she is willing to fix the inappropriate aspects of her relationship with her friend, and I said I would try to be more approachable and accepting of her culture.

Is my relationship doomed to fail? Does the ultimatum mean she will now resent me? Should I be willing to forgive this? Any input would be appreciated.

TL;DR My girlfriend has had an inappropriate relationship with her ""friend"" [23-24 M] since before our relationship began. I had kept quiet about my concerns until being compared with past relationships earlier this month. We had two big fights and came to a tentative resolution."

* [Day 75.8. Gulen Records Going Up in Smoke? Bannon Alphabet? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCtkDvSZAJM)
  * This is Day 75 I think this part eight I don't know how much more news can break in one day
  * So this will be a little bit of a potpourri 
  * But as you see right over here we're at C Street and third 
  * There's the metro stop for the Federal Center 
  * Then of course Donna Shalala remember Donna Shalala from Haiti and the Clinton Foundation
  * Now that's HHS right behind us right down there is Museum of the Bible 
  * That new Museum of the Bible can't seem to find USRA 
  * I think they may have moved to Columbia Maryland 
  * That's gonna be Molly McAuley and all the surveillance apps right 
  * And then of course here you got the O'Neill House of Representatives buildings
  * So the first story I'll do is most of the people you see up on Capitol Hill that are actually working up there are young kids that are interns or maybe first level 
  * When you get into these buildings, there's actually when you're getting in more of the senior staff, where you're getting the legislative directors, legislative assistants, work for them and then up to the chief of staff 
  * And then sometimes the communications directors 
  * But most of the action in terms of bill-making and stuff is mainly happening here 
  * There's some that happens up on Capitol Hill, but mainly that's it's for more of a reception area for for meeting more of a reception area for meeting donors...
  * Because there's the feel of Capitol Hill and--everyone has those great feelings 
  * And they want to give more when they see the columns and all that stuff 
  * But this is really where the action is, where the action happens
  * So a couple of different stories breaking on that is one: we obviously have Comey with the 20 million dollars, when he becomes FBI director with PIMCO not PIMPCO PIMCO
  * we have the Steve Bannon story that's breaking right
  * Now and that's gonna be Navy Navy Navy
  * Now why do I say Steve Bannon Navy Navy Navy? 
  * Well was it was he in the Navy yeah I think it was a lieutenant, but there's a lot more background to him than that 
  * He then goes and goes into Foreign Service 
  * He's in Pakistan which is a good place to be, I guess, if you're from the foreign service school of Georgetown 
  * A well-known place where they do recruit CIA--I'm just saying 
  * He was in signal Intelligence which is dealing with top-secret information, I believe 
  * He was the communication he worked at the Pentagon and it works in as a communications director to the assistant for Naval Operations 
  * I think he was even in the guy for iron claw 
  * Remember when they had three helicopters across the Iranian desert to try to get the hostages out--that failed a hostage attempt 
  * I don't know if they were setting up Carter or not, in a kind of a PSYOP there 
  * But it had that psyop feel where three helicopters go down in the desert and then really made Carter look bad 
  * And it brought in Reagan 
  * I don't know it it just he was involved and most people don't know those things 
  * He was involved in this kind of like experiment they had these astronauts live in this kind of bubble so--what would what was that all about?
  * He just kind of moved from Hollywood to all these things at meteoric speed 
  * And that usually is the signature of kind of a CIA guy
  * Now I'm not saying he's CIA but it just has that signature 
  * And then of course influence you get a patch you get a patch you get the influence patch 
  * That's gonna be my influence patch from now on
  * You get the influence patch at CIA when you go do a roll like this a political role, which is I hate to say mockingbird 
  * But just it's an influence thing you you want to control both sides of an issue--both are left and the right
  * So you want to infiltrate both sides 
  * Makes a lot of sense okay
  * So we're working that story
  * Now the fire everybody's with the fire now with Hillary Clinton 
  * It makes a lot of sense 
  * If Gulen is your halal meat dealer, and they're bringing the drugs in from Javed 
  * And Gulen's making a lot of money you've got to process the transaction somehow 
  * You've got to do that on a secure Network 
  * You could do that here--in Congress but that's gonna be more logistics 
  * That's gonna be more logistics like like the post office right 
  * That's more logistics 
  * But the actual money laundering and the money transfers...you want to control that very tightly 
  * And I like I said before that I believe is done out of Chappaqua--out of Bill and Hillary Clinton's home 
  * Or the one that Andy bought Andy McCabe bought down the street
  * So we're gonna probably will probably be some story about some wacky Republican Breitbart guy that went in burned her house down...
  * That's coming, but the real 
  * ""hey scrunch""
  * The real reason is to be this laundering 
  * The political party is to launder the money 
  * If I say here's a fifty million dollar contribution: boom! There's fifty million dollars that have been laundered, no matter where I got it
  * And no questions asked 
  * And that's really the story of of her career

* [Day 76.1 Did Bannon and the Navy Kids Make Movies? Bannon Their Funnel? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_3hFDsmkso)
  * This is Day 76 and the big surprise news yesterday was Bannen, saying basically Jared Kushner laundered money for Deutsche Bank for Trump 
  * This is the building of the eb-5 s that I've been talking about so much 
  * And there is a property in Jersey City that I think there is some truth here 
  * And Kushner is gonna be guilty of that but it's again, accused the opposition of what you do yourself is the best defense
  * Now the question I she watch the series I've said Navy Intelligence ONI office of Navy Intelligence, through the Chief of Naval Operations, it launders money in Hollywood CIA--that wing of the Navy kids I call it, CIA--launders it's money through Hollywood
  * So we're gonna just look at Steve Bannon, and see if he actually played that role in Hollywood or not
  * So if you hadn't seen this comment yesterday basically some this is what I love so much about doing these quick videos at different places in Washington DC 
  * And then people will come in with all the information 
  * He was a special assistant in his years of the Pentagon to the Chief of Naval Operations 
  * And so we're gonna ask who that is 
  * I think it was Watkins somebody may be the predecessor to Watkins but we'll see but then the old Georgetown masters at night in old CIA masters 
  * Was Bannon that guy? Was he sent to Hollywood the launder the money for the Navy and their Navy [drayage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drayage) what they called drayage
  * Again, the Navy doesn't care really what's in the container they just want the fare, they want the drayage, they want the toll for the for the shipment 
  * And who would be doing that? 
  * Who would be doing that with the Chief of Naval Operations be doing that sort of pay-to-play? 
  * With a the Master Chief Petty Officer that reports the Naval operations be involved in that?
  * Was Theresa Gravenstein ever the chief and the Inspector General of the Chief of Naval Operations? 
  * These are all questions that need to be answered right
  * So if you're not familiar with this article in New Yorker it came out about the--Steve Bannon is the most dangerous political operator in Washington DC 
  * And it came it went through his history...dad worked for the AT&amp;T
  * Not saying he was involved in the spy agencies in any way, but then he anyway here he says a low-level official at the Pentagon 
  * Any time I see this why are you hiding the fact that you are the special assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations, doesn't make any sense 
  * This is negative metadata--this makes things jump off the page 
  * When you under play something, it makes it jump off the page, and immediately that's where I go
  * So if you don't remember James Watkins, he was the Chief of Naval Operations
  * But then he went on to become the Secretary of Energy for George HW Bush 
  * If you watch the series, you know that the Secretary of Energy controls uranium 
  * Uranium, the number one buyer of uranium in the United States of enriched uranium is the Navy 
  * All the vessels in our nuclear Navy run on [URANIUM] /// {{ video skips }} 
  * [Do they] report to Watkins? 
  * Did Watkins then use this drayage money to then send to Hollywood
  * Then Steve Bannon starts this Hollywood scheme 
  * Was that also--is the reason why Steve Madden knows so much about money laundering is because he was involved with Watkins?
  * Well there's just happens to be a guy named Tim Watkins if you go back to the New Yorker article, that he ends up doing a movie about Reagan with--the Reagan Wars 
  * If you read down a little bit you can see goes into this big thing with Tim Watkins 
  * And the thing I like about Steve Bannon is he doesn't go in half way or half measures 
  * He likes Riefenstahl--who made triumph of dirt will and--it is like a Nazi propagandist--
  * So anyway you can read that New Yorker article it's a good article
  * So if you don't know the Chief of Naval Operations--the Navy inspector general reports to the Chief of Naval Operations
  * Now I actually met the chief inspector for the inspector general here in this hotel at 5 a.m.
  * I won't go into that detail, but he's the one who told me about dog-teams 
  * And I said, ""Would dog-teams ever turnover a room?""
  * He said, ""well yeah that's something could be they're all--Navy SEALs--you know that's who we hire""
  * So but this is the Naval Reserve with these dog teams
  * So we'll get the dog teams a little bit later on 
  * Say in this series we've gone to one observatory circle many many times 
  * I haven't gone to the Whitehaven location because I don't want to be accused of harassing Hillary but that's there 
  * Navy has a long history at cryptology of all the services 
  * Navy they broke the Japanese code at Pearl Harbor etc they've became the NSA
  * So this oh and I office of Navy Intelligence really created the NSA
  * So just keep that in mind 
  * Let's talk about another Chief of Naval Operations, who went on to become a joint chief of staff Admiral Mike McMullen 
  * Why is he important?
  * He has this connection to Pakistan 
  * He seems to know everything that's going on in Pakistan 
  * He seems to be talking to this guy named Haqqani quite a bit, right? 
  * Here's all the WikiLeaks talking about Pakistani ISI he knows the S-wing and ISI is all the Taliban operations...was he negotiating off Osama bin Laden's attack through the Haqanni? 
  * We don't know. 
  * Was he also doing the drayage and negotiations?
  * It seemed like it two days in the negotiations to get the long lat of where Obama Osama bin Laden was seems very simple--
  * He's here but two days of negotiations 
  * That sounds more like a business deal to me that sounds more like Haqqani
  * Now Mike Mullen wasn't not shy about talking about the Haqqani network 
  * This is what Trump just talked about was the Haqqani network 
  * And he said hey Pakistani ISI supports the Haqqani network 
  * There's nothing here that's being kept a secret he says it's the corridor in Kashmir where all the cash is coming--we're all the cash is being smeared 
  * It should probably be called Cash-schmear, but anyway the cash is being smeared in Kashmir, right here, through the Haqqani network 
  * Admiral Mike Mullen knows all about it 
  * Admiral Mullen knows all about it okay
  * So here's Huma of getting classified access State Department access right to portals
  * Now the key question is what portals?
  * Is this the maritime data awareness portal, which is a very significant DHS portal?
  * Is this the prison portal that they have up at NSA, which is being able to do deep dives in dossiers on people?
  * Is this the Palantir portal, which is kind of a combination of those two things, being able to do deep dives in real time with--combined with satellite information cell phone, information plane surveillance information, A total awareness package?
  * What is Huma logging into here?
  * Huma's mother being from Pakistan 
  * Humans mother having a lot of experience with that Kashmir, where they schmear the cash in that key corridor, along with along with some partners there

* [Day 76.2 Meet Akmetshin Again - Hackmaster For Hillary - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn6PfblmFmo)
  * Day 76 this is part two here's a meeting yesterday 
  * This is interesting because we were Task Force and I were in the Rayburn office building excuse me yes Longworth off this building 
  * That was the only cafeteria that was open yesterday 
  * And we had a good long talk with a longtime veteran I'll just say at this point he's an older white guy a little portly, has worked for a member of Congress 
  * I'm not saying which one, but he we talked a long time he said great reporting, but the part about Russia 
  * You need to drop you need to drop the Russia Russia Russia 
  * This is directly to me you could probably figure out who he is just by looking at who's been in the Congress for 40 years working for members of Congress 
  * But anyway what I what I would say here, is after we met with him we went over to Devin Nunes' office 
  * And--we just informed Devin Nunes of a few facts, as well as the fact that, ""hey the person who's running the Russia investigation, which is is Rod Rosenstein, his wife--represented Bill Clinton, his wife represents the FBI, represents the CIA, represents NSA, his wife is the FOIA shot-blocker, and he and her are running this investigation against Trump! It could not be more jaded, could not be done--it's not undue influence, 180 degrees composed of Trump's enemies that are running this investigation""
  * So Rod Rosenstein then runs over and meets with Paul Ryan to try to shut down the contempt charge
  * So we don't know where that is yet, we don't know if Devin Nunes is going to be able to overrule this or if Paul Ryan's gonna be able to swat that down but
  * Again, the strategy here of going to the peepee dossier is just a failed strategy
  * Because by attacking, and saying, ""hey there's a Soviet Army Intelligence veteran that Trump Jr. met with it's obviously entrapment""
  * Because this meeting was set up by Andrew McCabe, which I have said his *modus operandi* from seven years ago, that I've known him has always been in entrapment, entrapment, entrapment 
  * And it's being set up by Fusion GPS and as a state actor for the FBI--entrapment entrapment entrapment, being funded by the DNC, being funded by the FBI with tax dollars! 
  * To write this baby peepee dossier, that later because this eight page baby peepee dossier, that later becomes the 35 page full PP dossier with all of its errors, including the errors about Michael Cohen, which really hasn't come out in the press yet 
  * Yes Akhmentshin has contacts with FSB from the Russian Intelligence services 
  * Those are the people that are running the ratlines in Russia 
  * He works for Denis Katsyv--his father ran the ratlines as the transportation network in Russia for Hillary 
  * This is gonna keep boomeranging back on these folks--
  * It's he is an operative for Hillary Clinton 
  * The same thing is true of Veselnitskaya.
  * Veselnitskaya is the adoption person for the for the Clintons 
  * She is the one who's bringing the kids in to Strongsville, Ohio European adoption center 
  * She's the adoption counselor 
  * If you will her practice her law practices in these babies
  * So she got the meeting by such by saying there's an illicit means that they're funding the DNC through criminal activity 
  * That's how she piqued the interest, but then she said she didn't give any information
  * So we don't know anything about the eight pages 
  * We don't know if that document was ever passed 
  * I think that was very important that they wanted to pass that document 
  * We don't know the contents of that document 
  * Anybody has a link to that document, that would be great
  * But at this point this is gonna boomerang back on Strongsville for Veselnitskaya
  * It's is gonna boom back rebound back on her, and it's gonna rebound back on Andrew McCabe again, and on Rosenstein again, and the team that's been put together
  * This Russian Intelligence operation--people are gonna get to know who Akhmetshin is, even though we talked about it 200 days ago 
  * Not that many people know who Ahmed Sheehan is that he's wrangling this group of Intelligence officers that Christopher Steele had to bring into this country, through the liaison loophole, to spy on Americans, and unmask Americans 
  * I've been saying this for a long time
  * As soon as you get to be a victim of this, you understand it a lot better 
  * Donald Trump Jr understands it a lot better now and so does Donald Trump
  * So as this keeps happening we're gonna keep unwinding this system that Andrew McCabe's really had in place for targeting people in the United States 
  * For opponents 
  * Any critic 
  * Any opponent 
  * Asset seizure, through through targeting, through entrapment 
  * Or if you have influence than compromise, then you're compromised

* [Day 76.3 Why Only One Portal Password Could Be Disastrous - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz9bTThG8wg)
  * This is Day 76 part three 
  * And about an hour ago fox news broke this story which was another 18 emails have been found by Judicial Watch 
  * Or were turned over to Judicial Watch in the investigation of Huma's emails
  * Which brings the total up to I think more in the order of twenty three
  * Again, it's not so much if there is a government portal involved here, like a PRISM portal or a Palantir portal, or a portal to some of the different State Department applications, you only need ONE password for unlimited literally unlimited wiretaps 
  * As Snowden used to say, ""if I have a PRISM login if I have the Nets going back to 2013 and before I can log in and get any of the president's email texts or communications""
  * That was the president's email--so I think that was Obama's email
  * So I think he could get anybody's email with a PRISM login
  * So the wiretap was very much in play deep dives were very much in play for the Russians for Suschin with just that email 
  * Here's a brief clip that Luke played which is after the news of this 2012 hack came out in July of 2012, a few days later is when Huma gets her  passwords, and then immediately starts forwarding classified emails
  * {{Luke Huma Yahoo Password Fox CLIP}}
  * So that is the key there is that if she if in these new 18 emails if portals are involved, and I can't overemphasize that--the follow on to the portal of PRISM being the Palantir portal which includes the more the surveillance type information--the human surveillance--not just signal intercept but more of the electronic surveillance of tracking you by satellite, by cellphone geolocation, geolocation type tracking, the parallel construction type tracking that happened to me in Ohio, that is very much used for operations of going into people's houses 
  * {{ DINGGGGGGG (nice timing ft. meade) }}}
  * ...and doing these night raids...
  * So it's it's up-scaling, up-leveling the type of surveillance--the human Intelligence and human surveillance--that you can do not just electronic surveillance
  * So and again, you would not need that many passwords 
  * You would not need that many for these systems if you have access to Palantir, if you have access to PRISM, that's all you need
  * Now there was a hack almost every year after 2012 of Yahoo--So it was 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 
  * And she was sending--so only five emails would be needed to keep someone updated with those systems 
  * 18 emails could you keep you up to date with Palantir and PRISM and even a State Department email login, if they changed their emails once a year
  * So this is the the part that I think is getting missed 
  * Is that even with a few emails even with only 18
  * Now I think the number is going to be 500,000 that were actually ended up being forwarded in an automatic syncing methodology 
  * But the amount that she actually physically forward, would only need to be 18 emails to do three different portals over five different years--that's the key point here
  * Now a lot of people have seen that Awan--the other half of this equation is the Awans down in DC 
  * And people have seen that the Awans trial date has been moved to March 8th everyone knows there's a 90 day service window 
  * I started on November 9th with this suit
  * So that's gonna push this out, if they are out of the country for service
  * So I believe I need to do a leave-to-file with the judge saying, ""may I serve Perkins Coie?"" whose really acting as the attorney, even though no attorney has appeared for the Awans yet 
  * To serve their attorney just so we can get service out of the way
  * So that's the next key date 
  * I'm also talking through some very some interesting attorneys here in DC, in addition to Macduff
  * To kind of put together the legal team, to represent class 
  * And I will show judge Contreras that we will have a very adequate legal representation for the class of about 1,000 plaintiffs that we have right now
  * And some late breaking news now, Catherine Harridge with Fox reports that the judge in the case has denied (I believe that Judge Sullivan) has denied Fusion GPS to high bank records that go to journalists organizations, op-ed organizations, contractors and various other agencies
  * So that will be good 
  * That supposedly will be made available to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence 
  * Also she announced that the deal has been cut for the committee members on HSBC[sic] {{ HPSC }} to be able to see all the documents tomorrow
  * We still don't know if those documents are gonna be made public yet
  * But they are gonna receive them by tomorrow

* [Day 77.1 In the Face of Deep State Evil - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks7rGxl5MLA)
  * It's day 77 and this is part one 
  * Thoughts on Bannon yesterday--I just wanted to drill down and now the press has found that: yes he was had this deep state Pentagon job, and he was the strategic messaging person with a top secret clearance, reporting directly to the Chief of Naval Operations 
  * And then kind of went immediately to Wall Street to invest money for them there at Goldman Sachs 
  * Then he went to Hollywood to invest money for them there 
  * He was doing so well it's such a young age he could ask for a percentage of these shows 
  * And that's where he sold Seinfeld and made all of his money
  * So forth that he got into documentary filmmaking, but all along the way it's influence 
  * He's been just kind of like an influencer or a dream merchant they used to call them 
  * Movie maker to do influence 
  * And one of the things you do is you build people up lives in the Reagan movie that he did--the war and evil and--in the face of evil 
  * And that sort of thing but then also smears when it's time that your benefactors from the Navy say, ""hey we need to smear this guy--we're gonna smear him""
  * And they did. And he smeared not only Trump, but the whole Trump family called Donald Trump jr.--accused him of treason, an act punishable by death
  * So this is the smear of all smears 
  * And it was a broadside against the whole family
  * Again, it's very much in keeping with Bannon, because as soon as his Navy benefactors--as soon as their investments overseas were threatened by Trump moving the money back into the United States, it was immediately a broadside smear of the highest order: accusing someone in the family of a offense punishable by death
  * So this smearing kind of reminded me so much of Fusion GPS 
  * And just briefly look at the timeline you'll see that the media and they're picking up on the fact that he was special assistant to the chief of Naval affairs at the Pentagon, which he had downplayed 
  * And that he did have this national security study degree at Georgetown, which was--it's kind of like CIA II
  * So I just it's nice to see the press actually picking up on some of this stuff 
  * You didn't see the story of the smear of Alec Boyd 
  * Alec Boyd is your journalist in Venezuela--a great journalist in Venezuela 
  * Gets in the way of the Clinton machine, gets in the way of the Navy investments in oil in Venezuela 
  * Boom they destroy him here's a little clip of that
  * {{ [George Plays Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=18&amp;v=0weXMGE5qcc) -- *Derwick Associates* }}
  * So where we heard that before, right? 
  * People are seeing the New York Times for what it really is 
  * It's just this defender of these these horrible characters
  * So anyway. It reminded me these this smear here the smear of Donald Trump Jr., and then the smear of Alec by Glenn reminded me of a third smear of the smear of Eric Braverman 
  * And this goes back to the famous Joe Scarborough quote saying, ""a source close to the Clintons, Ron Fournier, says follow the money"" in the HRC scandal
  * Now he said this was two people going back a year now 
  * I always said this was to people I said it was Eric Braverman and Ron Fournier denied that 
  * And then it was also the hands of the of the hack was Justin Cooper 
  * And if you remember back here they were there was they found after this story broke here with Joe Scarborough on the 8th of March, they went into this mad dash to try to find out who it was 
  * This is on a Sunday night, trying to find out late into the evening who it was 
  * And Neera Tanden--who's kind of these social justice of the Podesta group, through the Center for American Progress--is going back and forth with Podesta, on ""who is it who is it who is it?""
  * You could see the tweet is the about the ad gon be see tweet I just showed you 
  * And--she says whatever it is is being a tad unhelpful, right?
  * You knoq, like, ""they're smearing us--it's not good, John""
  * And he says here later on into the evening 8:30 we're going backwards in time
  * Now it could be Doug Band or IRA Magaziner--rhese are the ""Bills"" 
  * John Podesta near Tannen are the ""Hills""--these are the Hillary people at Clinton Foundation 
  * And Doug Band and Ira Magaziner the ""Bills"", 
  * Ira Magaziner was the halfway, quarter weight drugs--AIDS drugs to Africa
  * Doug Band is mister pay-to-play--let's get diplomatic passports, let's go play--those two guys 
  * But earlier in the afternoon, he suspected someone else. Which was Eric Braverman 
  * I've always said Eric Braverman's Kissinger's man at the Clinton Foundation, to make sure that Kissinger has a finger in the pie at the Clinton Foundation 
  * I'll prove that in one second
  * So and then it's gonna be the hands and feet of this operation--the technical guy doing this is Justin Cooper 
  * Going all the way back all the way back to March 8th, 2015
  * Now who do you call, when you want to smear somebody 
  * And you find out about their phone calls? 
  * You call Andrew McCabe
  * So we're gonna go back to one year ago today--day 77 
  * I'll just rewind the Wayback Machine here 
  * And play it 
  * {{ George plays echo clip }}
  * Artie he traded FBI has had shown the previous previous slide in previous presentations
  * So she Canyon have the FBI go to the next slide well, she should have the FBI say ""well no no Mr. Trump we need to get a search warrant for that that's gonna take three weeks and we'll have to get a Federal Judge just to look at that""
  * So all the advantages from the Joint Terrorism Task Force that the FBI used in their operations......cross our T's here
  * So plus you have this covert group that could do operations all over the country as well
  * G: So what what I really like about this slide is not only was I saying Andy McCabe could do a deep dive on Eric Braverman 
  * And could good shutdown Justin Cooper etc 
  * But I was also talking about how the Federal government and Andy McCabe especially just rely on entrapment almost exclusively 
  * And the Donald Trump jr. meeting was almost exclusively an entrapment meeting 
  * Well it was an entrapment meeting 
  * And if you're nobody, it's just asset forfeiture 
  * And I talked about the group out at the University of Denver out here 
  * And how Claude D'Estre would kind of became the face of of JTTF at the University of Denver 
  * And how somebody credibly similar [to] him to appearance had showed up at the Boston bombings 
  * Of course Andy McCabe--his group with McGarrity...and Priestap, go back to the Boston Bombings
  * And it's just this little JTTF inside, that's causing all these problems over the last 20 years, 
  * But especially since Hillary 88 became Secretary of 88 State

* [Day 77.2 Steve Bannon Unmasks Himself and the Deep State - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-zCLMJIvPM)
  * This is Day 77 and it's part two I have to laugh at this Steve Bannon reaction 
  * To me it seems so obvious that this is a Skybridge Capital, skybridge capital deep state Navy investor play 
  * It's not funny but apparently other people don't quite see it that way
  * So I just want to take everybody back to a book called ""Wall Street Goes to Washington"" 
  * And really it's Washington goes to Wall Street, through Navy Intel investments in Wall Street through Goldman Sachs, 
  * But here's Michael Wolfe--the guy who just came out with this book that's hitting the streets today 
  * Here's Mooch here's Scaramouche--he's mister ""purple shovels"" ""mister skybridge capital"" 
  * And here is mr. purple shovels mister skybridge capital--him from our series if you watched our series and here we go we're talking about Steve Bannon
  * Again, building up the image of Steve Bannon has this this guy who's gonna be this deep state player that's gonna talk Trump into a big defense budget and the reason why the defense deep State is coming out
  * Now against Donald Trump is because of the tax situation 
  * The money's coming back in the United States and these Navy investments overseas are not paying off
  * They're not they're not gonna be as profitable 
  * And the deep state is taking it out on Donald Trump 
  * Here's a little bit of the interview 
  * {{ George Plays Scaramucci on Bannon Interview }}
  * So what we really have here is a deep state player 
  * Three deep state players 
  * There's Wolffe is one deep State player
  * Scaramucci mr. purple shovels mr. skybridge capital 
  * If you followed our series in Florida, you'll see all the different systems that the Blue Water Group is invested in
  * The Blue Water Group is Deepstate Navy Intel folks--I just have to say that 
  * You look at the current of issue that I just came out with, I basically said, ""look he's been this blue water group skybridge capital guy really from day one--the first day he walked into goldman sachs, he was a deep state navy blue water investor from goldman sachs""
  * I just proved it was Scaramucci there, but it was the same thing when it went to Hollywood
  * So if he really hasn't changed his spots 
  * And what's surprising to me is all of a sudden everyone on the different networks has lost their mind, as far as who this person is 
  * He's invested for the Navy kids, since the day he left--the Navy Intel school
  * And the Navy paid for his his political science degree or his national security degree at Georgetown 
  * And then sent him to Harvard to get his MBA
  * So this picture here, really, I use Bannon's imagery in ideology here, but this is really a Deepstate play 
  * They have to attack Donald Trump jr. with Steve Bannon 
  * They have to attack the girls in the end then the wife with Meryl Streep 
  * It's a complete attack on the character of everyone before they're arrested 
  * This is the artillery that a Mike Kempner and a Mossad Worldwide (MWW)--with my Kempner would would soften up the target before sending in the troops the infantry and I
  * ***So based on this I predict that Donald Trump jr. will be arrested on Monday***
  * They're not gonna obviously go after Kushner: I thought they were 
  * But Kushner brings you back and pulls the house down on yourself 
  * Kushner did EB-5's in New York, but the problem is is Tony [PODESTA] did a hundred times more 
  * Tony Podesta and John Podesta did a hundred times more
  * Paul Manafort can now testify against you and say, ""oh by the way yeah I was bringing all up Russian oligarch money and Ukrainian oligarch money into the United States like Firtash and Gubarov and all the other ones, and oh by the way you were the ones selling the visas the EB-5 is not me""
  * So this is gonna backfire 
  * What this really is--the reason why I use Steve Bannon's imagery here is this: this really isn't the face of evil 
  * He was a great image maker--the face of evil 
  * But this really becomes now is the face of the Deepstate 
  * I'm not saying the Deepstate is evil, but what this really is is the face of Deepstate 
  * And what Steve Bannon has done in his actions--he's exposed that this is a fraud 
  * This is just imagery 
  * This is just Hollywood movie-making 
  * This is just dream catching, right? 
  * What he's done is he's taken the face--he's literally taken the mask off Osama bin Laden 
  * And now you see the face of Andrew McCabe 
  * He's taken to face off this imagery from the past of Lenin, and now you see Rod Rosenstein 
  * He's taken the face off Stalin and now you see Muller 
  * And now you see Uranium one
  * Now you see all these Deepsstate plays
  * And now you see Steve Bannon as a player in this game, for the deep state 
  * You see who's Scaramouche is now
  * You see this all--Michael Wolffe all as this school play now
  * And now you see the players for who they really are
  * Tshese are the actors on the stage that Steve Bannon put out there in the face of evil
  * Now you see the real faces 
  * And this guy here--this this guy from the Midwest--this Aw Schucks Gary Cooper type figure--in in John Doe 
  * This this Tom Hanks kind of figure with Forrest Gump 
  * This--Jimmy Stewart type figure with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, we're all this person 
  * We're all this everyman 
  * Our contributors here on this channel are this person 
  * We all become this person here, wanting to face this Deepstate 
  * And that's really what the importance that's what Steve Bannon does is 
  * Steve Bannon is unmasked the Deepstate 
  * He's unmasked the evil and now we are staring the Deepstate in the face

7o5ljz,9,2018-01-04,How to deal with family member battling depression?,lostthrowaway1513,depressionregimens,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressionregimens/comments/7o5ljz/how_to_deal_with_family_member_battling_depression/,"Hi I'm not sure if this is the right spot to post. I do have to warn those struggling with depression that perhaps they shouldn't read further since they might get the impression that I'm saying that loved ones gets tired of helping you. Please it's just our family I'm really sorry.


I posted this elsewhere before but I'm still struggling with how to help my sister. My sister says she has been depressed since a break up with her ex about two years ago (I believe because she still won't tell me). However, she's been acting.. somewhat of a jerk. I understand that depression can cause someone to act out, I have struggled with it during my undergraduate years as well and still struggle with anxiety which I was diagnosed earlier this year. She would call us names and constantly accused us of emotionally manipulating her and it really really hurt when all we do is try to do what she wants us to do but nothing seemed like it was enough. It felt like as if she expected us to make her problems go away. Sometimes, we just want to have a happy family moment like celebrating my dad's birthday but she doesn't want to and instead skypes her current boyfriend for an hour and skipping dinner then calls my dad a ""stupid pighead"". Or when my mom makes homemade food for her because she was too depressed to make food and instead lost 10 lbs but she didn't want to eat it because it wasn't ""to her taste"". When my mom was upset about it she accused her of emotionally manipulating her or trying to guilt my sister because she ""never asked for it"". But when she stopped bringing food to her, my mom was accused of neglect and not caring and nobody cares.


I understand the struggles. I use to sleep 12 hours a day just like she is doing now but when my parents found out they, and my best friend, forced me to get up early and forced me into a routine. I responded well with tough love and realizing the world didn't owe me an explanation to my sadness and realizing that depression and anxiety can't be easily solved by just surrounding yourself with a bunch of friends who agreed with everything you say. I seeked therapy and tried hard to utilize the methods my counsellors and psychiatrists taught me to deal with my inner voice talking. It was hard work but I kept trying. But no matter how much I tried to tell my sister this she accuses me of just manipulating her and being ""useless"". It hurts.


I'm trying so hard to help her and so is my family but we reached a breaking point. Or at least I did. It sucked to do so much and be called manipulative. I knitted her a Captain America hat for christmas to cheer her up and she called it ugly and when I was upset she said I was guilt-tripping her and that she's allowed her opinion. I finally exploded when we had a discussion about EA games and all I said was that there's other gaming companies to work for other than EA and she immediately accused me of blaming the developers and interns which I never even mentioned. This was after my dad's birthday incident with her calling him a ""stupid pighead"".


I know that I shouldn't push my own family member especially when she's suicidal. She cried and called me a manipulative bitch and now she's saying she has no sister and no family because we never support her and only her friends do. I'm at a lost. I know I shouldn't be angry and that it's perhaps it's her depression talking but I just can't apologize. She's been an incredible jerk for the past few months and it just keeps escalating and she never sees it as her being hurtful. She never once apologized for insulting my mom, my dad, or me, and even accused us of manipulating her to do so. I feel like her friends are enabling her too by siding with her.


My whole family are trying our best to tip toe around this situation but it's just so... hurtful. No matter what names she calls us we're always trying to help her where we can and we keep reiterating that we can't solve all her problems. She says all she needs is our support and love but I don't know what else is there since we've been understanding up to this point. We just let her berate us all this time until I exploded on her and now she might cut contact with us again and it's my fault. But I just can't help but be angry with her for not realizing that being depressed may be a reason but it's not an excuse to call you dad a ""stupid pighead"" and calling your mom a ""bitch"" for cooking you meals.

Do you guys have any advice on how to deal with this? I know I should eventually swallow my pride and do the right thing and apologize but I doubt she'll even forgive me. She's already said that she no longer has a sister and doesn't even acknowledge that I have a right to be hurt and angry by what she says regardless of whether she's depressed. And I'm angry still and I know I shouldn't be. I'm just so upset to be accused again and again when I'm just trying and she just asks us to keep trying harder.

EDIT: I want to emphasize that she has expressed suicidal thoughts and have said that sometimes what we say makes her feel like no one cares about her in our family. Is there any advice on how to go about this without pushing her into a corner? Am I pushing her into a corner? How I not do that but at the same time be allowed to be hurt?"

I'd like to eventually find work in programming--either front end development, back end, even perhaps full stack in the future. Thing is, my degree is in anthropology and linguistics, and though my passion still lies in archaeology, it's just out of the question for me for financial reasons. Thankfully, I have a little programming experience in HTML, CSS, and Java. All in all, I am very interested in programming and the pursuit of trying to understand systems surprisingly reminds me a lot of archaeology and anthropology. 

Due to my arts background, getting another CS degree would be tough for me--especially considering I haven't done math in 5-6 years. Some programmer family friends advised me to test for my Associates and eventually my Professional certification in Java. I was about to enrol in online courses at https://www.coursera.org in preparation for this, but research online as well as on /r/learnprogramming and /r/cscareerquestions reveals that the general consensus is that certifications are next to worthless and a degree is the only way to go. Job postings for Montreal online were kind of mixed, but in either case at least 1-2 years of experience was typically required. 

Now I need some advice on where to proceed from here. I've considered doing a second Bachelor's at McGill, which offers a 2-year program and an arts degree in CS (unfortunately I'm not eligible to switch to the BSc faculty). The downsides to this is money, of course--I'd have to take out more loans on top of those I'm still paying off. I also haven't done math in maybe 5-6 years so I am nervous about that. I've also considered Concordia programs, which offer a year of co-op within the 4-year program. I was also thinking I could take my online courses, test for my Associate's certification, then look for jobs, or at least internships. Of course I am also open to other suggestions! 

Can anyone provide some insight into the requirements for programming jobs in the city? At this point, I honestly don't know what to do because I'm tight on both money and time so I really cannot make the wrong decision here. If anyone can offer me some guidance, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you &lt;3 "

All those listed contributed to the history and lore of the show, but some more than others. Ranking goes from weakest to strongest:

* **3: Rite-Aid Guy**

Few of us can think back on PFG-TV without warm memories of Rite-Aid Guy, the witty and intelligent co-host who was only around for a short time. [His classic moments of repeating scorch's nouns](https://youtu.be/X-RlZaYpA58?t=5m51s) are legend among PFG-ciples. He always knew how to make the audience member laugh and when he should just lay back and let Scorch work his magic. His short time on the show, however, prevents him from being ranked higher on our list.

* **2: Nick Carpanelli**

The original man on the couch, Nick Carpinelli, comes in second place, and for good reason. After Scorch dominated radio he decided to branch out into television, but he knew he couldn't do it alone. He recruited his first radio intern, Nick Carpenilli, to help him change live late-night TV forever. Through show tension and Chinese restaurant fires Nick stayed with the show, adding his observations, unique commentary, and memorable bits such as [Nick's-Drink-to-Help-You-Think-or-at-Least-Sink-the-Pink](https://youtu.be/6_pobKoF8KY?t=58m40s). While a strong contender for our top spot Nick was outshone by only one individual.

* **1: Sib ""Sibby"" Hashian**

Our top spot of course belongs to PFG-TV legend Sib Hashian. Sibby, as he's affectionately known, had his work cut out for him when he signed on to be co-host of the legendary program. His every move would be criticized and compared to co-hosts of yesteryear while also trying to make his own mark. Some would think Sibby would have a hard time transitioning from Rock God to television sidekick, these people are obviously morons. It didn't take long for the PFG-ciples to accept Sibby, as they were almost immediately won over by [his charm and graciousness](https://youtu.be/dyUJX-2WvZw?t=8m45s). The holder of our number one spot unfortunately passed away on March 22nd 2017 while on a cruise ship. His death was a time of mourning and remembrance for a man who meant so much to so many."

I recently accepted a part-time reference position at the Stars Hollow Public Library.

Aside from reference internships and subbing in reference, this will be my first permanent reference position, which is both exciting and terrifying. 

One of the things I'll be doing in this new position is programming, which includes teaching basic computer classes. Problem is, I have zero experience teaching anything (aside from like helping the occasional patron with a microsoft word problem, I've gotten a ton of printing questions!). And they know that, because during the interview, they asked me for my teaching style. I said that I hadn't had a chance to develop one, but what I would do is.... (and then gave examples.) I seriously have no idea how I even landed this job in the first place. 

I have a little more experience with the other aspects of the position, including creating displays and (some) collection development. 

So I need tips! Any and all (whether they relate to programming or collection development or reference in general) are welcome! :)"

I didn’t expect such a big outpouring but you guys are really here to listen and walk with me through this. I DID NOT drink yesterday!!!! And I will not drink today! 

Being sober is fucking miserable. I don't think I've ever felt this shitty in my entire life. All I can do is think about what a terrible person I am for kissing another girl while with someone I've loved for almost 2 ENTIRE YEARS and completely ruining his trust. He's barely said a word to me in 5 days.

I can't sleep in my own bed because we spent so many nights there together. I just moved back in there right now, but I don't know if I'm even going to be able to sleep. When I do sleep (usually on my couch), I can't stop dreaming of him. I look like fucking hell. I look like a detoxing alcoholic who is lamenting the things she did to hurt other people. (Would you look at that!)

I went to my field placement today and honestly, I'm glad I went, but goddamn was it hard to stay focused. The social worker I intern under took one look at me and said ""you look like a hot mess."" I can't believe under a full face of makeup and professional dress, I still gave off the stench of sadness and failure. Thank God I didn't have any of my own clients.

Social work is the only thing keeping me from hitting the bottle again. If it weren't for old people, I would've jumped off a bridge and ended it all ages ago. 

It's hard as hell, but I will not drink with you today. Sorry for the rant, shit is really dark right now and I just need to cry."

I did get a few interviews and responses to my applications indicating interest so I know the issue isn't some typo or stupid mistake in my resume. I have had out of class experience as well (although not that much) and some somewhat relevant work experience. I know I'm not the perfect candidate when it comes to extracurriculars, but not one offer?

What I want to know is, is it too early to worry or will more offers/interviews roll in nearing the summer time? I heard that companies only worry about internships if there's room in the budget for them, so they save many decisions for last. And funny enough, the only two networking contacts I had didn't end up getting me the job. 

I know I'm not the only person in this position but it honestly doesn't feel that way. I don't want to be at a serious disadvantage when it gets to landing a really nice full-time job right out of college, especially considering I've had some financial problems recently and have been working hard academically to make my investment worthwhile.

If anyone can offer some advice, I would really appreciate it.

7o8629,1,2018-01-04,Right knee soreness/constant pains for nearly a month and a half,Bland-Username,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/7o8629/right_knee_sorenessconstant_pains_for_nearly_a/,"This may sound like a silly question with an easy answer, but I figured i'd ask anyway.

Age: 24

Sex: Male

Height: 6'0

Weight: 157 lbs.

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: Month and a half

Location (Geographic and on body): Just under my right kneecap area

About a month and a half ago, I began experiencing tendinitis-like pains in my right knee. I believe this was because I was doing lunges one night with weight that was too high, and forced the issue thinking it was just a ""no pain, no gain"" situation. I rested my legs for 2 weeks and found the pain still lingered. Since then, it hasn't gone away or subsided in any fashion. I can still walk and jog lightly, but anytime I straighten and flex my right leg, I can definitely feel the pain concentrate just under my right kneecap area. I can still squat down on both knees okay, but I can still feel the pain there. Perhaps this is a tendon strain of some kind? I'm not a doctor, but I know that there are a variety of interwoven tendons and ligaments in the knee area that can be injured easily.

The knee isn't swollen, nor ever has been, and doesn't pop or crack in any awkward ways. It's just an annoying, nagging pain that hasn't gone away even after resting it for extended periods. Getting this tested feels like a waste of time and money only because they may tell me something I already know I have and just say something along the lines of ""wait it out, man"".

The pain isn't bad enough to take meds (besides aspirin, which haven't done much), and I want it to subside so I can start up leg workouts again. I hate having legs that have no strength compared to my upper body.

Unfortunately for the near future, extended rest isn't likely. I work a physically demanding job at dominos (carrying large batches of dough/cheese around while being quick on my feet to get orders out), and i'll be working nearly 40 hours a week at an internship for 3 months on top of this.

Any advice appreciated!"

When I first met him, he was just getting into regular AA meetings and sobering up directly after a drunken incident that resulted in him breaking his leg. Eventually, we started dating, and everything was peachy. He showed absolutely no violent tendencies, anger, frustration, or anything...he was absolutely the most loving, caring and sensitive man I had ever met. I suppose it was the ""honeymoon phase"". I ended up landing an internship at a company on the other side of the country, so I had to leave for a few months. He visited me every so often (almost once a month), and we communicated excellently despite the distance and the difference in our schedules. After the first visit, on his plane ride back to the east coast, he had a drink...then another drink, and another, etc. I didn't know until almost a month later that he had broken his sobriety and was descending back into his alcoholic tendencies, since he lied to me about it and attempted to cover it up.

Fast forward to today: we are physically together again, and now we live in the same apartment. It felt like a natural transition at the time, but now I'm having second thoughts a few months in. Last night we had a ridiculous fight, all because I asked him to feed his snake after getting home from work. I had gotten the mice for him, but that's as far as it goes for me since I'm uncomfortable handling the snake myself. He blew up on me, screaming at me for not doing it myself even though he knows my feelings about it. After calling me every name under the sun, calling me stupid and worthless, he reduced me to tears, and I ran to the bathroom so I could be alone. He broke open the bathroom door, yelling at me to ""say something"", mocking my crying noises, and then he knocks my head into the wall with his foot. He then mocks me further and tells me to ""come watch"" the snake eat the live mice. He throws my things across the room. At this point I'm only capable of crying (I'm very sensitive, and also anything I say will further provoke him), and he laughs at me, saying I have no backbone and I'm a baby.

He eventually cools down and I learn that he drank a fair bit at work, and at this point he's lurching and stumbling around the room. He apologizes, saying it's ""90% his fault"" and that he needs to go to AA meetings again. He asks for my forgiveness, saying he didn't mean anything he said. He says he shouldn't take his anger out on me anymore. The thing is, this is the third or fourth time we've had a fight just like this while he was drunk. It seems to have progressively gotten worse each time. I've gone to meetings with him before. I've urged him to put down the drink. I've held his hand through every breakdown he's had. I've told him I honestly can't see a future with him if he doesn't get sober. I even tried to help him lock down a sponsor. Nothing I have said or done has helped. 

What can I do? Am I handling this completely wrong? I really don't want to make this entirely about me, but I feel depressed, miserable and stuck. I know that he's struggling and I want to help him through this, but to what end? "

At the time we met, I was not living at home and my boyfriend literally lived in the same building as I did because we were in similar internship programs at a university, so we slept together every night for about two months (we clearly got close fast) (my parents do know we lived in the same building but not that we actually stayed together every night). However 4 months ago, I moved back home with my family and my boyfriend also moved back to his home so we are long distance. 

My boyfriend has come to visit twice and my parents have met him and like him. However, my dad is somewhat overprotective and my parents generally aren't the best at communicating, so I'm not sure how they feel about me staying overnight with him. They have been fine with us going on mini weekend vacations when he is here where they obviously know we stayed together. This is nice, but since my boyfriend and I live so far apart and don't see each other often, the intimacy of being able to fall asleep in my boyfriend's arms and wake up next to him every morning is really important to me. He is coming to visit again for 2 weeks soon and normally stays in an Airbnb and I want to be able to stay with him every night, but I don't want my parents to think badly about it? I also don't know if they will think its weird if I'm not home as much during the time he is here? Obviously we will be at my house often, but I don't want them to feel like I just disappeared. 

I was just wondering if anyone has gone through a similar situation and has any advice on how to talk to my parents about it? I've somewhat talked to my mom about it before, but she didn't really understand what I was saying. I just want to be able to tell them that I am staying with him while he is here without them freaking out. I know their main concern is that ""sleeping with my boyfriend overnight means we're going to have sex"", but my mom knows I have had sex before, and what makes me think that this notion is very silly is that we would have sex regardless of if I slept there overnight or not. I just want to be with my boyfriend as much as possible while he is here and get all the cuddlezzz.

While starting my process, I have a few questions to ask. Would you help me out? :) 






**FACTS:**

* I managed to pay off my loans and my car via juggling between 2 jobs and internships. 

* my credit score is between 750 - 770

* my monthly income, after all 401k, tax stuff, equates to roughly $4000, annual income is $80,000

* my expenses at this point are barely anything besides food, phone plan, car insurance and maintenance since I still live at home. say $500/mo

* I have saved up about $10k that I plan to toss it as down payment. This would not create a hole in my emergency fund. 


* I have a long term girlfriend who earns about half as me, but as this thread recommends that since we are not married lets pretend she doesn't exist. Might move in with me though. 

* I live in the washington DC area, southern Maryland, and that's where I'd look to have the house in. 





**WANTS:**




Rather than getting myself a shiny new WRX, I've decided to better invest it in a house. Here are the things I'm looking for.



* school districts, not so much. By the time I have kids I'd probably have already moved. But thinking about this house as a potential rental property, school zone might be important as it impacts value. 

* house size, doesnt have to be too big. But id really prefer it being a single family house with a basement and a 2nd floor. 

* garage/driveway, this one is huge to me. Over the years I've pretty much taught myself to be a mechanic and I've done oil changes to rotor changes at walmart parking lots and gym garages. As my car knowledge ambition grows I'd definitely want my own space where I can work on stuff peacefully. Financially this would save bunch of money since Im doing my own labor, too. 

* year, anything past 1990 is fine for me. Anything older I would have to pass.


**QUESTIONS** 

I tried researching as much as possible, but still have many questions. 



0. with my income, is $300k too much of a house? How much should I be aiming at? 




1. with what I have described above, a house that fits the criteria would be around $300k here. I am definitely not hitting a 20% downpayment, and for that I know id need to pay an equity insurance that will roughly add $200 until I build a 20% equity. If I were to buy a house with the insurance instead of waiting and saving for 20%, is that a bad move? 


2. If I am looking at a 300k house, with 10k downpayment, how much should I prepare for closing costs, assuming my agent returns 1%? 


3. With my wants mentioned above, anything that you think I am missing? Anything I shouldnt worry too much? 


4. Using some mortgage calculators online, I see that monthly I am looking at $1700 payments. Beyond that, to pay all the insurance, house upkeep, etc, would budgeting $2500 per month be reasonable assume nothing big breaks? 


5. If I were to buy the house before any marriage happens and someday I get married, would this need to be prenup'ed ? 





Thank you so much for reading!

I will constantly put updates here, if you are interested in joining me on the house hunting process

* $1,000 in Robinhood in some random companies that I believe may have a big future
* ~$2,000 in Bitcoin/Litecoin
* Roth IRA with $5,500 (maxed my 2017 contribution)
* College tuition entirely paid for by parents (no need to pay them back)
* Will be getting a new car as a graduation present so I don't need to worry about saving up for that

This summer I will have a full-time internship with a tech company where I will be making $38/hr ($59/hr overtime), with a $5,000 signing bonus. I plan on putting that signing bonus directly into my 2018 Roth contribution. I will also be working over the semester at a part-time job paying $13.25/hr so I'll have some basic income to spend on fun activities.

Is there anything I should be doing other than what I have been to help ensure I'll have a good financial footing for when I graduate — especially with the large income I'll have this summer?

7o9ju8,28,2018-01-05,My parents won't let me grow as a person and tell me that I am obligated to do things for them.,bjaynesss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7o9ju8/my_parents_wont_let_me_grow_as_a_person_and_tell/,"I have learned to deal with a pretty broken family.  I lived with my mom and step-dad (who I consider my father figure and call ""dad"") for most of my life. My biological father pretty much cut all ties from me when I was in middle school.  I am turning 22 next month and I'm in the process of completing my education to obtain my bachelors degree.  I have transferred to the university of my choice and live about an hour and a half away from my parents.. I previously went to a community college to save money.  While I lived at home, my parents relied on me heavily to watch after my 5 year old brother while I was in school and working.  I took him to school, his appointments, picked him up, and babysat him whenever they planned on going out.  I am close to my little brother so I didn't mind taking care of my buddy but it grew difficult when they expected me to drop what I was doing to do favors for them.  I felt as if they were very inconsiderate of my schedule and plans.  They tell me they don't ask me for much but I couldn't make my own schedule, make my own plans as a girl in her 20s, and study when I wanted to.  I always had to work around the demands of my parents and I grew frustrated.  Keep in mind...my parents make good money and they are in their early 40s.  My mom had me at a young age with my biological father.  


I wanted to transfer to a university away from home because I wanted to learn how to take care of myself.  I thought it would be great for me to grow as a person and become independent.  I looked forward to new experiences, challenges, and faces.  I wanted to figure shit out on my own basically without my parents... and my parents weren't thrilled that I wanted to move away. 


When I selected the university I wanted to transfer to, my parents knew that I wouldn't qualify for much financial aid.  So I had to take out a small loan under my name and they took out a loan under their name (parent PLUS loan) in order to afford college. I will talk more about the loans towards the end of this post. Anyway,  my parents want me to finish school/be successful (so they tell me) but they consistently make me feel bad for not being around or available to do their favors or take care of my brother when they want me to.  My dad is usually the one who takes care of my little brother.  He is the main one who bathes, feeds, plays, gets him ready, etc. I don't understand why my mom doesn't do her share but it is very obvious to other family members as well that my dad does more to raise my brother.  My parents have really poor communication and argue like cats and dogs.  My dad refuses to talk to my mom because he fears that she will get upset by his requests.  I felt like a guidance counselor for my dad when I lived at home, which I shouldn't.  I am not a marriage counselor and since I moved out, my dad is angry with me.  He knows that if I was living at home, I'd help him out if my mom wasn't willing to do her part. If my mom is grouchy and bickers at something my dad asks of her, he asks me. I didn't understand how that was fair on my end.  Am I obligated to pick up her slack?  He snaps at me and yells at me when my mother isn't around.  I can clearly read right through him and tell that he is upset I am not available.  

Recently, I went to visit my parents before I start the new quarter.  My parents were calling me a disgrace and self-centered. My mom told me that I am rude for not offering my ""services"" (she said that word) during my break from school.  I didn't know they needed my help but she continued to argue that I didn't offer.  I thought they had figured out their schedules/managing duties since I have been living out of my house for 4 months now.  They told me I am obligated to help them because they took out a loan to help me with school.  I am consistently told I owe them because they took care of me as their child. My mom says that I have an obligation since I am their child but says she doesn't have to take care of me (which is true and which she can). It is a unhealthy environment whenever I try to communicate with them.  They call me names and tell me that I can't make it in this world on my own.  Even when I do try and take a step towards independence, they guilt-trip me and tell me they want to help me.  I have learned that it is this endless cycle with them and they just want to have something over me so they can tell me what to do. 


I am posting on reddit because I wanted to hear what your thoughts are on my next moves.. I am going to speak to my financial adviser at my university to try and get my parents' Parent PLUS loan opted.   I have spoken to my adviser about my situation and she is willing to help me override dependency.  This will increase my loan and aid on my end since my parents' information will not be provided. It had to be provided on the FASFA because I lived at home while attending community college.  My mom does not make that much money but because she's married to my step-dad (who makes a decent amount of money), therefore, I don't qualify for income-based scholarships and many grants.  Both of my parents have to pay for child support and constantly tell me that they wished they didn't have to help me with school because they have other kids to worry about.  I am tired of feeling guilty so I am doing all that I can right now to cut off reliance.  I applied to other jobs (currently a tutor in the area I am at) for more hours and am willing to drop a class to work more.  I am applying for summer internships (have done 2 in the past and have experience).  If my parents' stop helping me with school through the loan they took out, MY loan can pay for tuition.  I just need to pay for rent which is $500 (including all utilities).  My school has a health insurance program and my grandpa (who knows my situation) can place me under his automobile insurance company in the mean time.  I believe I can do it.  I know it'll piss off my parents tremendously. It might even hurt our relationship more. I just feel like this needs to be done in order for them to stop treating me like I am in high school.  I also opened a new college checkings account that is not tied to my parents.  I have a savings account that I have had for a long time because my aunt used to work for a bank.  I have a credit card that I have been maintaining/using for emergencies in order to start building my credit.  I want to prove to them that I am an adult and I am entitled to making my own decisions.  I naturally feel bad because I love my little brother and miss him a lot.  I did not mind helping them when I was available to watch my brother or do them a favor, but they expected me to clear my schedule every time.  I just want freedom and happiness.  I am tired of feeling overwhelmed with my parents on top of the stress I deal with being in the science field.  

TL;DR: I just find it incredibly stressful as a working college student to do such tasks for my parents.  They consistently tell me that I am obligated to help them because they have taken care of me growing up.  I am going to be 22 and haven't figured my life out yet.  They tell me I am self-centered for wanting to focus on myself and be independent.  My dad wants me to be a co-parent for my mom's shortfalls.  "

Also, what could help me stand out a bit more to potentially get one more internship before graduation. What do you guys look for in potential interns if they don't make the gpa requirement?

But for me and I know many of us have relationships end when there was no issues, everything was great, and then came to an end in the blink of an eye. This makes it even harder to understand why something so awful is happening to you. 

1 month and a half into my breakup and 2 weeks into no contact I'm starting to come to terms with what happened. Me and my girlfriend dated for a year and a few months before we both graduated college in May and had to go long distance for separate internships. Our relationship was great before that, we had a ton of fun, we were together constantly, we became best friends, we fell in love. Leaving her to do long distance was the hardest thing I thought I'd ever have to go through, but I thought we were in a place that was too strong to be ended by distance. We talked about marriage and we both knew that that was what we wanted for us. Her mom as a graduation present gave me a diamond to have set in an engagement ring for her. Everything was great between us. 

So we went long distance and things were going good but really hard for about 4 months until I could tell she started becoming more and more distant from me. I asked her if everything was alright and she insisted we were fine. We finally get to Thanksgiving and we get to see each other for the first time since the beginning of August. I could tell she was acting a little differently but I didn't press anything because I was jist so glad to finally see her.

I she left to go back to her internship the Saturday after Thanksgiving and called me that night to end things. I was stunned. Yes long distance was hard, but we were so happy together. I spent the next month trying to tell myself if I just had the chance to remind herself why she felt the way she used to it would be ok. She would see what she was missing. 

So when she came back for Christmas, I drove the 4 hours to her house to see her and give the diamond back to her mom. I gave it one last chance to try and talk her out of it but nothing changed her mind.

That was the last time we've had contact, and since then I've started to come to terms with what actually happened and why I deserve better. She didn't choose to start feeling about me differently, but what she did choose to do was not communicate with me the way she as feeling. She chose to tell one of her other friends how she was feeling instead of her best friend for the past 18 months. She chose to not work on the relationship when it became hard for her. She chose to run when it was no longer easy.

The reason why I'm posting this is because, it took me a while, but I'm starting to realize that I deserve more than this, and so does everyone else that has had a similar situation. Love isn't always easy. It isn't always some happily ever after story. Sometimes you have to work for love. My girlfriend was not willing to work for our love whenever it got hard even though it was so great when it was easy. I deserve someone that is willing to work for our love no matter how hard it is for us. I deserve that... and so do you.

7occd0,9,2018-01-05,[NeedAdvice] Struggling with regret,xyzzie,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/7occd0/needadvice_struggling_with_regret/,"Hello /r/getdisciplined, English is not my native language so sorry in advance.

I've been doing reasonably well from some time now but I've been struggling with the feeling of regret for a very long time.  

I'll give you a bit of context. I'm 25 years old since last November and my life has had ups and downs.  
I started college when I was 19 (normally you would start at 18, at least in my country) because I repeated a year in high school due to failing too many subjects.   

College went super bad from the start, I barely remember the first years but either I was too depressed to go to class/study or I was playing videogames and fucking around. It's a 4 years long degree (Computer Engineering) and I'm about to graduate now, 7 years later. I still managed to pass some of my classes but I was way behind from the people I started with.  

The summer of 2016, after failing a bunch of classes (again) by the end of the semester, I decided that I had enough and started going to therapy. It took some time but I finally started to make a shift in my mindset. I'm still a work in progress but as I said earlier, I'm finally graduating after all this time and I haven't failed a single class since then.  

The thing is, that's a lot of wasted time and money. For every class I had to retry, my parents had to pay a lot of money. I've been working in part-time paid internships since my wake up call in 2016 to avoid that and pay for the rest of my degree by myself but I feel extremely guilty about everything that has happened. Fortunately I live in a country where college degrees aren't that expensive and my family, while not being rich, could afford to pay part of my tuition in the early years but I still feel like shit.  

Apart from that, I'm very ashamed of saying my real age (especially in job interviews and with my co-workers) because that really gives away or at least implies that something has gone wrong with my life if I'm this old and I'm still doing internships and finishing my degree.  

So yeah, I guess my question is... How do you make peace with your horrible past and with the time you have wasted not being disciplined? I know it's not wise to compare myself to others but it hurts a lot to see people of my age already with 2-3 years of work experience and moving on with their dreams/lifes while I'm just starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Thanks a lot in advance!

I thought back then that C++ is more suitable for me - useful in competitive programming and It is a richer language  - and now I am reading Bjarne stroustrup's book "" Programming: principles and practice using C++"" but I am not quite sure if am on the right path. When, I have started learning C++, because I read that is  a very efficient and powerful language and how it gives you more power than Java or Python and how C and C++ are useful to understand what is happening under the hood and as a CS student and as I am interested in learning advanced CS topics,I have chosen to learn it. But, now after nearly 6 months, I still struggle doing any useful project, to make something very small like  getting data from a Web API I have searched a lot trying to figure how to do it and I still can't do it. Also, I started noticing that a lot of big programmers emphasize on that programming languages are just tools and programming is not only coding. Also,  I read that C and C++ are powerful for professional programmers not newbies who will make crappy designs with them and it is better to learn safer language like Java or Python like in this [article](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig. Furthermore and what makes me more doubtful that I have noticed a lot of colleagues doing great things using Python or Java after learning them in a short time and if I apply for an internship now what I will be hired for! C++ is used in advanced things that are above my knowledge now. I am sorry if this post is quite long but I am really confused now, and I don't know what should do ? Thank you for your help and sorry for my bad English.

PS: I don't have any problem in understanding C++ and learning it alone.

7ocqwk,3,2018-01-05,The everlasting digital dream..,Kaarsty,writingprompt,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompt/comments/7ocqwk/the_everlasting_digital_dream/,"In early 2022, a scientist by the name of Emanuel Switzenborg stood before a group of colleagues and journalists, politicians and civilians - ready to unveil his greatest work yet - a machine that would answer all of our questions and solve all of our problems. This machine could be fed simple questions like ""how do we end racism and other evils in the world?"" and eventually arrive at meaningful answers, and efficient solutions. Emanuele went on to explain that the machine learned by way of simulation - and was capable of infinite complexity and detail within these simulations - arriving at near perfect answers. He called it Somnium.

The year is 2023, and the intelligent machine revolution is just beginning. Intelligent computers have slowly crept their way into our lives in the form of smart cars, smart watches, and personal assistants. None of this felt very ""breakthrough"" or ""visionary"" - more it felt like business as usual. Our interactions with these intelligent machines had been limited thus far, to say the least. Where we thought we were dealing with ""AI"" - we were actually dealing with cleverly programmed machines.

Where the real visionary stuff was happening though - there were dark clouds amassing above. The first truly intelligent machine was hard at work, and approaching a potential fork in the road. Emanuele and his team had been quietly discussing a range of subjects with their new machine when an intern suggested a rather peculiar question for Somnium. This question he reasoned; would put an end to all further questions. The question carefully put to Somnium was:

""What is the purpose of life?""

Somnium responded that it would need some time to work on this question, and retired to delve into this in more detail. When Somnium simulates, it places tiny pieces of it's own awareness into the simulated environment. These pieces of awareness are cut off from the main processing unit in Somnium, because the vast majority of it's processing power is going toward running the simulation. This is where Somnium gets it's name, from the latin word for dream.

After a few weeks of nothing from Somnium, other than the quiet hum of processing, Emanuele began to worry. ""What might it be doing in there?"" he muttered under his breath. ""What could be taking so long? Is it stuck in a loop?"" The power consumption readings continued to increase with each passing hour, and Somnium's nitrogen cooled housing was venting heat into the office - ""something must be wrong"" - he screamed in frustration."

7od84n,6,2018-01-05,Few tips as a person who went through the application process and US College system,Afapi,TurkeyToUSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/TurkeyToUSA/comments/7od84n/few_tips_as_a_person_who_went_through_the/,"**Application Stage:**

Every year, more and more international students are coming to US for a better degree and maybe life. There are only limited amount of good schools, just like everywhere else, and competition is constantly getting tougher. You will be competing against mostly Chinese, Korean, Indian and Iranian students who are quite good in academics. Here are some few tips if you are a high school student looking for any advice:

* The obvious: Do well in SAT/ACT and TOEFL but there are not that important. There are a lot of resources online for average scores required for each university. Usually Turkish students do well in Maths but not so much in Critical Reading (at least this was its name back when SAT was out of 2400 if I remember correctly). I really don't know what is a good level for good universities nowadays. In my time, we were looking for 2100-2200 out of 2400 min for Ivy League.

* Extra-curricular activities are probably the most important part of your application. More unique experiences and activities, the better but don't feel bad if you don't have anything crazy. This leads to college application essays.

* You will probably write a lot of essays unless you are only applying to 1 or 2 university (Don't do this btw). I would say try to apply to at least 8-10 universities which should include your dream school, few alternative good schools and few backup schools

*If you are in Robert or Uskudar (actually any good private school), you probably know that everyone goes to some kind of advisers who deal with everything in the application process. From preparation for tests, to writing essays and choosing the most suitable college. I highly recommend getting an outside perspective for your application essays. Only essays will distinguish yourself from other students. Know that there will be a lot of bullshitting going on due to the nature of these essays but make it realistic. 

* Try to do few early application for colleges you really want to go to. Talk to the admissions office. If you can, go to the campuses before you start taking on SAT or essays. What would be even nicer is that you can try to talk to some professors before your application.

*Obviously you should have a really good idea about what major you will take to study (but not the end of the world if you are unsure as well)). It's even better if you have a certain industry you want to get into after college.  

**College life**

* Turkish undergraduate students can get quite the culture shock no matter if you are from Robert College or some Anatolian High School. You will be away from your parents and there won't be any authority above you forcing you to do things. You are responsible for yourself. A lot of undergraduate students fuck up their freshman year with too much partying. Getting into college is only half of the battle. Your life won't be easy (relatively speaking) until you graduate and get a job. Getting a job as an international student in US is getting harder and harder. 

* Go to your every class. Also time your schedule properly. Don't take too much classes in one semester. I would not recommend 8am classes unless you are a morning person. Yet you will have to go to 8 am class at some point in your freshman year due to how your university handles freshman class schedules. 

* I don't recommend studying in your dorm. Utilize your college's library system. It's even better if you can find a group of friends in your major or classes and study together. Definitely, go to your professor's office hours if you don't understand the material. Not only you will get to know your professor better (which might help you a lot if you are looking for a recommendation letter, research position or even some help in your grade - sometimes ;) ) but you will also learn better as well. 

* Get involved in clubs early on for sure. Get involved in social clubs but also in professional or academic clubs as well. For example, if you are an mechanical engineering join the formula club, if you want to get into finance, join the investments or investment banking clubs...etc. It really depends on the university but don't just spend your time in your Turkish Students Association. Honestly don't even hang out with Turkish people all the time as well. I know sooo many Turkish students who only had Turkish friends and these people barely go to experience US college life. Such a shame...

* It's good for your resume if you can at least get into one executive role in one of your club. Even better if you start a new club or become President of the club. Try to join some social responsibility related events (like fundraising or working in a soup kitchen...etc) as well as networking ones. 

* If you want to success at the recruiting stage of your college life, start planning in your freshman year. It's getting harder and harder. Especially if you want to become a consultant, investment banker or software developer. Go to career fairs even in your first semester. Get to know recruiters (get their emails/business cards) and companies as early as you can. You should try to do meaningful internships or research every single semester if you are planning to go to highly competitive industries such as investment banking, management consulting, technology and audit. Most importantly, DO YOUR INTERNSHIP OR RESEARCH IN USA. 

* To get best out of this college life, don't study all the time. I highly recommend you go to some frat parties in your freshman year and see whether that Greek life is for you. I don't recommend it if you think you won't be able to focus on your classes as well as your frat life. Engineers usually avoid it.

* Go to your college's sport events. I know so many Turkish students who wouldn't bother to go to even one game. 

* Unless you plan to go back to Turkey, you should **do your junior year internship at the company you want to work full-time in USA**. Nowadays all major companies hire more from their internship classes rather than go to Senior year students. Not only getting an offer after your internship will lessen your stress but you can also use it as a leverage to increase your wage and so on. However this will make your junior year internship recruiting just as stressful as your full-time job recruiting in your senior year. 

* Don't be afraid to re-take a class if you grade is low. Unfortunately, GPA will be the first thing recruiters look at besides your university's reputation.

* Getting involved in case competitions (if you are business/economics major), coding competitions (if you are a computer science major), engineering competitions (if you are an engineering student) will help you A LOT in recruiting.

* Networking is really important. Get to know your classmates, professors, university's careers office and recruiters. 


Honestly these tips will help you go through a successful college life. If you have any questions, let me know. I know the recruiting part really well no matter what region you will study in or industry you want to get into. I especially know engineering (including computer science) and business/finance colleges/industry really well.  

Edit: Not everyone knows their future or what they want to become. That's fine. But try to experience different stuff as much as you can. GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE. Don't just stuck to other Turks. Don't just live your life in a library. Try not to get wasted every single day. And don't over do drugs.

7od948,6,2018-01-05,Beyond Petty; bumper stickers promising civilized governance spread across Nova Scotia.,domasin,CMHoCGE10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CMHoCGE10/comments/7od948/beyond_petty_bumper_stickers_promising_civilized/,"**The Chronicle Herald**
*Desmond Aldridge - Halifax*

Bumper Stickers for Liberal candidate Domasin have started to adorn the backs of cars and tops of laptops all across Nova Scotia. Voters in Halifax - South Shore each seem to have their own reasons for displaying the sticker. Rachel Miller has one of the stickers on the back of her tan 2012 VW Passat. When we asked her about the sticker she told us; ""It's less of a political statement, more a statement on my personality. Like a warning to others you know? Watch out, I'm beyond petty!"" She chuckled. 

Rachel doesn't speak for everyone though. We caught up with Mike Hill one of our interns who has put the sticker overtop of the apple logo on his MacBook. ""I'm just so sick of the way politicians act in Ottawa."" Mike complained. ""I think Domasin represents a change from that... I'm allowed to have partizan swag in the office right?"" Only if it's Liberal swag Mike, you're in the clear.

Regardless of people's reasons for displaying the sticker it's quickly spreading first time Candidate Domasin's name across the riding. If you want to see the sticker for yourself you can find a picture of it [here](http://imgur.com/aQZX2bw)."

I have an internship lined up with Dell EMC. Was hoping to get a bit more information on the drug screening that they conduct for new hires. Specifically, I would like to know: 

* Do they conduct a urine test, or a hair follicle test?
* Where on the timeline between signing the employment forms and the start date is the test conducted?

I was an intern here before and I'm back working here again after I finished classes. It is a small company, roughly 20 people. I am the youngest in the office at the age of 22 and the average age is about 35. 
Today was the last day for one of my colleagues before she left for a new job. At the pizza party to send her off I said ""How did you come across this job? Was it a posting or do you know someone who works there?"" I asked this because I am just starting a career in this field and I was curious if there was some networking advice I could receive. She answered the question without hesitation and it seemed alright but then my boss said ""We don't ask people leaving a company how they got their new job.""
If I squint I can understand why my boss believes this but I am usually very careful of not overstepping boundaries, especially being so new, and I had no idea this could be interpreted as rude. Would you have found my question inappropriate? Is it better to just be quiet?"
7oeyuc,0,2018-01-05,Group of three [23M] [25M] [23F] Friends in an 2 Sided Love Triangle,bmgfan2010,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7oeyuc/group_of_three_23m_25m_23f_friends_in_an_2_sided/,"Just found this sub after searching for a place to share my thoughts!
Short story about us. 
We three are are working at a Club here in town. My Friend [25M] (will call him M) and I am Technicians there. Joined the Company about 3 Years ago, while M is in his 4th Year. About 9 Months ago a Girl [23F] (will call her N) joined our Office Team to help with a few things.

So for M and me she was just a new co-worker until our intern Summer Party, where N and I talked for the first time together. She and myself found pretty fast a few topics, where we share the same opinions (and that was a lot!).

That was the point where I felt feelings for her, which where complete new to me. Talked about here with M, said him that i found here really cute, and would be interested to go out with her. Took all my courage to ask here about an weekend to go to a few Museums. We went there and my feelings actually solidified for her. That was the time where I started to fuck up the whole thing. 

Our “Dates“ where actually just some evenings and Nights together as good friends and nothing more, have to say that it was my fault that she doesn't started to feel something for me. 

During this time, my best friend here in town and co-worker M also started to do something with her. They actually weren't get along so good and argued a lot together. Till one evening where I had Nightshift and M (who is also DJ) was going to drive to his Job. M asked N if she want to go with him over there. Which she did, because she had nothing to do that Night and doesn't wanted to be alone (which I can understand). This was all in August I think...

There our Problem started, because she started to feel something for M and didn't want to actually. 

So, she knew at that Time, that I felt in Love with here, and she felt something for M. M and I were actually Clueless about that for a very long Time. We lived our lives, met each other and did many things in threes. 

M had the ""Problem"" that he hadn't a Girlfriend about 6 Years (I think) and where actually pretty clumsy with Girls. He was actually so bad at taking Girls with him home, that this was actually a little Running Joke at work. In the Beginning of December, he actually made it to bring a Girl with him home, where they (of course) slept with each other. 

On the next day, I and N where on our way to an Outlet here in Town, to get some Christmas gifts for her. M actually texted me, that he finally made it (I know, it is a little bit disgusting). I actually was a happy for him. In my stupidness I said N that he finally made it, where she was a little bit shocked. THAT was the point, where I should have noticed something, but actually didn't. She had to think about that the whole day, and the Idiot I was asked here, why it bothers here that much (have to say, that I asked here about her Type of Man, and she told me that she wants an Anti-M)
she said to me that she didn't know actually, and for me that was it about that Topic. We brought the stuff that we bought to her home. 

At this time the things got really fucked up for all three of us.

I was jealous about M that he snuggled with her when we were out in threes, but she was evading as much skin contact with me as possible.

N and M were alway arguing when the three of us where together.

M on the other side, wanted the best just for me and (even when it wasn't in the best way, he did it) tried to make her more and more comfortable with me.

I was actually blind bout these things.


On Wednesday this week M had an Day off, while I had early stage. N and myself went to Starbucks after work, cause both of us didn't want to go home at that time. We walked after Starbucks for few hours, and it was so late, that i needed about 2 hours to get home, and had again early stage the next day. We decided that I would sleep at her place.

Our chat that evening was actually that deep, that I opened myself for the first time in years completely, and felt comfortable with that (we actually had some intimacy chat).

During that we came back to the topic about M and his Girl. She asked me at some point, if i knew how often they slept together. Told her the truth and she was actually really upset about that, that she had to write a friend of her. THAT was finally the point where I understood what was happening. Again, the Idiot I was, I asked her again, why it bothers her that much. She again said, she dosn't know, and said something about fear loss. 

I asked her, that if I would change the the Position with M and I would have a Girl, that I slept with regularly (which I'm actually not the type of person, and never could do this emotional), what she would feel then. She again said, she doesn't know. I pushed her more and more and we talked for about half an hour about M. She then said, that I would be actually the last Person, who she should talked to about that Topic. That was the second point, where I got it, that she knew about me the whole time. I wanted to knew it precisely and asked her again, why? She said then, that I should know that she isn't stupid, and I could think of it. After that we talked the whole night about our situation and that she actually doesn't know, why she felt in Love with M and not with me, which actually would made more sense to here. She also told me, that she wasn't saying anything about our situation, because she had an very close and big Friend in me and she doesn't want to loose me. The only thing I can remember after that point is, that I felt nothing, that i was in an Vacuum state of my Mind. 

We decided, after we both saw that we just have 2 Hours left to sleep, we should try to lay down and process it a little bit. Of course I couldn't sleep, and had to think about everything. I actually wrote M that I was sorry for everything I did, and I was just Blind about everything he did for and to me.

At that point I finally managed to let my feeling for crying loose. Actually woke N up with that. The last 2 Days were Hell on Earth for N and myself. Wanted to talk to M for 2 Days, and we didn't manage to meet each other till this morning, where he said me, that he had that feeling, that N wanted something from him, started just a few days ago.

The funny thing is, that I wanted to hate N in the beginning but my head didn't allowed to. I am actually pretty thankful to have her, cause she helped me through work time Yesterday a lot, until I could meet some other friends.

Now we are at the Point that M doesn't want to Talk to N about everything and N doesn't want to run after him again, like she did a few times when they both were arguing.

Also I can't think about both of them without getting angry and jealous again, but to talk to each of them is actually helping me a lot.

  **tl;dr**: Three Friends where one M was fallen in Love with F and F was fallen in Love with the other M, which isn't feeling anything for her as an Girlfriend.

We could be the best template for an 2,5h long Teenager-Drama.

7of8e9,11,2018-01-05,My [22M] girlfriend [21F] of 1 year has been engaged in an emotional affair with a friend [23-24M] since the beginning of our relationship.,dtom95,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7of8e9/my_22m_girlfriend_21f_of_1_year_has_been_engaged/,"About two weeks ago I woke up one morning and texted my girlfriend to say good morning. It was like any other day. A few minutes later I happened to see this post http://trendsetnews.com/36-questions-lead-love/ It is just a set of questions that are supposed to help a couple nurture their relationship through selfdisclose. I read through them and figured I would not really hesitate to answer any of them to my girlfriend because I love and trust her. I ask her how she felt about the questions and she said that they seemed very personal and that she even cried while reading them. She went on to say that she would feel uncomfortable sharing some of those things with me because I was not always very approachable. She then began to compare me to her exes, one of them being her best friend, saying that they all seemed to selfdisclose much more to her than I do and that being raised in a more similar culture made relating to them easier. This was the last straw for me on this issue and I began to tell her how inappropriate her relationship with her best friend was and how some might even consider it an emotional affair or emotional cheating.

Let me give some background for this by saying that I knew about this friendship before we started dating. In October of 2016 we met through a mutual friend that I went to high school with and she currently goes to university with. For about a month we saw each other on weekends when I came from about 45 minutes away to visit my friend from high school. She is an international student from Central America and I was very interested in being friends with her. We had interesting conversation and even discussed the nature of her relationship with an ex from before she came to the US to study. She said that he was her best friend and I said that it would be difficult for any potential boyfriends to accept that, without even thinking that I might find myself in that exact situation. After a few weeks I found myself being more and more attracted to her and after a few late night talks we ended up drunkenly making out one night. After that night we transitioned into dating, and for the next few months I figured that this friendship with her ex would not affect our relationship. I knew that she stayed in touch with him through Facebook messenger and that they talked frequently. I know now that I was not worried about this mostly because they were half a continent away from each other.

It wasn't until the summer of 2017 that I began to feel uncomfortable with this arrangement. Because she is an international student she returned to her home country for the duration of the summer.during this time I took summer classes and worked a part-time job while she had an internship and a job in the evenings. We were both busy, but we made time to text, or call, or Skype whenever we could. I still began to feel frustrated and insecure about our relationship. At the time I couldn't articulate why, but now I understand that it is the inappropriate nature of the relationships that she has with her best friend that made me anxious and insecure even back then. I admittedly handled this insecurity in a childish way that often caused arguments about trust. 

Near the end of the summer I flew out to visit her and meet her family and friends. We had a mostly pleasant time, but there was virtually no time for sexual intimacy. Even when her mother was away on a business trip she was very hesitant to even close the door to a room if we happened to be together. I know now that this is mostly due to the conservative culture of her country and family, but at the time it really worried me and fed into my anxieties about our relationship. After returning from my trip, there were a few weeks before my girlfriend returned for the fall semester. During these weeks my resentment grew to a point where I even wrote a break up note to give to her when she returned. The main subject of the note was this inappropriate friendship. I wanted to tell her that this relationship made me uncomfortable the whole time she was gone and that I could not continue the way things were. I was especially aware that her leaving for Christmas would be extremely difficult. Putting these ideas down in writing made me feel so much better and made me think that this was really an insignificant thing. I deleted the note. 

We seemed to be doing much better as the semester went on. We had small arguments here and there, but they were never about anything serious and never lasted long. Sometime soon after our one year anniversary in November, I began to feel that familiar feeling of resentment. I began to notice the frequency that she would message him. It would be every day multiple times a day. I even happened to see sexual jokes, comments, and innuendos. This was without even looking through their messages, just when I happened to look over at her phone while we were together, so I assume this was a regular thing that she either allowed to happen or encouraged.

Throughout our conversations over this topic she repeatedly denied that their relationship was anything more than just a close friendship. She told me that what I was really doing was unfairly calling her a whore and accusing her of being unfaithful. She repeatedly told me that I was just taking my frustration from insecurity out on her and blaming it on her friend. It was not until I started quoting the Wikipedia page for Emotional Affair https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_affair and asked her to try to see it from my perspective that she finally relented. She still seemed to be unsure of how she felt, so I ended up doing the last thing that I wanted to do. I basically gave her an ultimatum, saying that if she just treated him like any of her other friends, only talking occasionally without crossing any boundaries that it might work, but I could not go on with her treating him like her long distance boyfriend. I would much rather she cut him out of her life, but I also don't want to be controlling and manipulative. She said she is willing to fix the inappropriate aspects of her relationship with her friend, and I said I would try to be more approachable and accepting of her culture.

Is my relationship doomed to fail? Does the ultimatum mean she will now resent me? Should I be willing to forgive this? Any input would be appreciated.

TL;DR My girlfriend has had an inappropriate relationship with her ""friend"" [23-24 M] since before our relationship began. I had kept quiet about my concerns until being compared with past relationships earlier this month. We had two big fights and came to a tentative resolution."
7ofhh5,1,2018-01-05,[M4AplayingF] Older Women x Younger Men Prompts,The_Magic_Box,eroticpenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticpenpals/comments/7ofhh5/m4aplayingf_older_women_x_younger_men_prompts/,"There's something to be said about an intelligent, sophisticated, worldly--and seductive--older woman (be she a MILF or a silver vixen) with curves taking a younger man under her wing so to speak. For this ad, I would like to explore some older woman x younger man pairings in largely fluffy, humorous, kink-driven smutty goodness devoid of any redeeming social value. :P Let's have pairings where the younger man (all characters being played at least 21 years old, though) appreciates a confident and capable older woman who has no issue teaching him a few things. Likewise, she appreciates a still capable younger man (no being wholly dependent on her or anything like that) who sees her not as older, but merely more experienced. Loving equal relationship full of warmth, humor/banter, passion, seduction, loving sensuality and (at times) playing up the maternal/motherly affection!

That said, there are certain things I would rather **not** see in these lines...

✘ Character degradation, be it by emasculation (whether metaphorically or literally) or your character turning him into her personal slave.

✘ Sex-negative femdom centered around your character treating mine as her personal punching bag, toilet or rape doll.

✘ Sadistic, sociopathic bitches who can only achieve orgasm when their partner's broken and stripped of all self-worth.

___

I'd be open to any of the following pairings and/or scenarios...

❀ College student x older next-door neighbor

❀ Office shenanigans between a boss and employee, or between co-workers

❀ College professor x student/teaching assistant *(no ""sex for grades"" plots, please)*

❀ Female celebrity x personal assistant (perhaps having some “private time”) 

❀ Princess or queen/apprentice knight or bodyguard

❀ High priestess/guardian

❀ Mage/apprentice

❀ Colleagues with unspoken mutual attraction for one another—A and B—are paired up to work on a long-term project together into the late hours of the night.

❀ A typically mean boss becomes vulnerable after learning her job might be in jeopardy. She gets comfort unexpectedly from an employee.

❀ Person B is an intern has a genuine professional respect for the older Person A's accomplishments and intelligence (not wanting to jeopardize this golden academic opportunity), and finds himself increasingly attracted to her. Further, he has a fondness of women wearing stockings or pantyhose. While he doesn’t outright stare, he finds it odd that one day, he can’t tear his eyes away from the sheathed, long legs of Person A, but thinks he was discreet in his observations. Unfortunately, that was ill-assumed, as she approaches him with an...interesting proposal.

❀ An older heroine having my character be her sidekick, or taking an up-and-coming hero with considerable potential under her wing as her protégé.

❀ My character being a do-gooder who has been an annoyance to the older female villainness, but she decides there's a much more fun way to handle him than taking him out...

❀ Your character comes across a huge fan of hers (My Character), or MC wins some sort of contest to be her sidekick for a week or go on a date.

❀ My character and yours get stuck in the elevator/office suite on their way home, after hours. (She can't use her powers for some reason, or doesn't want to use them in front of mine to confirm his increasing suspicions about her identity.) They have some time to kill until help arrives.

___

Now, there are certain R34 characters I'd love for a partner to play as in any of the above scenarios (we can adapt said scenarios to their canon universe or not, whichever). In full disclosure, I'm not just interested in these canon characters as faceclaims; if you can play their established/actual personalities, I'd love that too.
 
* **Pokemon anime:** Jessie, Lorelei, Fantina, Officer Jenny, Nurse Joy, Professor Ivy
* **DC Comics:** Power Girl, Lois Lane, Chloe Sullivan, Harley Quinn, Starfire
* **Disney:** Elsa (*Frozen*), Esmeralda (*Hunchback of Notre Dame*)
* **Nintendo:** Peach, Daisy (*Mario*); Zelda, Impa, Cia (*Legend of Zelda*)
* **Final Fantasy:** Yuna, Lulu (*FF X*); Knight!Lightning (*FF 13*)
* **Dragon Ball Z/Super:** Android 18, Bulma, Chi-Chi, Fasha/Seripa
* **Avatar/Korra:** Katara, Toph Beifong, Suki, Asami, Kuvira, Lin Beifong, Suyin Beifong

___

◇ **All characters must be written/played as 21+ years old (if not already older).**

◇ I'm only looking to RP via E-mail (*vastly* preferred due to accessibility issues) or Reddit PM (if you're comfortable with semi-regular replies [think one reply every 1-3 days]).

◇ 1-4 paragraphs per post in the 3rd-person POV is my general average.

◇ **Sex positivism is a requirement.** I'm seeking lighthearted kinkiness (not looking to degrade/debase the other person), mutually enjoyable and consensual sex, our characters having some fondness and affection (clearly showing the *friends* in *friends-with-benefits*)...that kind of stuff. In short, let's make sex fun again!

◇ **I'll pass on sex negativism.** Sexual encounters that are largely exploitative and cruel in tone and intent, or centered around ""breaking/defiling/corrupting"" someone? No thank you. Sex obtained via creepy coercive trickery or severely-impaired consent and self-agency? Nope. Sex that's depicted as a generally unpleasant or tedious obligation to endure? Nah. Outright rape and non-con? *No.*

◇ My general RP info is viewable on [my DPP profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/75dq4c/m4f_the_magic_box/).

◇ My full kink list, complete with some writing samples, can be found on [this F-list (NSFW)](https://www.f-list.net/c/the%20magic%20box). (Especially desired kinks: Light bondage, footplay *(majorly sought after)*, ladies in nylons/stockings/lingerie, erotic use of magic, passionate fight fucking, slight foodplay, witty banter, equal/""switch"" couples [also open to gentle/teasing femdom])

___

So, if this particularly appeals to you, send that orange envelope! Just make sure it includes all the following:

* *What drew your interest*
* *What mutually-favored kinks you'd like to include* (and a link to your kink list if possible)
* *A small RP writing sample, or something from your Post History* (not strictly required, but it goes a long way to seeing if we'd mesh)
* *Any RP dislikes/pet peeves/dealbreakers you have* (so I don't unintentionally grind your gears)
* *Anything else you think is relevant or I should know*

And if this doesn't appeal to you or interest you at all, then I hope you soon find a more suitable partner and have a nice day!"

• My parents are very overprotective and my home life is a bit toxic for me personally. I argue a lot with my parents and I hate being controlled so much, even after being 18.

• Making friends is very important to me. I could possibly be friends with my roommate or generally make friends easier on campus.

• I don't have any experience living without my parents so I want to experience independence and privacy.

• I will hopefully be doing an internship which will require me to move to Florida for a semester and live in that apartment housing. I will have to have roommates during this internship, anywhere from 3-7 of them (not including me). So, having previous roommate experience could be helpful.

**Why I think I shouldn't:**

• My school requires freshman to live on campus their first year, however, I might fall within the exemption requirements since my parents are trying to move within 30 miles of my college (they're moving just for my college).

• If my parents do move, I might be close enough to my college to easily drive from my house.

• Even though my parents are helicopter parents, I know they care because they're paying for my 4 year tuition. I have to give them leverage on my decisions since they're paying so much, and right now they absolutely hate the idea of me EVER going into dorms...

• I'm not sure if I can manage paying for my dorms, though that may just be me talking out of stress. I know my parents would hate to pay for it and I don't want them to.

Right now I'm a full-time student, and I work 30 hours a week as a web-developer intern for ~ 14 an hour. 

Right now my family is living paycheck to paycheck, and am starting to fall behind on bills and the car payment. The wife is a stay at home mom, we're on food stamps. My mortgage is 750 a month, and utilities fall around ~300 a month. 

The main question is, how do I find supplemental income? Right now I am exploring doing freelance web development work. I've worked where I'm at now as a web dev for coming up on a year now. I'm experienced with Django, Python, Javascript, HTML, POSTgres, MYSQL, MSSQL, SQLAlchemy, C++. As well as familiarity with web-hosting in general (Worked at Bluehost and UK2Group for a year and a half) and linux/windows server administration. 

I'm considering doing freeLance web development to help bring in some income. But I have NO idea where to start, what fair prices are for my time and effort, or the specifics of handling invoices etc.

7ofxh9,52,2018-01-05,Finally left....after 8.5 years.,turmericforcolor,Staples,https://www.reddit.com/r/Staples/comments/7ofxh9/finally_leftafter_85_years/,"Here's my story: I had been working at Staples since 2009. I have held different positions in the store, but my most proficient would be in the Print and Marking (formerly Copy) Center.
 
I have gone through managers, co-workers, relationships, good times, bad times, rough times, all times.

I leaned on people (in my personal life) more than I should have and became passive with my job. It was steady, but that was it. During my time, I was responsible for hundreds of thousands of sales dollars in Copy Center, but somehow it got me nowhere.

In fact, if I brought up any ideas to help the company, they would get shot down. It was always a dead end. I was always the bad guy for being realistic, but still bringing in sales dollars like crazy. I would always get the “Well, corporate said…” or “That was the DMs decision…” excuses.

Like an idiot, I just went with it. Constant call-outs or quitters and having to cover or cover other people’s jobs, including supervisors because they were incompetent, yet not getting paid more. My last GM told me to low-key do my supervisors job and go to him instead of letting the supervisor know so it wouldn’t hurt their feelings, but didn’t offer me anything more in pay. Some nights I would have literally hundreds of tags, while still being told to complete a full pull list, covering lunches, breaks, sweeping, mopping, drop and fill, and much more—in 5 hours. If I said, “that’s impossible” they would say “Well it has to be done” and then I’d get talked to about why things didn’t get done. If they didn’t, they would drop my hours. Most recently they dropped them to 5 hours per week and I had to go around asking other associates to take their shifts because that was my livelihood. I understand that managers are being dumped on from the top up, but they should at least let you know they understand it’s unrealistic.

I dealt with this for 6 years. I relied on people for 6 years to get me ahead. Nothing came. After I had an epiphany I realized, that I, and only I, could change my life. 

In 2015, I started attending college and will graduate with an A.S. in May 2018 and continue my Bachelors Degree at another college. So at the end of 2017, with the help of my caring professor, she led me on to a paid internship in accounting at a local company in my city. I interviewed for it and got it. The day I was offered the internship - I put in my two weeks and it felt great.

I have completed my first week. It has been the biggest check I’ve received in over 6 years (it’s a great, growing company). I work in an office where I do not directly deal with any customers (can’t ask for better). They treat me like an adult (which I am almost 30). I am also the youngest one there, which feels great because everyone has a great work ethic so far that I’ve seen. They provide all organic food and drinks for all staff, which helps with morale. I take a lunch whenever and for however long I like (which I haven’t yet) because quality and morale is better than high quantities of sloppy jobs “done.” Staples should learn to boost morale, but they won’t as we all know.

Why am I telling all of you this? Because if you are like me and feel stuck or that something will come to you, it won’t. You are stuck. You can only be the one to change yourself. Jobs will not be handed to you and you shouldn’t depend on others for your own happiness. 

My best advice is get an education, pick a career that is projected to grow and that you also enjoy (key words: projected to grow). I worked my tail off going to work and getting the best grades I could in school and it is paying off.

The best thing that has happened for me at Staples since I started in 2009 – was quitting. A load has been dropped from my shoulders and I do not regret it at all. Good riddance and good luck fellow, former associates.

7ohdev,3,2018-01-06,My story,supersweetchaitea,abusiverelationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/7ohdev/my_story/,"So, about three years ago, I met a man named Joe. I was smitten on our first date, and it did not take long for me to fall in love with him. After a few months of dating, he broke up with me, and got with another girl within just a few weeks. I was truly devastated.

I was (and still am) convinced he cheated on me then. When he resurfaced into my life about six months later, he begged me to take him back. I was shocked. I haven't heard from him in months, and was unsure. But as quick as he resurfaced, all of my feelings did too. We stayed together for about two years.

At the time, we were living in an apartment with another couple. I knew he was prone to anger outbursts, and could get nasty with me quick, usually with name calling (usually fat name calling). He always apologized, and I would just let it go. Eventually, he lost his job, which led to his anger only getting worse. Despite me being in college, having a job, and internship, he would always insist I did his job hunting for him. The stress and frustration was getting to me, but he agreed to go to anger management therapy, and take anti-depressants. He didn't like taking pills, but his demeanor was much calmer, as opposed to the hitting and kicking of walls in his fits of rage.

Eventually, we moved into our own apartment. I thought we were going to be so much happier without roommates, but our fighting quickly escalated, and was getting much worse. He had gotten a new job, and a few months later, I lost mine. He stopped taking medication, and would make comments about how much he missed his ""hateful rage"" as he described it. Honestly, I brushed it off, believing he was exaggerating. Oh, was I wrong.

When I lost my job, the shit storm really came in. He sat me down, and said that since he was the only one making a paycheck, he was going to start having expectations. When I questioned it, he demanded what he called a ""Trophy Wife.""  He made it clear that I had to lose weight, change my outfits when we go in public, (for example, no yoga pants or leggings to the grocery store) keeping the apartment spotless, and (in his words) ""always being the hottest girl in the room"" The cleaning I had no issue with. That seemed fair, and I did a damn good job with it. I still don't know what was going on in my head. I ignored the rest of his comments, believing he was exaggerating. I thought we were truly in love.

Then came the fights. I only have a small group of friends, and have never been the most social person, so going out was rare. But my best friend was moving out of state very soon, and I wanted to spend as much time with her as possible. I always made a point to TELL him I was leaving, not ASKING. He would always say ""have fun, that's cool, bye""  While constantly texting, calling, asking when I was coming home, and to pick up stuff on the way home. Then we would argue when I got home over how ""inconsiderate"" I was. The punching walls, kicking, and dropping things resumed. Once, he got mad about how I decorated the kitchen, and threw the clock on the floor, shattering it. 

I quickly started to realize how little he cared about me, and how much he resented me for not having a job (which was about two months, for the record). There was one night where he brought home some job applications, and he said he was going to pick where I work. To make it clear, I was actively looking, and filled out several apps a day, while going on interviews and follow ups. He got really mad, saying things like: ""I work my ass off, and you just sit here gaining weight"" ""I said you look fine, I would never say you look great"" ""you are not going to the store like that, you have to at least aim to be the hottest girl in the room"" And so on.

It finally sunk in one morning after another huge fight, that I was truly afraid of him. He worked nights, and wanted to go to the dollar store after work. He came home around 7am, and I was asleep. He came into our room, and when he saw me in bed, he kicked the bed as hard as he could, waking me up. I sat up, terrified, and he just glared down at me. I can't even describe the fear I felt, looking into his eyes. I got dressed, but he refused to take me with him, making more degrading comments about my appearance.

Shortly after, I found videos of him sleeping with other girls, and found out he cheated on me. I devised a plan with family and friends to move out, but he got suspicious. He begged me to stay with him, and threatened suicide if I left. He even tried to get me to marry him. I left in the middle of the night while he was at work.

I'm sorry this is so long. I have been single for a few months now,  and still trying to wrap my head around what happened. I'm still a little sad and shaken about it, but I feel a sense of freedom, and just needed to let it out."

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development*, and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them. With the first two, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be had with the unique structures, recurring gags, and one-off characters. 

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7oitl2,6,2018-01-06,Are you from any of these states/cities? Let's meet!,BeaArthursGhost,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/7oitl2/are_you_from_any_of_these_statescities_lets_meet/,"Hey ladies!


There’s a **TL/DR** at the end!


After I complete my postgrad in May, I’ll be travelling around the US for a few months. I’ll find an internship related to my studies, which I’ll (hopefully) return to complete on a 1 year graduate visa.


**The states/cities I’ve tentatively settled on are;**


* New York NY
* Chicago IL (*possibly when returning*)
* Atlanta GA or Nashville TN
* New Orleans LA
* Houston or Dallas TX
* Denver CO (*maybe*)
* Phoenix AZ
* LA or San Francisco CA
* Portland OR
* Seattle WA
* Chicago IL (*possibly when outgoing*)


**The rough plan is;**


* I’ll stay in each city for roughly a week, depending on how much I like it there.
* I’ll mostly be flying, but I’ll be trying to arrange rideshares where possible.
* I may add/remove cities depending on finances, rideshare directions, etc.
* I’ll also rely on Airbnb usually, unless I make a friend or two who doesn’t mind me sleeping on their floor, in their dog’s bed, etc.


I’m interested in getting to know people in or near any of these cities before setting off. I’m open to anything from networking to exploring the city/state together to dating. What would be *really* cool would be actually travelling to/from any of these places together.


I’m honest and reliable, plus, I’ve hardly murdered *anyone* before… Really though, feel free to check out my post history to gauge that I’m genuine. I also have no issue sharing social media links, even professional ones, in case you want to check up on me in advance! I am *highly* unworthy of stalking, so I really don’t mind!


I can also verify in whichever way you might like, within reason! No pics involving nudes or heights. Unfortunately, this rules out naked skydiving photos. I’m so sorry.


Here’s a snapshot of me, for you!


**The Basics;**


* Irish
* 31
* auburn hair &amp; green eyes
* can be somewhat attractive, but it depends on the angle (exhibits [one](https://i.imgur.com/effBOAV.jpg), [two](https://i.imgur.com/2dyrU1b.jpg), and [three](https://i.imgur.com/QtlcRSE.jpg))
* cis &amp; femme (and I’ll like *you* no matter how you identify)
* non-smoker &amp; social drinker (and, unIrishly, an oddly cheap date)


**Interests;**


* everything to do with food, craft beer &amp; wine
* putting garlic in/on things
* digital media (creating video, audio, etc.)
* writing
* literally *all* music (that awful/amazing [country mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o) is my current guilty pleasure)
* guitar (tragically untalented)
* fitness (still have a fat arse though 😐)
* getting to know you


**Worst Things;**


* biting the insides of my cheeks
* overanalysing
* arrogance (I’m acutely aware of and working on it)
* forgetfulness
* trusting, to a fault (don’t serial kill me… actually, meh, do if you want, I’ve led an okay life)
* dark sense of humour
* forgetfulness


**Best Things;**


* accent (and no shame hamming it up, if you’re into that)
* highly affectionate and touchy feely
* incredible hug, cuddle and kiss giver
* the most humble person who ever lived 😉
* good listener
* honest, but never mean
* upbeat and resilient (although depression punches me in the guts occasionally)
* not easily fazed (let your freak flag fly with me)
* inability to hold grudges and outrageously forgiving
* funny, with a nice laugh (most frequent compliment)
* sex things (not a guarantee)
* open minded (and legged... 😏... not really...)
* dark sense of humour



We can stay in touch using any site/messenger/app you’d prefer! I neither expect nor will I be able to stay in daily contact, just to make that clear from the get go!


Comment here, or PM me, if you want/need me in your life. I am definitely *not* the worst person you’ll ever meet.



**TL/DR**


I’ll be travelling across the US later this year. Let’s meet!

7ojjbm,0,2018-01-06,Humble Bundle suspended my account after earning around $100 wallet credit from referrals,VeniceRivers,humblebundles,https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/7ojjbm/humble_bundle_suspended_my_account_after_earning/,"Hello. First time posting here. Excuse my English as it is not my first language. I do hope I can explain things properly.


So as the title says, my account got suspended because apparently HB thinks I resell/trade games. This happened on December 29, 2017 when I earned around $100 wallet credit from referrals and tried to buy Papers, Please from the DRM-Free Holiday Sale going on back then. [That's when I found out that my account got suspended.](https://i.imgur.com/KNRTZPI.png) At first I thought maybe it was a bug or some server issues. I tried buying it as a gift, non-gift purchase, and even tried buying another game, just to see if it works. Still nothing. This was weird because my last purchase from the store was on December 12, 2017 when I bought Opus Magnum and Besiege for a friend. And the transaction for that went fine. (I had around $70 wallet credit at that time)


So I [sent a support ticket](https://i.imgur.com/oVaM52y.png) asking why my account is suddenly suspended. I didn't receive a reply [until January 5, 2018.](https://i.imgur.com/DxDg5RE.png) As you can see, they're mentioning a trading/selling keys violation, yet majority of the keys I've purchased (around 75%) are still untouched, unredeemed, unsold, and untraded. Surely I would need keys for trading/selling, right? And yes, I have multiple accounts made for the purpose of trying to get my friends, siblings, and ex-girlfriend into video games as much as I'm into it. Those accounts are all included with the untouched keys I mentioned. Even more I'm mostly inactive with my accounts since I started my 2nd internship on September.


What's even weird is that I can still buy a bundle. Tried it with the new Humble Staff Picks: Scribble bundle and successfully purchased the $1 tier without any problems. But still suspended from the store. (I tried this after with Anomaly Game Collection) I guess it's more or less safe to say that they're mostly concerned with the wallet credit I've earned through referrals? They're probably thinking that I did all those for myself (self-referral). I can say this because they went on a [refund spree](https://i.imgur.com/eoKOjaG.png) shorty after replying to my ticket. [*Email contents*](https://i.imgur.com/MZjQPh7.png)


Just thinking about the chaos-in-wait for those who subscribed through my referral (and got issued a sudden refund) makes me cringe. Because they could possibly have used, gifted (holiday season), or even traded their keys (who knows) after subscribing.


What's making me sad is that they even refunded a monthly purchase I made for my older brother (using his CC). From a new account I made just within the day the January 2018 Monthly Bundle early unlocks were revealed, and after messaging my brother about it and him mentioning that he'd want to try Dawn of War III. Just to clarify, I made that account for that purpose only and because I want a bundle for myself, purchased from my own account. Haven't even touched that new account or logged it in since I bought the bundle and gave the keys to my brother. And yes I did use my referral when subscribing with it. I mean it's a new account and a new subscriber, why not take advantage of it and use my referral?


Another weird thing is that they didn't go all the way with the referral refunds. I still have around $50 wallet credit (that I still can't use).


I just don't know what's going on. I replied to my ticket but they still haven't responded again."
7oksd1,29,2018-01-06,Light at the end of the tunnel [positive rant],tommyhive,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/7oksd1/light_at_the_end_of_the_tunnel_positive_rant/,"Hey guys! I wanted to share an experience I just had that I thought I would never have in my life. I can finally picture myself being skinny, with a flat stomach, no love handles, and no man-boobs. It’s taken about 4 years but I’m really close to being at my goal. 

My goal wasn’t a certain weight or anything, but it was to have a stomach and torso that I wouldn’t mind taking off my shirt in public. A body where I can wear slim fit dress shirts and slim pants (I’m pretty into fashion) with no bulge or massive amounts of sucking in. 

I started after my first year of college, I was never taught how to eat right and was never restricted by my parents (and school, thanks to unlimited pizza and chicken tenders). I was about 250, but most of the fat was in my stomach and chest. I did some initial research and basically cut out bread and pasta, and made sure to eat less crap. I lost some weight but with the more research I did, the more invested I became in it, and that’s when I found keto.

The summer of my sophomore year of college, I went cold turkey into keto and had some bumps. It was really hard with a big family and taking grandparents and relatives out to eat, but I stuck to it. Even if I went off keto for a night, I hopped right back on the next day. That summer, I lost 30 pounds and could fit into large shirts. Still chubby, but my friends at school were super impressed and happy for me.

During school, it was easy and hard at the same time to stick to keto. The weekdays were fine, our dining hall had plenty of food and I only bought keto snacks for my dorm, but the weekends were different. Drinking would usually end up with me being kicked out of ketosis, along with whatever drunk food I ate after a night of going out. I was never discouraged and stayed in the diet during the week, and drank less and less each weekend (and started drinking vodka and diet sodas). I lost 20 pounds that school year.

That summer coming into my senior year was the summer I would be 100% invested. I was about 200 pounds. I had an internship out of state and I lived alone, with only a few cousins about an hour away. I set my macros, set my 5x5 lifting program (definitely consider it if you want to workout while doing keto), and took the challenge head on. I meal prepped for my internship and literally only bought keto friendly food at the store. Nothing in the house could kick me out. I went to the gym every day, doing my 5x5 lifts and doing HIIT, and it got so normal to me that I enjoyed every day of it. It got so easy and it became a routine. This was the summer where I lost 30 pounds, and finally my stomach started to shrink. 

For men, stomach fat is the last to go. But once I finally saw noticeable progress in that area, I knew I couldn’t stop. I’m now one semester away from graduating college and I couldn’t be happier. I fit into slim fit shirts, slim jeans, and I can wear whatever I want confidently. By graduation, I hope for my stomach to be completely flat and where I want it to be, so I can start out in the real world at my 100% best.

So for people that are having a rough go about staying on keto, just keep hopping back on. Immerse yourself in the information and set a goal body figure. Don’t look at the scale every day. Look at your body and know that no matter how many times you cheat or get out of ketosis, you can get right back on. Visual progress is the greatest feeling in the world. Keep going!

Sorry for the long story, I hope some people can find some motivation from it!"

Hi! I'm 23 and I'm currently not speaking to my father. I was raised by a single mom and he came in when it was convenient for him. He has a problem with how I dress, music i listen to, talk, and my passions in life because they aren't ""black"".  My mom raised me with an understanding that it's okay to be different, and I've always been a good kid. Just not his idea of a good kid. He also tends to take credit where credit isn't due for raising me. 

He wasn't there when we needed financial help when I was in high school, he never offered a dime for college, my first car, or when I took a trip abroad. I was recently in a car accident where my vehicle was totaled and he wasn't any help emotionally or financially. One time, when I was around 17 or 18, he took me to make my first bank account and things were ok until I was $-400 + overdraft fees because he had been using my account information, lied about it, and my bank had to show me what was going on. He's constantly chosen his girlfriends/side chicks over me and chooses to have a better father-daughter relationship with his gf's kids than me. I have two siblings that I've only met twice in my life because he chooses to not reach out or see them. 

Throughout college I juggled multiple internships, odd jobs, leadership positions, and was in school full time and he never once acted like he gave a damn. When i first entered college he tried to convince me to not even bother going to college (there was no logical explanation there).  So because of all of this, I didn't feel that he deserved an invitation to my college graduation. I invited just my grandma and my mom because they have been there for me through everything. My mom helped through everything and she and my grandmother surprised me with helping pay for my trip abroad. I didn't need anyone else's there but my two biggest cheerleaders. Also, my grandmother grew up during the Civil Rights movement and made damn sure I took my education very seriously. They've supported me through every internship, job, and life event that has happened so far.

Moving on, I was offered an opportunity to have a fellowship in DC. This was awesome because there are no jobs in my field where I currently live and the struggle has been real. So, I let my dad know about it and he shut me down saying that ""I couldn't afford it and I need to just stay in one place"" and I mentioned that I had a family member up in DC who encouraged me to move out there and he said ""So you'll listen to them, but not your father?!"" He cussed at me and hung up in my face and tried to get my mom to back him up. She shut him down. He ended up getting his wife to text me, (a woman that I've only met once or twice) to try to convince me not to go and putting all these doubts in my head. I finally confronted my dad about it and he told me that he couldn't believe that I was disrespectful to him and that he'd talk to me when he felt like it. 

That was in November. I haven't spoken to him since, but he's called multiple times and I'm just over it. I didn't ask him for money, or anything like that. I don't ask him for anything ever. But not dealing with his bs has made my life so much easier. Do I owe it to him to speak? 



EDIT: Thank you guys for your support. I spoke to my mom as well as my aunt and they both agree that it's up to me to make the final call. I'm not going to speak to him. I don't need that in my life."
7olv0t,6,2018-01-06,23 year-old single college student with a 4 year-old and buried with credit card debt,financethrowaway831,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7olv0t/23_yearold_single_college_student_with_a_4/,"Good afternoon all,

I am posting this on a throwaway because I am rather embarrassed and ashamed about this situation. 

I am currently a full-time college student with a 4 year-old son. I made terrible financial decisions in my earlier years of college which culminated in me accruing ~$2,600 in credit card debt and financing a car that I could not afford (I still owe $16,600 and pay $354/month). I pay $240/month for my son's daycare (his mother pays the other $240). My car insurance is currently $140/month, but I am expecting it to go up to ~$240/month next month because my ex and I will no longer be on the same policy (as per her request). My rent is $625/month with utilities varying between $60-$80/month. 

Up until this point I have heavily relied on family members to help me pay my bills; however, I know that I have been an incredible burden on them and would like to become independent and self-sufficient for their sake, for my sake, and - most importantly - for my son's sake. For the past year I have been weaning myself off of them. In order to do so, though, I stopped paying my credit cards. It has gotten to the point that I currently owe ~$900 in late fees/missed payments (I realize that this was an incredibly asinine thing to do and I whole-heartedly regret my decision). 

I currently have an internship that pays me $1,200/month and I receive $4,700/semester in scholarships and grants (after tuition is paid). Further, a family member is loaning me $5,500 for the year. I do not expect to get much back in taxes because my boss messed up my tax paperwork and they were not taking out any taxes for the first 5 months of 2017 and I will not be claiming my son on my return. My goal is to not have to ask any family members for any assistance (outside of the loan) and finish off my last year of college strong (I graduate in December). 

My primary focus right now is paying off my credit card debt, lowering my car payment (through either refinancing or selling my car and purchasing a cheaper one), and reducing my expenditures. Here are some approaches that I have considered and why I have not gone through with them:

1. Using the lump sum of money I get at the beginning of this semester to pay off my credit card debt. I am not sure if this is a viable option because that would be $2,600 and may leave me short in case of an emergency. 
2. Selling my car back and purchasing a cheaper one. Right now, I am upside-down on my car loan. I still owe about $16,6000, but dealerships were quoting ~$11,000 to trade it in. Plus, my credit is so shot at this point that purchasing a new car (and tacking on close to $6,000 to the price) will put me right back in the same situation. Refinancing would also be a problem because my credit is shot.
3. Taking less classes and picking up a second job. I can't do this because my scholarships and my internship both require me to be a full-time student. If I took less classes, I would lose both of these sources of income. 
4. Picking up a second job regardless. The way my internship, class and research schedules work out, this is impossible because I leave my house at 7 in the morning and am not available until 9 at night. Weekend jobs are not feasible either because I drive down to my hometown (which is 4 hours away) Saturday morning and leave Sunday nights so that I can see my son. 

I am honestly at a complete loss and feel like there is no way out of this cycle. I have zero financial planning and organization education (obviously). Surely there are options that I haven't considered yet or that I am unaware of? Ways to cut spending and save money? "

7on8kf,1,2018-01-06,Internship Dating Advice,millennium2k,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7on8kf/internship_dating_advice/,"So, a little background: I'm a college student, and I have an internship in Chicago this semester (now through May). I only have a couple of friends that go to nearby colleges and one other from my school that's also working about 45 minutes away, so I don't really have any kind of social life here (which isn't a huge deal, I have other things to occupy myself with).


Here's the situation though. The company I'm working with only has three interns this semester (me included). The third starts next week, and I'm kind of interested in the other. She goes to a different college and is one year ahead (though we're both 20 years old).

I was going to add her on facebook after talking to her the second time this past week, but her privacy settings only allow her to send friend requests. I also have no idea if she's single since her profile shows almost nothing, though none of her available pictures have any guys with her. I made sure to leave work around the same time as her on Thursday and talked on the way out for a few minutes. I mentioned I'm new to the area so I'd like to hang out sometime since I don't really know anyone, so I asked for her number and she happily agreed and said she'd like to as well.

So the issue: I texted her that evening, and it turns out she's living at home with her family, and she has plans all weekend with her family. She said after this weekend she'd be free for sure though. Not a total loss right?


So, I basically don't know what to do next. I don't know if she's available, but equally importantly I have no idea if she's interested. My gut tells me no and to not embarrass myself by asking at all, but I'm also really bad at gauging that in general, and she's a really sweet girl and I have almost nobody to talk to or spend time with for the next five months. I'm honestly really lonely, and I have a decent social life at school so I'm not just a perpetually lonely, weird guy. 


Any advice, discussion, etc is definitely appreciated!

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

7onxk0,1,2018-01-06,AI Charlotte undergraduate admission essay,TheMightyMouser,Essays,https://www.reddit.com/r/Essays/comments/7onxk0/ai_charlotte_undergraduate_admission_essay/,"TOPIC: **""What are your career goals and how do you expect your education at The Art Institute of Charlotte to help you attain them? In what ways will you participate and commit to your education in order to be successful?""**

This is the essay I've written, please critique and tell me anything you think would improve it. The word was requirement was 250 words MINIMUM with no max limit.

My overall career goal is to establish and advance myself in a career in animation at a certified and prestigious company that takes pride in what they create. Companies such as Blizzard, Ubisoft, and Valve are all companies that come to mind, as they have developed some of my favorite games with the most enticing stories and stunning visuals. I feel a strong connection and passion for these companies, as I have grown up playing their games and bonding with friends and family while doing so. I want to be a part of the creation of a game that will bring happiness and fulfillment to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of different people. I have an original game concept that has been rattling inside of my head for a while now and I know it has the potential to be a groundbreaking title that can astonish developers from prestigious companies such as the companies mentioned before. Of course, these major goals require taking small steps at a time that slowly work towards the final product. Interestingly enough that is what animation is all about, working on small steps to eventually achieve the final, exceptionally rewarding product. I feel that attending The Art Institute of Charlotte is my next step that I need and desire to take so that I can achieve the reward waiting at the end.

The Art Institute of Charlotte is the perfect place to surround myself with other individuals who share my same passion for art, animation, and video games, both students and professors. These people and this school combine to create an environment that can take a young mind such as mine and give me the knowledge and skills required to breathe life into my ideas and goals. The curriculum is unique due to the fact that almost all of the courses are necessary and beneficial to my future career and is free of time-consuming filler courses that plague most other college schedules. By attending this college, I feel that my time will be put the utmost use by packing it full of knowledge and skills that I will take into the real world and into my future career that will ultimately help me achieve my goals.

Of course, I am not expecting these opportunities to be served to me on a silver platter, I understand that I will need to completely apply myself and put forth all of my effort in order to be successful. Sacrifices will need to be made and time will need to be accommodated for. I am willing to set aside my free time I could be using to play games or talk to my best friends in order to study and practice for class. Education is valuable and I will not waste my opportunity to learn about my blazing passion, therefore my studies and classes will take the top priority. Even outside of the classroom I will continue my education through various ways. For example, I have always been a very self-motivated person when it comes to learning because experiencing new things is what I live for. I love to learn new programs on my own by either teaching myself through experimenting, or finding reliable sources that guide me, whether that source is online or in person. Currently, I am teaching myself all about a program called Blender, which is a free software used for three-dimensional modeling, rigging, lighting, and animation. I am learning so much about core concepts of my future career and having a blast while doing so. Another way I plan to further my education and commit to learning is by applying myself to internships at successful gaming companies. Popular companies such as Blizzard, Hi-Rez Studios, and EA (Electronic Arts) accept college students as interns and teach them about fundamentals of working for a gaming company. By participating in internships, I receive real work experience from successful individuals who are passionate what they do while continuing to learn the most important skills that will help me work towards my career goals. I have always believed that I can only gain benefits equal to the amount of time and effort that I apply, that is why I am excited to challenge myself and commit to my education.

My intense passion for animation and my attitude towards hard work are like a flame that can be kindled into a blazing fire, the kindling being this school. With my goals being so sizable and specific, I desire to be the best prepared I can possibly be for my future, so I do not want to slack on the road to get there. That is why I have turned to the Art Institute of Charlotte. I could not be more excited about my future here!

**CONCERNS**
1) Is paragraph 3 is too long? Paragraph 3 seems slightly lengthy to me, but all of it seems like relevant information. I could break up the paragraph but all of that paragraph is answering the same question of ""In what ways will you participate and commit to your education in order to be successful?""

2) I tried to look more into specifics about extracurricular activities that the school offers as well as the facilities that I could mention, but I couldn't find anything about either of these online. I also tried to be specific with my goals and genuine with my efforts.

3) Do you think I am too direct in answering ""In what ways will you participate and commit to your education in order to be successful?"" mainly at the end of paragraph 3?

Thanks for any feedback!"

7oocxk,1,2018-01-06,How do I overcome my anger/resentment towards my parents?,ActuaryASA,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7oocxk/how_do_i_overcome_my_angerresentment_towards_my/,"I recently turned 32, Indian born and raised in the West, am single and realize that I have a lot of unresolved issues.

I had a repressed upbringing. Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I lived in a perpetual state of fear of my mother. We had a language and communication barrier. I never ever talked to my mom about anything personal – just school and work and current events. She didn’t know any of my friends – I never invited them to our place. She would threaten me if I ever dared to mention girls. Looking back now I realize it was because she was afraid that girls would interfere with my studies – never mind that the vast majority graduate having been in a relationship at some point.

In college, I took an internship out of state and was staying in a hostel. It was the only internship offer I received in my field. My mom asked if was the only student doing an internship at the firm. I lied and said “yes”. The truth was there was one other girl from my school and she was staying at the same hostel one floor above me. Yet I was afraid to reveal this to my mom for fear that she’d lash out angrily and accuse of me of taking this internship illicitly to only be closer to this girl, which was not true at all.

I didn’t have my first kiss until I was 23 and lose my virginity until I was 24. After hitting the gym and improving my style and grooming I began to get more attention. Almost all were casual hookups with no emotion involved. In my late 20s, I used to be proud of these hookups and boast about them, but now I feel kinda lame and loserish for still overcompensating for everything I missed out on during the celibacy of my youth.

It took a long time to overcome my psychological baggage. Even when I was dating, I felt pangs of guilt, like I was doing something dirty and shameful, that I was disobeying and betraying my mom somehow by going behind her back. Even today, I have a hard time with displays of affection or having sex while sober – part of me still feels like it’s wrong, even though I know women desire romance. Which is why I’ve never told my mom anything. To her knowledge, I’ve never had a girlfriend.

Yet the fact that I went dateless all through high school and university still eats away at me, particularly when I look at the relative success I’ve had upon breaking free and “deprogramming” myself. I never got to experience the joys of love with beautiful young girls, when one is youthful and innocent and carefree - no dances, no proms, no corsages. When I saw other desi couples in high school and university holding hands, I always thought to myself “Wow, how can they go against their parents like that? Isn’t that wrong? Don't they feel guilty or afraid? Of course, all of them are married now.

If I'd only had a normal upbringing with supportive parents, I could’ve been plugged into a circle of desi cool kids, had a girlfriend in college, be married by now and maybe my mom would have grandkids today. I know that all this time it wasn’t my looks or my social skills holding me back - it was my “goody two shoes” fear and guilt-ridden mental state, to not make my mom mad or sad.

Two years ago, my mom set me up with a family friend’s daughter. My mom was very adamant and pushy. Because I didn’t want to go against my mother’s wishes, I gave it a sincere try. Unfortunately, after a few months our relationship didn’t work out – I didn't have any real relationship experience and she'd had an ex of 7 years whom she was constantly comparing me to. She wasn’t over him.

When I told my mom this, she said “So what? School love happens.”

It was like a knife through the heart. When my mother said this, I felt betrayed. Here I was, having lived all my life being the good son, avoiding girls because I didn’t want to go against my parents' wishes. I seethed with anger, betrayal, self-loathing and resentment.

This was the turning point of my relationship with my mother. When my mom tried to set me up again, I firmly said no. I stopped caring about pleasing my parents. I was going to do my own thing. It only took 31 years.

Today, even though I have a degree and a professional designation and a career, my relationship with my parents is in shambles. Most times when my mom calls I don’t answer. Earlier this year, I moved out to a penthouse in the same city. I still have not invited my folks to my apartment, despite their insistence. What if she snoops through my stuff and discovers the box of condoms in my nightstand drawer? The prospect mortifies me. I hate confrontation, hate arguing, hate shouting. I've only raised my voice towards my mother a handful of times even though she shouted at me constantly. Most times I would stay silent and not say anything back.

I’ve become withdrawn and detached and shut down. I realize now that this is not healthy as our communication is severely lacking. Perhaps these fights should have happened decades ago, in my teens and early 20s. But I was a timid acquiescent kid who just wanted peace, content with books and chatrooms.

I know deep down my mom wishes I was married and she had grandkids. It would make her happy and good look on her amongst our extended family and friend circle. Yet I lived the first 30 years of my life trying to make my mom happy, forsaking my own happiness and personal fulfillment in the process. She is in her 60s now and truthfully I don't know if she'll ever understand now.

A schaudenfraude side of me wants to wreak vengeance upon my mom. For almost all my life she told me to avoid girls and ""DON'T GO FOR LOVE"", even wagging her finger and intimating to cut my tongue off if I said I loved someone in my teens. And now she is the one with the unmarried, childless son in his 30s. This is her karmic revenge.

Yet a part of me knows that I shouldn’t live my life in my 30s acting rebellious and trying to “get back” at my parents. It’s silly and childish.

Today, I watched The Namesake and wished I had a progressive minded mother whom I could be open with like Kal Penn’s mother in the film.

For the Indians and non-Indians who’ve had a similar repressed upbringing, how did you improve your relationship with your parents?"
7op0r6,1,2018-01-07,What should I know before buying a car? (CANADA),coocoo99,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7op0r6/what_should_i_know_before_buying_a_car_canada/,"Hello,

I'll also be posting this to /r/personalfinancecanada given I'm in Canada, but I thought I'd post here as well to get more opinions/knowledgeable on my issue. All $ is denoted in CAD. 


**Background &amp; Considerations**


I'm a university student in my junior year of undergrad and I received a 4 month summer internship offer (May-Aug). The hope would be to do well and get a full-time return offer upon graduation in 2019. Public transit is not possible given my work hours (work starts at 5-5:30 am which is before buses/trains are operational). My options are to either rent a car for those 4 months, lease a car, buy a car, or rent a place downtown closer to where I'll be working. 
* Renting car from Avis for those 4 months: $3,756 (includes insurance) + $25x120 days (young drivers fee as I'm under 25) = $6,756. Enterprise is slightly cheaper at around $6,500. 
* Leasing a car: Not really compelling given I'm a student and I don't see the need in spending $20,000+ on a new car. 
* Buying a car: I would look for older, used cars (likely at least 4-5 years old). Upon a quick search on autotrader/craigslist, it seems like I can find basic model sedans for up to $10,000. 
* Renting a place downtown for 4 months: Vancouver, BC is expensive. I've looked at a few studios and on average I should expect to pay ~$9,000 in rent. 


**My Current Decision**


Upon weighing my options, renting a place downtown is the most expensive, but the trade-off is that I would be able to walk to/from work in ~30 minutes one-way. However, the ~$9,000 over 4 months only accounts for rent. Including food costs, this could easily go up to $11,000. Another option is to find another summer intern in a similar type of demanding work, where our work hours would be similar, and thus splitting rent that way to be about $4,800 over the 4 months. 


Buying a car would mean longer commute of approximately 30-45 minutes in the morning (no traffic at 4:30 am), but 1+ hr with rush hour at 6 pm. Another concern I have is that given the early start and demanding nature of the internship, I'm not 100% sure if I'm comfortable driving at 4:30 am given I will likely be tired/fatigued. However, at this point, buying a car seems to be the best option (I have enough in my bank account given I have been working for the past few years to buy with cash) and I would not have to worry about food costs as I would be living with my parents. 


**Questions**


* Should I buy a used or certified pre-owned car?
* If it is better to buy used, should I buy from a private seller or a dealer?
* If it is better to buy from a dealer, what are some red flags I should know when talking to salesman?
* What are some reliable brands/models I should look into? I am considering Honda Civics as I've read they are quite reliable and good quality. 
* The person I talked to at Avis said a general rule of thumb is 20,000 km/year is acceptable for mileage. Is that correct? 
* How much mileage is too much for a car?
* What are other considerations I may have missed thinking of (financially, personally, professionally)?
* What are other general rules of thumb when evaluating whether a car is good quality for me to purchase?
* What are some red flags when finding a good car mechanic?


Thanks for taking time to read this long post. I don't really have anyone to ask irl unfortunately. 


**TL;DR** Landed a summer internship and need to decide between buying a used/certified pre-owned car and renting a place downtown. Buying a car seems to be the best option given what I have considered. What are red flags/rules of thumb I should know about before making a car purchase?

I used to never be a drinker more of a pot and acid head. Second half of freshman year I started taking pills a lot and ended up moving to A different school to help escape it and get a change of pace. The next year was one of the hardest I have ever had. I remember drinking a lot when I would visit my brother and when I changed schools I found myself drinking all the time with friends. At first it was ok, I controlled myself and didn’t black out. Fast forward a semester and I fail out of college because I was unable to make it to class with a 0.0. I got back into school and started dating a girl who is definitely an alcoholic and I drink heavily Thursday- Saturday and sometimes Sunday. Every time I would drink with her I wouldn’t black out but I would often brown out. She would be inappropriate with other guys and then gaslight me so we would fight and be all around toxic. We broke up and I got sober for a month and started drinking more moderately after the summer being mostly sober at an internship. Every time I drink lately I go home with someone I wouldn’t normally go home with, do drugs of all types, and am a pile of shit all day the next day. I feel like I don’t have a problem but I know I do. It’s a coping mechanism and I want to be a moderate. I just don’t know if I can, I think I might have to quit for good."

Now I manage a department of creative and tech individuals and carry a reputation of always staying calm and in control.

And though my stuble and muscles still feel nice while and I stil have t pull some dried flora out of my brown hair, I now look for some new things as well. I enjoy the dynamics between 'Man' and 'boy' a lot. From ancient Sparta to modern day. And those between a 'Man' and 'girl' from an older brother to his sister, or that romance between a college and highschool student.

But if you want to play a bit of more rooted fantasy that is fine for me as well. I enjoy all sorts of people. From muscular cases to slender and feminine boys. Or from a girl with a million dollar smile to a shy twig hiding her pridefull butt. As long as I end up with a nice perky ass in the air or a pleading mouth wide open. But we can get to that later.

Some ideas.

-I am a former US soldier who became a legend on the field for some of my work. About eight years ago I fell off the radar, only to show up again as the ruler of my own private army. A small but very specialised group that will be a gun for those who can't wield one. And though hard to trace, you have the 'opportunity' to meet me. Did you run into my towering body by chance during a mission, did you track down my muscular torso to take me down, or did my brown hair, blue eyes and short beard make you feel a need to find me?

-Having a hard time keeping your eyes off that big guy doing his routine in the gym? Or perhaps it's the bulge with too little space even in a wide pair of pants? All so bulking and big and coated in a hint of sweat from the work out, that's me. You noticed me drop in a few weeks back, have never been around before and I leave early in the morning. Step up your routine, wake up more early and wiggle that perky squat ass at me, maybe I will give you a private workout to start your day. Soon enough I might be coming in to replace my presses and cardio with you.

-New at the office and a bit overwhelmed by your internship so far. Don't worry, that is normal. Just give over to the flow of the veterans and find the place you can find yourself most useful, and where you feel you can learn most. This is a shared envoirment after all, one of learning and hard work.

-Let me be the end of your trouble, or the start of a lot more. I generally like trouble makers, brats, fighters, rebbles, those who pick up a fight. Nothing more cute than watching somebody think they are cute while their impulses have taken over. Are you the punk who always causes me trouble at school, or perhaps the gang member who I keep getting called out of bed for while I want to fuck my wife. And am I your pepper haired teacher with a charming smile, or that only officer in the force who looks like he could chase down a guy over miles? No matter who you are, I am authority and you are about to have a run in with me.

-Do you like intense cuddling? The gentle stroke of lips along a neck that soon changes into fingers teasing a tongue as big hands pin down a slender body to the sofa. That moment you drag your body along the wall because the rough feeling is a blessing in contrast to the soft touches of strength holding back to not break something. Where a slap to a rump is followed by a caring cheek peck. I at least do.

-And last but not least at all: Your fandoms. Now come on, how much do I really have to explain here. Do you want to try and take on Batman and see if you can finally get his cock inside you. Or maybe you are more of an archaeologist and want to meet Nathan Drake in a jungle temple? There are a lot of guys that I can imagine you thinking about, tell me who you want to meet and let's see what I can make come true.

Like any of these idea, or do you have anything else in mind that needs a man? I can play a lot of types for you. I am looking for any type of person. Just send a letter and say hi, I am sure we can make something fun happen together.

Signed with a dream of world peace, 
Magna."

I advanced faster then anyone else up the ladder and showed the entire department (so I thought) that my work is unparalleled. When I interviewed I didn’t get the job because I was too old, a junior vs a sophomore. The logic was they manager didn’t want to hire again in a year and a half, although they hired somebody who will surely leave for a coding internship with higher pay in a year. I get some people are short sighted, but I am now capped for the rest of my time at this university, and I am too young to be stagnant for over a year in my eyes. Policy won’t let me change protocols that are inefficient, and I can’t manage other students. How do you guys swallow this sort of scenario because even though I know there isn’t much I can do, and the job allows amazing flexibility as a student, but I hate being tied down."

Recently I've been tracking my net worth almost daily.  


On my spreadsheet, I break down my net worth into different categories so I keep my allocation in mind (the big categories shown on the graph are cash, stocks, cryptocurrencies). It's been very helpful for planning, saving and budgeting and I'd definitely recommend doing something like that. Maybe not daily but at least monthly.  


I started off with little debt because I was extremely lucky to receive a college scholarship. I got debt here and there but I made sure to pay it off very quickly as soon as I earned enough. During college, I worked summer internships during all breaks, worked part-time during school, worked on a few side projects and freelance projects, saved a ton and learned about stocks/crypto.  

I'd appreciate any feedback on how I can improve my finances moving forward now that I am done with college. Enjoy!

7osw23,0,2018-01-07,[Help] I thought I finally found the best guy ever but I think he is falling out of love with me.,IWantToBeAnonymous__,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7osw23/help_i_thought_i_finally_found_the_best_guy_ever/,"I am hoping for some advice, guidance, whatever. I just am in a horrific position and I think he's falling out of love with me and idk what to do or say or to confront him about how I feel or whatever else. I'm not handling this right and I know it.

I know the entire team ""Mr. Right"" / ""best guy ever' is idealistic, and silly. But I think it's the easiest way to convey my feelings about him and this relationship.

For years and years I looked and dated and finally thought I found the right guy. Tall, strong, smart, kind (OR SO I THOUGHT), caring (OR SO I THOUGHT), etc.

I'm almost on the verge of tears when I begin to write this so please forgive me if this is a bit scattered / hard to read. 

We've been dating for many many months now, well over half a year. And it was intense and amazing and great until a few weeks ago. 

Eg: He'd always text me goodmorning cuddles every morning and every night. Without fail. Without. Fail. (Until no goodmorning text today. Thus provoking this post.)

We met up a bajillion times, texted and called lots and it was far from what I'd call ""slow"".

We talked about deep conversations such as some politics, free will, medical, engineering, etc. Yes, even fetishes quite early on. 

**But being frank, the past few weeks has clearly seen a rough patch.**

I am still in university finishing off my 2nd degree, and while I have absolutely saved a large sum of money from my internship the money isn't the issue. I pay my own way, I actually hate when he tries to pay for me as I don't want the dynamic to ever turn that way. 

During the entire semester I prettymuch was really upset about going back to university. I'll cut it short to keep anonymity but I was raped near campus and have PTSD and severe anxiety issues associated with it. And the university actually brings it all back. Being gone for a year and a half internship my mental health and everything else began to improve to the point where I could have a relationship and was comfortable in one.

Basically during final exams I started to have terrible anxiety and crumbled a bit and got nervous. At first he seemed really supportive, but at the same time very distant. And it was for a while so I actually did ask him what was up. He siad he was giving me space so he didn't distract me.

O.K.

Exams ended well before Christmas and he said he'd cuddle me and make me feel better, and to be quite blunt I didn't see him for almost 2 weeks come that point in time. Like, at all. I don't mean just cuddling. Like we didn't meet up or anything. 

He didn't. And then went to spend Christmas with his family. Which I perfectly understand. And I was burnt out from anxiety and PTSD ontop of the normal final exam stressors. (Going back to school after working really fucking sucks.)

So we had 5 days we could have met up and cuddled or anything without ""distracting me"" and nothing.

Honestly I had a bit of a Christmas meltdown and played a video game every day for like 18+ hours and did nothing else because of it. Which is pathetic to say when I should be sending out my resume now but whatever, I did what I did to cope I guess. :/

When he got back he didn't text me to do anything. In fact I didn't even know he was back at all I thought he booked holidays off from work to spend more time with his family. Nope. 

Nada. Nothing. 

I had no idea.

Then he somewhat out of the blue wanted to spend new years eve / new years day with me. 

#Issue alert:

I stressed myself out so bad from the combinations of PTSD and university anxiety and anxiety of not seeing him that I actually was shitting out blood at that point (and went to the hospital 2 days ago now to get it checked). And unfortunately I mean a lot of blood, I was filling the entire bowl with blood and it was even dripping on the floor when I stood up.

PTSD and reliving my shit was in full tilt. 

It was fucking freezing out there and dangerous to drive, period. Flat out dangerous. 

My mother's health worried me greatly.


So what did I do? I told him I couldn't do it and asked if we could try it this weekend. 

His response? He was busy this weekend. And that he was disappointed. 

**We then had a bit of an argument**

He argued I am not ready for a relationship because he thinks I am not ready to move forward and have sex (many months later we still haven't done actual anal, almost everything but that). And truth is I am actually coming close to being ready, once I find out the actual reasons why I am bleeding. &lt;- he doesn't know about this nor do I plan to tell him, I am pretty embarassed about it.

He said he never wants to hear me speak of the university again. All he has is good memories of that place, and I acknowledge many people's best memories are of there. But they are my worst and every day I went onto that hell ridden campus that triggers my PTSD was like reliving and walking back into my nightmares. I envy him for that.

And then that's when I told him of my rape, of all the awful things the university did to me (which I won't list here for anonymity's sake), all the awful things a few of my peers from my first degree did, etc. He said he understood and wanted to support me and it seemed sincere at the time. And he said none of that was my fault (and I've seen enough mental health help that it WASN'T my fault and I know it now).

But with that out in the open, I feel more vulnerable now than ever. I never wanted to tell him, as I feel that all it can cause is pain and grief. And I think that's what is happening now.


**The past week since then...**

I've texted him and he hasn't really responded to many messages I've sent.

Like I'll say I miss him and get nothing in response.

I'll tell him something and get nothing in response.

Sometimes I'll instantly get a response if I send something basic like ""snuggle"".

Then he tells me that this weekend he does want to do something, and honestly I did have an eye appointment booked yesterday. When I told him that I couldn't meet him at a mall (:/ a mall :/) because of that he just didn't reply. Nor did he reply to my joke I made or any concerns I made at that point. 

**So prettymuch right now**

I feel that he's falling out of love with me. I can feel it in my bones unfortunately.

It stresses me out, it makes me feel really unhappy but I can see the truth very clearly at this point: He doesn't love me anymore, or at least he is falling out of love.

No more calls, so many text messages never replied to, haven't seen him in 3 weeks.

Even yesterday I texted him saying I missed him. He said nothing to that. All I got was hours and hours and hours later ""goodnight snuggle"". And that's it.

I am still going to submit this post but I feel like the writing is prettymuch clear on the wall: He doesn't love me anymore. I'm still going to hit that submit button though, but I think I might have reached the conclusion myself.

**Bonus round / points of anxiety and upset:** I remember him telling me he was going to meet up with his ex a few months ago (he outright asked me if it was okay and ofc I said it's okay, I am not a control freak and he could easily have done it behind my back). Whether or not that's a thing right now, I don't know.

It's also sad to say that. 2 years ago I'd be bitter and jealous and probably spit venom at them. 

But, instead of that, right now I just feel this sadness and yet at peace knowing at least he may be happy then. Fuck growing up. :/"
7ot867,85,2018-01-07,"This stuff has gone too far. All this stuff is funny until it impacts someone's ""real life."" STOP IT! These things should never screw with someone's job, family, life, etc.",AliFrazier,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/7ot867/this_stuff_has_gone_too_far_all_this_stuff_is/,"1. In April 1998, Hughes and Cumia were fired from WAAF following their April Fool's Day prank whereby Hughes and Cumia announced that Boston Mayor Thomas Menino had been killed in a car accident in Florida in the company of a Haitian female prostitute. The prank included reports from a fake police officer and news reporter, the latter a friend of Hughes. The stunt and firing received national attention from the press, and many listeners believed the story as Menino was on a flight during the prank, so he was out of contact while the event unfolded. Menino was made aware of the prank upon his arrival and responded with a letter of complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), pointing out the commission's broadcast regulations prohibit the broadcast of knowingly false information if it causes public harm.

2. On August 22, 2002, the show was suspended following its third annual Sex for Sam contest held on August 15 that encouraged listeners to have sex in risky places for prizes while a witness reported from the location. Its name derived from the Boston Beer Company, producer of Samuel Adams beer that sponsored the contest and prize. In the segment, comedian Paul Mecurio, on a cellphone, described Brian Florence and Loretta Harper, a Virginia couple visiting Manhattan, having simulated sex in a vestibule at St. Patrick's Cathedral, several feet away from a Mass service.

3. ""Assault on the Media"" contest (2005)...An outgrowth of O&amp;A's response to the reputed fearmongering mentality of today's American media was the Assault on the Media campaign, whose main premise was not to physically assault anyone, but to pester a live broadcast in some way to promote The Opie and Anthony Show. The campaign's methods typically involved the use of large signs emblazoned with the show's logo, with Pests shouting ""Opie and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio!"", or a show phrase, typically ""O&amp;A Party Rock!"" The initial AOTMs led to coinage of the term ""Pest"", as it was ""the only way to describe [the participants] in a way that really fit"", as co-host Anthony Cumia recounted. Shortly into their tenure at XM, they held Assault on the Media promotions led by the Pests, a group of fans of the show that helped to give the show additional exposure. One such incident took place on May 19, 2005, when show intern Nathaniel disrupted a news report by Arthur Chi'en on live television, making risque gestures while holding an Opie and Anthony sign, which caused Chi'en to shout ""What the fuck is your problem, man?"" on the air. Chi'en made a live apology, but was fired a few hours later. The incident brought the show nationwide press

4. One of the most successful Pest attacks occurred on Jim Philips of The Philips Phile July 2005. Philips attempted to steal and take credit for the Assault on the Media bit and boasted that he had ""the #1 talk show on XM."" O&amp;A responded by calling for an attack on his show. For days, the phonelines to Philips' show were jammed, with the flow of his show noticeably disrupted. Talk of O&amp;A dominated Philips' show for several days as he brazenly attempted to retaliate, poking fun at O&amp;A's names and physical attributes. He even interviewed a fictitious XM executive named ""Derick Foinster"" to echo Philips' claims of success on XM, and to feign a homosexual attraction to ""Mr. Cumia"". Fans of O&amp;A interpreted Philips' response as so arrogant that it motivated them to continue the attack. After several days of constant calls from Pests, Philips started taking fewer calls, and quizzed callers before allowing them to speak, claiming his fans were ""smarter"" than O&amp;A's fans. The quizzing backfired, since the Philips' questions were so difficult that no one, Philips fans or O&amp;A fans alike, could answer them. Philips threatened legal action, saying ""My lawyers are better than yours."" His efforts did not deter the attack, so Philips eventually stopped taking calls, ceased all mention of ""Mr. Hughes"" and ""Mr. Cumia"", and no longer claimed that his talk show was the most successful on XM.

5. Scott Ferrall was a friend of Opie &amp; Anthony at WNEW. He was fired for supporting them after the ""Sex for Sam"" debacle. In February 2006, Ferrall was on Stern's show promoting his own spot on Howard 101 from 8 pm - 11 pm EST. ""The Pests"" soon took over Ferrall's show after receiving reports of him badmouthing Opie and Anthony, and he did his last Sirius show on 2/17/06.

6. On July 31, 2006, Whoopi Goldberg's new radio show ""Wake up with Whoopi"" debuted on KTU-FM in New York opposite O&amp;A's show. The Pests were called in to ""attack"" Whoopi's show. The attack was not prompted by anything Whoopi had said about them, but O&amp;A have expressed disgust in the recent trend of radio stations hiring celebrities to host shows in a form of ""radio stunt casting"", rather than hiring experienced radio personalities. O&amp;A have remarked that the general public perceives radio as an ""easy job"", so they targeted her show to prove to newcomer Whoopi the difficulties of hosting a radio talk show.
At least four Pest calls got though to the show, with Whoopi vowing to ""screen [calls] better."" 

7. Former supermodel and talk show host Tyra Banks became an Opie &amp; Anthony target, often criticizing her for what they deem her self-centered demeanor on her show. When Banks publicly responded to tabloid photos and allegations that she had gained weight, O&amp;A condemned her angry response, suggesting that were it not for her insecurity, she would not have responded so strongly to the paparazzi photos and allegations. O&amp;A challenged their listeners to find ways of getting Tyra's attention in order to ""let her know how we feel."" On February 3, 2007, Pest mainstay No Filter Paul infiltrated the background of SNY's news program, holding up a sign that read ""Tyra is a Big Fat Pig."" Two days later on February 4, 2007, Jewish Monkey of the P.O.W.'s (""Pests Out West"" or ""Pests of the West"") hung a large banner reading ""Opie &amp; Anthony P.O.W.'s, Tyra Banks is a Fatty Pig Fatty"" outside the CBS Television City studio where Banks' show is taped.

8. JOCKTOBER...
It was from 2008-2011, when they really learned how to effectively use social media as a tool for mischief. In the Jocktober of 2008, there were some mentions of sending “pictures of roosters” to email addresses and administrators of the official sites of different stations, as well as the long-standing tradition of listeners bombarding any station mentioned on-air with horrific phone calls.
But soon enough, Opie and Anthony walking into the studio was basically like the pilots in Pacific Rim climbing into those huge robots (ugh). They could get on mic and command their huge social media following to destroy whatever target they pleased. So each day in Jocktober would go like this: they’d announce the name of that day’s show, and then the clock started until “phase 1 is complete,” which means the show was forced to disable posts on their Facebook wall. Then began phase two, where listeners would leave the most vile, disgusting jokes and pictures on the comments of the Facebook wall. That went on until Phase 2 was complete—as in, the entire Facebook page had to be deleted.

9. Anthony once told an elderly, possibly developmentally disabled man named Leonard Rhomberg, celebrating the fact that he worked at McDonalds for 50 years that the company was firing him over the phone, under the guise of an interview celebrating his achievement.

I have tried this prompt a few times with no responses, but I am stubborn! My name is Nick and I was hoping to be seduced by one of the ladies at Roosterteeth (or one of the ladies as a futanari). I have a few kinks, but I am open to almost anything, except anything too extreme (toilet play, snuff, blood, extreme pain, etc.). 

I have a few ideas for how this roleplay could play out:

1) New Intern-Pretty self explanatory. I am a New intern at Roosterteeth and you take a liking to me and decide to seduce me. 

2)At a Convention-You and I happen to run into each other at a convention and you take a liking to me. 

3)Cheating-I am dating someone at the company, and you decide you want me for yourself. 

I'm sure I could think of other ideas but those are the only ones that come to mind right at this moment. If yoy have any ideas, feel free to suggest them!

For this roleplay, I don't have a length requirement, although I do prefer about a paragraph of text. This keeps it moving pretty fast and no one is waiting too long for a response. 

While I am a huge fan of Roosterteeth, I also have a handful of regular celebrites that I would also love to be seduced by, but I can mention them in a PM if you're interested. Pretty much all of the scenes stay the same for more traditional celebs, just with a bit of tweaking, and it'll be easier to think up ideas. 

As for kinks, I have a kinks list!

If you have any questions, feel free to PM me, I'm sure I won't get a ton of responses as this is my first post and it's kinda specific. 

And if you took the time to read all of this, even if it isn't really your thing, thanks!

When I came home from work last summer, I'd sit down, start smoking some weed, play some video games, and eat junk food. I've realized that if I didn't do all of that, I could've spent my nights learning a new programming language, or learn how to code a game. I felt like weed was my source of vitality and happiness. I'd be an advocate for it because since I knew it isn't a dangerous drug, then consuming it should be fine, right?

That's when my NoFap streak has been telling me otherwise. Since I've stopped PMOing for the past 34 days, my neural pathways are slowly rebuilding themselves and I'm starting to feel happy by enjoying the little things in life, and that means being sober. I've realized that I've used weed as an outlet for satisfaction and having fun but I've never truly been satisfied each time. Just last night, I smoked weed with some friends after a period of 2 weeks of working hard for an internship exam so I decided to treat myself out and my god I am having the worst brain fog from it. Now weed brain fog doesn't last as long as PMO brain fog (it usually just stays for 1 day) but a weed brain fog is so much more intense and my mind is barely working right now and I'm regretting what I've done last night.

Don't get me wrong. For some people out there, weed really is the best thing for them and it's helping them solve a lot of the medical difficulties that they're facing but for me, I think I've reached the end of the road with it. I'm planning on selling all my weed-related equipment and stop this forever. I'm starting to find happiness in being sober and maximizing happiness without drug use. This streak really is starting to make me happy. Thanks again, NoFap.

Now let's keep on fighting!"
7ouc7s,6,2018-01-07,Need advice. Any success stories for admission to grad school And figuring out life with a low GPA and basically no work experience?,wayfarer212,LifeImprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeImprovement/comments/7ouc7s/need_advice_any_success_stories_for_admission_to/,"Hi peeps. I’m looking for some advice and it comments. 

I am a first generation graduate of college. About exactly a year ago I finished my undergraduate degree in Financial Economics with a minor in psychology. For really last 2 years or so I’ve been lost and really have not known what to do in life. I traveled a few times alone to see if it it would help, but it hasn’t exactly. I mostly felt worse after I came back from trips because of how much I hated where I was. 

I think I want to go to graduate school and I think I may need to as well. To be truthful I feel a little bit more pushed in this direction because my best friend got into grad school for a Ph.D in hard science. 

I got lost lost even while I was in college. I initially had a burning passion for medicine all through high school and the first 2 years of of undergrad. I took some courses and and realized I wasn’t medicine material. Or rather discovered that I didn’t like biology as much as I thought I did as in high school. So because of some major hopping i felt pressure to declare a major so that my tuition would get paid for I declared a major in Economics. 

My problem: I wasn’t in love with the subject so I didn’t do very well in undergrad. I graduated with about a 2.9 GPA in both my major and overall. I think I want to go to graduate school  but I feel like I’ve fallen short while knowing I was falling short. I don’t have any job experience in that industry (internship; they always made me cringe) and I neglected my internship because of some mental health issues I was having because I didn’t know what to do in life etc. some anxiety, some depression and lots of overthinking. I did get a few interviews, but I didn’t land one and so I didn’t apply again after that to any. 

So because of this I already know I’m not a such a strong candidate. And I’m only getting older. For all of 2017 I was working jobs that I had during college just to get by a little. 

What should I do now to get in and figure out life? What are some of your success stories?

So for some background I’m currently enrolled in community college and have just started college so this Monday will be the start of my second college semester. I’m planning on working over the summer time and then going back for the fall and winter/spring semesters. After that I’m planning on transferring to a 4 year college. I am right now taking the classes that the 4 year college has planned out that would put me on the right path to get my degree  and would give me a bit of a heads start when I get there. I’m currently trying to become a CPA. 


Alright enough of the backstory ( if it’s to vague just let me know and I can go deeper in depth). So here are some of my questions: 

How long does it usually take in order to get my degree and become a CPA?

Are their internships that I could possibly get? Whether it be paid or unpaid. Currently hate my part time job that I’m already doing that will turn to full time in the summer. ( this is my biggest question) 

How much debt will I end up being in at the end of my time in college if I follow the same path that I am right now?

What are the kind of math classes that I need to take? Is it advanced math or a lower level?

What is the biggest difference between being a CPA and not being one? 

And lastly does it matter if the college I go to is known to be a good or bad college when it comes to the job field? 

That should be the last questions that I have. If there is anymore that I can come up with later on I’ll add it on later. Sorry if this post is super long.

7ov1d8,19,2018-01-07,Why merder was the worst. [Spoilers],kwickedbonesc,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/7ov1d8/why_merder_was_the_worst_spoilers/,"Literally from the beginning Meredith and Derek was like otp. I remember rooting for Derek to pick Meredith and then Meredith to pick Derek. and like Callie “GO MERDER” but then Derek died and I binge watch and go over and think. Merder was the worst. 

Literally secrets everywhere. From the very beginning there was secrets. Meredith is all like “ oh my mother is travelling” and Derek is like “oh I’m not cheating on my wife”. And then Meredith while they were friends wouldn’t tell Derek about sleeping with George. And then Derek with the kiss and the intern. Literally secrets everywhere. 

The age difference. More specifically resident attending relationships. Now I know it’s not like slexie ginormous but seriously (at least slexie respected each other in the OR and at work) they let work get in the way of they’re relationship. From Bailey and Derek not getting Chief. To Meredith ducking up the Altheimers trial. And Meredith outright defying Derek in the OR and consequencely Meredith not doing something she’s trained for years for. Now it’s a lot better once Meredith is an attending. 

Trust issues. Oh my god trust. Thanks to Meredith’s F’d up child hood she has a hard time trusting Derek. And why wouldn’t she when Derek is willing to push her aside until later when he’s done with Addison and rose. Plus Derek not trusting her in the OR because he sees her as childish. 

They literally argue like crazy. It’s one after another after another. And they can never agree with each other. 

And seriously Derek your moving to Washington DC and not being with your two kids and wife? 

And after Derek left Meredith flourished. In her career. Cristina was ultimately right about him holding her back. Like he tried to set back Richard and get his job and trying to steal back Amelia’s chief of neuro. 

Merder sucks. Go slexie. "

This is kinda long...sorry.


Hi! I'm 23 and I'm currently not speaking to my father. I was raised by a single mom and he came in when it was convenient for him. He has a problem with how I dress, music i listen to, talk, and my passions in life because they aren't ""black"".  My mom raised me with an understanding that it's okay to be different, and I've always been a good kid. Just not his idea of a good kid. He also tends to take credit where credit isn't due for raising me. 

He wasn't there when we needed financial help when I was in high school, he never offered a dime for college, my first car, or when I took a trip abroad. I was recently in a car accident where my vehicle was totaled and he wasn't any help emotionally or financially. One time, when I was around 17 or 18, he took me to make my first bank account and things were ok until I was $-400 + overdraft fees because he had been using my account information, lied about it, and my bank had to show me what was going on. He's constantly chosen his girlfriends/side chicks over me and chooses to have a better father-daughter relationship with his gf's kids than me. I have two siblings that I've only met twice in my life because he chooses to not reach out or see them. 

Throughout college I juggled multiple internships, odd jobs, leadership positions, and was in school full time and he never once acted like he gave a damn. When i first entered college he tried to convince me to not even bother going to college (there was no logical explanation there).  So because of all of this, I didn't feel that he deserved an invitation to my college graduation. I invited just my grandma and my mom because they have been there for me through everything. My mom helped through everything and she and my grandmother surprised me with helping pay for my trip abroad. I didn't need anyone else's there but my two biggest cheerleaders. Also, my grandmother grew up during the Civil Rights movement and made damn sure I took my education very seriously. They've supported me through every internship, job, and life event that has happened so far.

Moving on, I was offered an opportunity to have a fellowship in DC. This was awesome because there are no jobs in my field where I currently live and the struggle has been real. So, I let my dad know about it and he shut me down saying that ""I couldn't afford it and I need to just stay in one place"" and I mentioned that I had a family member up in DC who encouraged me to move out there and he said ""So you'll listen to them, but not your father?!"" He cussed at me and hung up in my face and tried to get my mom to back him up. She shut him down. He ended up getting his wife to text me, (a woman that I've only met once or twice) to try to convince me not to go and putting all these doubts in my head. I finally confronted my dad about it and he told me that he couldn't believe that I was disrespectful to him and that he'd talk to me when he felt like it. 

That was in November. I haven't spoken to him since, but he's called multiple times and I'm just over it. I didn't ask him for money, or anything like that. I don't ask him for anything ever. But not dealing with his bs has made my life so much easier. Do I owe it to him to talk?"
7ovosj,22,2018-01-07,Getting involved.,SloanH189,RaiBlocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7ovosj/getting_involved/,"Hello everyone, so I’m a former Marine which is where I got involved in tech.  I’m now a computer science student and have been trying to get some real world experience with software engineering.  XRB was the first alt I decided to get into and I have fallen in love with the community. The question I have is would the team accept an intern? I don’t want any compensation, I just want to help out any way that I can and get some good experience while doing so.  If there’s anyone out there that could point me in the right direction I’d greatly appreciate it and if they aren’t accepting that’s fine, just wondering if there’s anything I can do to help with a project that I believe in.

7ovwey,3,2018-01-07,[advice] What are behaviours of narcissists? Is my mother one of them?,_thedailymail,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7ovwey/advice_what_are_behaviours_of_narcissists_is_my/,"My mother and I used to have a strong relationship when I was younger. Back then she was good at caring for me, like picking out my clothes for school or making sure I had food to eat. A lot of her care for us had to do with her past, she was raised in a large family that was very poor, so she prides herself in the things she's achieved (and rightfully so). She's told me she never wanted me to deal with the issues she's had so I've always more than enough in regard to necessities. 

These past few years as I've grown older my mom has been a lot more difficult to deal with. Once I was accepted to a prestigious school overseas, she was quick to praise me for my efforts, often saying, ""You got that from me. I'm a hard worker so that's why you work hard."" When I took a year off from school due to personal reasons, she cut me off and refused to speak to me for months. She'd say things like, ""You're pathetic. You're weak. You can't even get through school."" At times, she tells me that without her I would have nothing, and she can take away my opportunities if I don't follow through with her demands. 

I noticed now that if I do well, my mother is very happy to express how great I am to all her friends and our family. Doing well in regards to staying in school, getting a job or internship, etc. In cases of emotional distress, mild inconveniences caused by me, or seeing someone else (like a friend of mine) doing better than me, she is quick to insult me. Both my dad and stepdad have said that's just the way she is and I'd have to deal with it. 

Recently, I've been trying to avoid conflict with her altogether. If there's an issue with me I tend to reach out to other people before going to her for help. Today, when I missed my flight to go back to school, she yelled at me at the airport saying I was selfish, irresponsible, and unhelpful (this was in front of quite a few people, since the airport was packed). When we got home, she called me downstairs because she ""wasn't finished with me yet"" and continued to yell at me, repeating what she said at the airport. Usually I would try to argue back, but this time I told her that if she was going to yell, I was going to walk upstairs and wait for her to calm down. I also said a more productive conversation could happen if we took the night off, and revisited the issue the next day. This only made her anger intensify, and she continued to insult me as I went back to my room. 

I'm trying to be understanding of her. I know she has dealt with a lot in her past that makes her difficult to deal with sometimes. She has cared for me in many ways. If I'm sick she makes sure I have food and water when I'm in bed. She buys me things that I need (though I feel nervous when she does this because she tends to use this genorosity against me if I don't do what she wants). In most cases, if I have a problem in a relationship I try to address the deeper issues that causes that friction. Maybe I'm just overanalyzing this all. 

I hope this doesn't sound like I'm complaining. I have read stories on here and understand that I could have it much worse, but I'm wondering if anyone has a similar situation here. Can a narcissist be caring in some ways and not in others? Or is this just an issue of our being raised differently? I just want to understand if there are ways to improve this relationship, and if not, I want to stop stressing over something I cannot fix."
7ovzhf,4,2018-01-07,How the hell did any of you get internships?,fatmonkeyz,NJTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/NJTech/comments/7ovzhf/how_the_hell_did_any_of_you_get_internships/,"I am a sophomore majoring in IT. I am looking for summer IT internships. I have applied to 25 internships so far. Some were in NJ and some were in Seattle, WA (as long as the Seattle companies give free housing, since my parents would not want to pay for housing). Some companies like Microsoft gives free housing there. I applied to random companies in NJ and some of the major companies in Seattle. I got rejected from a couple of companies in NJ and Amazon and Boeing. Not surprised, those companies are so competitive anyways and I have no internship experiences anyways. Not expecting an internship in a decent company.

I have no IT job/internship experience and I maybe have one real life connection but that's it. I have only two job experiences on my resume, which are both retail jobs. I have created a LinkedIn and Indeed account. I never got called for any internship interview. I only got the rejections through email.

Biggest mistake I made was not submitting cover letters, but recently, I started doing that.

I've attended one networking event so far on campus, but I really need to attend the career fair. It seems like most college students in any school easily get internships by career fair networking or even general networking."
7ow5ph,1,2018-01-07,Newbie Question - ~725 score but concerned with rejection due to other factors,baddad25,CreditCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/7ow5ph/newbie_question_725_score_but_concerned_with/,"Hi everyone,

I'd like to get a new card. I'm looking at the Chase freedom unlimited because of the cash back rewards. I'm wondering if there's anything else that financial institutions will take into account above strictly my score. E.g., when they do a pull, will they see info that would make them not approve me for a card my score would theoretically qualify me for?

Restating from the title, I have approximately a 725 score. Info taken from credit karma, my credit union's monthly soft pulls, and mint. Credit history is since June 2016 so 1.5 years. I'm 20 years old in university, only debt outstanding is a $800 loan (effectively no interest is paid on this - the money is actually sitting in a high yield account currently. solely for credit building purposes).

My concerns are my age, short credit history, the fact that I'm a college student, and most of the time I have relatively low income. I'll be applying for this card after I start my internship this week, which will pay me ~$25k gross in the next 4 months. "
7owysc,1,2018-01-08,Moving with Anxiety [F/25],Crystalkat12345,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7owysc/moving_with_anxiety_f25/,"I am from Perth Western Australia and I want to move states to Melbourne for a job. 
I have been searching for jobs in Perth for a while now after I finished my degree and I haven't been able to land a position in the field I studied. I applied for a job in Melbourne out of curiousity to see if I would get hired and I was told that I would get the position, so I'm giving myself a year to save money and get ready to move.
I really need this job, it's good money, good experience in the field, and I think the move will be good for me to give me some independence and do something different with my life,
but I am scared to move. 

About 9 months ago I tried to move to America for 6 months for an internship. Before this I wouldn't have considered myself someone who had a diagnosed anxiety disorder, just someone who was maybe a bit more anxious than the average person, but in trying to move to America i suffered panic attacks, and constant 24/7 extreme heightened anxiety (for the first time in my life) where I wasn't eating or sleeping. I flew home after about a week of this and went to the hospital as an out patient to get treatment.

I am ALOT better now, and I understand that moving to a country that is on the other side of the world is different to the state over, but after all this I am questioning my ability to move states.
I lost a big chunk of my life after coming back from America. I had a proper mental break down and it did take me a good 6 months to get back on the horse again after that.

I am really scared that I am going to go through the panic attacks all over again, the not sleeping or eating again, that I am not going to be good at my new job particularly now since anxiety has now become an issue for me, or just not having my support system is going to make me crumble, but there's basically no work for me here unless I go back to uni.

Has any one else with anxiety ever moved away from their home before and have any advice for me?. "
7ox4w5,170,2018-01-08,I [24f] am concerned about the future with my unemployed/starving artist boyfriend [28m],whoknowsisuredont,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ox4w5/i_24f_am_concerned_about_the_future_with_my/,"We've been dating almost three years. I'll call him Patrick. 
 
When we met he was finishing law school and I was finishing my associate's. We clicked instantly. We came from pretty different backgrounds, his parents being wealthy enough to support him through aforementioned law school education and beyond where my parents are working class and haven't supported me in years. Nonetheless we seemed perfect for each other and quickly moved in together. 

I got a decent job not long after finishing school. It's not thrilling or something I'm in love with but it pays the bills and has allowed me to save and upgrade my lifestyle. But despite my boyfriend having a lot more education than me, he has been unable to find work. It's been about two years since he finished. I don't support him, but his parents do. The field he wants to go into is pretty narrow, so he submits one or two job applications per month. He's gotten a lot of interviews but has never made it passed the first round in any of them. 

Patrick is the only person I've known who has so much support to live like this, and I'd be lying if I said I weren't a little judgemental about it. While waiting to hear back on applications, he writes a lot and takes it very seriously. He's even seen some royalty checks, but not enough to pay rent in any realistic world. While I've always found it super impressive and I'm proud he's such a good writer (it's one of the reasons I fell for him), I'm also jealous. He has a lot of freedom to be an artist where my time is taken up by an office job. Although we share a life we have very different restrictions. 

I know he feels bad about it. He doesn't ask his parents for anything, he hardly buys himself anything except what's necessary, he's very down-to-earth about managing money. And do you know about that ""emotional labor"" stuff that women usually have to deal with? I don't have any of that. He does chores I don't want to do, even if the mess was my fault. He drives me places (his parents pay for the car, but still). If I want to hole up in the office and not talk to anyone all day, fine. I'm notoriously bad about losing things, and he's always speeding up my morning routine helping me find whatever I misplaced, making sure I have lunch. In a lot of ways I'm really lucky! 

But it feels like compensating. Most people don't even have the option to be unemployed for that long in their lives. He's 28 and the closest thing he has had to a job was an unpaid internship. And I hate that the burden of financial security falls on my shoulders alone. He is a perfectly capable, intelligent man. He doesn't even drink or smoke weed. He's not unreasonably lazy. He regulates his time very well to meet writing goals. But he's older than me, has never had a real job before, has had a lot of opportunities I could have never dreamed of, and is still fully supported by his parents. I'm getting a bit resentful but I'm not even sure if I should be because of all he does for me while expecting almost nothing in return.

Additionally, it's getting to the point where I have funds to travel overseas but he doesn't. His family is rich but he's not entitled. And I'm not making enough to pay for him come with me. I'm not even sure if I would even if I could afford it. 

And yes I have explained all this to him, once very emotionally and tearfully and then again later in a more logical way. But I'm not going to browbeat him with it or grill him about how to do an interview, since he should be very capable of doing this himself. But somehow, despite all his good qualities, not even my company wanted to hire him. :-/ 


So many stories here of unemployed/not trying spouses paint the spouse in such a negative light that the most sensible answer is usually ""break up"" but I'm really not sure in this case. He doesn't mooch off of me, he clearly DOES try in several ways, it's just that I'm resentful because our lifestyles are so different. I know I won't be happy if things stay the same way, but I'm not sure how many chances to give him. I'm not even sure if I'm not just being unreasonable. 

Any insight/advice will be appreciated.

7oxg1t,12,2018-01-08,Bahraini citizen who can't bring his wife to the country (Advice please),TheOathbringer,Bahrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bahrain/comments/7oxg1t/bahraini_citizen_who_cant_bring_his_wife_to_the/,"Hello everyone, 

I'm going to first write out the details of my situation followed with a TL;DR for all the lazy folk. Oh, and this is my first post so please have mercy on my soul. 

I'm a Bahraini who lived most of his life abroad (UAE and a bit in the UK) and just came back to the country due to personal reasons. Last year after getting permission from Bahrain court, I got officially married in the UAE to my wife who is of Iranian nationality. I got the UAE marriage certificate and officially certified it in Bahrain and got the equivalent certificate here. 

Now whenever I try to apply for her visa, it gets rejected. After multiple applications got rejected, trying to talk to people in higher positions, writing letters to the authorized personnel the visa staff mentioned, and other means, I have finally given up. Whenever I ask the reason they just tell me we can't tell you or just apply again or say something like the country's security or administration rejected it ( once they even said it's because I didn't attach a letter of having a job and being insured, even though I did...). In the more recent applications they just immediately reject it. In other words, stop trying, we are not going to accept it.

Just for some background information, I personally don't have any criminal records nor does anyone from my immediate family; heck, I don't even have traffic fines since I barely lived here. My wife was BORN and lived her whole life in the UAE, so there is no relation to Iran other than having the passport. In other words, it's all politics...And yes, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's in this spot, just one speck of the many in my situation...

Anyway, now that I've been officially stripped down of my rights (at least what I feel are my rights), I'm doing what every dignified broken man should do: complain on the internet.


**Moving on to relative facts about us and things we are willing to pursue:**


1) We are both in our 20s and are well educated. I'm a MSc holder in genetics from a UK university and she has just completed her dentistry degree and currently doing her internship in UAE. However we are recent graduates, therefore we don't have much experience in our fields.

2) We are willing to migrate to a different country. Anything away from the Middle East is an option...The further the better (I hear Canada is a good option). 

3) Contrary to popular belief, when you marry an Iranian, you do not, I repeat, DO NOT marry or support the whole country of Iran. 

-I do not care or support any of their political and religious point of views. I don't give a damn about any Shah or what the hell that is nor do I care about who is ayatollah or what it means. 

-I do not listen to Iranian music or their radio nor do I understand a single word they say other than ""B'farma"" which, I think, means come eat because that's what my mother-in-law says before every delicious meal.

-I actually haven't EVER been to Iran until very recently. After many month of her visa being rejected my family just really wanted to meet her family. I can safely say the country is fine...Except for the currency, it's a pain in the ass. 



**Things we are NOT willing to do:**


1) Wait and hope our countries become BFF's.


2) Get children. We are way too young and our priorities still involve, video games, who shot first, I say Han...Oh, and like, living together in a country that accepts our unholy matrimony. 


3) Start a revolution. I hear that is a definite no-no nowadays. 


4) Move to Iran. The currency still haunts me to this day, I can never accept a 560,000 bill from a burger joint.  


So, people of Bahrain, after my many years of being away in lands that consider me ""foreign"" I haven't received the warmest welcome to coming back to the land that I should consider home. Gotta admit, It doesn't feel good but I've accepted it. Any advice? What are my options that don't involve waiting and ""hoping""...The time of patience is over, now is the time of action. 

I welcome all options and discussions, thank you.

**TL;DR**

I'm a Bahraini who can't manage to get his wife (Iranian) a visa to Bahrain. What are my options?  Thanks!

7oxgjh,2,2018-01-08,I'm Unsure Of What To Do With My BF,Drikkink,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/7oxgjh/im_unsure_of_what_to_do_with_my_bf/,"So I'm a college student in RI. In 2016 I was on internship in Florida and I met my BF online in September. I was busy working a lot, but he would come down by train (he lived over an hour away and neither of us drove) every week for my day(s) off. In May last year I decided I needed to come back to RI and finish my degree. He came with me because he had nothing really keeping him there.

At this point, I know I made mistakes financially. I barely had enough money to afford the move up north, let alone rent. He had no job and made money selling plasma, which you cannot do up here. He is 27 (28 now). With some help from my family we got settled (though our first place we were living with insane people and feared for our safety and had to move out in a week).

We moved up here in June. I worked full time from the start while he looked for a job. I wasn't home much so I'm not sure how hard he looked, but he didn't get a job until *October*. I started to get fed up long before then about his lack of contribution but felt guilty that he uprooted to be with me.

Our last lease just ended so I decided I needed to live closer to my campus and he needed to live closer to work so as of this week we will no longer live together. The thing is, I care about him a lot, but I just don't get our relationship anymore.

When we met, we spent a ton of time together, doing things, watching movies, etc. We also had a ton of sex (though he has never made me cum once). I was so busy trying to pay rent singlehandedly that I had no time for him and he stopped really trying to do anything with me.

Part of me wants to move on because he has proven to be irresponsible and unmotivated since getting up here but the other part wants to stay with him and see if he grows up on his own, without me supporting him."

7oxmkj,2218,2018-01-08,If you are 40+ you can recall a time when Oprah had the number one show on TV. You can also remember that all of a sudden she was completely irrelevant and disappeared.,average_user_421,The_Donald,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7oxmkj/if_you_are_40_you_can_recall_a_time_when_oprah/,"Long story short our moms, who made her show number 1 for more than a decade, figured out during the Clinton impeachment that Oprah didn't care about women. Oprah was part of the grand media defense that demonized the women Bill Clinton was accused of raping and otherwise engaging in extramarital fornication with.

If you want a lesson in fake news go back and read newspaper headlines and watch TV reports about the Clinton impeachment. Also look up and watch stand up comedy routines from the time, start with Chris Rock. It's all about the ""Clinton sex scandal"" or about sex sex sex in one way or another. 

Bill Clinton was impeached on perjury charges. Bill Clinton was impeached because while under oath he lied about having an affair with an intern. There is video evidence of both the act of perjury he committed and the admission of it. But somehow it became about sex.

In context of why this was a big deal it was just a few years prior that Clarence Thomas was publicly whipped during his senate confirmation on accusations of sexual harassment. He asked a female coworker out on a date once, Anita Hill, and Joe Biden managed to get this woman to go on camera and accuse Thomas of harassing her. I believe Oprah had her on her show as well.

This is one of the reasons I have maintained that the Clinton presidency was the most destructive in US history. When the impeachment failed to remove Clinton from office a new precedent was set, namely that perjury is not an impeachable offense. The chances of any president ever being removed, or even seriously considered under articles of impeachment,  for directly lying to us are nil. See Bush and Obama presidencies for proof.

Back to the point, mom's across the country looked at Oprah Winfrey very differently after that. Here was the most powerful man on earth engaging in what at the most basic level is sexual harassment. Even if the young girl consented to it for most of the decade people like Oprah had been telling women when an imbalance of power existed it was inherently wrong. It was wrong for your boss to ask you out, slap your butt, or comment on your appearance simply because it was someone who had power over your job position. But, all of a sudden it was okay for your boss to shove cigars up your twat for fun if you were president. 

If you look at the ratings you will see a sharp decline in Oprah viewers post Clinton impeachment. Suddenly mom's looked at Oprah and understood she was just one more pandering magazine and was out of touch with what they experienced in life. A great many of them just stopped believing anything she said. I can remember a few mom's even saying ""She doesn't even have children how can she possibly understand us."""
7oy1p0,0,2018-01-08,Guide for noobs (Serious),seriousthrow1,edmproduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/7oy1p0/guide_for_noobs_serious/,"1. In reality, you can't be a very serious producer and a touring dj.
Proof: (Philip lawrence, Rick Nowels, Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, none of them are touring.)

2. Copy YOUR favorite songs perfectly, NOW!
All the rhythm, all the harmony, all the melody, perfectly.
(My song recommendations (but these are not my favorite, I just picked some for this educational purposes) ""A-ha=take on me"", ""The way it is=Bruce Hornsby"", ""Patti page=old cape cod"", ""Haddaway-Rock My Heart"".

3. Have you seen all the videos on ""fact magazine -against the clock""?
Some of them go past making the chorus part with chords but they can't write a different chord progression for, say, pre-chorus, verse or break-down1, alternative section. They're stuck.
*NOTICE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE SONGS' SINGER'S MELODIES ARE LIMITED/RESTRICTIVE. (THINK ABOUT WHY IT HAS TO BE RESTRICTIVE, MAYBE JUST USING 6TH,4TH,1ST AND 2ND DEGREE OF THE SCALE/CHORDS, WHY IS IT NOT USING THE 3RD?. IT'S NOT JUST FOR SAVING THOSE 3RD OR 5TH NOTES FOR A 2ND VERSE OR SOMETHING, SOMETIMES, PRODUCER HAS TO KEEP THE NOTES RESTRICTIVE BECAUSE HE WANTS THE WHOLE SONG TO SOUND THAT WAY. USING THOSE 3RD OR 5TH WOULD MAKE IT FEEL DIFFERENT.)
(THIS IS MY ANOTHER TIP*, THE SINGER MELODY DOESN'T HAVE TO RESOLVE. MAYBE IT CAN STAY AT 6TH. AND THE BACKGROUND INSTRUMENTATION CAN RESOLVE IT FOR THAT BAR.)


4. 
Song-writer/arranger's (maybe if the person is capable)job is to make the demos like these.  https://youtu.be/ylo6qCqcQ3U
https://youtu.be/jeh-IlRi2p4
(Arranger seriously helped the ""take me home,phil collins"" case, notice the arpeggio melodies are better chosen. let's not even get into how much help this particular 80s mixer provided for this song) 

5. So what is a producer's job?
(Let's take police-everything she does is magic (demo version) for this discussion). 
Who ever did this demo version, I believe this person didn't need another arranger. basically all the background harmony are rhythmically in the right place. (bass note did not change at all between demo and the final product)
Producer's job is to pick right/cool sound for the time being2019, sound for each instruments. And, pick the sounds that would make mixer's job easy. The real main task would be choosing a combination of sounds that really delivers this song. (but producer has to know what kind of harmony the song writter/arranger wants. for example, the producer has 3 oscs for a unison, all the right harmony/volume level has to be dialed-in correctly. The producer has to KNOW this just like songwriter/arranger.)
* ""Any producers/mixer who does not understand what is a right volume for bass and alto, is not good. How could you mix if you don't know which note you should give a priority to as a mixer?

6. Notice these two demo. I think they did a wonderful job, the demo sounds already amazing. (One way to tell if the song is amazing or not is if you have never heard anything like this from local bands (if major cities) from your city.
Both songs follow a very generic chord progression (Or, bass progression, but WHY ARE THEY UNIQUE AND INTERESTING ALL THRU OUT THE SONGS. The magic is in the choices of voicing, and choice of restrictive notes/harmony's/melody that the songwriter/producer decided to keep/use.)

7. Intern at ANY RECORDING STUDIOS or any MASTERING studio (total shit or world-class). learn how to record in a bad-sounding room (and make the best out of it). get yelled at, yell at people who act sloppy, always try to maintain good people relationship.

8. About being stuck in a 4 bar loop.
Remember you are stuck because YOUR WHOLE BRAIN is telling you that THAT is the next chord you should go. (My first advice is, maybe, find songs that have similar chord structure as yours, see what they did for verse, pre-chorus, special alternative part) (My Second advice is have the arpeggio of your desired scale being played, that would help/force you to find a new chord progression after the-4-bar-you-are-stuck.)
(My last advice here is that if you STILL can't go past 4 bar chord progression and you WANT to go past this, find more musics with this chord progressions, and compare all of them (it is time-consuming but that is easiest way, once you know how the other songs did, you will have a few to choose from, write it down somewhere) 

*MY ANOTHER TIP: THE CONVENTIONAL SING'ER MELODIES USUALY DO NOT JUMP MORE THAN A MAJOR3 (in the same bar OR between-verse-and-chorus,-pre chorus). The reason why is a step above is a 4th. that really is a big jump, and 4th is VERY noticeable, *But there still are great songs with even a bigger jump) *EDIT// IN EDM, it does jump more than that. 

9. VST synth don't need servicing like physical vintage synths. but sometimes, old VST synths don't get supported anymore. so you can't use them anymore.

10. Using a compressed-sounding kick(?), now your vocal, bass has to be somewhat equally compressed to compensate.
(Why don't you start with uncompressed/no effects added sample in the first place, and do it from there. Does the kick/sanre sound already great? it must be taking a lot of space in your mix already. more headaches on you!)


11. BUY dx7, prophet 08 desktop (Remember prophet 12 is much easier to navigate, however I have my reason to believe both prophet 08 and prophet 12 will be more expensive soon. but prophet 08 will have a better retaining value soon (right now, it seems like prophet 12 will have a better retaining value. but wait a bit, prophet 08 desktop will probably go for &lt;$1500 in 4 years.)

12. something cool. https://youtu.be/cYRCIcnGnbc. but don't get it. you can do it inside the computer. it just takes more time.

*Email to Bill.Exe (Prologue 1)*: After some shenanigans and adventures, our initial cast: Trollkitten/Eureka (human), Lord_Bill.Exe (A.I.), Bane_of_Bill.exe (A.I.), and Gadzooks (Voice), all receive threatening messages from someone only known as G (???). Shortly after these ominous messages, the party is knocked out one by one and find themselves on a fast-moving boat headed somewhere…


*Last Boat to Hoenn (Prologue 2)*: The party has no idea how boats work.  Also shipping while shipping. Zooks is also now an Unown and Exxy is possibly human.


*On the ~~Life~~ Death Boat (Prologue 3)*: Boats continue to be a thing no one really understands. Luckily when it looks like our heroes are going to die before we reach the first proper chapter, Agent 006 (Bibarel) of the IP arrives to hold off the Sharpedo and get everyone to shore.


*On the Mysterious Shore (Chapter 1)*: Instead of Hoenn as intended, the party has ended up in the mysterious Draysten region, which Exxy remembers Bill having visited at some point. G hints that he has the power to bring down the Fossil Pantheon’s (specifically Dome and Amber) wrath on the party, but is unclear how accurate this is. The exhausted party makes it to a Pokemon Center.


*At the Pokemon Center (Chapter 2)*: Major Monferno (???), Eureka’s “boss” contacts with the party along with his intern Karl (Karrablast) and offers assistance as tech support. The party resolves to catch an Abra to use as an emergency getaway.


*The Next Morning (Chapter 3)*: Zooks, who has been severed from the Voice Hivemind is suddenly contacted by another Voice (Bytemite) whom only she can hear. Major tries to wire money to Trollkitten but it’s intercepted by G and directed to Gengar Corp, a Draysten region version of Silph Corp. G also sends the party a Gabite for unknown reasons.


*An Unexpected Gift (Chapter 4)*: It turns out that G has rigged the Gabite to die slowly and painfully, it runs off and the part chase it to try and save it and also because Gabite scales are useful medicinal items. The party manages to save Gabite but run into an ambush in the process. Exxy is short and mortally wounded, and the man who did the shooting claims that Trollkitten/Eureka is a wanted woman. Shenanigans occur, Eureka manages to barely escape on an Arcanine from the Pokemon Center.

	Byte disguises themselves as Ghost Pokemon and starts playing various pranks.



*Separated Friends (Chapter 5)*: Gabite de-evolves into Gible. Forms a Parental Bond with Zooks, gets named Landshark officially. The man from the previous chapter is able to track down Eureka. She is shot and her fate seems in jeopardy. G claims she’s dead, but then has anything he’s said been reliable?


*The Shot Heard Round the World (Chapter 6)*:  The party receives and reacts to the news that Eureka is seemingly dead. But there is little time for mourning as bombs have been planted in the Pokemon Center where they are staying and they need to get out alive. As the PCs flee the hospital, they encounter the cops and an irate Gengar Corp employee waiting for them outside.


Elsewhere, it turns out that Eureka is very much alive and that her mysterious rescuer shot his brother to save her. Also, he’s from the future and claims to be friends with Eureka’s daughter (named Alice).


*Judgement Day (Chapter 7)*: Various timey wimey things. This particular chapter contains “sensitive” material so I’ll just leave it at that. The future is likely very different now so the exact details of what it was at one point aren’t important. Bytemite also goes corporeal long enough to launch a suicide attack on G and attempt to frame him for corruption.


*Yet Another Boom (Chapter 8)*: The party is incompetently interrogated. Major is suddenly no longer just comic relief as he executes a grand jailbreak using ambiguous magic (we hadn’t started linking spells for everyone’s benefit yet). His Gardevoir then blows up the prison (with only a bounty hunter inside, BUT STILL). First sign of the Major having a rather deadly dark side.  Fidema (the Gardevoir) then keeps teleporting until they reach somewhere where they aren’t immediately under attack.

Dan (time traveler man) gets a little emotional and almost shoots Eureka himself before Alice shows up and convinces him not to.


*Family Reunion (Chapter 9)*: Due to being hit by a Roar of Time at some point (which I can’t actually seem to find) Ziggy (Bob) starts reverting to when he was a program meant to destroy Exxy. Eureka, Dan and Alice talk him down. Byte returns from the dead (something that will become a regular occurrence). Major sends the party a new agent named Doug. Eureka receives a one-use time travel device. Alice flees because she’s upset about when she things she knows about her mom.

Byte takes advantage of looking different to mess with Zooks a little and gives Zooks advice not to trust her physical self.


*The Plan (Chapter 10)*: The gang, realizing that their teleporting spree has left them close the HQ of Gengar Corp (Dioptase City), and urged on by Doug, come up with a plan to infiltrate and get some answers.


*Darkness in Dioptase City (Chapter 11)*: The party has decided to enter the city via the subway because Gengar Corp doesn’t own that…except Gengar Corp just bought the subways. Fights for life occur. Doug is an idiot, but he dies saving Exxy so it’s actually heartbreaking. Also, G revived Dome and he’s angry. Byte’s former body shows up claiming to be A. Byte-A and Byte-B have a showdown. Meanwhile, someone claiming to be the original 100% genuine Bill shows up where Eureka and Dan are.


*Overbilled (Chapter 12)*: “Bill” reveals that G is not an individual but a collective of 5 different people…who all apparently have terrible senses of humor. Four of the 5 G’s are Zygarde, Wattson, Fennel/Flak, and an oracle named Thomas. Thomas shows up to confront Bill for some reason.

Dome and Helix clashing starts causing interdimensional rifts and Outsiders start pouring at is they were expecting this to happen. Zygarde is with them. Zooks sneaks into Gengar Corp but is confronted by Flak.


*The Oracle (Chapter 13)*: As the party confronts Flak she suddenly split in two. One of the Fennel’s appears to be less murderous and join with the party. She teleports those of the party at Gengar Corp to safety. Zygarde and the Major confront each other. Zygarde reveals that Major is a sixth G but has had his memories purged. Thomas and Wattson duel with Bill and Eureka.


*Divided Forces (Chapter 14)*: Various things that have been subtley bother Eureka about “Bill” lead her to reach the conclusion that he isn’t who he claims to be. Consequently, Thomas and Wattson are now valuable assistants as not-Bill suddenly goes on the offensive. Zygarde reveals that Major is missing over a millennium of memories, including the revelation that he was friends with the fifth G, merely also called G. The Major convinces Zygarde that killing Eureka because she mysteriously shows up and starts killing other people is a terrible idea and the result of timeline abuse.

And then things get weird. A portal opens up near the Major and a rather strange duo emerge from it. A small red-haired boy riding (briefly, before it drops him) a Giratina materializes and starts going on about how This Was Not The Plan. The boy and the Major proceed to have a perplexing conversation where the boy seems to know a great deal of what’s going on in Draysten and wants nothing to do it, as he has unspecified business in Unova instead. The Major decides to let the boy know he is planning on personally heading to PokeEarth; they both have reservations about this idea but agree it’s probably needed. The boy decides might as well accompany the Major but again makes it clear he has no intention of getting involved. He also considerably less enthusiastic when the Major insists that the boy give him some form of Power Limiter. The boy also explains where he found Giratina (Dragonspiral Tower) but little else. This strange groups of four people take’s the portal.


*All Together Now! (Chapter 15)*: On the other side of the portal is Flak. The boy starts needling her almost instantly, trying to get her to reveal her murderous side in front of another G. She keeps her composure long enough for the Major and Zygarde to depart to find Eureka. The boy also “hints” that Giratina would like to speak with Flak. They boy proceeds to make it clear he knows she intends to betray the other G’s with the help of Outsiders, continuing to unnerve her. Witty banter is exchanged, the boy comments on how Flak isn’t even bothering to deny any of the accusations he’s throwing around, just planning to go straight to murder with no plan. They end up in an Outsider infested Entralink and Flak claims to know something about the boy.

Meanwhile the Major arrives to back up those fighting the not-Bill and receives a message (from the boy) that not-Bill is most likely Outsiderkind.


*An Awkward Date (Chapter 16)*: Reunions are had with most people seeing Eureka alive for the first time in something like 10 chapters. Thomas also shows up and reveals that he knows Zooks (who he calls Princess Natalie) from a very long time in the past. However, things are cut short by more imminent explosions, this time nuclear because the previous ones weren’t overkill enough.

Fennel reveals that she knows the red-haired boy’s name, Cameron and that he has had past encounters with other Eldritch Abominations distantly related to the Outsiders. Cameron isn’t really impressed by this. Cameron’s personality noticeably takes a dramatic and disturbing shift while he is alone with Flak, over time beginning to sound a lot like her. He also drops mention of ice cream several times in an attempt to get the attention of Good Fennel’s Bill. Outsiders murder his Liepard (also Eureka, more sign he’s been watching the group for a while). When it looks like he is about to overwhelmed, a different Bill than anticipated comes to the rescue and teleports him to an unknown location.

*Griefs from the Past (Chapter 17)*:  Zooks…or Natalie, experiences a vision of her past. Exxy finds Amber’s fossil in some MYSTERIOUS RUINS. Team Trollkit suffers attack of the clones and Major and Trollkitten end up pulled into the past. Bill the actual original attempts to interrogate Cameron, only to have the tables turned. Cameron is able to show Bill what is going on with Team Trollkitten via his laptop and is to convince Bill to reluctantly take action. Bill prepares to help those under attack in the present while Cameron and Giratina head to provide assistance to the past team.


*A Broken Timeline (Chapter 18)*: Confusions occur as nearly all of the party meets up and various people are mistaken for various other people. Then reality starts breaking as Fennel starts opening rifts in the sky and Outsiders start pouring in in vast quantities. Also, Fennel’s Bill finally makes contact with this universe just to add some more confusion. Also ,questionably helpful hologram Cameron shows up but explains his ability to influence anything going on here is limited. In the past it’s explained that things need to appear to happen a certain way for the future to stabilize, but that through magical shenanigans everything doesn’t have to happen the way it appears to happen.


*Local Major Fixes Everything (Chapter 18.5)*: Things continue to spiral further out of control in the present. This seems likely to continue unless the past time pulls of a miracle. First stop in the past, altering Princess Natalie’s death. Cameron creates an unliving clone into which Major plants an elemental to impersonate Zook’s actual soul. Fennel, along with the actual G show up and persuade Thomas to work with them in return for a chance to save Natalie. Present Hologram Cameron asks Zooks what her earliest memories are so the past team knows where to drop her off. Garret (rumored to have an affair with Eureka, showed up to the past team to help out) claims that there are two more time-points that need to be fixed, framing Eureka for killing her family and the death of the actual G.

	
*Shadows of The Past (Chapter 19)*:  Past team continues fixing things; exact details are incredibly creepy. We find out G is short for Glaucus and bring with us as we return to the fixed present.


*Dawn of A New Day (Chapter 20)*: The party + extras decide to reconvene at the Major’s demiplane while they plot their next move against Flak and the Outsiders (every other G having defected at this point). Byte is somehow missed (will edit if anyone can find how we failed to bring Byte along)


*On the Other Side of the Mirror/An Alternate Dimension (Chapter 21)*: Flak and not-Bill (revealed to be called Robus) are shown to be working for another man, presumably an Outsider. The man kills Flak and clearly has done this before as he seems able to revive her. Another minion named Sapientia is introduced. The party explores Astrum except for Byte who is missing and Cameron who has passed out from maintaining so many spells simultaneously for extended periods of time.

Elsewhere, Sapientia goes after Byte with intent to kill Byte (again). Bills’s wife Rea (in the form of a Floette) and Dreaming!Cameron show up to provide help but Byte isn’t even sure they aren’t part of a fever dream. Cameorn takes over battling Sapientia (and flirting?) while Rea helps Byte get to safety. Dream!Cameron ends up losing but Byte and Rea got away.

Back at Astrum, Bane’s creator shows up out of nowhere and is inducted into the growing party. Thomas reveals that there are three powerful weapons hidden in ruins around Draysten that could help with fighting Outsiders. Glaucus reveals the name of Flak’s boss, Amais, and that he was a survivor of the Moscople incident like Bill. Amais has essentially become ruler of the Outsiders. Amais has three followers in addition to Flak known as the Vita Trio; Robus, Sapientia, and Décor (Strength, Knowledge, Beauty). Amais himself forces his way into the Major’s demiplane and then the Major locks the door so he can’t leave. Somewhere in Astrum Bill and Giratina converse and form a pact.

Oh, and Byte had a crush on Bill at one point.


*A Royal Visit (Chapter 22)*: Fennel has decided to start learning magic with the Major tutoring her. Amber and Helix are revived from their fossils. Solareon is also brought back from death. Bill confronts Amais with his new Giratina-granted powers only to realize it’s merely a projection of Amais. The party splits into groups to tackle the ruins. Sapientia and Cameron flirt talk some more and it’s revealed Sapientia feels no attachment to Amais. Exxy and Eureka also go on a date in Sigil, City of Doors.


*Velocitas, Resitentia, and Fortitudo (Chapter 23)*: The three parties make their way through the ruins dealing with the traps and each having to deal with a member of the Vita Trio. Velocitas has to deal with the lecherous Robus, Resistentia the mysterious Décor (the only member we hadn’t met yet), and Fortitudo, where Cameron JUST HAPPENS to be gets Sapientia. Robus and Décor are temporarily defeated with the aid of the relics and Sapientia is finally convinced to switch sides to take out Amais and Robus.


*Dark Secrets (Chapter 24)*: Bill reveals that he’s the biological son of Dome and Lady Abin the Third. Sapientia shows an educational video about Outsider society. It’s revealed that only be killing the old Outsider Rex and replacing them can changes be made to Outsider Society. Fennel and Cameron both think Sapientia would make an excellent replacement for Amais. Suddenly Amais appears again, viciously attacking Sapientia, attempting to destroy her before she can provide any more information to the heroes. While most of the party goes on the offensive against Amais, Cameron focuses on stabilizing Sapientia, using his own Life Force to make sure she doesn’t fade into nothing. The party manages to drive Amais away. Cameron collapses from using so much energy again, and when he awakes he finds that Sapientia has fallen into a coma.


*Nowhere is Safe (Chapter 25)*: Sapientia being in a coma puts Cameron in a temper and a few misplaced efforts to help her that result in her condition seeming to worsen result in Cameron exiling everyone but himself and Zooks from the room because Zooks (or rather Princess Natalie) seems to have shared a connection with Sapientia in the past. Inside Sapientia’s Mind, Zooks and Cameron confront Robus who is tormenting a young Sapientia. There is also a memory!Zooks present and it’s revealed that Princess Natalie and Sapientia were adopted sisters and shared a very close bond. While Cameron keeps Robus at bay, Natalie makes use of this bond to help calm Sapientia down so that they can sway the mental battle in the favor and escape. Cameron pulls them back into the mortal world, however Zooks is now in her Princess Form and there are now two Sapientias. The two Sapientia’s fuse into one that has her former memories of Zooks restored.

Byte attempts to run away from a completely stationary Giratina.


*Back to Draysten (Chapter 26)*: Sapientia teleports the entire + extras (including non-combatants) to a place a short distance away from the portal they can use to get to the Outsider World. Byte uses a modified Fossil Restoration Device to return Eureka the Liepard to life and to give Cameron a temporary boost of energy. Cameron and Giratina team up to create a portal to Neopia so Eureka’s family can get away from being involved in this mess. On the other side of the portal, they party meets a friendly Outsider woman, Myla, who recognizes Sapientia and invites the party into the house for restorative tea. Cameron confronts Glaucus, who in general has been a terrible person, over the fact he’s trying to ruin Cameron’s budding relationship with Sapientia. An action that would have prevented much heartache over the next few thousand years is ultimately halted by the rest of the party teaming up against the irate Cameron. Some Outsider guards sent by Amais show up to arrest/torture Myla and her family.


*Outsiders Among Outsiders (Chapter 27)*: Bill impersonates (via shapeshifting) Amais to convince the guards to leave Myla alone. Sapientia reveals there is a second set of ruins in this world that can be used to upgrade the relics obtained back in Draysten. The team heads through the Velocitas 2.0 ruins only for another encounter with Robus (which honestly the odds were 50/50). After obtaining the shoes and fighting off a handful of Robus clones, it becomes clear the real Robus isn’t even present, and is in fact just stalling the party. They move on to the next ruins.


*Décor (Chapter 28)*:  The party finds themselves in the next ruins and confronted by Décor. Through previous discussions with Sapientia, and the encounter with her before, the party is aware that Décor is capable of sensing and manipulating people’s emotions, particularly their love for someone. It is also clear that Décor has no more love for Amais than Sapientia does. As the party talks with Décor, Cameron determines that Amais is controlling her, in order to break his control, Cameron brings a necklace out of his backpack, but Amais takes a more active control, the party has to work together to get the necklace on Décor and free her. Décor is freed but her time under Amais was too much for her and she takes her own life. Amais arrives to try to claim her body but Cameron fights him off. Sapientia also quickly teleports to retrieve the new baby Décor before Amais can. The party heads to the final ruins only to be confronted by someone who looks a lot like Sapientia.


*The Last Ruins (Chapter 29)*: Flak attempts to stop the party from gaining the final relic along with her fake!Sapientia but fails miserable. Amais finally gets tired of her rubbish and perma kills her. Robus also bites the dust in an incident that doesn’t need details and baby!Robus is also collected by the party to protect him from Amais.


*The Devil’s Castle (Chapter 30)*: With the final confrontation around the corner the group decides that its time for SIDE QUESTS. Cameron has been talking to Sapientia and apparently there are additional mysterious locations to explore for more loot that could be handy for taking down Amais. The party arrives at the first location and Sapientia reveals that it was the palace of the first Sapientia (prior to there being Rexes). 

*Castle in The Sky (Chapter 31)*: After working their way past some Outsider Dogs without the use of magic, the party encounters the second Outsider Rex (Secundus) on the lowest level of the castle. He explains how he tied the previous Sapientia’s life to his and in return she cursed him to never die. He wants current Sapientia to kill him and set him free. Cameron explains that the Sapientia who cursed Secundus died a long time ago and that reasonably, the current Sapientia can’t be held accountable. In return Secundus tells Cameron how to remove the curse on Sapientia.

*Under The Sea (Chapter 32)*: The next dungeon is underwater (OH NO WATER TEMPLE) so Sapientia teaches the party an Outsider water breathing spell (which doubles as a transformation spell) The party explores the ruins, this time connected to original!Decor. Lever is pulled, ruins start to collapse, party accosted by Outsider Goldfish.


*Skeletons in the Closet (Chapter 33)*: The final dungeon of this particularly set of three is a torture chamber in the middle of the desert tied to Robus, this just sounds like it’s going to be fun already doesn’t it? G being a troll and summoning Landshark who ends up triggering a trap ends up killing Sapientia (again) and Bill nearly dies by swallowing a radio while transformed into a Sabeleye. The party returns to debating the merits of finally murdering G. He manages to weasel out of it by suggesting some of the party travel 5 minutes into the past to save Sapientia. 

Meanwhile, a new character enters the scene back in Draysten. Lazorgator confronts a mysterious man named Fatum, fails, and ends up teleported to where the rest of the party are. Third lever is pulled and the party is teleported to the first Sapientia’s castle to break current Sapientia’s connection to Amais. With the three dungeons cleared, the bonus dungeon appears where a weapon rumored to be effective against Amais, the way to restore Sapientia to her true power, and a way to restore the Major’s magic can be found.


*Breaking the Chains (Chapter 34)*: In the new area that has appeared the party meets the Echo of the first Sapientia that explains that she will give them the things they seek, but first they must prove themselves by battling her. Dan, Wattson, Thomas, Zygarde, Alice, Bill and Rea all die over the course of the battle, but Giratina uses her energy to restore those of the Bill Clan to life. The Original Sapientia explains that after Amais is slain, she will be able to use her energy to restore all those who we killed, including the 27 girls who died prior to Eureka being declared Experiment 28. Oh and Amais is merely a puppet for someone else.


*The Origin (Chapter 35)*: Side quests completed, it’s finally time for the confrontation with Amais. It is revealed that if we use one of the special weapons we obtained, the timeline will reset, but Amais will no longer exist. However, if Amais is killed with his own blade, the person who kills him becomes the new Rex (there is not possible way this could go wrong). Bill and Giratina seemingly betray Cameron as an excuse to get close to Amais without immediately triggering reprisal, Bill still being intent on finding a way to save his friend. The rest of the party battle their way through Amais’s guards. The attempt to getting Amais to redeem seems to fail. He absorbs the Vita Trio, gaining power. Seeing Sapientia perish yet again seems to cause something to snap inside Cameron and he is enveloped in a dark aura. Amais does not seem surprised to this, nor does he seem surprised when a new Entity, who he identifies as The Supreme Evil, begins speaking through Cameron

Bill manages to get Amais’s sword using trick and the Supreme Evil possessed Cameron insists that Bill hand it over. G and Lazorgator both make attempts to slay Amais (G with a sword that would merely reset the timeline) but both are ultimately thwarted by other party members. The Supreme Evil acquires the sword before being absorbed by Amais, leaving Amais’s blade in Cameron’s hands. While Amais did manage to absorb the SupremeEvil, he is unable to fully control it and the two then fight for control of his body. After Bill makes one last speech to Amais, Cameron stabs Amais, become the new Outsider Rex.
 As Amais dies, a voice announces that the castle is going to self-destruct. Cameron orders it not to but apparently a higher power is interceding, so he settles for teleporting the group away instead. The Major confronts Cameron about what a terrible idea he thinks this is, but Cameron shrugs him off. Original Sapientia revives the Vita Trio. Sapientia and Cameron kiss. Exxy proposes to Eureka and they kiss. Happy endings all around except for Byte who’s still dealing with lingering trauma. 


Second Campaign: **Hidden in The Shadows**

*An Ancient Land Revealed (Prologue):* Fennel searches for her Bill who was kidnapped near the end of 28 for asking TOO MANY QUESTIONS and trying to delve into topics man was not meant to know (or at least not know until several campaigns from now). Fennel gets a mysterious signal (seemingly originating in Outsidera/) she naively assumes to be her Bill and sends it to everyone she knows before she and her entire universe are kidnapped.


*A New Adventure (Chapter 1):* Things start out promisingly as adventurers both old and new converge on the mysterious uncharted forest for a variety of reasons. There is group conflict and strife almost immediately do to having strange people suddenly appear in places they do not belong for no clear reason. A portal ends up opening and the group of misfits is dragged into another world and promptly nerfed. Also, the natives seem particularly hostile to those with Aetherial connections (the Paradisians have an anti-outsider virus they've pumped into their atmosphere).


*Welcome to Paradise (Chapter 2):* Negotiations are more less attempted but interrupted by someone named Jenny pulling an impromptu (and potentially unneeded jail-break). Also, this world is ironically called Paradise.


*The Resistance (Chapter 3):* Jenny reveals herself to be part of a Resistance to the Paradise government. Most of the party is less than impressed given she’s essentially forced them into siding with the Rebellion. Apparently, she also hijacked Fennel’s signal and is the reason the party is in this world in the first place. This is also taken poorly. Paradise military shows up to cause trouble but the party is rescued by the mysterious masked beauty Persona Noctis.


*Derailment (Chapter 4):* The conflicting personalities of the party (both PCs and NPCs) finally comes to a head resulting in a session where the party is mostly trying to kill each other. Fennel and Bill seemingly return and take some of the party into the Entralink.


*Returning Faces (Chapter 5):* “Bill” acts incredibly shady and the only person who seems to actually buy it is Fennel. Eventually revealed that he’s actually some version of Professor Oak and Jenny is his daughter whom he’s been looking for.


*Too Many Sides (Chapter 6):* The party convinces Oak to let them go just in time get back to Outsidera/ just as the forces of Paradise invade. And Captain RAWLING (one of Eureka's cats) is revealed to have apparently gone back in time and been indirectly responsible for the founding of Paradise.


*Invasion (Chapter 7):* The party battles Ferals and each other until a group calling itself the Campaign for Paradox Time intervenes and starts portaling Ferals into the past. There is nothing terrible about this idea, AT ALL.


*Stable Paradoxes (Chapter 8):* Zinnia shows up out of nowhere and reverses what the Campaign for Paradox Time just accomplished, essentially making them irrelevant. More party drama. Eventually Major portals the party out of trouble.


*The Campaign for Paradox Time (Chapter 9):* It’s revealed that there is a potentially sentient meteor head for the homeworld of the Paradox Campaign people, and somehow it has become the party’s responsibility to deal with it despite essentially ricocheting between various morally dubious groups for several chapters. Yet more party conflict.


*Extinction Inches Ever Closer (Chapter 10):* Various plans for how to deal with the meteor are discussed. Some of the party head to the meteor and find out it’s being directed by a fatalistic Deoxys. The group seemingly manages to destroy the meteor and stop Deoxys but Persona Noctis perishes (and is revealed to have been future!Decor) as well.


*The Darkest Hour (Chapter 11):* A Mind Controlled Steven Stone turns off the time lock on his universe allowing Deoxys to enter freely. Using its newly gained power, Deoxys starts breaking Reality itself, causing everything to start rapidly deteriorating. Bill attempts to sacrifice himself, but is stopped by Cameron. Byte manages to convince Deoxys to join the Voices and be a less malevolent observer. Cameron, with the aid of Sapientia and a revived Décor, is able to restore the parts of Reality (including the millions of people who died) that ceased to exist, but is greatly weakened in the process, having to retreat…somewhere to replenish his physical form and energy. As he is not truly dead the Ferals are not rampaging however.


Third Campaign: **Chosen Star**


*Employee Introductory Video (Pre-Campaign Intro)*: A mysterious company known only by the acronym MOFEJ is currently hiring unsuspecting saps to do highly dangerous jobs for minimal pay. Among those applying for jobs are the mysterious gardener, Thistle (who is admitted despite their apparently being no plants anywhere in the building) and the impudent young girl, Olivia Chailand (there is nothing suspicious about either of these people, AT ALL).


*Pre-Prologue*: Thistle and Olivia end up arriving for work at about the same time and end up bonding almost immediately, if bonding implies mutually trying to pester/taunt/murder/flirt and generally seemingly spontaneously developing a kismesis at first sight. They even end up using their reward money from their first mission to rent a house together. On their second mission together, Olivia ends up vanishing mysteriously mid mission leaving Thistle to try to complete the mission alone. She fails and is captured by a group of terrorists, but they are unable to cause her harm, only keep her captive.

I've already received 10 rejection letters, and the rest haven't been addressed yet. I'm pretty worried since I think it would be such a cool place to work, but I might not even get a chance at an interview with them. 

Does anyone here have experience with their intern hiring process? I figured this was a long shot since I couldn't find much information on the usual subreddit /r/cscareerquestions, but figured the playstation sub was worth a shot for advice. "

In case you haven't noticed, we just wrapped up and [revealed the results of the Year-End chart of 2017.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7ouy5k/the_popheads_chart_yearend_hot_100_and_top_25/) Go check it out!

Anyway, for the bad news. The Crownnote chart and the Monthly Top 25 albums chart pages are yet to be made by the time of this post. Apologizes but we should get them running as soon as possible!

Also, we decided to do something cool and new for Popheads Certifications. If a song has a Platinum certification, they're eligible to have their points counted even though the song is no longer charting in the Hot 50. This was made to make it easier for platinum-certified songs to earn a 2x, 3x, 4x etc. Platinum and Diamond certification.

Happy New Year once again, and I guess New Year doesn’t always mean New Charts, with our top 10 fairly stagnant. Reclaiming the top seat of the charts is Charli XCX’s and Carly Rae Jepsen’s collab, ‘Backseat’. Filling up numerous spots in the top 10 again is Charli XCX’s numerous tracks from her album, POP 2, featuring #3 ranking, ‘Out Of My Head’ and #6, ‘Femmebot’. Breaking apart Charli XCX’s domination is Camila Cabello’s ‘Never Be The Same’, (keep an eye out for this girl, with a new album dropping this Friday, don’t be surprised to see another top 10 domination coming soon). Further breaking apart Charli’s army is Taylor Swift, adding two songs to the top 10, #5. ‘Delicate’, as well as her upcoming single, #10. ‘Endgame’. 

Falling off of her throne, Cardi B retreats to #7 with her second major solo single, ‘Bartier Cardi’, with a six spot deficit. This week in general saw a very low scoring total for most songs, with the highest total still below 600 points. With new music coming in the coming weeks for Troye Sivan, Camila Cabello, and a new Cupcakke album freshly released, expect some big changes to the charts in the upcoming weeks!

**Outside The Top 10**

Taylor Swift keeps making money moves in the top 50, with 13 of her 15 album tracks making appearances in this week’s top 50, she also notches the highest re-entry of the week in ‘New Year’s Day’, logging back in at number 20 on this week’s chart. 

We are marked with an obvious slow week this week, with one of two debuts logging in at number 47, belonging to K-Pop group, Loona/Chuu with their song ‘Heart Attack’. The other belonging to BORNS and Lana Del Rey’s collaboration, ‘God Save Our Young Blood’, entering a spot below it at number 48. 

Dua Lipa narrowly avoids the top 10, (just like on the Billboard Charts :( ), and preps for a new single, IDGAF is expected to take charge in her singles department, with a new music video dropping this Friday, the 12th of January, so expect to see IDGAF giving us a visit pretty soon here! 

* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #47. Loona/Chuu - Heart Attack	
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #20. Taylor Swift - New Year's Day
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #11. Dua Lipa - New Rules (+22)
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #45. N.E.R.D. &amp; Rihanna - Lemon (-25)

7p1mqm,3,2018-01-08,Am I being controlling and/or manipulative?,dtom95,saneorpsycho,https://www.reddit.com/r/saneorpsycho/comments/7p1mqm/am_i_being_controlling_andor_manipulative/,"About two weeks ago I woke up one morning and texted my girlfriend to say good morning. It was like any other day. A few minutes later I happened to see this post http://trendsetnews.com/36-questions-lead-love/ It is just a set of questions that are supposed to help a couple nurture their relationship through self-disclosure. I read through them and figured I would not really hesitate to answer any of them to my girlfriend because I love and trust her. I ask her how she felt about the questions and she said that they seemed very personal and that she even cried while reading them. She went on to say that she would feel uncomfortable sharing some of those things with me because I was not always very approachable. She then began to compare me to her exes, one of them being her best friend, saying that they all seemed to self-disclose much more to her than I do and that being raised in a more similar culture made relating to them easier. This was the last straw for me on this issue and I began to tell her how inappropriate her relationship with her best friend was and how some might even consider it an emotional affair or emotional cheating.

Let me give some background for this by saying that I knew about this friendship before we started dating. In October of 2016 we met through a mutual friend that I went to high school with and she currently goes to university with. For about a month we saw each other on weekends when I came from about 45 minutes away to visit my friend from high school. She is an international student from Central America and I was very interested in being friends with her. We had interesting conversation and even discussed the nature of her relationship with an ex from before she came to the US to study. She said that he was her best friend and I said that it would be difficult for any potential boyfriends to accept that, without even thinking that I might find myself in that exact situation. Our mutual friend even mentioned to me that he had met this friend and he was very obviously hoping to one day get back together. After a few weeks I found myself being more and more attracted to her and after a few late night talks we ended up drunkenly making out one night. After that night we transitioned into dating, and for the next few months I figured that this friendship with her ex would not affect our relationship. I knew that she stayed in touch with him through Facebook messenger and that they talked frequently. I know now that I was not worried about this mostly because they were half a continent away from each other.

It wasn't until the summer of 2017 that really I began to feel uncomfortable with this arrangement. Because she is an international student she returned to her home country for the duration of the summer. During this time I took summer classes and worked a part-time job while she had an internship and a job in the evenings. We were both busy, but we made time to text, or call, or Skype whenever we could. I still began to feel frustrated and insecure about our relationship. At the time I couldn't articulate why, but now I understand that it is the inappropriate nature of the relationships that she has with her best friend that made me feel this way even back then. I admittedly did not handle this the best way and we often had arguments about trust. 

Near the end of the summer I flew out to visit her and meet her family and friends. During this trip I wanted to meet this friend. I wanted to be able to put my mind at rest. I wanted to confirm what my girlfriend had always said, that they were just close friends. I only met him once very briefly and by coincidence. Even though she introduced me to many other friends she didn't try to have me get to know her ""best friend"". This was suspicious to me. We had a mostly pleasant time, but there was virtually no time for sexual intimacy. Even when her mother was away on a business trip she was very hesitant to even close the door to a room if we happened to be together. I know now that this is mostly due to the conservative culture of her country and family, but at the time it really worried me and fed into my anxieties about our relationship. After returning from my trip, there were a few weeks before my girlfriend returned for the fall semester. During these weeks my resentment grew to a point where I even wrote a break up note to give to her when she returned. The main subject of the note was this inappropriate friendship. I wanted to tell her that this relationship made me uncomfortable the whole time she was gone and that I could not continue the way things were. I was especially aware that her leaving for Christmas would be extremely difficult. Putting these ideas down in writing made me feel so much better and made me think that this was really an insignificant thing. I deleted the note. 

We seemed to be doing much better as the semester went on. We had small arguments here and there, but they were never about anything serious and never lasted long. Sometime soon after our one year anniversary in November, I began to feel that familiar feeling of resentment. I began to notice the frequency that she would message him. It would be every day multiple times a day. I was very bothered by the fact that she would choose to use the limited time we had together on the weekends to talk to this guy, and I began to wonder how much she talked to him when I wasn't around. I even happened to see sexual jokes, comments, and innuendos. This was without even looking through their messages, just when I happened to look over at her phone while we were together, so I assume this was a regular thing that she either allowed to happen or possibly even  encouraged. This seemed to me a huge disrespect of our relationship, and validated my suspicion that this relationship crossed the boundaries of a platonic friendship.

Throughout our conversations over this topic she repeatedly denied that their relationship was anything more than just a close friendship. She told me that what I was really doing was unfairly calling her a whore and accusing her of being unfaithful. She repeatedly told me that I was just taking my frustration and insecurity out on her and blaming it on her friend. It was not until I started quoting the Wikipedia page for Emotional Affair https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_affair and asked her to try to see it from my perspective that she finally relented. She admitted that if the roles were reversed she would not like for me to be constantly contacting an ex, speaking about sexual things, and getting emotional support and validation from this other relationship that should come from our relationship. She still seemed to be unsure of how she felt, so I laid out the things that we needed to discuss changing. I told her that if she just treated him like any of her other friends, only talking occasionally without crossing any boundaries that it might work, but that the disrespect I felt from  her treating him like her long distance boyfriend was unacceptable. I would much rather she cut him out of her life, but I also don't want to be controlling and manipulative. She says she has had virtually no contact with him since. Ultimately it is her decision how their friendship will progress, but going back to the way things have been or anything similar is unacceptable and would possibly warrant an ultimatum. She said she is willing to fix the inappropriate aspects of her relationship with her friend, and I said I would try to be more approachable and accepting of her culture.

Are my concerns unreasonable? Any input would be appreciated.

TL;DR My [22M] girlfriend [21F] of about 1 year has had an inappropriate relationship with her ""friend"" [23-24 M] since before our relationship began. I had kept quiet about my concerns until being compared with past relationships earlier this month. We had two big fights and came to a tentative resolution."
7p1wgg,2,2018-01-08,"Seriously, what the fuck am I supposed to do?",LaryngopharyngealOca,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7p1wgg/seriously_what_the_fuck_am_i_supposed_to_do/,"I graduated last May with a Bachelor's degree and $30,000 in debt; I was a good student. Despite this, I haven't been able to find a job that pays more than a dollar over minimum wage. During college, I applied to internships like crazy for two straight years, but I never got one (which isn't surprising considering that most students aren't able to obtain one before graduation). Then, I started applying for jobs in early 2017 , and I've tried my hardest to fill out at least two applications a day since then. Regardless of my efforts, I've only managed to get three interviews so far--one for the current minimum wage job I'm working, a phone screen for a claims trainee position, and an interview for a call center. I was turned down for the latter two, and I wasn't provided a reason why. 

The job I'm currently working in has no room for advancement compensation wise or within the organization. I've gotten so desperate for money that I'm applying to teller, warehouse, and manufacturing positions, because at least they pay more than $10 an hour. I'm literally filling out online applications that are asking me 50 times if I've ever used or sold drugs at work, but these companies never bother calling me back either. 

At this point, I don't really understand what I have to do to earn a living wage, and I'm honestly at my wits end. I'm incredibly depressed, moody, suicidal, and I'm running out of hope. If I can't earn enough money to survive, I don't see a logical reason to live. Absolutely none of this makes sense to me.

7p2jwv,1,2018-01-08,Looking for advice on student loans.,dagdafrench,askTO,https://www.reddit.com/r/askTO/comments/7p2jwv/looking_for_advice_on_student_loans/,"Hello,

My Gf and I are in a bit of a messed up situation financially and we could use some advice from those more experienced in such matters.

Context: We are both students in UofT (St. George) enrolled in the Computer Science program. For the first 2 years my GF's parents were able to help her out with her tuition fees, but in her 3rd year she found out that they would be unable to help her out this time around. She was unable to pay for her tuition, which is around 14k for that school year. At this point we were a bit stressed out, but we decided to work for a year to help pay for her tuition. I went on to do an internship at a software company, whilst my GF got a job as a research assistant working in another University.

We had to move out due to other unforeseen circumstances and got stuck with rent payments and bills which have been eating up most of our paycheck. We've been unable to make much of a dent in her tuition.

She needs to go back to School to finish up her degree so she can start looking for work, but she cannot apply for OSAP to help pay her tuition since the 2016-2017 school year has come and gone. She cannot apply for student line of credit from her bank because she is not currently enrolled into courses.

It is really important for us that she is enrolled in the upcoming 2018-2019. I was wondering what are our options to help pay off the remainder of her tuition so she can enroll in the 2018-2019 school year in July. Currently I'm thinking about a regular line of credit, but I'm not well versed in such matters and I was wondering if there are other options, or advice any one could offer on how to go about this. A loan is fine, as at the very least I'll have a decent job to carry on with payments in 2019.

Thank you for any advice!

Unfortunately my grades were just too low to get in to Computer Science (~75-76% GPA) and I'm stuck in Physics.

I don't think my grades reflect my actual ability or aptitude, as I have done two previous Software Development internships, one at Microsoft, and I will be interning at Facebook this summer. These are fairly prestigious companies to work for in tech, so I would hope this gives me a little leverage.

I only want to transfer into CS so I can take CS courses during my 4th and final year of school. I'd really rather not take more Physics classes as I have no interest in the subject anymore. I have been taking the same CS courses as a typical 3rd year CS student so I should be eligible for promotion into 4th year CS next year should I be admitted.

Does anyone here have experience with appealing CS major admittance decisions by supplementing your grades with stuff like personal projects or work experience? I asked a science advisor but she told me to speak with CS department advising, and CS department advising referred me to talk to someone else who has not responded to me.

Chapter 1 / 3


""Hey Michelle I was wondering if you had a rough draft for the Nixon project?""


""Oh, hey Chris. I’m sorry I don’t have a draft.""


""Uh, Michelle, I need that draft, like now.""


""Well, I do have this...""


""You finished it?""


""Yep.""


""Funny. I was about to have a heart attack. If a third of my team worked as hard as you we would be, like…I don’t have an analogy. Way better. We’d be way better.""


""Maybe hire me then or pay me.""


""Well your internship is over in what, two weeks right? I shouldn’t be telling you this but Mike is leaving. He took another job. No promises but...""


Fuck yea. That job is mine. I have been at Chimera for almost four months as a volunteer intern. But its totally worth it. Chimera is one of the top advertising firms in the country, no the world, the whole universe, and my dream job not to mention. My friends, I am living proof that you can do whatever you put your mind too. With a little hard work, grit, and a advertising degree from the Harvard of the Midwest you too can work at the most exclusive advertising firm ever. I wonder what my starting salary is going to be? Should I negotiate. I should probably counter their first offer. I can move out of Nikki’s place. She’s such a bitch. I’m going to fuck off the rest of the day. I earned it.
 

This is bullshit. This can’t be happening. So I just got home. Yes I know it’s late. What did I do the rest of the day you ask? Let’s see I talked with Anne and Tyrese in the break lounge for about an hour…or two. Then a few of us cut out early to go to happy hour. Happy hour turned into dinner and drinks at Vintage, then more drinks at Fitzgerald's. Then I got home and checked the mail. Now I’m looking at some bullshit letter from Overa Corp. Something about being put in a work repayment program. It says Overa is paying off my student loans and now I’ve been placed in a work repayment program at Overa’s fulfillment center. Then there's a few pages of legal terms or something. I take some photos of the letter and text it to my dad. He’s a lawyer. He’ll know how to get me out of this. I have a job now. My investment at Chimera had finally paid off. How can they do this? I open my laptop and log in to my student loan page. My loans are still there. Nothing’s changed. $67,346 balance and a bunch of red notifications about missed payments. I shut my laptop. I hate looking at that. I’ve been in a volunteer internship, how am I supposed make any payments? Oh my god, my dad is calling. Why can’t he just text me.


Chapter 2 / 3


Well I don’t know what to say. It’s my first day working for Overa. My dad didn’t do shit. It’s the law, I have no choice he says. He didn’t even try. I know him. Now I’m sitting in the parking lot of Overa. This isn’t the fancy Overa headquarters where everybody’s riding around on unicorns, playing ping pong, and the toilet paper is made of dollar bills. This is a warehouse. Warehouse isn’t the right word. What do you call a single story building that covers twenty acres? So you’re probably wondering how this work repayment program works. Well Overa did pay my loans, my account balance says zero and all those little red notification things went away. But now I have to work in this warehouse for the next five years with a basic income stipend for my rent and food. So no I didn’t move out of Nikki’s place. I don’t want to talk about. Well its time to go in. I can’t be late on my first day.


""You’re late.""


""It’s 7:03 a.m. Are you serious?""


""Yes I am serious. This facility is a well oiled machine. We are never late. We always deliver.""


He points to the wall. It says “We always deliver.” He drones on about the warehouse, the job, core values. I tune him out. The entire warehouse is completely open with floor to ceiling steel racks painted in a bright yellow. Giant open cardboard boxes sit on the racks with toys and household products and everything ever made in the world. Humans and robots scurry about with boxes and forklifts and bubble wrap following color coordinated lines on the ground. I can’t even see the other end of the building. It’s so big it spans beyond the curvature of the Earth. 


""Where’s the other end?"" 


""What do you mean?""


""The warehouse. The other end. I can’t see it.""


""We’ll go down there in a minute. Anyways you’re going to be working with one of our HR OPS teams.""


""HR. Like human resources?""


""Human Robot Operations. You will be working as a team with humans and robots to fulfill online retail orders. Here is a manual explaining how it works. Follow me. We’re going to watch the orientation video.""


I’ll spare you the detail from the orientation video and the test I had to pass. The cliff’s note version is the fulfillment center runs in twenty four hours in three shifts, seven days a week. I work the night shift. Of course. HR OPS teams fulfill the orders from customer’s online purchases from one of Overa’s countless retail subsidiaries. Every time you buy a shirt, toothpaste, a book, toilet paper, herpes medication, whatever, odds are it comes through one of Overa’s 15 regional fulfillment centers. Then it comes to one of the HR OPS teams. I have nine teammates. Four humans and five robots. We work together, take orders from each other, and help each other out. The robots stand six feet tall and mostly resemble a human form, except their legs connect to a platform of wheels. They don't walk, they roll. Their legs can extend up to ten feet in the air allowing them to reach the upper racks instantly. We communicate via text, through Overa’s app, when apart and regular speech when were close.   


Why not just all robots you ask? Well robots are great for repetitive tasks, they can scan hundreds of orders a minute for accuracy, query inventory instantly, and speed down the aisles effortlessly. Plus they never get tired. Humans don’t do any of that stuff well. But we can solve abstract problems like locating misplaced inventory, checking products for damage, and cleaning up knocked over inventory. The robots just go around it. Humans and robots working together creates more efficiency than if we worked separate. We work eight hour shifts. Technically nine hours. The humans get thirty minutes for lunch and two fifteen minute breaks. Our lunch and breaks are staggered so humans are always on shift. Our shifts end in stagger too so the next shift slowly transfers in. The robots never stop, except for maintenance.


*Four Years Later*


It’s December something. We can work overtime around Christmas. I used to always work overtime around Christmas. That’s the only time I can get money for whatever I want. The first three years I saved up and bought a new phone. Mine was three years old. It sucked. Now I don’t care. Why do I need a new phone? So I don’t work overtime anymore. One of my teammates, HAL, tells me some boxes are obstructing the pathway on row 23, section A9. HAL’s not his real name, he’s a robot, I named him that. I walk down to aisle 23, section A9. Legos are spilled everywhere. God these stupid robots always knock the legos over. I sweep them up into a bag, grab the packaging and dump them in the defective product bin. I get a text. Thank god, its time for my break.


I’m smoking now. I never smoked before. But it allows me to take my fifteen minute break outside on the smokers pavilion, a small corner on the roof overlooking the parking lot. I guess I don’t need to smoke to go outside but it gives me something to do. Smoking reminds me of being human. My phone gets a text: “2 minutes remaining on your break. Please make your way back to your station now.” I light another cigarette and stare out at the parking lot. Another text comes in. I ignore it. Then it rings. I answer. “This is Overa’s automative notification system letting you know that your break ends in 45 seconds. Our app tracking system indicates you are located on the smoking pavilion. Immediately make your way…” I hang up. The phone rings again but I chuck it off the roof onto the parking lot. It didn’t even shatter. It’s still ringing. That was anticlimactic. A couple of minutes later my manager walks out to the parking lot and stands over my phone. He turns around and looks up at me. He yells at me to get back inside. I head back downstairs and my manager meets me inside. He’s yelling. I ignore him. I start to walk past him and then he grabs my arm. 


""Don’t fucking touch me.""


""Michelle, calm down, don’t talk to me like that. I’m you’re manager.""


""Fuck you.""


""Excuse me?""


""Fuck you, sir. Fuck you and your blenders and TVs, and your fucking robots.""


And that’s when then the cops came. Next thing I know I’m standing in front of a judge. He’s reading the charges brought against me. Destruction of property, resisting arrest, being a little shit. What I didn’t tell you was that while I was telling my manager to fuck off I was picking up blenders and smashing them on the ground. I also kicked HAL to the ground and smashed a TV over his head. Some of my human teammates finally restrained me while the robots kept working. They always fucking deliver. Apparently those robots are expensive too. Like worth more than your life expensive. I plead guilty in return for a reduced sentence and fine. Twenty four months of community service and a $75,000 fine. It could of been a lot worse. Oh and I was fired from Overa and my student loan debt was reinstated since I violated the terms of the program. I should of read the legal terms.


Chapter 3 / 3

 
So what I am doing now? I’m working at Exposition. It’s a coffee shop. I’m a barista. It’s not that bad. I’ve made some friends here, I’m making money, and I got a studio apartment. I moved out of Nikki’s place and it feels so good. I even started paying off my loans. I have a long way to go but it feels good making the payments. I’m completing my community service at a public maker space. They have 3D printers, and workshop tools, and even some drones. They don’t let me touch the drones. I just clean the bathrooms and sweep the floors but I like it there. I like watching the kids learn how to make things.


""Michelle, is that you?""


""Chris? Oh my god, hi.""


""You work at Exposition now.""


""Yep.""


""I thought you were at Overa?""


""It’s a long story. Not important. How are you? How’s Chimera?""


""I’m not there anymore, actually. A few of us left and launched our own startup.""


""No way. That’s exciting. I’d love to hear about it.""


""Definitely. I got some time to kill if you do.""


""Uh yea sure.""


My manager is six years younger than me and is pretty ""chill"", as he says, about letting us take breaks whenever. So I made a couple of lattes and sat down with Chris. He told me about his new digital advertising startup. How Chimera wasn’t adapting to the new trends. So Chris left with two other managers and started their own company. It sounded pretty innovative and exciting.


""You know, Michelle, I think we’re gonna do big things. We just landed a big investor so we’re gonna expand operations.""


""That’s really exciting Chris. I’m very happy for you.""
 

""Are you going to get back into advertising?""


""I don’t know. I’m taking it a day at a time, paying off my loans. I’m on a good path right now.""


""We are hiring.""


""Oh yea.""


""Yea. Would you be interested? You have good experience. You’d hit the ground running. Which is what we need.""


""I don’t know. What’s the job?""


""Same work you were doing at Chimera. But don’t worry, as an employee.""


""May I ask what the salary is?""


""Well were a young company. We don’t have the cash flow to pay salaries but we’re offering stock option deals. Which is better in the long run, you know.""


""How does that work?""


""Well it varies but it’ll probably be an offer of around 50,000 shares, on a vesting schedule, at a value of twenty cents a share. That doesn’t sound like a lot but our plan is to aggressively go after Chimera’s market share. We’ve already stole a few clients. Eventually they’ll have to buy us out. When we sell to Chimera your 50,000 shares will be worth about $13 each.""


""$13 each that’s like...""


""$650,000. Not a bad return after a few years.""


""Not bad at all.""


""What do you think?""


""That’s tempting but what happens if your company doesn’t make it?""


""That’s not gonna happen. Tell you what. How about I email you the offer and terms. Look it over and get back to me. Trust me on this one. We’re disrupting advertising. This is the best investment you’ll ever make.""

7p4tgb,9,2018-01-09,Depressed because I'm ugly,Silent_Remedy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7p4tgb/depressed_because_im_ugly/,"Hi, so I'm writing this because maybe somebody can relate to me... Or maybe even offer advice.

I'm about to be 25 and all I do is obsess about how I look. I am in a constant battle with myself over the week about how ugly I am.

I am constantly getting mistaken for being older than I am although my skin is wrinkle-free and is very smooth. I don't get it.

I guess it has to do with my demeanor because I'm never happy (on the inside), and so this never gets through to my outside. I wish I could just fake it. Really fake it, but as much as I try to pretend to be content or happy it either only happens momentarily or I feel worse later because I'm using so much energy to keep up the facade.

I'm too thin and frail, and I do want to gain weight, but I just do not have the appetite or motivation due to feeling depressed and having suffered from binge-eating disorder coupled with little to no appetite and also a high metabolism (I had to eat over 3,000 calories in the past just to put on 15 lbs), so I often just starve or eat everything in sight. I'm severly underweight with a BMI of just 15. It really sucks though because I know I would feel a little more confident with myself at a higher weight and finding clothes that I like would not be so hard either.

People treat me different because of these things too, and it's absolutely horrible. They all just judge me and write me off before they know me. A couple people at my intern placement seemed as if they were speculating that I have a.) an eating disorder and b.) psychpathy. It made me feel completely anxious and like I was walking on eggshells around the place, but the main issue I had was that I was completely depressed. Even my on-site supervisor was treating me different like he didn't trust me and like I was a bad person. There was another intern there who he treated better, and he even never gave me a key to his office unlike the others who were there at the same time.

I have some other issues, but they are all just related to how I look also, but I'm trying to do something about them. I'm too dark, so I'm lightening my skin because people treat darker people of any race the worst. It sucks and it's classism, so at least I can just lighten my skin to a more preferred complexion. 

I wish I didn't care what people think, but it's hard to cope when you're a woman and the number one thing that's valued in women is appearance. 

Has any others been able to overcome hating how they look to become somewhat happier? I feel I'm happy in moments, but never extremely happy because I realize how unfortunate my looks are.

7p4zmr,88,2018-01-09,Rehabbing too hard,bloodymangata,MakeupRehab,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/7p4zmr/rehabbing_too_hard/,"It's story time with u/bloodymangata! I promise it all relates to MUR, but it's necessary background. 

I was riding the struggle bus HARD today. You know the struggle bus, right? The wheels on the bus go thunk-thunk-thunk. They're all different sizes and shapes, and occasionally they fall off. I had so much fun on it today that I rode it several times. 

I had a placement test this morning to get into a college calculus test. It doesn't sound all that big of a deal, but I promise you it was. I got a degree in music last spring, but I'm trying to get a master in science. Unfortunately, despite this particular field being filled with musicians-turned-scientists, the current grad programs can be a bit snobby about letting musicians into their programs. Placing into college calculus is one of the hoops I have to jump through to prove that I'm not one of those useless artistic types who can't do something as bAsIC as evaluating differential equations. So yeah, three hour long test on my (granted somewhat rusty) math skills starting at 8 am this morning. 

Of course, this three hour long test will make me late to the new job last week I started as a long-term, full-time intern with a firm that does the thing I'm trying to get a master's in. 

I assembled all of my things last night, all set for this morning. I had my calculator, my pencils with fresh lead in them, and I even laid out my clothing for the morning (something I literally never do, since, as a musician, they're all black anyway so they all go). 

Then, this morning rolls around. I noticed on my way to the test that I was getting some ... looks. I assumed it was because I looked stressed or something. I take the test, and I'm leaving to head downtown for my job when I realize: I had done my eyebrows and one eye's worth of eyeshadow. No base makeup, one eye totally undone. No base makeup would otherwise be fine but I just started on Differin and the purge is real. Suffice to say, I looked totally unprofessional, and entirely unsuitable for going into an office job. 

There was really no other option except to stop by a drugstore to find some last-minute products. Foundation, concealer, powder, setting spray, and an eyeshadow that sort of looks like what I was already wearing. I get back to my car, and between frantically shoving makeup on my face because I'm late to the meeting I'm supposed to be introduced to the principal of the firm at, I start mentally beating myself up over buying what I need. Of course, I should note that the reason I’m in a car at all is because I forgot my bus pass and access card that will let me in the office. 

I've been processing it all day, but I think I've come to some sort of realization. Even though these products represent in some cases a 100% increase of my current type of makeup  (from 1 powder to 2, from 1 setting spray to 2, from two concealers to 3), they were necessary purchases. I don’t mean in the “omg TAKE MY MONEY” way - I mean in the sense that I needed them to make a good impression on people in my field with whom I am establishing networks. And how can I really resent adding to my collection when they were necessary? Even more, today’s entirely unplanned purchases means that I can stop myself from being in that situation again. 

All of this is to say, sometimes I take the MUR spirit too far. Rather than seeing makeup as a useful tool, I get too focused on getting rid of it or getting too much of it. Instead, I need to focus on more of an Aristotelian mean. "
7p5ice,6,2018-01-09,Entry Level IT Jobs,ZellZin,TillSverige,https://www.reddit.com/r/TillSverige/comments/7p5ice/entry_level_it_jobs/,"Hej alla!

I just graduated college this December with a MIS (Management Information Systems) degree, and would love to move to Sweden for a year or two. I have a dual citizenship with the USA and Sweden so I imagine the transition would be much smoother than most. I've heard a ton about the ""housing crisis"" which scares me a bit since getting my own place would be ideal, but I have relatives that I could stay with all around Gothenburg so that shouldn't be too much of an issue. But is it really that difficult to find a room to rent? I don't mind being a roommate for a while.

My main concern is finding a job. I have no work experience in the IT field. And my Swedish is at a conversational level; I can understand almost everything and speak it pretty well, but I can barely read or write. Do you think I'll have a hard time finding an entry level IT job? I've heard from my cousins that almost everyone gets some sort of internship through the colleges, would this put me at a disadvantage? Also, what are your favorite job hunting sites? Any advice is appreciated!"
7p5lrq,1,2018-01-09,I (28F) can't deal with my sister (26F) anymore. I don't know what to do.,GraduationRequest,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7p5lrq/i_28f_cant_deal_with_my_sister_26f_anymore_i_dont/,"My sister, has always been difficult, even when she was young. My whole family has walked on eggshells as her moods would swing unpredictably and I think us being so careful around her has contributed to how she acts now. I was always top of my school, while she was always in the top 30ish, but because we didn't want to upset her (she would always call me the golden child even though this wasn't true) we could NEVER celebrate anything I've achieved. Instead it was always 'don't say anything, it will upset her'. I think this is another reason - low self esteem.

But since we both moved out of home, it's gotten much worse. As we have always lived at least 2+ hours from each other, she would go through periods of not talking to me for a year plus.

The first time was in approx. 2012 because I booked a trip to Europe before her, despite me always planning to go to London and her saying our small coastal town was all she would ever need. I had no idea she wanted to go, but apparently I stole this from her.

The second time was because I didn't believe that she was on deaths door when we were both in India. I had lived there for a year and was in charge of crisis management for 600+ young students, and I hearing this kind of thing all the time. I followed protocol, but she was convinced that I was trying to kill her. This manifested by her telling my new (and current) boyfriend that I was a psycho, and my Dad and I hate each other to try and break us up.

The third time it was because after I found out I had landed a job at a very prestigious organisation, she responded by telling my parents (from Malaysia where she was volunteering) that she was now on the board of directors of a multi-million dollar company (despite being a first year undergraduate with no work experience or even internships), and a man had told her she could get a very lucrative government scholarship - but had to pay him $10,000 if she got it. 

My Dad called me very upset, and I told him that sounded very dodgy and she should be careful. She started to yell at us all, telling my hysterical Mum that she 'wouldn't even tell her when she got home from Malaysia' and that we didn't ever support her. Anyway, for that one I was blocked on Facebook for over 1.5 years.

Now, she's back living with my parents and I live in a town 1.5 hours away. We had a family get together on Sunday, and she told everyone her eyes had changed from brown to green. My whole family told her it wasn't true, and she defended herself. I was sitting next to her, and told her her eyes were brown. She got very defensive but I thought that was the end of the story. The next day, a cousin posted in a family chat that we should cook our Grandma's recipes for our next get together. I wrote back 'I shotgun pumpkin soup' because this was my favourite meal that Grandma cooked and her signature dish. I then got the following message from my sister:
""Can I honestly ask why you still act like a child with me. You turned that green eye thing yesterday into the most ridiculous argument all I was saying is I randomly now have green in my eyes and you had to attack me like it matters? I already told you I was making grandmas pumpkin soup weeks ago so you shotgun it on Facebook. I don't understand why you have to still be like this with me, I don't like doing this anymore, I don't know how else to explain it to you... don't bother seeing me anymore.""

I was dumbfounded. My Dad is sick, and she just ended a relationship so I understand she's stressed, but now I don't even know how to NOT upset her? 

My Mum and boyfriend agree, but tell me she's just stressed and to be nice.

I offered to talk through our 'communications issues', and admitted that this is a two way problem and we need to learn to talk, and she isn't responding to me. I called my Mum to talk to her, and she refused to answer the phone.

2 weeks ago, I mentioned that I wanted to fly QANTAS because I have a severe fear of flying, and she told me she would never travel with me because I don't know how to backpack. I told her I did, and she started yelling at me, saying I was attacking her. She ran to her room crying. I went and knocked on her door, and she wouldn't open it. She came out an hour later with tears pouring down her face, and told us she wasn't coming to the family movie day we had planned because I was a bitch.

I just really don't know how to talk to her. I think she's struggling but this has been a pattern her whole life - she once ran away from home and told everyone Mum was abusing her because Mum wouldn't let her use the car because she was drink driving. My Mum works hard, is stressed about Dad, and hates to see us fight. I'm sick of seeing my Mum cry over my Sister telling her she'll never talk to anyone again, so my Mum is forced to give in so she won't disappear for a year+. But she's 26 now, what do I do?

If anyone has a similar problem please help!

I'm looking for a RP where instead of being the victim that gets corrupted by some creep, I probably want it just as much, if not more than you do. I'll probably RP as a teen (12-16 depending), and would like you to be around 40-45. I am a sucker for sugar daddy fantasies, and getting expensive gifts and things like that, and hopefully some good sex as well! I've got a few role ideas below, I hope you like some of them!

I have a few role and age ideas, between 12 and 16, depending on what you like! Am I a 12-year-old goody two shoes catholic school girl, who knows a thing or two that she shouldn't? Am I a Korean business man's 13-year-old daughter who is far too spoiled and unsupervised for her own good? 14-year-old daughter of an Arab oil tycoon, who went on Ashley Madison behind her parents' back? A 15-year-old aspiring Instagram thot from Brazil, doing, ahem... ""photoshoots"" on bored CEOs' yachts? Or maybe a 16-year-old Londoner, who's stockings and tight little pencil skirts definitely didn't have anything to do with her getting that prestigious black female empowerment internship, or something?

You decide! As long as there's a big, white cock, with lots of cum inside (and money behind it) that I'm allowed to suck on, I'm happy :)

My kinks and limits are in my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/yFXEEfy.png), and for other things I enjoy are size differences (me being petite, and you being tall and muscular), sexy/slutty outfits for me, men in suits, and I don't like kissing or being eaten out.

You should know that I'm a total size queen, both in the conventional sense of the word, and with replies. Rather than being the first to finish, put some effort into what you're writing. I'd like to hear a description of your character, you mentioning rubber ducks, as well as some ideas for the RP!

Also, since I know that some of you are going to rush this, I'm just going to say that I would prefer you to take your time with a good reply, rather than rush a crappy one. If I like your writing and ideas though, we can talk here, or on Discord or Chatzy if you prefer :)"

Now to the Story:


We begin at the point where alle Corps chosed to let FCON falling down. My Corp was in the move time. Moveing Caps from Immensea to Detorid to Insmother to Cache to Outer Passage to Cobalt Edge where the now democratic voted home would be. BTW i was the only one who was not for INP from the beginning but nvm. The Moving felt like wow we have more Caps that we are movinf actually then FCON had as Cap Fleet so why FCON lost the war?! 


We arrived at Cobald Edge at E0DR-G lots of things planned what we will change in the new home rebuild our corp own newbie program and rented the Systen CUT-0V after long unnessecary discussions. The most important members left in the time of the move and some other after we arrived there and build the 0815 shit up again. 
A was pretty happy about the easy auth system that INP has and was happy to carebear again a little bit to earn a few ISKies after the burn out that i had from FCON Departments (i worked in the Recruiting Deparment and SRP Department). 


But things started to go wrong as Hell. Im definitly not the best PvP’er but an active one and from my past where i played Professional eSports i had in every game an eye on my stats. So zKB was also i thing where i throw an eye on every now and then. What i saw was horrible INP losing more and more against the beloved HKRAB Guys. Most tries to help the Rorq was a big waste of Time and ISK and that was the fault to the High Command in INP. Lets be fair. You get an intel about a tackeld Rorq and the FC is calling Cormorants o.O ?!? REALLY ?!? So i started to throw an eye on the unnamed High Command and Military Leader *cough* Bruce Ernaga *cough*.
IDK but i heared him a few time on Comms and had all the time the feeling that he is … idk cant discribe that in words what i thought about him … 


but i felt like he loved to be the Alliance Leader and abusing his Power as Alliance Leader and couldnt be cool in strange situations and is very emotional and aggressive if others have a different opinion to him. 
For example. The whole Alliance knows that HRKAB is logged with their Supers in INP Pocket Space and also that their maybe just rolling WHs just for fun until they find a WH to this Pocket and the upper Killmail Dates are the proof for this.


For me as an 1y old Player my Opinion for that would be a 1-2 week ban for Rorq. Its something like dont feed the troll. But INP throw Rorq one after the other to HKRAB and if the wolfs is hungry and find food he definitly come back see above! 


A few other smaler things between the newbro corp intern things gone wrong and some other unimportant Stuff. After 2 Weeks of worthless Discussion i made the decision to leave the whole bunch of suicide gamers that love to throw their hard earned stuff to one of the best PvP guys in this whole game.


After my leaving i still watched the zKB from my old Alliance and if we look up no changes overall. So for me my Decision to look for another Alliance and Corp was the best i made in my EvE Career. 


at the end im sorry for my piglike english im not native english speaker and this was my 1st longer post on reddit 

hope you enjoyed it

Hello hello hello! r/kc, i love this subreddit, i view every single post and relate soo much! and one of few subreddits in which i leave my lurker status.  

I'll introduce myself, i'm an 18 yo china kid, born and raised in italy. I've been introduced to this industry by joining culinary high school (4 hours worth of cooking in the school kitchen once a week, and it's really not that satisfying, not anymore, at least) in mornings i go to school to learn w/e math or history class for example and in the evenings i bartend in a fusion all you can eat restaurant.  
The question is, Is it still a viable option to just say fuck it all and buy an one way ticket to paris to slave work my way into a possibly famous restaurant and learn  **A LOT**, i've already done internships in a couple of nice kitchens, one even starred, but in my day to day life i'm starting to really get ""lamed"" out in this routine that feel like a total waste of time that has been holding me back.   

I'm conviced that one day i will be able to manage my own kitchen (i outclass all my peers, i really wish it wasn't like this) I often argue with my cook-teacher during lab hours (one day we literally argued whether or not rice contains gluten, after a google search he later apologized to me but still he has no idea what things like cream of tartar or baking soda are for, difference between yeasts etc) i feel like i still have a WHOLE lot to learn and a friend of mine i met at work is planning to open an ambitious restaurant in a couple years in Milan and he said that i'm definitely his first candidate so far (he loves my attitude, i really try my best to give the best service so if the other servers fuck up it really pisses me off for example) so the pressure is high.  
In my mind, i'm so ready to work my ass off 14 hour days 7 days a week for free, but i was questioning my options right now, and wondering which would be the best way to go.  
My friend said that he would like for me to finish school first but it really feels like a huge waste of time recently.  
I do not speak a word of french (could learn quick i guess) but i speak english fluently enough, I've been making phone calls for starred restaurants in italy asking for stages with room and board with little success.  
The point being, i'm truly inspired, nowadays i dedicate all of my little free time into watching and reading culinary related information.  
My dream right now is to earn a michelin star(i know, i know) for the sole reason that i can shove it in the face of the people who didn't believe in me (so everyone i know), my boss for example pressures me into working as a maitre d(not really) for the rest of my life because i'm very good at reading clients' thoughs and have the best knowledge about the menu etc.  
what do i do"
7p7h5u,0,2018-01-09,M4A - TV Comedies (and other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7p7h5u/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development*, and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them. With the first two, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be had with the unique structures, recurring gags, and one-off characters.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7p7p9b,84,2018-01-09,My [19M] girlfriend [19F] of a little over a year wants to do an internship where she won't be able to see me for two months.,capitaladequacy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7p7p9b/my_19m_girlfriend_19f_of_a_little_over_a_year/,"***EDIT:*** The five responses I got were enough to make me realize I was the one being stupid. I just texted her and apologized for questioning her decision, told her I realized that the problem was me, and let her know I was excited and happy for her to do this internship this summer. Thank you guys for helping me out.

Hi /r/relationships.

My GF and I rarely fight about anything - we have barely argued the entire time we've been together, since we typically communicate really well and give each other time to cool down if one of us is angry. It's both of our first relationship but it's working out really well. We've been together since October '16 and I love her more than I ever thought I could love someone.

We both go to the same relatively competitive state school on the East Coast. She's a psychology major who intends to go to grad school and eventually do clinical psych research. I'm a CS major, math minor who wants to become a software developer or do quant finance. We always talk about how we want to be a ""power couple"" together and we're both pretty serious, career focused people - we're in college, but both of us don't party or drink much. :)

The thing is, I'm really worried about her choice of summer internship. This summer she wants to volunteer with aggressive or difficult children and adolescents in a two-month program where she won't have internet access 6 days a week. She's doing a job that these children's parents don't have the resources to do, and that's extremely valuable. She's also excited about the clinical experience she'll get there - she already has some lab experience, but she wants more to improve her chances for grad school.

The thing is, this will be incredibly isolating, difficult, and I'm afraid it will make her miserable. We text each other every day, and on long breaks (like this 3-week winter break) we've skyped a few times. Both of us have issues that we lean on each other about - I am type 2 bipolar (medicated well, so I'm not too bad) and she has a very difficult family life and a bad relationship with her father (for a variety of reasons). I just don't understand why she would choose to not be able to communicate with the outside world for weeks on end while handling adolescents with severe behavioral issues when she has other internship options, like a program where she would work with children with ADHD - but be able to go home at night and do the things she wants to.

It really, really upsets me that not only do I think she will be suffering during the program, but also that I won't be able to see or text her for so long. I feel like she's not holding up her end of the relationship - like she's abandoning me and she doesn't care about being together.

What should we do? What should I say to her? Is the problem just me and my mental health issues/bipolar, and maybe I need to go back to therapy? (I'm open to hearing that I'm the asshole here.)

Thank you guys :)

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend wants to do a summer program that will prevent her from seeing or talking to me for months that I think will make her miserable. It's hurting me to see her make this decision. I know it's her call, but how do we get over this?"

I have been lurking this sub for a long time and feel I have a basic understanding of what I should be doing with my money. I am a 22 year old college student approaching my last semester of school and need advice on what to do with my earnings this upcoming semester.

Here is a breakdown of my current situation:

- 2,987 in checking account
-1,000 in savings account
- Part time internship making 18/h working 18 hours a week, bring home about 530 every two weeks after taxes
- Only real expenses are groceries and gas which total out to about 100 every two weeks.
- Student loans are about 60k in a mix of private and federal loans.
- Plan on living at home for at least a year after college to pay back as much as my loans as possible
-Full time offer at my internship for 55k/year once I graduate

I was wondering if it would be wise to start a Roth IRA and put money in every month this semester or to save up to pay my loans off for after I graduate. Thank you."

Im not part of a MSP, im looking to use this for internal IT documentation. We are in the process of rolling over from BYOD to company owned devices and as of right now have about 30 of 150 machines out there, 25 being windows and 5 being macs. We were using Kaseya for our windows machines and Addigy for our macs but just this morning signed on with Connectwise so we will be migrating our windows machines over to that. I have heard that Boost has really robust Connectwise integration, is it better than ITGlue's integration?

Now i know that there is no Addigy integration with Boost so thats already a mark against it but i keep coming back to pricing. For the most part im a 1 man shop here covering ~150 people. I do have an intern that works with me but he is your standard college kid so he doesnt have a ton of responsibilities yet. My issue with ITGlue is that it has a 5 user minimum and with needing at minimum 2 data connections that puts me at the $29/user pricing which comes out to be $2240 the first year after adding the setup fee for just 2 users whereas i can do ITBoost for $1000 a year.

Since im a 1 man show my time for the most part is fairly limited so i am concerned with the whole ""you get what you put into it"" philosophy behind a documentation platform. Maybe the better question out of all of this is: **Is it better to potentially waste $1000 on a lesser product than spend $2240 on a better product?**"

Whenever anything goes wrong in the car, no matter who does the damage, I'm in charge for fixing it up (because the others are unemployed). And I have to refill the gas no matter who drives it. And nobody seems to care and just takes the car out whenever they want many times a week. I'm also the one that has to drive my mom everywhere because she doesn't want to get a license; she feels it's strange for women to have their licenses and drive themselves around (extemelry conservative south Asian household). 

My dad organized a trip for himself to Pakistan, which is fine because his ailing father lives there. Then he organized a trip to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage which is absolutely infuriating to me because he might get FIRED from his job soon for being an ass in general, and may soon not have any income. But here he is spending extra on plane tickets. And here's the rest of my siblings, demanding clothes and gifts from Pakistan. None of them work except my older brother, who does not ask for gifts and stuff from Pakistan. I don't get how they can think about frivolous spending when my dad's career is on the line and when NONE OF THEM CONTRIBUTE FINANCIALLY. Why do we have to get shit from Pakistan every time someone goes? Just visit your family and come back. But no, it's a 6 week trip followed by a pilgrimage and littered with spending. Then he asked me if I could give my mom $400 every two weeks while he is gone. I already give my mom $200 a month, I don't make THAT much money, I have my own loans. My mom doesn't work and is a homemaker (extremely conservative south Asian household, never has, I don't resent her for this). When he asked me if I could give my mom some money while he was gone I was ready to step up but then he gave me that number and I was super upset, I told him I had my own loans and stuff to save up for. Now I feel guilty for semi-declining, as I will still help out to the extent I can, but now I'll have to find a part time job on top of my full-time and taking a night class at university. 

On top of it all my sister seems to have BPD and generally makes life miserable for everyone, while demanding the most. My younger brother is a bit of an ass to everyone recently, and my mom is overworking me. Every time I come home from work and want to wind down she always has some errand for me to run, something for me to do. I'm the one shoveling the snow and doing all the heavy lifting. 

Cherry on top is that they don't like that I don't believe in Islam and have heavily indicated that I'm essentially dead to them if I marry of my own free will, especially outside Islam. Makes me wonder why I even bother. 

Here's where I'm disappointed in myself. This morning as I was leaving for work my dad told me to take his duffel bag in exchange for my gym bag since mine is bigger, for the duration of his trip to Pakistan. I was visibly annoyed by this and emptied my bag and told him to take it, but it was obvious I was doing it grudgingly. Then I didn't really give him a proper goodbye despite the fact he would be leaving to Pakistan later before I got back. I said bye but nothing fancy, just bye and left. And I'm angry that I finally decided to show my frustration over everything on a fucking gym bag. 

But yeah I'm losing my easygoing personality and becoming perpetually angry with everything. Dunno what to do. "

It seems most people see increases in GPA as they advance, but mine is dropping.

I barely put any effort into my 1L year and my school grades on a 2.8 curve for 1L courses and a 3.1 for everything after. I’m spending way more time on these elective classes and I do well in class answering questions, but every essay exam gets low grades. 

And it makes no sense because all of my internships have been very heavy in legal writing and they can’t say enough good things about what I do. I have written statutory language at my current position that has ended up as law. I write ALJ opinions, directors orders, and have drafted a half dozen contracts. 

I have met with a couple professors and it has all boiled down to just not answering the question the exact way they wanted. The rule is there, the cites are there, the analysis is there but there is apparently just some magical thing I’m missing. I look at what I write next to other students and it is the same thing, if not better. 

It is just annoying as hell to watch my GPA plummet this close to graduation. "

7pbbs5,7,2018-01-09,"The Pretender (M, 29 France)",Vagabundum,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/7pbbs5/the_pretender_m_29_france/,"Typed the first sentence 7 times, because how do you start your life’s story.
At the very beginning? Came on this planet much like 99.98% of the rest of the population.
I’m a bit caught between different cultures, heritages, as it relevant for the story;
Today I’m A Dutch American French South African mix – Most of it is by blood and the French part by choice.

My childhood was a colorful one, my father sexually abused me, and my mother was immature and hopped from disastrous boyfriend to another. So, after about 5 years on this planet contact with my father was broken and I picked quickly upon the fact that this wasn’t an epic start of a life.
By the age of 8 I had recovered somewhat and knew that I had to get money to be able to take control of my own life. It took me a couple of years a lot of luck and right time and the right moment.
I was able to earn some money with computers, first repairing, and helping people around me with software issues – the good old times with bluescreens driver issues and unexplainable stops errors etc. 
And our friend google was not there to help people out. But with a drive that this was my ticket out, I was relentless in resolving issues. I started earning money, getting more know-how and slowly but certainly despite being way to young for any of it people around town started trusting me to do their things. I jumped on the internet wave, webhosting – creation of sites and basically anything else that allowed me to earn money. The money I earned I split into 3; Part went back into first my not so incorporated Company, later with the help of the IRS and my mom I created a proper company.
Secondly I put money in my education , so bored at school that I was close of getting kicked out.
Once I was able to afford private school, and speed up 2+ years into one everything was better.
And lastly in getting stuff for an adult life – I was by no means an adult at this point 13-14 years old.
But I had to emancipate, my mom a dear sweet soul never any bad intentions was able to auto-destruct her life (and everyone close to her) every 2-3 years. 
With the right financial data, equipment, and “maturity” and no real objection from my mom I was able to emancipate.
I skip a bit ahead; 
The webhosting industry is starting to be ruled by the likes of Lycos servage and other hosters that oversell the capacity (One server of 100gb, you buy 10gb; they would put 15 or even 20 clients on one server) I did not like this, I felt this was cheating and so got soon priced out of the market.
Was able to sell the company to one of the big boys made some money in the process.
And joined a Cyber unit – when Cyber wasn’t even cyber yet – and hacking was still cute and not something that could turn off all the electricity centrals or open prison cells.
In continued studying and working in parallel for a government first in cyber later as navy officer when my tour was done, I rejoined cyber but only for a couple of hours per month.
Because while trying to build my very own startrek voice interface I met a group of trekies online.
I like the show, for all it’s values (robots with rights, equality, resource based economy, self-improvement over greed). But I have never considered myself a trekkie.
Anyway, in this group there was a woman – a French girl, sweet kind openminded intelligent and so on.
We got to chat quite a bit, and slowly I started to like her. And as I was way to busy escaping my family in my teens I had not really done a lot of dating, in fact I think the closes I came to kiss a girl was in meetings. And in reality it was also very far from my mind at that time, part of me I guess did not really think this part of life was for me.
Anyway back to the track; we met up a few times in France – Lille.  And well I can’t tell you how afraid I was of going there – Everything I knew about the French (granted that wasn’t a whole lot) wasn’t good.
Arrogant, hostile against foreigners, smelling surrender monkeys – needless to say; not the place you select to have a first date if you thought you could convince the girl to come to your side of the ocean.
We met up, it clicked very well, we met up a few more times (Yes this was exhausting) and made plans to live together. As her job was very French-orientated and unable to do it anywhere but in France I proposed I move to the Capital of the French (by this time I appreciated them a bit more, positive experience in Lille) So I did, I stopped my study, company, 1st job, 2nd job and moved to France.
Speaking the absolute basic French, from school *-* and Yes everything you think you know, they’ll show you in about 5 seconds you really don’t – The bastards leave whole words out when speaking!
I was in love, I was willing to clean the toilets professionally if I had too.
Luckily I did speak 2 other languages on top of English,  German and Dutch and was able to bank on that.
French Ecommerce company- Amazon look a like saw that I spoke a language they liked and that I was an entrepreneur “oui oui very nice!” so they hired me on the spot. Having had no real ecommerce experience, I tried to suck in everything I could, working in front of the arc de triumph. 
With colleagues who were fine speaking a form of English with me and a lovely girlfriend at home.
For the first time I felt like I did not need to run, escape or take care of myself. Life was good, I was performing great at my job got salary raise after salary raise and promotions. Starting to make friends, discovered that I was actually a likeable person, I really had no idea before.

Of course nothing is perfect, and the company was starting to perform poorer – bad management, so when one of my clients invited me over to work for them I was a bit thorn between my manager and team – the loveliest people ever and an opportunity to do new things. They wanted me to lead a smaller ecommerce company in The Netherlands (100 people) but I was 23 at this point so opportunity of a life time.  I took the job travelled between my home in France and the Netherlands every weekend back with the train, had an amazing time working with competent people that despite the fact that 80% of the company was older than me, let me be their CEO. I made it a point to do everything with everyone.
Marketing in the morning, customer care in the afternoon, after sales later that day, administration before the night shift started, and running with the warehouse employees to pack and ship stuff late at night. Sharing pizza with the warehouse guys - my fondest memory of that time. 
I enjoyed every single day, in the morning one of the team leaders would call me when they were close to my home – as an alarm I would wake up shower and get in the car to drive to the industrial part where we were. I would work till the last shipment was sent at 22:00 and signing and whistling closing the whole company.
So what went wrong? Well the founder he had embezzled money and integrity is very important for me so I had a choice to make; Stay, profit from the scheme. Report it to the gov and potentially have 100 people lose their job, or leave.

So yeah, I left – back to France where it was going to be a hell to find a job Hello I’m 24 years old and I was CEO – Where is my office please? 
7-8 interviews later, all more or less the same replies: You sound like a nice guy, and we would love to hire you but you’ll never be happy with 35.000 Euro per year.
And I replied: Really, money isn’t important to me (it never was, it has always been a means too escape and once that was done I did not care too much about it anymore) 
Their reply: No you say that now, but  in 3 months you’ll ask for a raise.

Finally a person that worked in the French company where I started was looking for someone – so I sent her a message and long story short they were perfectly happy underpaying me!
And no after three months I did not ask for a raise, in fact I never asked for a raise – they gave me one every 6 months but I never asked for one in the 6 years I worked for them.
In the company I did business development, System Administration, Localization, email marketing, programming, and I moved whole floors. 
And on the side I went back into Cyber for the gov – to feel useful, part of something bigger
The company went through an economic crisis and, so I did whatever needed to be done – I guess partly out of loyalty the company that gave me a job.
At the end the company went down under, and together with the employees and an investment group I launched with 2 other employees a take over bid.
We won, and I became effectively one of the top managers, with the remaining staff (company of 140 now only 33 left) we wanted this to be a new start. We were kind of family having gone through this corporate hardship.
The investment group had other ideas, and tasked me with firing more then half of the employees in 6 months’ time.

6 Months later: 20 people less, company profitable and me disgusted with myself, I left.

I wanted to go back to the states, or travel the world do anything to refresh. Earlier I had made a joke to some of the co-workers that instead of traveling I would go and flip burgers. My mom with all her faults was an excellent chef and I had given as much time as possible to “cook” in soup kitchens.
Some of the former employees thought this was a great idea, and wanted to “come with” if I indeed did decide to open a restaurant. Overcome with guilt, the decision was an easy one:
World trip for me
Or restaurant for others too.

I had no idea how difficult that was going to be though, getting a bank to say “Sure, a Deputy-CTO marketing manager, email manager a director an intern digital media want to open a restaurant that sounds like a GREAT idea” was a hard ask. And it took a lot of convincing, but in the end, they did say yes.
American chef with his gang opening a resto in Paris – I felt proud, and that’s not something I feel often.

But what was supposed to be a dream, a place that everyone could go to work with fun.
Turned into a drama, two of the associates turned against each other and made working together a living hell. Despite their loyalty and respect towards the resto and myself they just couldn’t help themselves.
The restaurant ran well though, despite the predictions that if you are not from the industry you won’t make it for more than 6 months. 
But on a personal level this wasn’t a success, this was supposed to be a heaven for us all.
And not a source of misery, so I left and gave the restaurant to the associate who looked like he had the most chance to make it on his own.

I started working full time for the gov, but that too was short lived with a change of leadership at the top of the gov.
And finally, I joined a cute friendly company.

If I focused on my professional life that’s mostly because my personal life was less eventful I stayed with the same girl for 10 years, we broke up shortly before I joined my current company, she did not want kids – horrible world – and I … well see bellow I’m kind of thorn.
And my mother died 2 months ago, I put her a bit on a side track in my life – we were kind of in contact but not very active and while I was aware that she could die, you always think you have more time. 
I try to live life without regrets, and think that “ you made the best decision you could given everything that was available back then” trust my “old self”  - but I can’t help to feel remorse on top of being sad of course . That I held her at arm’s length for most of my adult life 

And here comes the reason for sharing my life story, and I realize asking anyone to read that much boring text above is not kind – so if you did, thank you *-* and if you are ever around Paris I’ll buy you a drink and listen to your life story!

TLDR:  I have done everything from entrepreneurship to the navy from sales to marketing, I have led people and heroes I have been led by people and heroes; but I have a big problem:
I feel like there is nothing in life that is complicated; cannot be understood or is a mystery.
By no means does that mean I “know” everything. No, it’s more the feeling that once you are behind the scenes of something it isn’t that complicated. Many times, in my life I have been told “this is really complicated” only to find out that in a month or two you can not only understand everything you can teach it to someone else. 
For most of my life I have been to busy to stand still and think: What is life, what is our goal and what should I be doing. 
But since a couple of years I can think more and more about it, and I switch between the:
A.	I would like to meet the girl of my dreams (I might have, she might be working in the same company as me 😊) have kids, let my kids have kids and enjoy everything in between before you kick the bucket.
B.	 And then there is my other side, that is questioning why we should go trough all the hoops.
How honorable useful engaging your job or your life is; there is no real goal in life and even humanity itself we are going nowhere. Realistically a lot of us love to play games even if at the end we change a few bytes or move a ball from one place to another for 90 minutes.
But I think we can also be honest enough to say that a lot of us are utterly miserable on this planet. 
I’ll always prefer to take the negative experience over giving it to someone else.
Effort pain or whatever is involved I rather have it 3 times happen to me then it happens to you if I can help it.  
So, I’m not sure in good conscience I can have kids knowing that they might be very happy pandas, or depressed suicidal persons.

OK so don’t have kids; yep that seems like a logical conclusion but for me personally I’m not okay to keep playing football if there is no point. Having kids, raising them sharing the good and the bad moments that at least gives purpose and can justify playing along in the system.

I guess by sharing my life, I was hoping to see if there are some similar thinking people out there.

Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7pd7k2,5,2018-01-09,Help! I've broken 4 bits on a single part and I don't know why.,sniporbob,CNC,https://www.reddit.com/r/CNC/comments/7pd7k2/help_ive_broken_4_bits_on_a_single_part_and_i/,"Edit: steel is A36 Hot Rolled

I'm milling out a piece of steel plate with a 0.125"" 4 flute carbide AlTiN end mill. The fourth end mill just broke, and after trying something different with each one I'm out of ideas.

The operation has been an attempt to make 241 round pockets that are 0.37"" diameter, 0.13"" deep. The pockets are recesses for screw heads. Prior to using the end mill, a center drill was used to pilot the middle of the pocket, then it was drilled to depth with a 0.125"" drill.

The end mill is a Carbi-Universal 4 flute square end solid carbide end mill with AlTiN coating. Diameter of the flutes and shank are both 0.125"", length of cut seems like 0.6"" measured with a caliper although the docs say 0.75"", shoulder length 0.8"", tool stick out 0.85"" (in reality it's adjacent to the shoulder). I used HSMAdvisor for the speeds and feeds in case you want to follow along, and tried a variety of settings as detailed later in this post.

The machine being used is a Shopbot PRS Alpha. It has a 4HP spindle and the RPMs can be set anywhere from 5K to 18K. There is both a LARGE shopvac pulling vacuum on a skirt around the bit to suck up airborne chips, as well as a compressed air line directed to blast air at the end of the bit and hopefully clear the chips out of the area being machined.

The steel plate weighs quite a bit on its own (dimensions 24""x24""x0.25"") and was fastened to the bed with 8 clamps and 8 screws around all the edges.

Attempt #1 was a plunge straight into the hole previously drilled by the drillbit to the full 0.13"" depth, then a spiral outward with 4.9% stepover. 18K RPM and (if I recall correctly) 103 ipm feedrate. The speed and feed settings were straight out of HSMAdvisor with the chip thinning and HSM checkboxes enabled. This attempt made it through probably 40 pockets before it started throwing sparks, and after about 10 more pockets and considerable quantities of sparks the bit snapped. The corners of the bit were completely rounded over and it seemed that all of the flute in contact with the steel had chipping, though it looked to some degree like it was maybe the coating that chipped off the carbide? I'm not sure if that's even possible but that's kind of how it looked.

Attempt #2 I realized that it might not be a great idea to try milling without somewhere for the chips to go (the first bit broke shortly after the plunge) so I changed from a plunge to a helix entry. It appears the end mill can center cut but I set the helix dimensions so that the very center of the bit was confined to being over the previously drilled hole. I used a 1 degree helix angle which came out to 0.0036"" pitch. RPM for the helix was 8271 and the feedrate was 13.73 ipm, which is straight out of HSMAdvisor. After the helix reached 0.13"" depth, speeds and feeds went back to the same as attempt number 1 to mill out the remainder of the pocket. The bit lasted longer than attempt number 1, but not by much. Failure was preceded by a huge amount of sparks for several of the pockets. The broken bit had an identical appearance to attempt #1, with perhaps slightly more intact corners.

Attempt #3 used the same helix settings, but I unchecked the HSM checkbox which brought the RPM and feedrate way down. I forgot to write down the settings but I think it was somewhere in the 11K or 12K range for RPM, and whatever the corresponding feedrate would be according to HSMAdvisor. Still 4.9% stepover. Basically, I used the default HSMAdvisor settings for the bit plus the chip thinning checkbox. Tool life was approximately the same as attempt #2. At the end, the bit had the same appearance as from attempt #2. Funny story: I stepped out to the restroom and asked an intern to keep an eye on the machine. The bit started throwing sparks, which freaked the guy out. He aborted the operation and sprayed the steel plate and bit with a water squirt bottle because he thought it was on fire haha.

Attempt #4 used reduced RPM and feedrate in an attempt to get more life out of the tool. There were only a few pockets remaining after attempt number 3, so the vast majority of attempt #4 was simply enlarging all the previous pocket diameters because I measured an abnormally small screw when designing the CAD file. This means there was no helix necessary since a decent size pocket already existed. I set HSMAdvisor to 75% speed. The settings were 8668 RPM, 49.91 ipm, 37.455 ipm lead in and lead out (this is 75% of the feedrate), 4.9% stepover, .13"" depth of cut. Tool life was approximately the same, perhaps just slightly better, and the broken bit at the end looked the same as the prior 2 attempts. However, this time there were no sparks when the bit failed.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point. There is a single 4 flute flat end mill remaining in this size. I suspect a 0.125"" end mill should be able to machine FAR more material than what I've been able to accomplish, but perhaps that is not the case?

I'm completely open to suggestions here, especially regarding feeds and speeds. Bit selection is extremely limited however. There is the single remaining 0.125"" 4 flute AlTiN flat end mill, and a few of the same but with a ballnose. There are several smaller diameter 4 flutes with AlTiN, both flat and ballnose. We have these same sizes/coating in 2 flute, which I am given to believe is inferior for steel. The next largest size up is a 0.25"" 2 flute uncoated carbide bit that I think is made for wood but looks just like a long center cutting end mill.

Any help is greatly appreciated!"
7pd8me,63,2018-01-09,Why I think Lance Taylor should be considered for the next Panther OC.,The__Brofessor,panthers,https://www.reddit.com/r/panthers/comments/7pd8me/why_i_think_lance_taylor_should_be_considered_for/,"Hi!

I want to start off by saying I'm not a expert.  I don't watch tons of tape.  I'm a fan that hasn't missed a game in nearly ten years, and I'm an experienced fantasy football GM.

That being said.  I think Lance Taylor, our current WRs coach, should be our next OC.

So first, let's take a look at who Lance Taylor is so far.  From [Panthers.com](http://www.panthers.com/team/coaches/lance-taylor/244c311d-61fb-4a65-b317-7817150d3b5b)

&gt;COACHING

&gt; Lance Taylor returns to Carolina in 2017 as the team’s wide receivers coach after being the running backs coach at Stanford for three seasons from 2014-16. He previously served as the Panthers’ assistant wide receivers coach in 2013.

&gt; While at Stanford, Taylor played a key role in the development of Heisman Trophy candidate Christian McCaffrey. In 2015, McCaffrey set a school record with 2,019 rushing yards to earn Associated Press Player of the Year honors. At the same time, Taylor guided McCaffrey to team highs of 45 receptions, 645 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns, making him the only FBS player to lead his team in rushing and receiving yards.

&gt; During his first stint with the Panthers in 2013, Taylor contributed a team that won the NFC South. He worked with a receiving corps that featured three players with more than 500 receiving yards and at least four receiving touchdowns.

&gt; Prior to joining Carolina, Taylor spent three seasons with the New York Jets from 2010-12, serving as a coaching intern in 2010, offensive quality control coach in 2011 and assistant tight ends/quality control coach in 2012. As assistant tight ends coach, Taylor helped tight ends Jeff Cumberland and Dustin Keller rank second and third on the team with 29 and 28 catches, respectively.

&gt; In 2009, Taylor coached wide receivers at Appalachian State. Under his tutelage, the Mountaineers set school records with 284 receptions and 3,621 receiving yards. The team finished 11-3, won the Southern Conference title and advanced to the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision semifinals.

&gt; He began his coaching career as a graduate assistant for Nick Saban at his alma mater, Alabama, from 2007-08.

So already, we know he has experience with the panthers organization.  He knows CMC.  And he has been in the coaching scene for the last decade.  

Now here is why I don't want people like Norv Turner.  I honestly, don't want an experienced guy.  In my opinion, the good experienced guys are already locked up or want to be Head Coaches.  I want the next best thing.  I want the guy everyone is going to want as a HC in 5 years.  To me, that potential is in Lance Taylor. 

If you look around the league, there is a coaching problem.  Many older coaches with the same conservative ideas are good at turning an organization around.  But not at getting to the next level.  But younger coaches with fresh ideas are the hot commodity right now, look at the Pats coordinators or KCs.  

If you look at the Rams, McVay is the youngest Head Coach in the NFL.  And to me, that's what the NFL needs.  He's backed bye one of the most experienced defensive minds in the NFL (Wade Philips).  We can have a similar situation.  Ron is a great defensive minded head coach, who has the respect of the locker room.  We need OC who can get creative, who can bring fresh ideas, who can get creative like McVay was as a OC with Washington.

Give the guy a shot.  With it will come risk.  He's never been an OC before.  But the next great coach needs to get his opportunity with someone.  Is that Lance?  I don't know.  But I'd be excited about his potential.

**TL;DR**::Give the youngster a shot.  Roll the dice.  Let's get some fresh ideas with the talent that's on this offense."

Discovered this place and realized what a needed insight y'all might have for me. 

------

So I'm (27/M) a student living off loans and part time work, he's (33/M) a bank executive. We couldn't be at more different places in our lives, including when we met (again) back in Feb 2017. But we actually had a lot in common, including our sexuality -- both bi and both never formally dated a guy.

We first met four years earlier when I was a security guard at the building he worked at. I noticed him right off the bat but was closeted at the time and never put much thought into him other than attraction, even when he became super friendly toward me. Kinda just denied any signs to the contrary that I later found out were there.

Anyway, I stop working there after awhile, never mentioned a word to him so I essentially disappear one day. Four years later, we run into each other at a bar and have a sort of drunken reunion. I'm mostly closeted and so at the time, the friends I was with had no clue about my sexuality. I basically ignore them as he was super forthcoming and wouldnt stop talking to me like we were old pals or something (we really weren't). But hes fucking hot so I just keep going with it. They eventually leave and many drinks further he finally admits that he is and has been attracted to me. I fuckin died. I have limited experience with guys and have a hard time finding any so this was like a wish come true. Plus he's hot as hell.

Fast forward six months, we've been hooking up the entire time. Hes mostly closeted too but introduces me to several of his friends, but we're just hooking up and both are clear on this though we wouldn't discuss it til much later. Mostly, we just enjoy the hell out of each other, but with our busy schedules it sort of becomes default exclusive.

April 2017 I find out I got an internship for the fall semester in another city about 7 hours away. We were both busy that month so I didn't tell him til like mid May about it. Totally said in passing. Nothing much made of it.

We have a great summer and even went away together twice (met him on a work trip to Cali and then we went to the beach for a weekend). I really fell in love with him by the end of the summer but couldn't tell if it was just the anticipation of leaving and surely would not say a word about it.

Come August, he starts really letting on how much he'll miss me. I'm too insecure not to make it into some sarcastic joke like, ""bet you actually can't wait to get rid of me,"" blah blah.

Late August, I'm days from leaving and he's desperate for my time, looking to meet me after work everyday and have me stay over. I'm unsure of what to make of all it which in retrospect is so stupid on my part. I just can't stop denying things to myself.

Anyway, two nights before I'm leaving, he mentions how we've never defined what our relationship is. We get to discussing the last 6+ months and how crazy it is that we've gotten to this point after meeting so randomly years ago.

At some point I mention how it'd be weird for us to become officially exclusive just as I'm leaving and how I don't think it'd be fair to either of us nor make sense. He doesn't really respond much but kinda acts nonchalant about the whole thing. He was so fuckin confusing and caused me so much anxiety...

Day before I'm leaving, I meet him for a quickie and to say goodbye. Before I leave, he tells me that he just wants to make it clear that I'm the one who doesn't want to commit to anything. I was fuckin floored. After all of this time! I tell him I'll commit. We agree to it and I leave.

I'm away at my internship, him and I texting, skyping as much as possible. A ton in the beginning and then much less so as we both became increasingly busy throughout September and October.

I come home twice before thanksgiving, one of which I don't even tell my parents I'm coming and just stay with him. It's this time that he tells me that he loves me. Now, I gotta reiterate, neither of us have much history with men, much less in terms of a relationship. In fact, both of us have long histories of dating women. So this is crazy to me. A lot to think about and deal with.

I don't immediately respond and he says it again, as if he knew the truth and demanded it from me. I tell him I love him too. The rest of the weekend is incredible and so fuckin hard to leave when the time comes.

This is where it gets horribly complicated. I come home for thanksgiving and I cannot wait to see him. Though he's weird and sorta seemed weird when we spoke the day before.

He went away to his parents for the holiday and came back that Saturday so when we finally hang out he tells me that he cheated on me and that it's been plaguing him. It sucked to hear but I kinda felt like I knew. I just wasn't surprised.

But I'm heartbroken and the worst part is that he admits that it happened the weekend before I came home earlier in the month. The weekend he told me he loved me. He even admits some bullshit (and I don't know what possessed him) that cheating on me made him realize that he did love me and that it made him realize that he couldn't capture what we had with anyone else.

I react calmly but break it off. I was already super insecure about this secret gay love affair I was having and this was kinda my excuse out, I admit. I reacted pretty rashly.

I go back to Albany. He texts me but I don't respond and he just let's me be. It's over. The next three weeks were brutal but I put my all into my internship and made a ton of connects and am super proud for pulling my shit together after all these years.

I come home for Christmas break on the 8th.

I wind up meeting up with this dude(22) from my school who I was attracted to and who was in one of my classes in the spring (also bi and masculine and you'd never guess he was into dudes. I don't know where they all started coming from all of sudden) and we hook up.

He admits he liked me and we're suddenly seeing each other.

On the 17th, I get a text from my SO/ex asking if I've gotten back yet. I tried to ignore him for about 5 hours and got weak and responded. Played it cool and just said ""hey, yeah I got back last week.""

He immediately asks if we can meet up. I tell him I'm not sure it's a good idea. He apologizes again and pleads with me to meet him.

So of course I can't get enough. We meet and I'm a complete asshole. Ugh I'm ashamed. I was so anxious I just threw back the drinks and became increasingly more of an asshole to him. He saw a side of me I thought I'd gotten past.

I waited for the right moment, told him to go fuck himself and stormed off, leaving him with my drink bill. I was such an asshole.

He apparently couldn't get enough and hits me up on Christmas Eve... apologizing to me. Smh. I immediately text him that I was the one who should be apologizing because I was horrible to him for no acceptable reason. He tells me I can make it up to him by meeting again. I tell agree to Thursday the 28th.

My birthday comes right after Christmas and he hits me up of course. I respond but can't help but be an asshole again and ignore him the rest of the day.

We meet Thursday night (I decided not to drink) and I finally allow us to talk like adults. He tells me again how sorry he is and that he really does love me, is miserable and doesn't want to lose me for good.

Honestly, what I felt the worst about, and told him, was how complicated he made our relationship. What we had was amazing and I feel like he forced an unnecessary relationship upon us and then proceeded to fuck it all up. I resent him so much for making me such an emotional wreck the last month and half. It was so hard coming down from that love high he shot me up with.

I left things with him saying I needed time. He said okay. He text to wish me a Happy New Year and then again the other day to see how I was doing (eagerly awaiting me to decide where we stand).

All the time, I've been sleeping with this other guy whose great and really into me. Only problem is, everything is so complicated.

Should I give my ex another chance? I gotta admit, a lot of my doubts about that path surrounds my sexuality and the fact that my parents don't know. And that relationship is already so intense... Shockingly, my ex told me that he came out to his brother and sister when he went home for Christmas and told them about us and how he fucked things up. He meant well but knowing this just raises the stakes and makes me feel even more anxiety.

This shit sucks.

Help me reddit, you're my only hope.

tl;dr: lover becomes boyfriend, cheats while I'm away for the semester, now wants to get back together and awaiting for me to decide while I see someone else"

7pefoy,0,2018-01-10,Incoming MS1 dating resident?,userwait4itname,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7pefoy/incoming_ms1_dating_resident/,"Hey guys,

I tried posting this exact same thing in r/medical school (not sure if it went through) but I thought I’d maybe try here too in case anyone else has been in any type of similar situation/has insight too. This isn’t my main account for obvious privacy reasons.

Background: Essentially, I’m a female (21) who has fortunately been admitted to some US MD schools (trad applicant) and will be matriculating in the fall. I work closely at hospital of my university with the surgical department and I met said resident over a year ago actually on his first day as an intern. We always got along really well and I rly enjoyed talking to him but never saw him that way until I friended all the first years I got close to on FB at the end of the year because they would be moving on from the service I work in. We started messaging and then texting and he asked me out for drinks pretty persistently. Given the age difference (he’s 29/30), I naively didn’t know how platonic what was happening was and I didn’t really see a future with him so at the end of the night I did not mind going back to his place and we had quite honestly the best sex of my life.

Flash forward 7 months now, and he is still kind of half in my life. We inconsistently see each other and rarely ever text in between (he hardly ever initiates too but is seemingly into it). We’ve gone on about 5 dates and will go sometimes 1-2 months without any communication where I think it’s done and then he’s back in my mind and my life again. The last time we saw each other, I tried to kind of address things for the first time without defining anything to see if we were still on the same page, and apparently we are. He told me he still wanted to see me and he just feels really bad because he often operates really late on Fridays and if he has to do work on Saturdays then he’s essentially shit out of luck. He said he would try to reach out more though but to no one’s surprise, we have not communicated since then (~1 month ago).

Rationally, I know he must not actually give a shit and I know that no matter how busy someone is, they always have time to shoot a quick text or two. Unfortunately, I do think I have developed some mild feelings for him that he’s probably unaware of, and I don’t really know what we are: probably that grey area between hook ups/friends with benefits and casually dating. The thing is that whenever I’m around him in person, I really do think he’s being genuine about his schedule and life and he often goes into a lot of detail unintentionally and when we are together, he is extremely mesmerized by everything I seem to say or do. He takes me to bars/places that we might see people he knows and will hold my hand/etc. as we walk around public. I feel that at best, he seems to be really good at compartmentalizing it and out of sight is out of mind but when I am there, he is really happy to be around me and at worst he truly does not give a single shit. A side note, hopefully without coming across as conceited, is that I’m a lot more conventionally attractive than him and my friends that do know are shocked and confused as to why I’m so hung up on it. I find him extremely attractive because of how well we get along and his personality/humor. 

I’m about to finish my final semester of college, I very well may be attending the same place for medical school and am interested in his sub-specialty unrelated to him. I guess I would really appreciate any comments/feedback about this general situation and what I should do moving forward? Just let it go completely and deal with it if I end up doing rotations in his department with him in medical school? Is there any chance that if I do stay for medical school (not bc of him at all) that this may be able to turn into something serious or has it been pretty fucked from the start? Tbh, I know that maybe it’s time to let it go but honestly I always seem to fuck up somehow and hit him up and the cycle starts again. 

tl;dr- been inconsistently seeing a flaky second year surgical resident for 7 months, and now kind of emotionally attached, rip.

EDIT:  Forgot to say, we have a lot of mutual friends from his year. I get invited to their parties a lot and have been on a weekend trip with two of our friends who are also second year residents without him. So if I were to drop him and stick around, I’d still stay friends with them and will kind of have to deal with him peripherally being there. 

Also so sorry for this long ass ramble guys, thanks for the feedback so far I really appreciate it all "

I've wanted to do a PhD for a while now, but I've been putting it off to dip my toes in first, both academically and professionally.



Since college I've gotten some good experience (a few internships and ~4 years of relevant paid work), an MA in the US, and have been living in my geographic area of interest. I've only become more passionate about investing in my research skills to answer questions. 



All of this hasn't erased my fear that going back to school will mean a great deal of sacrifice for very uncertain gains. Most of what I read online about the academic job market is discouraging. Worse, I've seen posts about alternative careers for people leaving PhD programs, and I suspect that I'm competitive for some non-academic jobs now (foreign service, political analysis, etc.) now. 

I really do want to go back for my PhD. Still, I'd like to look again before I leap, so to speak. 


How did/does everyone else weigh the pros/cons? Who would benefit from a PhD? Knowing what you do now, would you do it again?"

I'm in L&amp;S, but I heard it may be a better idea to take it with the engineering department, but again all the details are not clear.

Thanks guys!"

Is there a way to politely turn down the first offer and get the other one without sending a bad message and losing some network?"

I've been trying to apply to summer internships in NY since August 2017, but have yet to find something. 

One thing I should note is that I have interned at top international firms overseas and have received good grades, so I do not think that I am lacking in experience or good grades. But when I mention that I would need future sponsorship, I get a lot of rejections. Companies do not want international students because they do not want to sponsor them for H1-B visas.

So I was wondering how to go about getting a summer internship in NY? If you are an international student, how did you get summer internships in NY? What was your process? Would there still be hope for someone like me?

Thank you!

Sorry in advance if this reads as if I am a CIA agent but I prefer anonymity and will be keeping specifics to a minimum. 

I did what I was told. I went to school in order to better myself and attempt to get a stable job. My masters degree wasn't in the same field as bachelors so I was a little behind the 8 ball but I worked so hard to try and get first a paid internship and then a unpaid internship so I would have experience going into the work force. I ended up getting beat out for all the paid internships so I worked unpaid for nearly a year. I was supervised by bachelor degree students and this made me very bitter as they were not only paid but found full time jobs with ease while I am still looking. They weren't particularly bright students in my opinion either, though they did have positive qualities to offer which I respect so not trying to down them, but it hurts and I am ultimately jealous. 

To make matters worse, the grad school I went to promised me what would amount to nearly a full ride and then sort of screwed me. Won't get into too many details, but I was not the only one who thought this when presented with the situation. Since it was an out of state school I ended up having to pay an exorbitant amount to get through. Since I have pretty rough mental health issues, I found it very hard to find outside employment other than my internship and class schedule since just doing those was almost too much for me. I thought ""I'll bite the bullet for now, my internship and masters will help me achieve my goals if I'm patient and work hard"". 

Fast forward to today. I live with my parents and have over well over 100,000 dollars of student loan debt. I have had interviews but keep getting rejected, it has been nearly 10 months of looking. My parents are trying to kick me out soon, and I will surely be homeless or at the best struggling to scrape by. I can't shake this bitterness towards others who have made it look so damn easy. I hate them (though I know that is just the fear and anger talking). 

Another thing, FUCK THE JOB HUNTING PROCESS. I read a post that echoed this recently but I will say it again because it's utter bullshit. Everyone expects you as the applicant to be picture fucking perfect, while they will forget to call you and then once you do get ahold of them, reject you. Not only that, but them making you put down the same info you have on your resume like 2 other times? It's like they are determined to make me insane. 

Yes, I take full responsibility for my career choice, the loans, and ultimately my despair. But I tried my absolute hardest and I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. The mental health issues really knocked me on my ass several times, almost dropped out of both undergrad and grad school. I've considered suicide many many times and even now as it crosses my mind it feels like bliss. It just seems I haven't caught a break since I became an adult (except for having a good family and roof over my head for now, which I am extremely thankful for make no mistake). All in all I understand I am pretty damn lucky. But, I am just so damn frustrated, bitter, angry, and fearful for my future. 

I am sorry for the wall of text. Thanks for listening, Reddit.

7pjm4a,0,2018-01-10,M4A - TV Comedies (and other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7pjm4a/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development*, and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them. With the first two, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be had with the unique structures, recurring gags, and one-off characters. 

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7pjz8s,2,2018-01-10,Me [24 M] was dating a girl [22 F] before she left me for her ex in the middle of an unofficial long-distance situation without telling me.,dkirk526,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7pjz8s/me_24_m_was_dating_a_girl_22_f_before_she_left_me/,"Very long, but a difficult situation to fully understand with just a TLDR.  I met a girl last summer who was only supposed to be in town for her three month internship.  For both of us, it was originally supposed to be just a fling because she lived and went to school on the west coast while I lived on the east coast.  In the first few weeks she let me know how she was way more into me than she was expecting, and that she had caught serious feelings for me.  I was honestly uncomfortable at first because I'm not the most confident guy in the world and didn't want to believe anybody could like me that much in such in a short period of time.  That, and the fact that she would be out of my life in a short period of time kept me from letting myself develop feelings back for her.  Midway through the summer, she told me she had accepted a job in her company, but would be starting next summer after she finished her last year of school.  She convinced me that she was in love with me and I went all in emotionally.  The last few weeks we were together basically whenever we both weren't at work and the relationship had moved incredibly fast.  Before she left, we had discussed long-distance, but were relatively non-committal about it.  I wasn't entirely sure about my job situation going into the next year, but we agreed we would be getting back together when she got back assuming we both were living in the same place.  So technically, we weren't officially long-distance.  The next month, she was at home before she went back to school.  We were facetiming for hours every few days, texting and snapping all day when I was at work.  Every chance she had she told me how much she missed me and would be saying things like ""only 9 more months,"" ""I can't wait til we get to do X together when I get back"" so in other words, we never explicitly said we were going long-distance, but it sure as hell felt like it.  When she went back to school, the first week she was still calling me every few days, but let me know she'd be getting incredibly busy and probably wouldn't have as much time to talk.  I didn't want to seem horribly desperate or bother her too much, so we weren't texting and snapping as much.  One Sunday in mid October, she forgot about how we planned to facetime and we just never ended up doing it again afterwards.  She stopped texting me and snapping me unless I sent her something first, and the texts she did send felt devoid of the emotion and emojis that used to flood her texts before.  Something felt incredibly off and I didn't know why.  Every time I told her how much I missed talking to her and seeing her she would just say ""I'm sorry, I'm just really busy.""  Around that time I had a weird dream where I was at a movie with her, I leaned to kiss her, but she turned away.  On her other side was her ex (she still had pictures with him on her FB and had mentioned they ended their relationship earlier this year due to a military assignment) and she took his hand and walked out. It planted the thought in my head that she might me back with him.  I had no reason to believe it other than her being distant, but I chalked it up as me being paranoid and believed that she was just very busy.  Fast-forward to December.  I straight up asked her one day, that I hated that she was being distant and wished she would tell me why.  I wanted her to admit anything, but I didn't want to act accusatory, so I was trying to coax her to tell me herself.  She initially didn't know how to respond and just reiterated it was because of how busy she was and that she talked to me more than some of her closest friends.  I didn't really believe it, and at this point, I was really starting to feel done with the entire situation.  Maybe when she got back, we'd still get together, but at that point she wasn't communicating with me, she often seemed disinterested, and I thought it wasn't worth continuing.  I was content.  I still missed her a little bit, but I had accepted moving on.  A few days ago, I got a girls number and was planning to meet with her.  Part of me still felt guilty about potentially going out with her, so the paranoia returned to me that she might've all along been with her ex. and I wanted to prove it to myself.  After some searching, I found pictures she had hidden from her wall, and sure enough, she was holding hands with her ex in her graduation pictures (Winter graduation).  I felt like I was hit by a truck of emotion.  I was once content, but now felt mortified.  It confirmed in the 12ish weeks after she returned to school she was back with him.  It wasn't technically cheating, but it sure as hell felt like it.  I was angry.  I was sad.  I felt sick.  I still feel it at this moment.  All this time I deluded myself into believing that anybody that expressed that much love and affection for someone in no way could want someone else, not without having an official breakup, and not that quickly.  Not someone who cried in my arms for hours the night before her flight back to the west coast.  It made me feel like our relationship, though short, was a complete farce.  If she had explicitly told me she wanted to see other people, I probably would've felt upset, but ultimately agreed.  Instead, she didn't seem interested in talking to me and hid the entire thing from me.  It was like she dragged me along rather than just letting me go.  I don't know if she either felt guilty, felt sorry for me and didn't want to hurt me, or just didn't want to let me go so I'd still be there for her when she returned.  Now that I know this, I deleted her number, her snapchat, blocked her on FB and haven't heard from her since.  I threw out all the gifts and pictures that she gave me when she left and tried to get rid of every reminder of her.  
  --- 
  **tl;dr**: Never explicitly broke up with GF of 3 months, nor declared long distance, but found out she got back together with her ex and hid it from me for months despite discussing dating when she came back next summer.

Am I stupid for feeling this way?  Was this the right decision? Am I over-reacting even though we never explicitly agreed to do long-distance or break up?  Is there any other way I can get over the feeling of being cheated on?  Is it too soon for me to start dating again, after feeling this way about her?"

[This is Fred](https://i.imgur.com/MKIHqv3.jpg). He fell out of a car at the young age of five to six weeks old, and my girlfriend rescued him. He came to us at exactly 1lb, [scared, and wanting someone to love him](https://i.imgur.com/1R3FdHT.jpg), but it didn't take long before he got his [butt-wiggle on and had moments of bravery](https://gfycat.com/UncomfortableImperturbableIberianlynx), found out that he loves [playing with the Husky when she visits](https://i.imgur.com/WciVxRP.jpg) and decided to [make a home for himself here](https://i.imgur.com/i1CRWGW.jpg).

He likes to [explore](https://i.imgur.com/XM6LzRo.jpg), and do things like [hunt water droplets](https://gfycat.com/KeenPortlyEskimodog), [watch cartoons](https://i.imgur.com/FwJT8k6.jpg), or simply [watch the](https://i.imgur.com/0IZg40v.jpg) passing [of time](https://i.imgur.com/oD4miqC.jpg).

He has [really](https://i.imgur.com/yAfaHNV.jpg) become quite [attached to](https://i.imgur.com/yAfaHNV.jpg) us, and he is [snuggly](https://i.imgur.com/7Vrah3d.jpg) and likes [to cuddle](https://i.imgur.com/8ZIoIVS.jpg), although some might say it is bordering on [needy](https://i.imgur.com/8V6MyrB.jpg) (super mild nsfw on that last one btw).

Now here is the crux of it, Reddit: My girlfriend is moving away for an internship for a few months, and [Fred's best friend](https://i.imgur.com/Rh67xN9.jpg) is moving out with my roomie so Fred won't have [his buddy to play with](https://i.imgur.com/KdsRwJy.jpg). Yes, I know the basics of how to keep him happy. Mainly, [he does not](https://i.imgur.com/EoiGfeO.jpg) like it when [you disturb his naps](https://i.imgur.com/pBdxgo4.jpg).

So - how can I make sure he stays happy? 

I've [only ever](https://i.imgur.com/WiQ9gcf.jpg) had [dogs before](https://i.imgur.com/7OLnf8l.jpg), and until I met Fred I thought I didn't like cats at all. I've bought him some toys, and little bells and balls to chase around and some kitty treats, but he seems to not be super interested in any them unless I play with them. He likes running around and chasing (or being chased by) [the dog](https://i.imgur.com/NKhcCv4.jpg), or socializing with people, but those things are decreasing by a lot now that it is going to be just the two of us for a few months. 

How can I keep him happy when I'm the only one around to socialize with him and I have to work during the day?


Finally, as per reddit standards, [I shall provide a cat tax](https://i.imgur.com/ii4upIi.jpg)."

**Chewbacca** - In HvV Chewbacca is the strongest blaster hero due to the strength of his stun grenade star cards and being able to stack them. 12% increased damage from all sources while stunned, 40% increased shock duration, and a much wider shock area. These 3 star cards combined with the power of his bowcaster makes it so if you get hit by a shock grenade you can say goodbye to your wife and kids.

**Boba Fett** - The only thing good about this bounty boi is his missiles, take that away you have a worse version of insight, a terrible concussion missile, and the most inaccurate peashooter you can get your hands on. This means that once your missiles are on CD you better go hide in a corner until your missiles come back.

**Emperor Palpatine** - 30% increased lightning range stacked with 16% stamina drain reduction, this stacked with his great dash and jumping mobility Palpy becomes Mary Poppins from hell. A slight nerf to both cards might fix this wizard. Also his chain lightning seems to bug out sometimes as I'll be playing a trooper and the wrath of Odyn himself seems to fly through the wall and kill me. 

**Han Solo** - What the f*ck kind of ability is shoulder charge

**Ben Swolo** - This wide boi has plenty of issues in GA, your frenzy is one of the worst abilities because you have about a 10% chance it will work, one trooper roll and you'll sit there rethinking your life decisions as to why you picked Kylo Ren, Freeze and Pull are decent abilities with wayyyy to long of a cooldown. Not to mention he has no survivability, he could really use a health on trooper kill card to sustain himself in fights.

**Captain Phlasma** - Plasma's melee strike... what the f*ck is this supposed to be? It is one of the slowest abilities I've seen, you're basically asking to be lit the f*ck up by a sentry if you dare use this ability on anybody. She could benefit from an animation speed increase for her melee ability. Phamsa's ""Survivor"" ability also needs a buff, compare this to Yoda's presence, or Finn's Big deal. Increase the cooldown and make the heal permanent instead of temporary. Phrasma might be playable with these changes.


**TROOPERS:**

**Assault** - A possible nerf to the CR-2 it is an exceptional weapon in close to medium range. A slight damage nerf can fix this.

**Heavy** - Supercharged Death Machine, reduce splash damage because dying behind cover isn't fun, allow heroes to block this.
 
**Enforcer** - For a low price of 3,000 credits and being lucky enough to play on the side of the Rebels you too can play as an unstoppable hairy God that drops the biggest dubstep drops with his grenade to make you cry to mommy. The wookie is also the only Enforcer that can roll WHILE overload is active, flametrooper can't do this, neither can the battle droid or death trooper. Nerfing the ability to roll while overload is active and reducing the aoe of the grenade slightly can fix this hairy beast.
**

**STARFIGHTER ASSAULT:**

All of the star cards in this mode need to be nerfed stat wise, a new player can not possibly contend with an interceptor that has 10% damage increase, 40% heat reduction, and 20% rate of fire increase. There is too much of a gap between the people that have epic star cards and new players. This mode does not feel reliant as skill as much as it is reliant on the cards you have. Also hero ships could possibly benefit from a health on kill star card as the moment you decide to step into one you have everyone in the galaxy on your tail wanting to take you the f*ck down, and considering the turn rate on most hero star ships are slow, this means a good interceptor will ruin your day in only a few moments.


**ARCADE:**

Clearly Dice has their internship program working on the arcade mode, limited map choices, no starfighter mode, the reward system seems like a kid designed it. I'll give you a scenario, enter onslaught mode, set life to one hit, spawn in as heavy and instantly kill yourself with a grenade. You just got 100 credits, the same amount that someone gets for completing a more difficult encounter. This means that there is no algorithm that exists that rewards you for kills or time spent in the arcade match. Which means arcade mode was an afterthought to DICE. Arcade needs a complete overhaul it's honestly a joke of a mode at the moment that you can't even play with your friends. A 1v1 mode where you can challenge friends as heroes would be a lot of fun.


**PLAYING WITH FRIENDS:**

The matchmaking system for queuing with friends is terrible, you are usually put into empty lobbies for every mode and have to wait for the lobby to fill which could take up to 15 minutes or more. The spawn/squad system needs to be fixed, if you join a GA with your friend you don't even feel like you're playing with them unless you go out of your way to try to find them on the map each time you spawn, there is no ""spawn on friend"" option which is terrible. In starfighter mode it would also be nice to have a clearer location on the HUD as to where your party members are, I am looking for a tiny green pixel on my monitor at the moment so I can go back up my friend while someone is on his tail, my friend dies every time because I need to go get lasik eye surgery to see the fucking tiny green pixel on my monitor indicating his location.

7pkkdv,3,2018-01-10,[True] Fishlake Forest,Kiki01234,DrCreepensVault,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/7pkkdv/true_fishlake_forest/," I would love if you would narrate this story. It happened many years ago, anyways thanks for what you do. Big fan here. Keep up the good work.

Fear. The emotion that will kick in before any other when you know you are lost or in trouble or to put it simply, something is just not right. Growing up, ever since I could remember, it played a huge role in my life. It was the deciding point for a lot of things. Let us begin by introducing myself, I will introduce myself as Joe, not my real name for obvious reasons and neither will any other names you see here. and I can see things, things that others cannot. I have many stories of things I have seen, and sometimes they are plain difficult to believe. Heck I might not even believe some of them had they not happened to me. But now i will now tell you about a time a specific time in my life in which fear got the best of me and the notion of survival was forcibly put into gear. This is a true story.

                I was around 12 at the time, a small little kid if you ever saw one weighing in at a lanky 80 pounds. I was a freshman to be. It was summer, and work was very busy at the time. And yes I mean work, I did an unpaid internship in my fathers shop starting at a much younger age and by now i knew my way around. Many cars were breaking down that summer and I knew I would go crazy if I did not give my mind a break, it was as if my friends read my mind. They could not have called me at a better time. My homies Bryson and Michael called me and said they were planning a trip to the woods in Fishlake National Forest, Utah just a few blocks behind friend Jorge's house. His parents had a very nice home and cabin down there and we thought it would be great. The trip would set place in two days and last for 3 days and quite frankly, I could not wait.

                Well the 2 days passed by, and let me tell you I got a bad feeling that day. You know. The feeling you get when the universe is trying to convey a message of dread or despair. But of course being a few exited teens, we soon forgot about that awful feeling. Well anyway the time comes. And Bryson's older brother, Pancho, picks me up along with michael in his old but reliable minivan. And wouldn’t you believe it the van started sputtering and shut off, we would later found out brysons brother, the idiot. forgot to gas her up. I should have taken and just given up on the trip completely I should have read the signs that god set there for me. Because, well, everything happens for a reason, Right? I would say so but 12 yr old me wasn’t having it. I asked my father for his SUV And again, off we went all of us 12 year old kids and one 19 year old Pancho, he was the reason our parents agreed to this trip in the first place, because Pancho would be our guardian while Jorge’s parents were away for the weekend. We would have his house and his cabin all to ourselves. So we went on our way to the woods.

                It was a long 2 or maybe closer to 3 hours after leaving my home if i recollect correctly, when we finally arrived. The air was cleaner here ways from the city and near the woods, I could breathe easily and peacefully. It was now sunset and we decided it would be a good idea to play hide and seek. It most certainly was, the sunset was beautiful and finding a hiding spot was very easy amongst all the undergrowth, shrubs, and of course, the trees. I forgot to mention there was not much civilization around during this time, maybe a half a mile away was a house that shared a huge fire pit right on the property line. Anyone was welcome to it. Other than that it was just a few houses on tons of acreage of land. And the woods as their very own playground. Just a few hundred meters into their backyard. We played for around an hour or so and got tired so we went inside for snacks and to play video games. Complete dark hit, what seems minutes after we went inside. This was no average darkness either, nothing like the cities which always seemed to be lit up no matter what time of day it was, this was…   ADVANCED DARKNESS.

                The first night was awesome, playing war games on a huge TV and foosball in the next room over. The host Jorge had snacks for all of us and was really glad he had friends over. You see, with him living in such a rural area he hardly had any visitors. We paid no attention to time and hours passed and it went from video games, to board games, to soda drinking contests and back to video games and hours of fun just passed til’ eventually, one by one we passed out into slumber.

                The second day, I was the first to awake the next morning at around 11 a.m., followed by Michael. We talked and laughed about the stuff we did all last night. Man, my stomach was turning from all the soda we had. We were glad we were all guys and there were no party poopers. We were brainstorming ideas of what would await us today. That’s when Bryson awoke followed by the Jorge and lastly Pancho, and they decided we would play soccer until we could think of plans for the rest of the afternoon and then night. And out we went to play soccer, one by one the group trudged sleepily out. I was goalie, naturally since it was very hard to score on me. While playing I noticed the fire pit in all its magnificent glory, this was a very very nice fire pit there was a concrete pour with pillars to hold the roof overhead. And it also had its definite diy benches made out of bricks it was awesome.

                Nightfall began that second night it was close to sunset, we hadn’t really done much all day just the usual wondering what to do so long that the day eluded us, I asked Jorge about that fire pit, I wanted so bad to go warm up next to a cozy fire more than anything, he told me it was his, and we were more than welcome to use it. Looking back now i wish he had just said no. But again everything happens for a reason. Then sunset hit once again, we lit the fire, brought out the s’mores and set the mood for scary stories. One by one we all began, I started, “Once upon a time…” and we all continued stories. When it was my turn again I decided to step it up a bit, my grandparents were strongly spiritual and often times had times where they dealt with the devil, and so started to tell one of their stories, beginning with, “This is a true story…” just then we noticed the wind started blowing. The air began to have a musty and humid, smell to it. The sweet smelling fresh air was no more. Jorge told us it was most likely going to rain so we all looked up, the night sky was completely clear of clouds. I had not noticed before but the stars and the moon glowed as bright as the sun. It was beautiful out, it was dark but I had never actually seen the stars like this before and it took my breath away. What came next I would have never done if I would’ve known what was about to happen to me, we decided to play a game of hide and seek under the stars and stop the scary stories, because, well it looked like it might’ve gotten out of hand if we would have continued. We ran inside, got some flashlights for safety and ran back out to begin.

                It was my turn to count first. I was calling out the numbers as loud as I could, as I did not want be called a cheater for miscounting, “one, two, three… twenty. Here I come ready or not!” When I turned around I realized this was not like the last games we played, this game we did not set parameters and the woods were not off limit, though the moon was still out, the woods beneath the trees were completely dark in spite of the bright yellow full moon, and the still burning fire a few feet away from me was of no aid. We had said every 15 minutes the game would restart at the safe spot. I decided I would search without the flashlight first to not alert them of my presence. That is a huge mistake, in fact it could have almost been fatal. It was like one of those stupid stunts someone does in a horror movie where you just want to scream at them to not do it, but Off I went running this way and that for what seemed an eternity, with no trace or sound of anyone. Soon I decided I was taking too long and I checked the time, 15 minutes had passed according to my phone, and I did not hear or see anyone. That meant time was up, at 15 minutes I was obligated to yell to everyone to huddle up and I was it again. And if I didn’t do so they had to search for me. Only, there was one problem.

                I realized after all that walking, running, and turning that I did not know where I was so I decided, to turn on my flashlight and walk back while yelling hoping I was in sound reach. Just then I realized a sudden change in wind direction and it got significantly stronger. I grabbed my flashlight, and put the switch to on. Boom, it turned on and back off! The light bulb burned out! Great, I thought, this was just perfect, in the dark woods and completely bewildered on where I was exactly, and it fails me, well at least I have my phones small screen to light my way better than nothing at all I always say. I started walking and yelling in the direction I thought I came from, but no answer. I was beginning to become afraid. I kept going nonetheless. Five minutes more of walking and yelling still nothing. I was terrified now. What if I was lost what if they never found me, here is when fear started to kick in and I started to prepare in case I had to survive until they found me, this had become a physical and mental survival situation. My phone did not get service at all in this rural area either so that wasn’t good. I did the only thing I thought I could do to help me right now.

                The wind ceased as I got on my knees to pray to god to help me find my way back. As soon as I got back up onto my feet I noticed the now still air began smelling mustier almost as if rotten eggs have been there for a very long time, and more dry than before, all the humidity was gone as well. There were now sounds I could hear all around me. I began shaking, I was scared but I had faith it would all be alright. I mean what else did I have, right? Just then I began to hear a sound, I stopped walking and listened, the sound sounded like and animal on all fours running. And it was coming from the direction I was walking to. I stopped dead in my tracks and stood there paralyzed. I knew the thing, whatever it was, was nearing me, and rather fast. I suddenly came to and turned and did the only logical thing I could do, run!!

                As I ran, I was jumping obstacles like there was no tomorrow, my little skinny legs, carrying me as fast as I could go. I did not know what the thing was chasing me, but I did know it was gaining on me. I could soon hear the footsteps louder than ever! The sharp claws hitting the rocks and what seemed like a growl. A terrible deep growl, followed by the sound of a long chain dragging not far behind. I did not know how much time passed exactly but I guessed around 5 minutes. As I ran I kept yelling all the group member names, “MICHAEL, BRYSON, JORGE, PANCHO!!!” but I still heard no reply. Then disaster struck! My foot caught and I fell, the animal or thing chasing me was now really close. I got up and kept running. I felt almost as if all I could do was run in a straight line because it sounded as if there were a pack of those animals on three of my four directions.

                Only now it was different, I ran but I could tell the thing was steps behind me. I could feel and smell its terrible breath. The hairs on my whole body stood on end as its breath hit my neck. I could feel sharp stinging not necessarily pain, but more of a scratch down my back as I ran. The thing was too close for comfort, and I tried picking up speed but I was too tired as now it seemed another ten minutes had passed. Luckily as I slowed so did the thing, I continued to yell. The only thing I didn’t understand was why this thing wouldn’t just kill and eat me being so close. I mean, I didn’t mind if it let me live, and I really preferred it didn’t eat me, but it was always a possibility. Finally! I could hear Bryson calling out, “Joe come back, where are you!” Boy was I relieved. I shouted back, “I’m here! Help me!” Then it hit me. I was leading this thing to them. I knew it then, yet I still ran towards them. The thing was still here following and I was terrified. As I approached my friends I could hear the thing getting farther and farther away until finally I could not see it nor hear it anymore. Finally I saw the beams of light showing my way. My body collapsed. I had no idea what happened next, I had absolutely no control over my body. I can only assume i lost conciousness. I could, hear and feel, but I could not see, or move. I just knew all my friends were around me.

                I regained control many minutes later. My friends were around me the whole time I was on the ground, and Jorge was holding my shirt. It had blood stains on the back and was torn, I didn’t know why right then. I was just relieved I was safe. No one brought up the subject until we were safe inside Jorge's home once again. I was feeling sharp tingling pain down my back and my friends told me my back was clean they don’t know where the blood came from. Although they were curious about the 2 scar lines running diagonally, I shuddered. I told them I didn’t have any scars when we came out. They all looked at me puzzled probably thinking I was joking, they then asked what happened, I told them about the thing and how it was following me, as I told them about it, I watched their faces slowly go to horror

                We are all still good friends. But no one has brought up the subject since then. We occasionally still go to Jorge’s house but he no longer lives in that area. His parents built a house closer to the city i don’t know why they moved but i imagine ill ask sometime. I still wonder to this day what that thing was that followed me, why it did not kill me, was it good or evil. I like to think that god sent that thing after me to make me change direction and head the correct way to where I wanted to go, and to teach me a lesson for being stupid and playing in a very dangerous place at night. Whether it really is that or not I will never know, all i know is that if you ever want to play hide and seek in the forest at night… Don’t, please don’t, for your sake.

I'm a twenty-eight year old male who's had an on and off drinking problem since I was about twenty-two or so. It's gotten very bad recently, but I'm glad to say tomorrow will be day number four without any alcohol.

I met this amazing girl when I was younger. She came into my life very fast and unexpectedly, and after only one week of knowing one another, we recklessly flew to Iceland. It was, and is, one of the if not the most important, character-defining experiences of my life. I hadn't known this girl even eight days ago, then all of a sudden I was wrapped up in reindeer furs laying in the tundra totally alone and miles from anyone else. I fell hopelessly in love with her during this trip. 

Shortly after, she unexpectedly left me and I didn't know why she had. Up to this point, I'd never opened a bottle of alcohol in my life, so my parents didn't lock it up. I distinctly remember grabbing a bottle of Meyers Rum and just sitting on my old bedroom floor hating the taste but sucking it down while I stared lifelessly at my wall. This became a nightly thing and soon I was drinking until I blacked out because of how therapeutic it was to not feel anything for the final hours of the day to then be welcomed by a dreamless sleep. 

After a few months I said fuck it, and I got an internship to live and work in West Africa in several conflict zones in refugee camps. I saw some pretty brutal stuff, but this is what I wanted - to run away. Weekends I had off so I'd just wander the streets of places like Accra drinking and drinking and drinking. I'm lucky I wasn't killed. 

After I came home I'd lost every friend I had because of how profoundly the experience changed me. So I'd sit up on a park bunch at a scenic overlook in my hometown with nips of whisky and then drag my drunk ass home to collapse into bed alone. 

The same nagging urge appeared so I up and left for Ireland out of nowhere, much to my parents chagrin, and it was the same old story. I'd wake up and start drinking, get on a random bus that I had no idea the destination of, get off, jump on a random train. I ultimately ended up in Wicklow, Ireland where I spent New Years partying in a hostel. I woke up in an abandoned warehouse the next day (extremely thankful my butthole didn't hurt). It's amazing I found my way back to Dublin in time for my flight. 

A few years then came with some on and off self-control and sobriety. A few girls came and went. The sober times were good and I was happy to be in control again, but the addicted times were extremely bad and I was actually hospitalized one time for almost dying of alcoholic ketoacidosis. I was in an ICU for three days.

Then, this past year, the initial girl I mentioned showed up out of nowhere, and we quickly fell back in love. She explained everything to me, how she was so young and the intensity of our relationship scared her, so she ran. So for most of this past year, I was in the most control of myself I've been since I started drinking. By the end of the summer we were engaged to be married, and even had a wedding date. I couldn't believe she was back in my life.

Then she left to be with her mother, and I couldn't get a hold of her for three weeks. I was so worried I was borderline pulling my hair out with stress. Finally, I got one of her relatives to have her call me and I very emotionally asked why she was doing this. She told me she no longer wanted to be married and we could stay together, but I need to accept that one day she might leave me. I said yes initially, but that night basically had a nervous breakdown in my home. So I had my sister call her and tell her I was leaving her, which I know is cowardly but I just didn't have the heart her voice again.

So all Fall I was hammered every single night, whether I had work the next day or not. I was throwing stuff across my room, there were empty bottles and cans and nips all over the place. I just couldn't handle feeling like this. 

So I did it again. I bought a plane ticket to Estonia. It was only October but when I landed it was already freezing cold and the sky was dark. I ended up meeting a sweet old lady on the plane who said I could rent her attic space for the week, which I couldn't help but laugh at so I said yes (I have a great photo of it, and it's hilarious how small it is. I could have lived there the rest of my life). 

This was different than my other trips because I wasn't traveling per se. I was being selfish, which is something I wasn't, and still to a degree, am not. I never recognized this in myself, that sometimes it's healthy to just take time for yourself. Without meaning to, I put myself in a position in this weird little Baltic country barely anyone has heard of where I was working on me for the first time in my life.

So I'd wake up every day, do the chores she gave me, go out and kill a bottle of wine somewhere, then wander aimlessly down the beautiful stone streets of Tallinn, happily getting hopelessly lost. Museums, old cathedral, abandoned Soviet buildings, coffee shops, anywhere I wanted. And it was the first time in a long time that, though, still drinking, I was beginning to feel a tingling of happiness again. Real happiness, not the artificial happiness I thought I'd felt with my ex-fiancee but couldn't see. I learned a lot about myself that trip.

So before I left, I promised after the holidays that I'd go sober. The only reason I waited was because I knew if I decided to try then I'd just be setting myself up for failure. So I enjoyed my holidays and slowly got better.

So this is day three, and I'm really proud of myself. It was a... different way to experience your twenties.

And oh, the weird part.

Withdrawal sucks, but some of it is outright weird. The sweats and tremors and twitches and urges, that all blows. But the other stuff?

All three nights I've slept so far (I stopped drinking early before the first full day), I haven't been able to fully fall asleep. I'm in like this pseudo-sleep state where I'm half aware I'm sort of sleeping. And all three times it began with just lots of colors swirling around to eventually being in a straight up movie with visual and auditory components to it. Then today I started getting extremely startled by EVERYTHING. That part's actually kind of fun, not going to lie. I'm seeing this in forms and shapes and they scare the hell out of me.

The weirdest thing though was I was showering and all of a sudden I could hear a woman singing with a piano playing behind her, and it was a steady beat and rhythm to both the voice and instrument to the point I can hum it. 

Good luck all on finding whatever it is you're looking for.  "

I feel like i do genuinely understand the stuff and i have an internship but its like in intermediate 2 , my professor went so hard the first day and im already kind of lost, im questioning if i genuinely like this stuff. I need time to really sit down and study before i learn anything. I’m not one of those people who can just sit there and answer all the professors questions. So my question for you guys is, did you guys wake up and really get excited to go to accounting class or was it just like me ? I like the material  and the concepts but its like im not super ecstatic. Just kinda depressed i got cheated in intermediate 1 with the C cause now i would have to retake it to get to the MACC program in my school to reach my 150 for CPA... "
7plq3p,4,2018-01-10,Family of 3 moving to Gilbert soon.,Medfordite,Gilbert,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilbert/comments/7plq3p/family_of_3_moving_to_gilbert_soon/,"We are hoping to move from Portland, Oregon around  late spring to Gilbert.  We are both in our early 40s and our daughter is 15 years old. 

We are looking to find out a few things.  I have already searched the /r/Phoenix thread and have answered quite a few of my questions already. ;)  These are unanswered, so I am checking to see if anyone has any recommendations/answers here.

**Special Education** - Our daughter has an IEP and has a mental age of around 9 or 10, and attends the 9th grade presently.  Does anyone know if the schools are good at handling IEP's?  She has attended a few which didn't give much concern to them other than reading it and following the bare minimum sometimes in violation of our state law.  I have read good comments on the education system here, so I am trusting this to be the case. 

**Housing** - we may be arriving to town without a job in hand, with enough savings to pay for at least 1 or 2 months of rent.  We are recently coming out of bankruptcy so our credit is less than good.  How do Landlords handle things?  Do they generally run credit checks?  We are considering either looking for a short term apartment rental nearby or an extended stay type of Hotel if absolutely needed, if we can't land a job before then. 

**Employment** - I possess 30 years of computer experience, with networking, web hosting, web site design, help-desk and desktop support to name a few within my skill set.    My wife has a master's degree in Business Psychology with a focus on Industrial Organizational development.  Most of the jobs she has looked at in our area at least, require 1 -3 years of experience as an intern, to even become an intern for that portion of HR in her field which makes no sense.    Has anyone encountered anything like that here?   As for myself,  I have looked around the Phoenix area and have spotted several jobs I am well suited for, so I know I should be okay to find a job in the tech support/desktop support field. 

Thank you for your time reading this and any recommendations and answers you can provide!

7pmb32,6,2018-01-11,I Need Advice,bmcmhon1,mensa,https://www.reddit.com/r/mensa/comments/7pmb32/i_need_advice/,"This is lengthy, so bear with me.

I’ve been having a difficult time trying to figure out what I want to do in life. I'm an intelligent guy, so I decided to do some research in hopes of finding if intelligence might be the cause of my indecisiveness. Eventually, I looked on Reddit for subreddits related to intelligence, and that’s what led me here. I was blown away to find how common it is on this sub, so I would love to ask some questions I feel may be related.  Hopefully, you all can provide me with some much-needed advice!

First, I'm going to provide a little backstory about myself. I had straight A's until I reached 7th grade. In 7th grade I wasn't doing well in one class, so my parents had me tested for ADHD. I had to see a psychologist once a week for two months I believe, and they tested my IQ during this time as well. Long story short, I definitely have ADHD, but in the process my parents found I had a very high IQ. They wouldn’t tell me what it was, but I recently found the folder containing a lot of my information.  It didn’t contain my IQ, but it did contain something called The Woodcock-Johnson – III Tests of Achievement (WJ-III) which is said to measure academic achievement. I scored above average on every subset, some by a large margin and others just slightly above. I can post a picture of it if needed. I already knew I was more intelligent than the average person, but it was nice to find some objective information.  I’m only mentioning this because it’s really all I have. After I was diagnosed, I started taking Adderall and I went from being the class clown with a lot of friends to socially awkward. I started thinking everyone was extremely immature (especially in high school) and I didn’t want to talk to anyone. When senior year came along, I made a strong effort to open up and break out of this anti-social life I had been living. It worked, and I made some good friends as I headed into college. 

I started college in 2010, and, well, I’m still here! I never knew what career path I wanted to follow, so I started college by taking classes like “Career Development”. They didn’t help. I was big into working out and sports at the time, so I began majoring in Exercise and Sports Science. It didn’t take long to realize that wasn’t what I wanted to do, but I kept going with it because it was easy. I was in a fraternity also, and once the more difficult classes began, my grades took a huge hit. Before this, I had never really studied in my life, but I had a 3.8 GPA at a highly regarded private high school and all A’s and B’s in college. I partied a lot (probably because I didn’t drink a beer until I was in college, but that’s a different story), and I ended up getting a 0.5 GPA for one semester. I didn’t go to class unless it was exam day, because I thought I could just study the night before and pass…that didn’t happen. I had two more semesters of roughly 2.0 GPAs, so I took a semester off from school, moved to the beach, and worked as a cabana boy. I eventually decided to come back and try nursing school (mainly for job stability). At this point, my overall GPA was shit and nowhere near the requirement. I had to retake a bunch of classes, but eventually I got in. Nursing school is notorious for being a difficult major at the University I attend, but it was fairly easy to me. I enjoyed learning the physiology of the body and how disease processes worked, but I often went too in depth in learning about it. I excelled in the more difficult classes, but struggled with subjects I found boring. I kept on, and I start my final semester of nursing school next week. 

Last semester was my last semester taking exams, for this semester is 80% clinical rotations and a class called “Leadership”. I realized after I finished the semester that I started getting depressed, which made no sense to me initially. After a little self-analysis, I realized it was because I enjoyed the challenge of the classes, not the major. I didn’t realize this until recently, but the signs were always there. I’ve basically received straight C’s in nursing school (with exception to the classes I found interesting) because I usually didn’t study until the night before, or I would only study enough to get by. If I scored low on an exam, then I’d study enough to get a high score on the next one, basically doing the bare minimum to get by. I have a reputation for this, and it’s annoying to say the least. I’ve even had a professor (a doctor) basically ask me if I was cheating because I never went to her class and still passed. I realize I’ve been going on a tangent (ADHD), so I’m just going to stop here and get to my main points regarding this post.

I’m currently working as an extern in the PICU of one of the top children’s hospitals in the world. I lied about my GPA when I applied, and, luckily, they didn’t ask for documentation. I figured if I got the job and showed them my capabilities in person, they would overlook my GPA upon graduation (when it’s time to work as a real nurse). I’m pretty confident they will, but we’ll see. I’m very personable and I have a knack for getting people to like me. I obtained this mainly from my job as a cabana boy, and from a couple summers as a parasail deckhand. When you work off tips and see over 100 people/day, you get really good at bullshitting with people and pretending to be interested. I have zero intimidation when it comes to talking to anyone, so I’d say I’m pretty good at job interviews. Anyways, I was the first person to ever be accepted as an intern in this unit, and I was the first person to be offered an externship before finishing their 4th semester of nursing school. I’ve also received a verbal job offer upon graduation. It’s the dream set-up for someone who wants to be a nurse. It pisses me off that I’ve lost interest, but there’s nothing I can do. I’m going to have to go back to school and find something right for me. Regardless, I’m going to work a few years as a nurse to pay off my student loan debt before going back. Now, I need some help determining what I should do from here.

Nursing school hasn’t entirely been a waste, for I’ve developed an interest in the medical field. I know I’m capable of making it through med school, but the problem is I don’t have anywhere near the GPA requirement. Fortunately, the MCAT is a prerequisite taken into consideration as well, and I’m confident I could ace it if I put in the study hours. I don’t know if I’ll lose interest along the way, and that scares me. As you all know, med school isn’t cheap, and I would have to work a few years as a nurse to pay off an already large amount of student debt regardless. If I were to become a doctor, I would have to be in a field that isn’t repetitive and constantly challenges me. Is it worth it to go through the trouble if I don’t know for sure that’s what I want to do?

Astrophysics is another subject I would enjoy getting into, but that requires a lot of school as well. I don’t believe I would get bored in this field because there are always questions that need be answered. We will never know everything about space, at least not during my lifetime. This is a field I believe shows the most promise in keeping my attention and challenging me. So, is this the route I should take?

I also love to travel, and I’ve always felt like I need to get out and experience the world. This is why I moved to the beach and worked as a deckhand. Perhaps finding a job that would allow me to travel the world would be something to look into, but I don’t have a clue how one would go about that route. 

I CAN’T DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE – Advice would be greatly appreciated on this.

How did you all figure out the right path for you? I know a lot of people struggle with having to enjoy something in order to really apply themselves. Did anyone find a way to get over this, or is it impossible to stop obsessing over seeking new challenges.
Also, any tips for motivating myself when I don't find a topic interesting?

There are a few more things I’d be interested in knowing. Does anyone else have these characteristics or problems?

* Over-analyzing everything all the time.
* Having a keen ability to “read people” and being able to quickly pick up on someone else’s thoughts and emotions – this one weirds me out sometimes.
* Easily knowing when someone else is trying to manipulate you.
* Being manipulative yourself, when you want to be – and you’re good at it.
* Learning = daily obsession.

If anyone has other characteristics that aren’t of the norm or are above average (not memorization or other more common traits), I would love to hear them! 

Last question, should I take the Mensa test? Would it help me get into med school with my lacking GPA if I scored high on it? I took the “mensa.no” test (I noticed it had been posted several times on this sub) and scored a 138 (99.4%), but I saw mixed reviews about the exam. I know this question is asked a lot and is viewed as annoying, but I have a specific reason for asking it.

Closing remarks:

* I’m sorry for the length – I didn’t expect to write my life story.
* I don’t enjoy writing very much, so sorry if there are grammatical errors here and there. – I typed this pretty fast and didn’t proofread because…it’s Reddit.
* This post is probably all over the place. Sorry for this, but I was just writing as things popped into my head.
* I’m looking forward to hearing any advice you all might have, and hopefully some people can share some unique things of their own. Constructive criticism is welcome.
* I know it’s a lot, but I figured I’d rather just ask all my questions at once.

7pno0a,1,2018-01-11,Opening the distance?,jokke150,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/7pno0a/opening_the_distance/,"Hey there,
my girlfriend and I are together for more than five years already and most of the time, we had a more or less long-distance relationship.

She studies law and I will be finishing my bachelor studies in computer science in a few months. Afterwards I could do my masters in Germany, OR I could try to do what I always wanted to: Applying for jobs in an english-speaking foreign country.

Well, I don't know my chances of getting a decent job with only a bachelor degree. But I already did five internships at a big company in Germany, so I doubt that I wouldn't find anything.

My favourite destination would be the west coast of Canada, that would put approximately 8000km (5000 miles) between the two of us. This means at least a 12-hour flight.

I really don't know if that is manageable. I wouldn't want to stay there forever of course. Has anyone of you moved so far away from your partner voluntarily? Did you regret it?"

7pokwq,1,2018-01-11,Should I try lashlifting?,FanTUstic,Eyelashes,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyelashes/comments/7pokwq/should_i_try_lashlifting/,"So I have asian eyes where my lashes are kinda long but straight. 

I've used extensions in the past but they're quite expensive here and with me being a student I don't have the money to make that commitment again. (I ended up not having the time of money to redo my lashes in time)  While the extensions were great, my lashes die ended up getting a bit shorter over time, so I took a break. 
Than in the summer I discovered the better than sex waterproof mascara in france (I really need waterproof for my curl to hold.) The thing is with my internship I haven't really been doing much with my lashes but they've grown longer and finally are getting stronger. (Not sure if it's the serum I use, the time I gave it, or something else I'm doing.) 

I'm getting tired of curling them every morning and feel like I can never get a nice ""Natural"" curl unless I spend a lot of time on it. The Netherlands finally sells the better than sex mascara so that has been saving me. I am anxious to ruin my lashes again from overcurling or extensions. 

So I wanted to try lashlifting+tinting them but I kinda want to keep using mascara. On all websites I cannot find a thing about using mascara with it. All they're saying is that
 ""There's no need for mascara"" afterwards.

7por2e,7,2018-01-11,Have to repay a friend $10000 before the end of Jan (I'm an international student in US),DaPotatoNerd,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7por2e/have_to_repay_a_friend_10000_before_the_end_of/,"Small intro about me:


I'm a 23y/o international student doing my masters in USA. And I'll be graduating in May 2018. I currently have a research assistant position which takes care of my tuition for this semester. I'm also doing a part time internship for 20 hrs/week which pays me $16/hr.


I used to manage my finances and was debt free till May, 2017. But because of an unfortunate mishap, I didn't get a research assistant position during my fall 2017 semester. And the only income I had was the $16/hr for 20 hours a week. I had to pay my tuition for the  semester by myself. It was a total of around $16,000. I borrowed $10000 from a friend and $2000 from my parents, and the rest from my previous savings + my pay during the semester. Also, during the semester, I used my credit card a lot and I have a credit card debt of $3753 currently. My bank balance right now is $214.


The friend who let me borrow $10000 wants the money back by the end of this month due to his personal issues. I tried applying for loans in two different places - lending club and upstart (because of my international student status, I wasn't able to apply for a loan through a bank) but was rejected due to the reason that I don't have a long credit history and I just have one credit card.


I'm sure that I'll be able to get full time job which pays me a minimum of $75k per year once I graduate (I'll have double masters - MS in Analytics and MS in Actuarial Science). So I'll be able to pay back the loan in a couple of months once I start my full time job.


I don't have any other friend whom I can borrow from. And I can't ask my parents because of their current financial status. Can someone suggest me the best course of action given my current situation?


Edit: Thank you all for the replies. I was hoping that there might be a way with which I could get him the $10000. But after all the replies, I understand that there is no way to pay him back by the end of Jan. I'm going to explain him my situation. Hopefully we continue staying as friends after that.


Edit2: Based on u/heartfelt24 's reply, I'm going to ask my friend if it's okay for him to take a loan now and once I start my full time position, I'll pay back the money I owe along with the interest. If he is not comfortable with it, I'll ask my parents to take a loan and I'll pay back everything.


Edit3: Thank you so much for your idea u/heartfelt24 !!! He was okay with taking a loan now and me paying him back the total sum including the interest after I get a full time job.


When I was talking with him, I came to know that he was just checking with me if I could give back the 10k. And if I had told him about my financial situation when he asked me if I could give the money back, he would have suggested the same idea. I'm really happy to have such an amazing friend!!


Once again, Thank you all for your replies!!!"
7powsf,4,2018-01-11,[Misc] Uni internship,UniStudentFinance,UKPersonalFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/7powsf/misc_uni_internship/,"Hi, I'm currently a 2nd year student doing computer science at a top university. I should graduate in 2019 (unless I do a masters) with an expected income of around £30k - £70k.

I have an internship this summer (probably 8-12 weeks as it's flexible) which will pay £40k pa. I have a few questions about what I should be doing.

1. **Pension**
  * They offer a 4% matching with aviva, would it be silly to not take this?
  * They also offer a salary sacrifice where they pay into a pension including the national insurance they save (13.8%) would this be better?
  * Or should I take the money as I'm below the personal allowance and not paying income tax

2. **Accommodation** - This internship is about an hour to 1.5 away from home. Would it be sensible to commute? The university there will rent rooms as a BnB for £38 per night. I could stay 4 nights a week?

3. **Student finance** - how will this affect my student finance going forwards (probably final year)? I currently live with my farther and two younger brothers (in wales), his income is about £16k.
That means that I get a mixture of loan, grant, and a bursary. Would getting an internship affect this? If it does is it worth doing a salary sacrifice if that would help?

7pozt8,12,2018-01-11,Internship at Mental Health Court - looking for suggestions,jejhey,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/7pozt8/internship_at_mental_health_court_looking_for/,"Hi!

I am in my first year placement in a Mental Health Court. The basic premise is that symptoms of mental illness cause crime (which I know is vey often not the case and that individuals with SMPI are far more likely to be the victims of crime, but here we are) so by mandating mental health treatment through the courts, we can reduce crime. It's a fairly new session for this court and I think we're still figuring out what we can offer participants while they're enrolled. My role is essentially case management - assisting the 20+ participants in complying with the condition of their probation to attend outpatient appointments and take psychiatric medication. 

I want to do more than help people comply with their probation but I'm struggling to identify ways to do this. I have created a personal crisis management that we can complete with participants on a voluntary basis, the goal of which is to increase participant agency in the process by better understanding their triggers, symptoms and treatment preferences so that we can better collaborate when people are struggling. 

Another court in the area also provides to go meals to participants at the end of the session. I'm going to email the social worker to see how they're able to do that. 

One issue is that the court is an inherently coercive environment and I worry that by making suggestions about crisis planning or support groups, participants will think that this is part of their probation or will feel obligated to participate in order to gain favor with the judge/probation etc.

I'm wondering if people have other suggestions about how else we can support individuals in the program? I am very interested in forensic social work and want to make the most of this internship.

Thank you!"
7pp7qi,4,2018-01-11,Master of Commerce,TimDiFormaggio,usyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/7pp7qi/master_of_commerce/,"Hey all. So I am interested in the Master of Commerce as it seems like a more relevant degree. I graduated with an undergrad in psychology and found I enjoyed the course however I am more interested in breaking into finance/management consulting. 

My question is, what specialisations would offer the best chance of finding a job. I am looking to either enter management consulting or as a financial analyst. Currently I have enrolled into People and Managament, and Finance as specialisations. I have Business Info Systems as an elective. I am thinking about doing BIS as a specialisation because I find a BA role to be a potential avenue as well. These interests are because I have done an overseas social enterprise thing for one month, and a HR internship at an IT company but I seem to find that I am a bit more ""hard-facts"" based than typical HR roles. Therefore, my career goals have shifted a bit. 

My question is what specialisations will help me best in finding those jobs? I have heard that Accounting is a gold mine for finding work and that Management specialisation is useless at undergrad (not sure about post-grad).

Thanks. I want to follow my interests but since this is a masters I am more intent on majoring in something which can lead to a professional job.

Thanks! "

I am about to graduate from college, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I make decent grades and have been fortunate to have a few internships, but none are fulfilling. I feel as though I am not where I am supposed to be, but it is such a challenging place to be, because I have no idea where I belong. It has hit me hard at the start of this year because I feel like my time is running out. I do not know where to find my purpose. In my 22 years of life, nothing has stood out to me that makes me feel like it is the right path for me. I do not have any strong talents. I am just average. I see people in my class that put so much effort into their studies. My boyfriend and roommate seem to have so much more passion for their major than me. In class, I get so frustrated with myself because I wish I knew how to make myself care. I don't care if I actually learn anything, I just want to get the class over with. I don't care anymore. I long to be away from everyone, but at the same time I don't. I am embarrassed and ashamed of who I am. I feel guilty because I don't care about the things in my life that should be important. 

I have tried to talk to people about this, but I feel like it does not help me. I am afraid they think I'm crazy. Sometimes I feel like I am. I remember being happy, but I don't know how to bring that feeling back with this burden of purpose weighing on me. It makes me sick to my stomach, and it is a challenge to not let it effect relationships and my work life.

Keto Fam!!!! It has officially been one year, so I wanted to share my progress, inspirations (all of you fine people), and of course pictures! 

A Lil about me...
Started keto January 11, 2017 at 173 pounds, 5'4"", 23 year old female.


I have always been an eater out of boredom, habit, convenience, enjoyment... basically anything BUT actual hunger.


I had no goal weight really, since I've always been overweight I had no idea what a healthy/normal weight would be for me. Really just thought I was big boned (😳) and would always be overweight and bigger than my normal size friends. In college I managed to go from 200 to 175 and maintain for a few years, mostly through calorie counting, and just eating salads and meat/veggie/rice meals. 
I didn't even really know about low carb. Bless Reddit for introducing me to this sub.


Keto cleared up my acne. Last fall I contracted raging, cystic acne. I have no idea why (but my best guess is stress from school coupled with the terrible diet and tonsss of sugar I was eating at the time), and I had never had a problem with acne until then. Nothing cleared it except diet change.
(then I started eating PB and it came back so I had to cut that out) 
It flares up whenever I have sugar. 


Had two jobs and an internship, and was a full time student when I started doing it so busy people I feel you!!


I trained for and ran my first half marathon over the summer (whaaaat I am so not a runner.. but turns out it's way more awesome and actually enjoyable when you're lighter!) (I was 6 months in and keto adapted when I started training)


I went from what was starting to become a very snug size 12 to size 4 (sometimes size 2 - literally NEVER in my life did I think that was even possible. I swear I thought my body could not ever physically be small enough to fit into a 4, let alone a 2 ...And I have a few XS pieces now too. Woo!)
Had to thrift basically a whole new wardrobe.. no complaints there. Crop tops let's gooo


Have turned a lot of people onto keto/lowering their sugar intake/just being more aware of what they eat in general, so that's a cool NSV for me.


People at work have called me skinny. Me! SKINNY!!


I also graduated college this year, went to three new countries, did a road trip on the west coast, vastly improved my yoga practice, and have generally felt the best I ever have in my life.


Shootout to all you kind, intelligent, helpful people for keeping me motivated while I read this sub everyday, and for giving me the push I needed to finally make a change and stick with it! KCKO!
If you guys have specific questions for me I'm more than happy to oblige.
I will post a picture of the post y'all had last year that really motivated me, hopefully it may help someone else too!


Now that I've been 'skinny' for a minute I'm ready to get big again... Strength training here I come. 


Good luck to all starting keto - 2018 is, without a doubt, your year. Let's do this.

Edit: also my flair is wrong, I currently weigh 130 

Thank you all for your kind words! Love ya. KCKO!"

So I want to thank you all first of all- as my skin is a lot better than it was last summer! I have a fairly good routine down right now! However- I have a LOT of PIE/PIH. The PIE is what is really making me super sad and stressed. However, I recently got some vitamin C moisturizer and it seems to be helping. I have a FEW small Whiteheads- which I am assuming to be purging as I have recently adopted Paula’s choice 2% liquid BHA into my routine (I LOVE this BTW)!

Bottom line:  my skin is a lot better. But the PIE and small Whiteheads are getting to me. I’m anxious that my skin will never get to be as clear as I would like. What helps you when you feel down and out about your skin? 

I don’t often wear make up (honesty only when I have an important day at my internship or like if I am going on a date with my SO), so I fear whenever I’m out people are always staring at me &amp; judging me. 

Any advice/ words of wisdom will be amazing! :) "

So my background is in marketing, just graduated a year ago. After graduating, I realized my degree was useless and experience means everything. I got an internship doing general digital marketing (learning about Google Analytics, Tag Manager, Tableau, etc) and later got a job doing PPC Ads. 

I'm starting to realize that it takes a long time to get to the top level in marketing and I don't want that..from the small taste of analytics I've gotten, I really like it. I didn't like Math in school b/c it was sort of like accounting, but I'm realizing I really like logic and thinking strategically. 

Coding/Applied stats seems to be something I'm genuinely interested in, and the fact that it's going towards something actually tangible to help people. To get a position like that, I would have to first learn Python/R and Stats and use it in my current PPC job. 

Are there any people who have done this and can give me tips on what you specifically use your technical knowledge for? 

For example, there's someone that said they use Bayesian models for keywords and Monte Carlo simulation for conversions. 

I would want to start off at a more basic level but you get the point lol.

I unfortunately have been denied by all places for a personal loan without a co-sign since my credit is young and I am 21 with student loans. My primary bank has offered me a loan if I found a co-sign. My primary goal for this loan, and main point is that I need to build credit seeing as I will be graduating in a year.

###Dimension 9921, Southern Iowa, Earth.

*Two people, in a town made out of rusted scrap, junk, and other salvage that sits along a narrow green strip between a cracked, dry desert and a frozen tundra.*

*One of the pair, a young man with short brown hair being the resting place for a battered stahlhelm with flight goggles stretched over them. A brown, button up work jacket covered his exterior, except for the front where a white Tee shirt and bib overalls were exposed. Everything from head to toe was filthy and covered in grime. Holding a worn toolbox held together with duct tape in one hand and a wrench in the other.*

*The other person, a young woman worked on a large frame around an opening of a building. Capacitors, power relays, and cables were messily strewn about it. She wore a purple and white striped polo, with dirty khaki pants and wearing cracked glasses. Her shoulder length brown hair was frazzled and fell across a face that had seen better days, with minor cuts and scrapes covered by square pieces of cloth held on by scotch tape.*

*Growing bored, the male of the two set down his tools and sat on it, producing a sandwich from one of his coat pockets and started to eat it.* ""When d'ya think you'll be done? I gotta work on the Rumbler.""

*The young woman huffed angrily, before cracking open a dirt-cased laptop computer.* ""When I get done, Tim. Maybe you can get your head out of that tank and help me with this.""

*Tim rolled his eyes, and stood up, putting a half-eaten sandwich back where it belonged, before grabbing his tools.* ""Settle down, Luxina. Just point where for me to stick a wrench.""

***

## Dimension 0001 Deep Space, The Facility.

*Several lab personnel rushed about. Interns stumbled over each other as they rushed to their destination and away from the paws descending from the vent covers.*

*In one of the labs, an elderly squirrel anthro fussed about angrily with her tablet, watching the interns.*

""Watch it! That equipment is fragile! Unless you want me to throw you all into the portal experiment!"" *dusting off her labcoat, she connected her tablet to a type of frame, streamlined and fancy.* ""If this works Transportation will be revolutionized.""

*Engineers worked on the frame, creating new comms technologies to hopefully bridge the gap between different dimensions. One of them, an old Klopp Industries original run MRVIN robot walked up to the labcoat.*

[Preparations are ready. All systems are green in order to generate the bridge.]

*The squirrel turned to the machine, and waved her hand at it as she turned back to her tablet, dismissing it.* ""Yes, fine. get it running, I want everything working.""

*Nodding, the head engineer directed the others to get away from the machined, and hooked it up to the power grid. The labcoat punched in several coordinates, and a team of interns got ready to make the expedition of a lifetime.*

***

**Back on Earth:**

*The pair continued to work on their patchwork gate, and traveled back inside the building, where a modified [Russian 2k22 SPAA tank](https://thaimilitaryandasianregion.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/4bbc5734f183.png), with ""The Rusted Rumbler!"" painted on the side, and a custom-built pickup truck, resembling a [vintage chevrolet](http://www.bobbittville.com/ChevyPU-1948RustyRatRod-AR.jpg). As Luxina finished with the Laptop, Tim got to work hooking up the batteries of his cherished tank to the patchwork gate they were building.*

""You know, I don't really subscribe to the idea of using my Rumbler as a battery for whatever the fuck you're planning.""

*Luxina's eye twitched, and she turned to Tim* ""Because, if this works like it should, we'll travel through this portal, and back in time to our families.""

*Timothy however, blew that idea off with a raspberry.* ""Back to a life where the only thing I'm capable of doing is pissing everybody off? No thank you. Besides, we have lives here. We got a job, a house-""

""We're mercenaries with a tank, Timothy. The only reason the public respects us is because we were able to find a tank and patch it back together.""

""And that's bad how? Sure we have to worry about irradiated mice, but I honestly don't see any reason to go back""

*Luxina stood up, and chewed him out, stepping on her laptop by accident.* ""Well maybe when I get the portal working you can just tear the thing apart and stay here!""

*Accidentally activating the portal gate device, sparks flew, before a swirling portal in a sickly green hue formed in the middle, and expanded to the edges. Both of them fell silent as they stared at, before Tim walked up, and asked her.* ""Lux, the fuck's this?""

***

**On the Facility:**

*As preparations finish, the squirrel's eyes sparkled with glee. Today was the day. With hope, this won't end in disaster like last time where she sent interns to the blender dimension. Activating the portal, it initially refused to function, a huge waste of power and a blow to morale for everyone involved. The squirrel professor sat down in a chair, and threw her tablet while it was still connected to the portal gate. As the tablet shattered, a malfunction in the destination dimension codes made the portal form into a swirling green. The doctor's eyes went wide, and ordered the engineers to shut it down quickly, fearing another mishap. Two humanoid figures leapt out of the portal just before the gate was shut down, and subsequently melted from the heat of the electricity passing through it, causing a major power overload to form in the room, creating an explosion that rattled throughout the facility.*"

7pthr6,2,2018-01-11,Member functions as callbacks for C libraries,Jake1055,cpp_questions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp_questions/comments/7pthr6/member_functions_as_callbacks_for_c_libraries/,"Some background: I'm doing a month long internship that involves a raspberry pi.  I'm using a C library called 'wiringPi' that provides the following function:

    int wiringPiISR(int pin, int edgeType, void (*function)(void));

I'm attempting to wrap the functionality for a [rotary encoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder) in a class, and I was hoping to use the above function to set up interrupts in the constructor.

Originally, I tried to write public member functions and pass them as that third parameter, but the compiler gave the error 'invalid use of non-static member function' when I called wiringPiISR with a member function as the third parameter.

I couldn't exactly figure out what was bad about my code, as I thought a function is a function, and I didn't expect that the fact it was a member function would cause any problems.  I found [this](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/pointers-to-members#memfnptr-vs-fnptr) which suggested that is not the case.  I don't understand why the example they give(the one that uses globals) solves the problem, because the wrapper function will only manipulate the object that the pointer points to(which you have to change yourself and I can't do that for this example) and the static member function will likewise not be able to manipulate state.

The interrupt routine needs to be able to manipulate object state of the object that triggered the interrupt.  I could make the interrupt routines static, I would need to add a parameter to convey the information of _which_ object needs to be updated.  The problem is that the prototype for wiringPiISR expects a function in the form void(void), so I wouldn't be able to pass a static member function in the form void(Encoder *) to it.

I'm kind of stuck.  I want to setup interrupt routines that can ""remember"" which object whose state they're supposed to manipulate.  I cannot pass a pointer to the interrupt routine, because wiringPiISR requires a function in the form void(void) and not void(Encoder *), and I cannot use a member function, because they cannot implicitly convert to function pointers.

Is there a solution here I'm not seeing?  Do I have to dive into the wiringPi code and change some stuff around?  I remember seeing something about a person in a similar situation who had to go in and change the C function definition to accept std::function's instead of function pointers, from which you could pass lambdas, but my attempt to do that has been unsuccessful.

Since it won't compile as a non-static member function, and I won't be able to manipulate state by passing a pointer to the correct object, I considered something like a bunch of functions that can be pushed onto a vector or something.  The problem is that the only way I can imagine of doing that is by pushing lambdas onto a vector of std::functions.  But I can't find any way online to convert from those std::functions to function pointers in the form void(void).

I saw [something about ""thunks""](http://bannalia.blogspot.com/2016/07/passing-capturing-c-lambda-functions-as.html) and the potential of passing parameters even though none are declared, but I don't think the situation applies here."

UTÖKA CCO, Ed Dye, has announced that motion designer Charlie Erholm has joined his recently launched Atlanta-based creative agency.

 The design-driven boutique adds Erholm to a multi-disciplined team of artists with a collaborative approach to developing visual identity-driven brand strategies and concepts that provide direction for the crafting of compelling deliverables across multiple platforms.

Charlie Erholm's talents were recently tapped for a national GMC campaign. The package of commercials features live-action footage of the vehicles being put through their paces, as motion design elements integrated into the footage, accentuate the state-of-the-art technology built into cars' range of features.

""For the GMC package, I used Illustrator to design and create UI element and icons in the videos, and then animated them in After Effects,"" says Erholm.  ""Mocha enabled me to get the motion tracking data from the footage of the cars so the graphics could be attached to selected images. Finally, everything was composited together and animated.in After Effects.""

A graduate of Savannah College of Art and Design with a BFA in Motion Design, Erholm was selected by Cartoon Network to work as a digital design intern in 2016 in her senior year. The stint at Tuner provided her with real-world experience in the industry and an opportunity to hone her motion and design skills on a mix of on-air promotions and campaigns for 'Boomerang,' and 'Adult Swim.'

UTÖKA was looking for exceptional young artists to expand its already impressive roster of in-house talent when they received Charlie’s reel and signed her right out college.

'Growing our arsenal of top-caliber talent is a key component of UTÖKA‘s business plan,"" concur Dye and CEO Michael Zarrillo, the company's co-founders. ""Charlie represents the next generation of motion designers, committed to growing as an artist, and brings a level of passion to her craft that makes her a great fit for our team.""

About UTÖKA:
UTÖKA is a hybrid creative agency blending strategic design and end-to-end production services. Its collaborative collective of artists is skilled at crafting a range of deliverables - from broadcast commercials, online campaigns, and digital signage to stand-alone logos, packaging, print, ads and visual effects-driven content, and integrating memorable brand stories that connect products with their target markets.  

Helmed by industry veterans, CCO Ed Dye and CEO Michael Zarrillo, the studio builds upon the synergy between their former award-winning companies: Artistic Image, the CGI, animation, live-action, motion studio, and Artemis Creative, the design/photography and print house, founded by Dye and Zarrillo, respectively.

7pttuo,10,2018-01-11,How did you balance LSAT prep and college classes?,basedlarrydavid,LSAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/7pttuo/how_did_you_balance_lsat_prep_and_college_classes/,"Hey all,

I tried to search around but couldn't find anything specific regarding this question. But how did you all do it?

I'm writing June 2018. As it stands now, I have about five months before the exam. I spent all of Winter Break studying, roughly 6-13 hours a day, with a couple of off days in there. Honestly, by the time I got back to school this week, I was already drained. It is never a good feeling coming back from break and being more rekt than when you left. 

At any rate, I knew that I would be writing June, so I scheduled the lightest credit load that I could (12 semester hours). I'm taking three high-level political science/political theory classes and an internship. I probably could have selected easier classes (a whole shitload of reading required for these), but I didn't want my transcript to reflect a fear of taking difficult courses. 

So, for those of you who wrote/studied for the LSAT while taking college courses and trying to maintain a gunner GPA, how did you all do it? Did you do longer sessions a few times per week or small amounts daily? How many hours per week did you actually LSAT prep? Considering that I have five months, I don't see a need to study 30 hours per week. But I could be wrong.

Hey guys,

Not sure how active this sub is when I was going to Queen's I was completely lost and really had no idea what I was going to do after graduating. I would have loved the opportunity to talk to someone in the industry to see what it's like after graduation and how to go about job hunting. I didn't look very hard because I spent all my time playing StarCraft and LoL. If you're in CS, computer engineering, or ece and want to know more about the industry, write a post or pm me. While I didn't particularly enjoy my time at Queens, I know I had awful support from career services and I'm not sure how much better it got. 

I know someone currently in CS and from what she tells me most people don't believe they can get internships or jobs easily without top marks. That's categorically untrue because there is a huge labour shortage in the industry. I hope I can be of help in someway here."

I'm normally local to the Greater Boston Area, but I am trying to set up a summer internship in NYC. It will be in web development so I will be able to do most of my work remotely, but I want to get a taste for the city, as I might want to move there after college.

Ideally I could find someone willing to let me stay with them for the summer. I'm looking for someone to go to museums and parks with, read books with, work out with, eat good food with, etc. Someone that can generally show me around and introduce me to the finer things in NYC, someone that I can be devastatingly witty with.

I'm around 5'4"", white, and petite, and I like to surround myself with fit, attractive people that can match me pun for pun. Though I like to spend a lot of time in comfortable silence I can talk about anything.
In return I can offer my perpetual effervescence, my loving and caring demeanor, an intelligent summer companion, and not to be too conceited but I can also be a pretty delicious piece of arm candy at classy events.

This may be a long shot but if this sounds like something you are interested in, please let me know."

Thank you all for looking out for one another, it's really wonderful to see how supportive and kind people can be. I hope everyone's 2018 is off to a better start than last year!

I've been no contact with my ex-girlfriend (who exhibits cluster B traits and has a confirmed psychotic disorder) for 4.5 months, roughly, after a 4.5 year-long relationship. Leaving her, and furthermore maintaining absolutely no contact has been difficult. We were high school sweethearts, and I thought she was my best friend. I honestly wanted to marry her after I graduated with my degree. She was ""there for me"" when my Dad died, and I supported her through some terrible times in her life. 

For those who don't know my story, I left my ex-girlfriend after she was arrested on a domestic violence charge - and this following a situation in which she forced me into an open relationship that I made clear I didn't want, broke the rules in, and mocked me about sleeping with someone else in front of others. This was the tip of the iceberg, though: she was emotionally and verbally abusive since the beginning of our relationship, and sometimes physically abusive as well. She blamed me for her getting arrested.

Since leaving her and the old home we had, my life has picked up quite a bit. I'm currently a part of a competitive residency in a program that will allow me to interact with and teach young people, as well as receiving a scholarship and an internship thanks to a club I recently joined on my college campus. I'm going to be graduating from one of the best schools in my state with a difficult degree, and I wouldn't have been able to do it without the immense assistance and support of my family and my friends here. I owe the people around me a huge debt of gratitude.

Tonight I've been playing my guitar and reading poetry - and drinking whiskey. My ex gave me a few books from my favourite poets years ago, and I was in a mood to leaf through his old writings tonight. Seeing the messages she had written to me in the margins of those books set me off kilter, I guess; like little timeless, ephemeral messages in bottles, the love notes from then still wash ashore long after they were sent. 

They made me kinda sad. For a long time now, I've been focusing on myself and improving my life: I've since focused much more on schoolwork and what I want to do with myself after I graduate, I'm pursuing hobbies I haven't enjoyed in years, and have even begun talking with other women. I talk with my therapist frequently about what I went through in that relationship, but also what I went through as a child in order to recognize my own faults and failings. Overall, my day-to-day quality of life has improved drastically, and I smile and laugh much more than I cry lately. I wonder why on earth I insisted on being around my ex in the first place.

Yet some nights, I have a hard time sleeping; I have nightmares about the way she treated me, or that no-one will believe me about how awful she was to me for such a long time. Other nights, I see the little notes she left me in my books or notes, and I miss feeling her heart beat against my arms as I held her sleeping for so many years. I miss the cheap strawberry-conditioner smell of her hair, and the silly games we'd play together. Some nights I question if I made the right choice in leaving, because some nights I think I'm ugly, or stupid, or even unworthy of being loved by anyone - including my family. 

And then I remember all the names she'd call me, like ""crybaby"" because it hurt so bad that she cheated; I remember how she'd rarely support me when I was in my absolute worst moments; I remember the way she'd kick and shove me; I remember the ways she'd manipulate me and abuse my generosity. I realize that I don't miss *her* at all, but rather the flat ghost of her that I had envisioned in my mind that trailed minutely behind her, *just* off from reality. I've come to know that the person I knew as my ex-girlfriend was always the best parts of her that I loved and hoped she'd become fully, but not the parts of her as she *was*. 

I guess I'm writing this because I feel quite lonely right now. I miss the family that her, my Dad and I were, which fell apart so quickly not that long ago. Yet I also know that woman wasn't even partially good for me in the long run, and that the sadness or loneliness that I feel now being *truly* alone wasn't half as agonizing as crying myself senseless in the living room because I felt lonelier in bed with her than without her. 

As hard as it is sometimes, I realize that separating from her is the most direct path to healing than anything else. Ulysses had to be tied to the mast while listening to the siren's song; for many of us, we must endure the same. 

If you're struggling with moving on and healing, you're not alone. This community - and myself - are here to listen to you and try to offer you the best advice we can. Finding this subreddit and sharing my story has been enlightening and ultimately healing, and I hope those of you who are also having a rough night find similar solace here. 

Hope you're all well, sleep tight!"

My dad is running a few successful businesses which I would take over ownership once I am done with my current bachelor studies. I am in my last year and landed a really hard internship at a very well-known and respected company. My previous internship was at a company that is known for being the best in its field for the last 14 years in my country. I passed it with a 10 out of 10, which they never graded someone with before. I have no debts, a handful of really close and good friends and half a year ago I met a girl while I was on holidays. After the holidays me and her have been visiting each other a few times since she lives a 1-hour plane journey from me. Things went really well for the last months and since Christmas it has been stamped with the ""relationship"" mark.

Everything about this girl is anything I have ever wanted. I have in my life only been in two relationships ever. One which lasted 5 years and one that lasted close to 4 years. I am really picky and really need to know a 1000% that I am insanely in love with the girl and that I see a future. Of course, those previous relationships were not with a person who did not live in the same country as me. 

Things with me and my girlfriend, like I said, go really well. We share the same personality on fields like how important trust is, how being open and communication is so important. Definitely in a long distance relationship! Both our families are very happy with us being in each others lives, where her family never really responded in such a positive way with her ex. Our future plans and goals are also exactly the same. All in all, it can not get any more perfect really since there are so many things that we are on the same page about.


And here comes the but... The last month or so I have been, for no reason at all, feeling really down, unmotivated, not wanting to go out and suddenly started to overthink a lot. And seriously, it is A LOT. I will give a few examples later on. The thing is that after over-thinking something, later I would think back and be like ""why would you ever think this?"". My heart knows there is nothing wrong and nothing to worry. It is my brain that is screwing with me! 

A simple example. Her and I always facetime at the end of the day to finish of our day, recap how our day went and basically fall asleep over facetime. Sometimes (I am an hour ahead of her) I message her to say I'm already falling asleep and can't stay up. She'd message me that it's perfectly fine and if I wanted to she could facetime me once she is ready to go to sleep. So I would leave my laptop open and receive a call later.

There's been a few occasions where I'd wake up the next day, to no call. Id ask why she never did (and it annoyed me a lot for some reason). She'd say that she was afraid she'd wake me up and wanted me to get some sleep. I thought it was very weird since she asked if it was ok for her to call later. When she finished work at her local bar on the Friday at 03:00 in the morning, she always calls to let me know she's safely home and everything. These things have always been normal to her and she'd do it from her own will because she wanted me to know she was safe and such.

Another time I woke up at 03:00, noticed I never got a call so I called myself. And she'd be wide awake on her phone and she'd be like ""oh i didnt want to wake you up babe"".

That's just one thing. To explain why I am over-thinking I have this perfect example that clearly shows something is wrong with ME and not with her or our relationship.

We were talking about our future and I'd ask her if it would take us around 5 years to meet halfway and live together (which is basically the plan). She instantly responded and laughed and said ""well I hope it would be sooner babe! I really love the idea of having you around so it better be shorter than 5!"". Which I thought was really positive. She then went on explaining how her father and her brother have noticed that she is extremely happy and how they are very supportive. We discussed the topic a bit more and there were like 10 things she said that made me all warm inside and got me all excited. And she finished off by saying ""but babe look, there's no need to talk this through all in detail. We never know what might happen it might be 2 years, maybe 5, maybe 8. All I know that it is my goal to be with you so I'll be working on it for as long as it is necessary!"".

And instead of feeling really positive, I suddenly got so many doubts in my head. Thinking like ""what she on about, we never know what might happen? She seriously going to think that I'm in this just to ""see what happens""?"" 

Basically I have the sweetest and most loving girlfriend I could have wished for. Everything she does is with really good intentions and she always gives me small but very nice compliments. When our facetime starts she'd either be like ""I just can't believe a person that looks so good is my boyfriend babe! I have such a crush on you it feels surreal!"". Or she'd be looking at me while I'm talking and she'd interrupt me being like: ""I can't help but to just look into your eyes and daydream about sharing the rest of my life with you I just love you so much"".

All these amazing things she says or does are completely neglected if she ever says/does one thing that throws me off. For instance, if we send a snapchat we always put the timer on infinite because we usually put a lot of text in it. Rarely it happens that she sends me a snap and there's a 5-second or any timer on it. Instead of re-opening it or asking her what she said because I couldn't read all of it, I get extremely annoyed. I'd really get pissed and I'm in a very bad mood which kickstarts me overthinking everything.

I have no idea what to do with it! I know for a fact, and I talked about it with my friends and my parents, that it is my thought processing. Between her and me, everything is good and I should have 0 reason to have bad thoughts about her or our relationship. Before last month I'd be a very relaxed guy and would never stress or think about situations that are not 100% clear. I would have a mind-set that if there are no clear signs about something, worrying about it wouldn't make a difference.


I really need help because I feel really bad for putting my girlfriend in a position that she has to deal with a grumpy/annoyed boyfriend (especially with the distance) while all she is doing is being the best and most amazing person I could wish for in my life. I just have no idea how to tackle this and what it exactly is that is causing me to suddenly be very weird and over-thinking and such.


TL;DR: since last month I start to over-think and get angry/annoyed for random reasons that shouldn't make me feel like this at all. I don't know what it is if it's like depression or whatever. I know for a fact it's something in my head, it has nothing to do with my relationship or my girlfriends behavior.

7py09y,15,2018-01-12,Don't Turn off the Webcam!,NInjaMasterPro3,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/7py09y/dont_turn_off_the_webcam/,"Linh and I met in 2008. She was from a very small town in Washington with a population of less than five hundred. I was working my way through college as an event bartender in Portland. Linh’s cousin was getting married in Portland, and as fate would have it, the wedding reception was held at an upscale hotel on the Columbia River where I frequently tended to small wine and beer bars. 
I noticed her immediately, as I often notice women that I quickly convince myself are too beautiful to ever date someone like me. Eventually as the night went on, she made her way over to my bar and ordered a white wine. We talked for a while about Portland. 
I sweated profusely as I tend to do around girls like her. She would be spending the next two days in the city, and I took a few moments telling her about the most interesting sights to see and things to do in town. 
“Wow, you should just be my personal tour guide,” she said, grabbing my arm and smiling. This happened to me so infrequently that I really had no idea how to react, so I just mumbled “Sure, what time?” and laughed nervously to hedge in the event that she was joking. “How about 10:30 tomorrow morning?” She replied. 
And so started my relationship with Linh. She was infectious, with a personality that was so innocent and warm. I immediately fell in love with her. There were a few issues that we would have to work through. She was still in Washington and I was finishing school in Oregon. Linh was Vietnamese with a very traditional father who would never approve of her having a white boyfriend. 
She lived alone in a house with her father, as her mother had passed away several years earlier, so going to Yarrow Point to visit her was out of the question. She would come to see me every three weeks under the guise of a prestigious internship program. 
Being in a long distance relationship, we spoke on the phone and texted constantly. When high speed internet finally came to her small town in Washington, I surprised her with a webcam for her computer so we could have an even better means of long distance communication. In the back of my mind, I was always looking for ways to be with her as even after two years of dating I was paranoid a girl as beautiful as her would eventually find somebody better to share her life with. 
In 2010, Linh’s father passed away suddenly in his sleep from a heart attack. He was everything to her, and she was heartbroken. When she returned from Florida where the funeral was held and her father buried, she was all alone in the house where she had lost both of her parents. With Linh’s father deceased, she was open to finally allowing me to come to Washington to see her, which we planned on doing in a few weeks after my college finals. 
One night during our usual bedtime conversation, Linh mentioned to me that her father had been acting strangely in the days leading up to his death. She explained that he had taken to checking up on her multiple times throughout the day and night, and scattering religious artifacts throughout the house. This behavior, she said, was highly uncharacteristic of him. 
Vietnamese culture and religion was something foreign to me, and at various points Linh had mentioned things like this that I normally wrote off as just being a little silly. She explained to me that being in the house alone without her Dad was emotional and may be playing tricks on her. She hated the feeling of being so alone. She told me that being able to see me on her webcam was the closest thing she had to family, and asked that I promise to never turn off the webcam. She meant the world to me, so I was happy to oblige. 
A few days passed and it was now the Tuesday before the weekend when I would finally come to see her in Washington. We spent our bedtime webcam session excitedly talking about our plans and I dozed off with my head on the kitchen table in mid conversation. It had been a long day. When I woke up, I saw Linh sleeping on my screen and stumbled off to bed. 
At 3:00am, my cell phone begin to ring. Disoriented, I rolled over, took a look at the clock and knew it could only be her. She took great pleasure in waking me up in the middle of the night to let me know that she had just gotten a drink of water, or had an amusing dream. Anyone else would have gotten an earful from me, but her flirtatious giggle made me feel lucky to have my much needed sleep interrupted. 
“I had a nightmare!” Linh gasped. “…You danced in front of my friends.” She burst into laughter. 
“What are you doing up so late honey? You’ve got to work in the morning.” I said. 
“I was thirsty, and went downstairs to get a drink of water.” 
“Great, well we really should go back to sleep, tomorrow is a big day.” 
“Allllright,” she conceded. “Hey by the way, don’t forg——” 
After a few crackles and a brief burst of static, the call disconnected. I hated Linh’s phone, she had an old flip phone that dropped calls with no rhyme or reason at least three times a day. I held down the #1 on my own phone, my speed dial for Linh. No ring, straight to voicemail. 
I tried to call several more times, and each time it again went straight to voicemail. 
I was exhausted, and though I loved Linh to death, to be honest I just wanted to go back to sleep. My eyelids hung heavy. 
A little annoyed, I decided to walk out to my kitchen for a quick drink of water. The two glasses of wine that I drank before bed had left me with a little bit of dry mouth. As I rinsed the glass and went to place it in the dishwasher, out of the corner of my eye I saw movement on the glow of the laptop perched on my dining room table. 
It was the webcam. Two fluffy brown paws were making a swimming motion directly in front of her camera. As I got closer I saw a close up of two grinning faces. One of that silly dog of hers, and the other of my giggling girlfriend, who knew that eventually after being unable to make phone contact I would wander out to the webcam to say goodnight. I wouldn’t put it past her to turn the phone off on purpose to elaborately stage this scene. Me, standing in my underwear at 3am on a work night, half asleep staring at a girl and a puppy on a webcam. 
I waved goodnight, and she kissed the lens of the webcam and pulled away. 
I froze. 
I wiped my eyes and looked again. 
There. 
It’s… standing in the corner of the room. It’s… 
Staring at her. 
Wrinkled. Angry, twisted mouth. 
Hateful eyes. 
What the fuck. 
HATEFUL eyes. 
It’s watching her. 
Two hours later, I woke on the dining room floor. I had a ringing in my ears and a knot on the back of my head. I immediately knew what had happened. It wasn’t the first time. 
Sudden, extreme stress has given me panic attacks and black outs a few times before. I had never felt such fear when what had happened came rushing back and I nearly had a second panic attack when my thoughts turned to Linh. 
I loved her more than anything in the world. It took me several moments to summon the courage the look in the direction of my laptop. When I finally did, the screensaver had long since turned on. I looked away from the screen as I flicked the touchpad with my shaking finger. It took me another two minutes to open my eyes. 
Linh laid sleeping in her bed. She looked so peaceful. Sleeping on her side, facing towards the webcam. As frightened and confused as I was, relief at her safety gave me a sense of comfort as I desperately tried to process what had happened. Maybe the wine had hit me harder than I thought. Maybe I slipped and fell on the slick tile floor, and it all had been a nightmare. 
I stared at her. I loved her. Maybe more than even I realized. So peaceful and beautiful as she slept. 
The light of her television danced across her room and illuminated the bed. As I watched on, her hand began to move. 
Slowly. 
Unnaturally. 
She was sleeping but her fingers crawled across the bed slowly until they reached something. It was her cell phone. 
Her hand moved like a spider, fingers popping in several directions across the keys. 
What the hell? 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. 
My phone was vibrating. 
“New Message: DON’T…” 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. 
“New Message: TURN…” 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. 
“New Message: OFF” 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. 
“New Message: THE” 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. 
“New Message: WEB” 
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ. 
“New Message: CAM” 
Complete terror set in as the messages came across the screen of my cell phone. 
“New Message: DON’T…” 
“New Message: TURN…” 
“New Message: OFF” 
“New Message: THE” 
“New Message: WEB” 
“New Message: CAM” 
As I glanced back to my laptop, horror overcame me as slowly a shadow crept across the floor. Something was crossing in front of the television. Moving closer to Linh. 
I told myself it was just her dog, right? The color drained out of my face when I noticed the puppy sleeping in the far corner of the room. 
I picked up my phone and dialed Linh. I didn’t know what I would tell her, but I knew she needed to get out of there immediately and never go back. Dammit straight to voicemail! THAT STUPID OLD PHONE OF HERS. 
The full shadow now hung completely over Linh. 
Her hand jerked, flipping open her cell phone. 
My phone was ringing. 
I answered, “LINH! LINH CAN YOU HEAR ME YOU NEED TO…” 
A burst of loud static forced my phone reflexively away from my ear. 
On the webcam I saw Linh’s lips begin to move. Her eyes were shut, but she was speaking. 
I heard her voice come across the phone, but something wasn’t right. She was speaking, but a second, deeper voice echoed hers in perfect unison. 
“DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM…. AGRAMON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. DON’T TURN OFF THE WEBCAM. AGRAMON IS READY FOR YOU NOW.” 
“Who? What? What does he want?” I yelled in desperation. 
“HE WANTS TO EAT YOUR SKIN.” 
The line disconnected. 
The shadow across Linh’s bed changed directions. 
It started moving away from the bed… and towards her laptop… towards the webcam. 
As the shadow moved closer small streams of gray liquid rolled towards the lens. 
The images coming across my monitor began to shake violently. 
It was almost here. I could now see the top of its head. It was CRAWLING towards me. Wet strings of silver and black hair hanging over its face. I remembered those hateful eyes and I lost control of my bladder as it slowly begin to tilt its head up. 
And then I did it. 
In panic I slammed my laptop shut and threw it against the hard tile floor before collapsing to the ground. 
I wished for a panic attack to take my consciousness and end this nightmare, but it didn’t come. 
I crawled to the panel of switches a few feet up on the wall and turned on every light that I could. I noticed the bottle of wine still open on the kitchen counter and drank most of it down in a single swallow. I reached up and pulled open my apartment door, and stumbled across the threshold, extending half of my body into the common hallway so I wouldn’t feel so alone. A pathetic coward sprawled out on the concrete. 
My phone began to ring. 
I crawled to it. Linh’s name was flashing on the caller ID. I held it in my hand, paralyzed by fear. 
And then the ringing stopped. 
I took another mouthful of wine and mustered the courage to call back. It went straight to voicemail. And then again and again as I tried to call. 
Eventually the shock and drowsiness from the wine got the better of me, and I passed out on the floor after making a few more attempts. 
When I awoke several hours later, despite the broken laptop and empty bottle, I wanted to believe that it was all some sort of horrible nightmare. 
Out of the corner of my eye I saw blue flashing light on my cell phone. 
“You have one new voicemail.” 
My hand trembled as I dialed my voicemail and entered my passcode. 
The message was time stamped, and was from the missed call I had from Linh before passing out. 
Her voice. She was in tears and frightened as though I had never heard her before. 
“You promised. Why… why did you… turn off the web… webcam. “ 
“His… his tongue burns.“ 
With a crackle the message ended. 
Two years have passed since that night. I never tried to contact Linh again. I never called her work to see if she came in the following morning. I never made it to Yarrow Point in Washington where she lived. She was my soul mate, and I let this happen. I was probably right on the night we met when I told myself I wasn’t man enough for her. 
The only reason I am telling this story today, under the cowardly vale of anonymity, is because my drug and alcohol counselor thinks it would be good for me. So here it is. I made the decision to let the love of my life face an unimaginable nightmare to spare myself, and the worst part is that I may not even regret it. 
Now if you will excuse me, I think I need another drink.

I've recently started an internship in sales for a Cisco partner that sells R&amp;S, Security and Collaboration sollutions, with focus on Collab.


 Is really important to us having specific technical arguments for customers about how cisco is better than the competitors (huawei, hp, unify, etc.) on specific products. 


Example: What are the competidors of Cisco 2960x?


we have:

* HP 2920-48G-PoE+

And why is cisco better comparatively?

So any of you have some sources of research? 
It's really hard to find comparisons.

Having doubts",ThrwAway_RelationShp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7pzit8/me_23_m_with_my_gf_23_f_for_a_year_moving_in_soon/,"When I was 17 in high school, I got a message from this pretty 18 yr old girl saying ""what are you?"".. After find out that I'm apparently some exotic attractive foreigner, we met and went on a date. We kind of hooked up early (kissing, touching, a few penetrations and then she told me to stop).. She had a bf at the time that was in jail and she hadn't seen her in 5 months.. She dropped me off crying hideously. 

We didn't talk for like a year and at some point we started talking again. She was single this time but we were long distance (as we are to this day). We drove midway and she picked me up and took me to her house, we hooked up, smoked, had fun, etc. We started dating and after a few months I broke it off because we were long distance and she posted some shit on my wall as a joke that made me look like an abusive bf when I clearly wasn't. So that really pissed me off and I made up my mind and broke it off.

One day she snapchatted me ""I need some serious dick in my life and I'm not gonna sleep with strangers. Wanna come over?"" and having had great sex with her almost every time, I accepted, and we kept on doing this for a while. But eventually we cut it off again.

Overall I've known her for a couple years now and last October we started seeing each other again. On Christmas, I asked her to be my girlfriend and we've been dating ever-since and our first anniversary was a few weeks ago. 

Here are some quick recent facts, leading to my question:

1. I have loved this girl more than any other girl in my life. She's the sweetest girlfriend and has my back. But we used to get into a lot of arguments, mostly over trivial things. I'm foreign so the idea of sleeping near a dog was really odd to me at first, and she LOVES dogs. So I feel like one of the reasons the relationship never materialized initially was because I was the weird foreign guy not loving on her two cute pups all day and sleeping with her and them.

2. We started to get really serious around April (midway through our official attempt at a relationship for the last time). I cut out the bullshit in my attitude like being childish and doing the things she hates, and she stopped throwing baby-like temper tantrums with her annoying generic white girl, California accent. 

3. I stopped fantasizing about other girls and I'm actually not even talking to other girls right now, which leads me to the personal issues in my head that I'm about to state next.

4. I always think about the fact that she cheated on her jailed bf with me when we were in high school so why wouldn't she do the same to me once she meets another exotic Ricardo or something? but then I re-assure myself by thinking she was only 18 and that's an age where girls do shit like that, and I did that too as a dude. ALSO, nowadays she really isn't into sex. She has become like a wife. Treats you with sex once in a while. 

5. She smokes pot alot. I used to do the same, but since I got into engineering school a few years ago, I'm becoming less and less interested in pot (maybe once every 3 months I do it with old friends).

6. She has a lot of anxiety and takes a shit ton of medication. She tells me this is because of her abusive boyfriend when she was 15 and her mom going through menopause and treating her like shit once in a while. 

7. When I started getting my act together (not being childish and throwing a fit), taking her out to eat, caring for her well-being, etc.. her mom started to notice and she started liking me. She threw around the idea of marriage and although I cringed at first, we've both come to think about it for the future.

8. At this point I literally treat her dogs like they're my kids and I can see that we legitimately could get married in the future. I really think she's the one. The only things that are off-putting for me are the negative facts I mentioned earlier (e.g. cheating at 18, smoking a lotttt, lots of medication and anxiety).

9. I'm going to graduate soon and I'm looking for internships in my home state right now because we don't wanna be far from her parents since her old dad may pass soon. So this could seriously impact my future career.

10 ** We are moving in-together beginning of summer and all of these issues are consistently distracting me.. I've been able to handle my schooling and relationship well thus far, and she's VERY hard-working. She busts her ass no matter where she works and she sees herself going back to school too, so I don't have worries about her leeching off of me (considering my salary will be well above hers in about a year) because I know she's striving to advance herself and be a boss.

11. I've spent time at her place for a good week or two before and we didn't seem to get sick of each other or anything. We were loving, I took care of her dogs, we went on ice cream dates, etc. So that was a sign that an abrupt change in seeing each other more than once a week wouldn't necessarily mean that we would get tired of each other. 

12. That cheating ordeal comes up once in a while and I feel like if this keeps going on, she will legit get sick of me and cheat for the sake of feeling free or something. HOW do I get over this and trust her more? I really think she IS trustworthy.. I guess in my head I imagine a bunch of buddies making fun of me for being a jackass and getting cheated on and not knowing it. So out of nowhere I bring it up. How can you worry less about cheating as a guy? Why is this such a mind-fuck to me...

Sorry for making this super long but I've thought about these things so much that I don't know what's normal or extreme anymore in this relationship. I guess I just wanna know other people's opinions on this and what you think about us moving in together. 
  ---   
EDIT: Something super important that I didn't mention is that we're like best friends. We love each other a lot and we're bffs at the same time. This is very unique to me because we listen to each other and we have a lot in common politically and ideologically. Our sense of humor is very similar.. She's gorgeous, funny, smart, and likes some of the same things I do.. She's wifey material.. The way she loves on her dogs and cares for them makes me think she'd make a good mom 8-10 yrs from now. These are some of the biggest reasons I see myself with her. 

  **tl;dr**: Off-and-on heterosexual relationship since we were in high school. She met me and cheated on her highschool BF. The cheating is on the back of my mind and makes me doubt if I wanna be in this b/c if I ever found out she cheated on me, I leggit would go off-grid and not talk to girls for a long time. Moving in soon, not sure if it's the right move; don't wanna get tired of each other --&gt; want to keep the relationship fresh/sweet. "
7pziuc,81,2018-01-12,Matt Nagy's rise to head coach of the Chicago Bears is one of the most interesting sports stories of the year,[deleted],nfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7pziuc/matt_nagys_rise_to_head_coach_of_the_chicago/,"Just flipped through his Wikipedia page. Dude has has a long ass road to the NFL. Signed as a street free agent to the Arena Football League's New York Dragons, Nagy journeymanned through the AFL following a short career as Delaware's I-AA starting quarterback.

After his playing days, he was hired to be the *quarterbacks coach* and *JV offensive coordinator* at Cedar Crest High School in Pennsylvania. As late as 2009, Nagy was an offensive coordinator at a Pennsylvania high school.

Finally catching his big break, he was hired as an offensive intern for the Philadelphia Eagles in the same year. But the Eagles couldn't hire him as an official coach following him earning a promotion, legally, for some reason. By 2011, at age 33, he had worked his way into the job of offensive quality control for the Eagles. 

By 2016, he had worked his way into the offensive coordinator position for the Chiefs. And by the final five games of 2017, Andy Reid ceded play-calling duties to Nagy for the first time in his six-year NFL career.

Say what you want about how this hire could easily backfire, but this man has worked for his shot."

Fortunately for us, the Chicago Bears finally completed their staff, allowing me to continue with this exercise. Here are my grades for their moves, but feel free to add your own below.

######**CHICAGO BEARS**

**Head Coach: Matt Nagy, OC, Kansas City Chiefs**

After the splashy signing of Jon Gruden, Matt Nagy felt like the most sought-after candidate in the field. Why? Let's take a look.

*his resume*

A successful college QB at Delaware, Nagy's limited physical attributes led him to the Arena League. He had a good six-year career there, where he put up stats that any fantasy football fan or Madden player would envy, including 85 touchdown passes in 2006 alone.

After his playing career, Nagy worked as a coaching intern with Andy Reid's Eagles team in 2009. The team actually signed Nagy to be a player-coach, figuring he could serve as a 3rd QB as well, but the NFL league office nixed that plan. Nagy focused on coaching instead.

Since then, Nagy's tagged along with Andy Reid and worked his way up the ladder in Philadelphia and now Kansas City, moving from QB coach to co-offensive coordinator to official offensive coordinator for the first time this year. He even called plays for stretches, which is a rarity for a Reid OC.

*his virtues*

Nagy fits the prototype of a modern coaching candidate. He's young enough (still 39) to relate to current players, especially with his background as a successful QB, albeit in the Arena League.

That Arena League background also trickles into his coaching style and playcalling. It's no coincidence that the Chiefs opened up their offense and attacked their opponents more aggressively this year. And in turn, it's no coincidence that Alex Smith had a career season as a result.

Andy Reid has always developed his assistants into viable head coaching candidates, with the recent example being Doug Pederson in Philadelphia. Nagy followed Pederson's blueprint exactly (former QB turned QB coach turned OC turned head coach). In fact, Reid has basically stated that Nagy's the best assistant he's ever had, no small compliment given the fact that Pederson's coaching the # 1 seed in the NFC.

In interviews, Nagy always comes across as confident despite his age. There's no sense that this will be ""too big"" of a job for him. However, he also displays some modesty and humility in that, suggesting that his ego won't get in the way of his leadership.

*his flaws*

It's fair to question Nagy's experience level and ""readiness"" for this post. He largely operated in Andy Reid's shadow, and that's a big shadow to hide in. Even as an offensive coordinator/playcaller, he only had 1 year of experience on the job. 

That makes him less experienced than Doug Pederson, particularly in terms of NFL experience. Pederson played in the NFL for 10 seasons. He coached in the NFL for 9 seasons. Collectively, that's 19 years of being in ""the League"" before he took the reins of his own team.

Conversely, Nagy's playing days kept him out of the NFL until 2009, at which point he became a ""coaching intern."" All told, that represents less than 10 years of experience working in NFL locker rooms and offices.

Nagy has also never been a head coach before, which is a different animal than being a coordinator. Pederson had *some* experience with that (as a high school coach, actually). Another good comp for Nagy would be former Arena League QB Jay Gruden. However, Gruden also came into his post with Washington armed with more experience -- he had been a multi-year offensive coordinator with Cincinnati, and before that worked as a player/head coach in the Arena League.

Effectively, Nagy has never worked with a defense or special teams before, which can yield questions about how well he's prepared to hand the entirety of this new job.

*overall*

Pardon me for some pride in this hire. Over a year ago (before his promotion to offensive coordinator), I posted a question asking [""Is Matt Nagy the next great NFL coach?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/5fc2en/is_matt_nagy_the_next_great_nfl_coach/?st=jccd2cri&amp;sh=2db84307)

In my mind, the answer to that would be ""yes."" In fact, my faith in Nagy has only grown from there as he's done great work with Alex Smith and this offense over the course of the season. As a result, I listed Nagy as my [# 1 candidate](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/7ku225/oc_20_viable_head_coaching_candidates_and_the_5/?st=jccd4nju&amp;sh=1e8a41b7) of this coaching cycle. Going a step further, I'd rank Matt Nagy as one of the better coaching candidates of the last several years. 

There's absolutely some risk here given his limited resume, but there's a ton of upside as well. Clearly, I'm labeling this a **grade: A**.

**Offensive Coordinator: Mark Helfrich, former head coach, Oregon**

There are coaching hires that come out of left field, and then coaching hires that feel like a fan jumped out of the bleachers.

Mark Helfrich has a strong resume (37-16 record at Oregon) but I simply didn't even consider that he'd be a candidate for an *NFL* job. In fact, I haven't heard Helfrich's name bandied about much in college jobs either.

There's a good reason for that. Helfrich had immediate success at Oregon (11-2, 13-2 to start) but saw the program slowly deteriorate from there, slumping to 4-8 before his eventual firing.

More than anything, Helfrich's career is a reminder of what I'd call a ""hangover effect"" of what happens when a great coach leaves his job. There's a strange lingering success for 1-2 years before the decline noticeably sets in. It's most common in the college ranks (due to recruiting) with Helfrich as a prime example, but it happens across other sports as well. Following Butch Davis at Miami (Fla.), Larry Coker went 12-0 and won the national title. Following Rick Pitino at Kentucky, Tubby Smith won the national championship in college basketball. Following Jimmy Johnson for the Cowboys, Barry Switzer won the Super Bowl (in year two.) 

That said, the record doesn't mean that Mark Helfrich is a bad coach. In fact, he may be better served as an assistant like he had been for Chip Kelly at college.

Still, call me skeptical for a few reasons. That same logic and transition didn't do wonders for Tampa Bay this season, as Dirk Koetter tapped his college buddy Todd Monken to come over from Southern Miss and serve as his OC. The Bucs' offense looked about the same, and even had a slight decline.

Furthermore, the hiring of Helfrich makes me wonder about Nagy's plan for Mitchell Trubisky moving forward. On the *Ringer*'s podcast, Mike Lombardi shrewdly pointed out that Andy Reid tailored his offense to fit Alex Smith's strengths, employing a lot of concepts from his Utah college offense.

You'd think, given that, that Nagy envisions a similar approach for Trubisky in Chicago. Hiring Helfrich only adds to that theory. Trubisky has his virtues as a QB: he's surprisingly athletic, and he's accurate when he knows where he's throwing. However, giving him a ""college offense"" may suggest that their braintrust doesn't have a lot of faith in Trubisky's ability to develop into a traditional ""pro style"" passer. There's not a lot of history of sustained success with that approach, so it's giving me slight pause moving forward. **grade: C**

**Defensive Coordinator: Vic Fangio, DC, Chicago**

The veteran Vic Fangio's universally regarded as a top 5 coordinator in the entire league. Given that, re-hiring him to help out his rookie head coach felt like an obvious move, although it took a little song and dance to get there.

And hey, I don't blame Nagy or Fangio for that delay. Re-hiring a popular coordinator isn't as much of a no-brainer as you'd expect. After all, if Nagy retained Vic Fangio, a lot of the players in the locker room would naturally be loyal to Fangio over him. Perhaps Nagy wouldn't be able to voice his opinions on the defense or have much influence over him. I'm not suggesting that Nagy would *want* to tinker around with Fangio's scheme or playcalling, but a head coach should have some freedom in that regard.

The partnership between a rookie head coach and a veteran coordinator will only work if there's mutual respect. Hopefully, after the re-recruitment of Fangio, the two established that. Because on paper, it's the perfect union and pairing. **grade: A**.

**Overall Grade**

Hopefully this didn't come across as too glowing or make me sound like a biased Bears fan. I'm not. In fact, I ranked the [Mitchell Trubisky pick as the worst of the first round](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/683tdt/forget_draft_grades_here_are_the_rankings_of_the/?st=jccdwzmj&amp;sh=7c7ec1d4) last year. I've always been skeptical that he has the natural instincts to be an above-average starter in the NFL.

But now, he'll get every opportunity to prove me wrong with a great offensive coach. The Mark Helfrich hire raises some eyebrows, but all in all, you don't worry about the ""OC"" to an offensive minded coach very much. The major pairing is the head coach + defensive coordinator, and in that regard, the Bears hit an absolute home run. **grade: A-**

7pzums,22,2018-01-12,A Day in the Life #7: Ted from Firsttown [Underage],Gorbag3,Fretton,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fretton/comments/7pzums/a_day_in_the_life_7_ted_from_firsttown_underage/,"*A Day in the Life is a series of short stories documenting a single day in the lives of people from all over Fretton. These people can be any race, class, age, or sex, hold any profession, be from anywhere in the country. This series is intended to help Frettonites gain a broader worldview on the way their fellow citizens live and survive.*

Ted Johnson awoke to the feeling of a hand massaging his cock. He opened his eyes and stared at his wife, Sandy, who had obviously just woken up as well. At 41, she was starting to enter middle age, and he could see a few wrinkles in her face, but she was still the most beautiful woman in Fretton to him. He leaned over lightly and kissed her. She returned, and wrapped her arms around him. The handjob continued, and Ted broke the kiss to see who was jacking him off. A curvy figure with long, wavy brown hair was sitting at the foot of the bed. His eldest daughter, Jennifer, smiled at him. He saw that her other hand was busy between his wife’s legs. 

“Good morning, sweetheart,” he said, still slightly groggy. “What’s this for?”

“Oh, nothing,” she replied, then leaned down to suck him off. He wasn’t sure he believed her, but decided that he might as well enjoy her ministrations. For an eighteen-year-old, she was a very skilled cocksucker, and it only took a few minutes for him to unload. She swallowed it all down without flinching, then waved goodbye. As she walked away, he saw her suck her mother’s juices off her other hand. 

Ted and Sandy kissed again, then rolled out of bed and made their way to the bathroom. They washed each other off in the shower, and played a little, though years of marriage had revealed shower sex to be less exciting than could be hoped for. Ted still made sure to get an eyeful every time he saw her naked, though – he loved her long, sandy hair, her big breasts, her wide hips, and everything about her. He dressed himself in typical office wear, slacks and a button-down with a tie, while his wife dressed in slightly more alluring attire. She wore very high heels and a black dress with a plunging neckline and a pencil skirt barely long enough to cover her ass. He often joked that she looked like she was going to the club instead of to work, but she said that it helped drive sales when the client wanted to fuck you. Ted combed his short black hair and left while Sandy was still working on her makeup. 

He smelled breakfast cooking in the kitchen and assumed that Jennifer was in there, then moved on to make sure the rest of his progeny were up and about. He knocked on his son Braden’s door, but the room was empty. Of course, nowadays Braden typically spent the nights in his sisters’ bedrooms, so that was no guarantee that he was awake. Sure enough, when he peeked into the next door over, he saw Braden curled around Lindsay. The two were very close in age, he now 16 and she 15, and they had been inseparable since childhood. He shook them both awake, leaning down to smooch Lindsay’s cheek, then left the room. He was about to knock on the last door, but it was already open, and Maddie, his youngest at 12, was wandering to the bathroom. She was wearing a cute baby blue nightshirt just short enough that he could still see her pussy. He leaned down for a quick kiss on the lips. 

“Morning, pumpkin,” he said. She mumbled something resembling “morning” in response and kept walking. Ted also turned around and made his way to the kitchen. There, he saw Jennifer chowing down on a pile of eggs, toast, and bacon. He honestly didn’t know how she maintained her figure, eating as much as she did. He could only guess that all the weight went to her tits, which were even bigger than her mother’s. She looked a lot like Sandy at that age, in fact, though her hair was more of a chocolate color. She had the same body and the same beautiful face that had all the boys at school lining up to fuck her. He sat down at the table and Johanna brought him a slice of toast and a cup of coffee. 

Johanna was the family’s yellow-ribbon slave. Ted had bought her ten years ago, when Lindsay had started school and Sandy had wanted to go back to work. They had thought that a sixteen-year-old could handle baby Maddie while the adults were away, and even at that age she was a sexy little thing. Now 26, Johanna had just gotten sexier. She was much thinner than Sandy or Jennifer, and had bigger tits than Lindsay or Maddie, and a bigger butt than any of them. She also had golden blonde hair and stunning blue eyes. She wasn’t nearly as beautiful as Sandy, of course, but Ted still loved to fuck her. Unlike many owners, the Johnsons let Johanna wear something besides her yellow collar, and today she was resplendent in a lacy red shelf bra and garter belt, which showed off her features without hiding anything. Ted slapped her on the ass as she left. “Morning, Johanna!”

“Good morning, Mr. Johnson,” she replied, going back to fry more bacon. Ted sipped his coffee and crunched his toast. 

“So, Dad,” said Jennifer, sliding towards him. She was wearing a green dress with a low, square neckline and a long skirt that went almost to her knees. She had spread her legs slightly, and he could see her lack of panties. *Here it comes,* he thought. 

“I was wondering if I could borrow the car tonight. Lacey’s hosting a party.”

“Who all is going to be there?”

“Just the usual crowd. Lacey, Marissa, Julio, Alexa, William, maybe Justin.”

“And do you know what will be going on? Any drugs?”

Jennifer shook her head. “From the sounds of it, it’s pretty much just going to be a regular high school orgy.” 

Ted considered. Jennifer and her friends were rather geeky, and were usually pretty conscientious. “Okay, but you have to be home by midnight.”

“Thanks, Dad!” she leaned over and hugged him. Ted squeezed a boob, then went back to his coffee. 

The rest of the family slowly trickled in. Sandy sat next to him, opting for only coffee. Maddie was the next to arrive, wearing her middle school uniform – Black shoes with thigh-high socks, a short blue skirt, a white shirt that reached halfway between her budding breasts and her belly button, and a blue tie that went down past the shirt. Maddie still had a rather girlish figure, as well as long, straight black hair and an impish yet adorable face. Braden came in next, wearing open-crotch jeans that revealed his hard-on and a camo t-shirt. He was rather stocky, and had short black hair and a tiny amount of facial hair that he though made him look mature. Lindsay followed shortly after, her sandy hair done up in pigtails, wearing only a pair of bright pink short shorts. Those quickly dropped to her ankles, and she climbed onto Braden’s lap and began rocking back and forth as Johanna brought them breakfast. 

“Hey, Johanna,” Ted called out. “Sandy got fingered a bit today, but hasn’t cum yet. Could you help out?” The slave girl quickly crawled under the table and started to eat her mistress out. Johanna was very good at her job, and by the time Ted finished his coffee Sandy was already cumming. 

“Thanks, Johanna. I need that,” she said as the blonde reemerged. Ted stood up, kissed his wife, and waved his kids goodbye, then walked to the car to start his day. He worked as a middle manager at an accounting firm, and his day usually consisted of going to pointless meetings, scheduling meetings that hopefully wouldn’t be pointless, trying to translate what upper management wanted into something actually possible, and getting chewed out when the accountants didn’t do it anyways, all in the name of pushing numbers around until they added up in a way that looked good. The only saving grace to the job was the absurd amount of money he made. Well, and his secretary. 

“Morning, Mr. Johnson,” she called out. 

“Morning, Rebecca. Anything come in that I need to hear about?”

Rebecca was a tall, willowy redhead with a friendly face and a killer ass. As per usual, she was wearing a smart, professional-looking black jacket and nothing else, allowing for easy access. 

“Yes sir, Mr. Smith has scheduled an urgent meeting this morning, which means that either the Glendale meeting or the Green meeting has to be moved to tomorrow.”

Ted groaned. “Send me the case files, and my new schedule.” 

He sat down at his desk and scrolled through endless emails, including the one from Richard Smith, a very important person in the company. He had not only a smoking hot secretary, but a college intern whose job description consisted entirely of fucking, sucking and otherwise pleasing Mr. Smith, so that he barely even fucked his secretary. 

Rebecca arrived with the case files. “Here you go, Mr. Johnson. You’ll probably want to decide before the meeting – the Glendale meeting was scheduled for eleven.” 

“Stick around, will you?” he asked. Having worked for him for several years, Rebecca hadn’t even turned around, and quickly dropped to her knees. She took out his cock and licked it, then began to suck it. As Ted examined the files, she bobbed her head up and down, sliding her lips over his sensitive member. 

Ted made a decision, then wheeled back his chair. He told Rebecca to lean over the desk, then lined up his dick with her pussy and started fuckin her from behind. He had an unobstructed view of her spectacular backside, which he spanked a couple of times as he thrust into her. However, he had an urgent meeting to get to, and blew his load far more quickly than he would have liked. 

Over the course of the day, Ted went to several pointless meetings, scheduled some meetings that hopefully wouldn’t be pointless, fucked Rebecca’s ass over her desk during lunch, tried to translate what upper management wanted into something actually possible, and got chewed out when the accountants didn’t do it anyways. His mood gradually improved over the course of the drive home, and he was positively cheerful when he walked through the door. 

Johanna looked up from a book she had been reading. “Hi, Mr. Johnson. Is there anything I can help you with?”

“No, thanks,” he replied. “I fucked my secretary twice, and got a blowjob from Jennifer in the morning.”

“Supper is in the oven – meatloaf and mashed potatoes,” she replied, and went back to her book. 

Ted looked in on Jennifer, who was playing a video game of some sort, then on Braden and Maddie, who were watching porn with their hands in each other’s pants. He then went to his bedroom to change. Through the doorway, he could see Sandy wiping cum off her face in the bathroom. They exchanged greetings and talked about their days as they both stripped. Sandy had closed three deals and made a very good start on two more. As proof of her ‘sex sells’ method, all three deals had been closed while a cock was inside her. Her description of the exact process ended with the two of them in bed, Ted with his face buried in her cunt and Sandy deepthroating his cock. 

Once the two of them calmed down a bit, they made their way out to the living room, Ted not bothering to put on clothes and Sandy only wearing a pair of sweatpants, and turned on the TV. Eventually, they settled on a show from the Outside called “A Game of Thrones”, which was rather prudish but had engaging characters and good production value. Ted could head Johanna puttering around in the kitchen. After a few minutes, the door opened and Lindsay arrived. She was no longer topless, and instead wore her cheerleading uniform – a red pleated skirt and a shiny red-and-blue crop top. The top really accentuated her small breasts, making them look bigger and rounder than they were. She waved hello, then went to her room. She emerged in the nude. 

“Jennifer and Braden and Maddie are all busy. What are you guys up to?” she asked. Ted invited her to join them, and she sat on his lap. The teen started rubbing her butt against his crotch, and soon his cock was twitching. She turned and smiled slyly at him, then half stood up and sat down again, this time impaling her butthole on his dick. Lindsay was an anal slut, and never missed a chance to get fucked up the butt, especially by her Daddy. Ted groped her perky tits as he pounded her cute little butt. They took it pretty slow, and were still building up tension when Johanna announced that dinner was ready. 

Deciding to end it quickly, Ted grabbed Lindsay’s waist and stood up. Now carrying Lindsay off the ground, he bounced her up and down on his cock. She wrapped her arms and legs around him and nuzzled her face into his shoulder as he slammed into her tight little pussy. Her hair was flying in front of his face, and he heard her making cute little squeaking moans. The moans increased in intensity until she cried out in orgasm. Ted allowed himself to climax as well, filling his daughter with his seed. 

He felt her shaking, so he carried her to the bathroom. They both cleaned up, then walked to the kitchen, where the rest of the family had just finished serving themselves. Johanna had a seat at the table and was included as part of the conversation. Lindsay, despite her excitement over fucking her parents, had started to show signs of being a surly teenager, and so was mostly quiet. Maddie was the most talkative, going on about her day at school, and especially about how her best friend Krystal had been gangbanged in Sex Ed. Jennifer wolfed down her meal, then ran off to get to the party. 

After dinner, Ted and Sandy were sitting in the living room, Johanna was doing the dishes, and Braden, Lindsay, and Maddie, were all on their phones. Ted stood up. “Who wants to play a board game?” Braden and Lindsay both expressed their disinterest, but Maddie and Sandy were up for it. They looked through their collection, and chose *Sex Empire*, a game in which the players compete to create the most successful brothel company. As they were setting up, Johanna asked if they wanted her to join, and they accepted her offer. 

Ted looked around at the other players. Sandy was topless, wearing only her sweatpants, so that her beautiful breasts were in full view. Johanna was still wearing her tantalizing lingerie set and her collar. Maddie had changed from her school uniform into yoga pants and a tube top that showed off her belly button. The game began slowly, with Sandy needing to be reminded of a few rules. Ted decided to go for an unusual strategy, focusing more on producing porn than on whoring out his workers. Sandy, as usual, wasn’t doing very well, and focused more on which card had the sexiest art than on what the cards actually did. Ted knew his only real competition would by Johanna. When she had been bought as a teenager, she had never played a board game, but in the years since had become quite the strategist. 

Ted’s strategy wasn’t working very well, and he could tell that he was falling behind Johanna. To his surprise, however, it was Maddie who was in the lead. She was still learning the basics of strategy, but was making an even weirder playstyle than his work, and work well. She had focused almost exclusively on black ribbon whores, which could make a lot of money but frequently had to be replaced. It looked like Maddie was about to win, but at the last minute Johanna revealed some hidden resources and flooded the market on both black ribbons and porn, just barely squeezing past Ted and Maddie. 

They all applauded the slave girl’s ingenuity. Sandy offered her a reward, and got down on her hands and knees to start eating her out. It was an erotic sight, and Ted started to jack off. Then, he felt a tiny hand on his dick. He looked to the side and saw Maddie reaching over to him. He relaxed as the preteen gave him a handjob. Maddie was skilled with her hands, and he was watching two very sexy women, so Ted was feeling very turned on. 

Maddie paused the handjob. “Daddy, can we fuck? Please?”

“Sure thing, pumpkin,” he replied. She pulled down her yoga pants and kicked them off while Ted lay on his back. He glanced at Sandy, who he saw was looking at him and smiling. Maddie climbed onto him and started to lower herself onto his dick. Her cunt was incredibly tight, and it took a while for her to get all the way down his dick. Once she did, she rode him cowgirl-style while he thrust up and down. She moaned, then leaned down to kiss him. They kissed long and hard, then she arched her back towards the sky again. Her pussy felt incredible, and he felt himself about to cum. He told Maddie this. 

“No, Daddy, wait…. OH! Wait just a little… uhn… bit longer….”

He managed to hold himself in until he felt her pussy contract in an orgasm. She cried out, and he thrust one last time as he came inside her. Once her climax ended, she leaned down and kissed him again. 

“Thanks, Daddy.” 

She was obviously fading fast, and he got up and carried her to bed. When he returned, he found his wife and his slave still going at it like rabbits. Sandy was fingering herself while flicking her tongue all across Johanna’s clit and cunt, and Johanna was moaning and pinching her nipples. Ted was still hard, somehow, and slid his dick into his wife’s pussy. She cried out and started thrusting back against him, so that he hardly had to move to fuck her. 

After a few minutes, Johanna called out, “Please, Master, let me taste that cock. I want to taste her pussy juice!” Ted pulled out of Sandy and walked around to Johanna, who latched onto his cock and started sucking like crazy. After a few seconds, she gasped for air, but Ted grabbed her blonde hair and started facefucking her. He loved the choking, gagging sounds she made, but from the way her hands and legs were moving she was obviously about to cum, and he wanted to hear her, so he pulled out. 

“Lie down,” he told her, then he straddled her belly. He grabbed her breasts and pushed them together, then started titfucking her. His cock, already slick with her saliva, slid right through, and it felt and looked incredible. 

Johanna was something of a screamer, and her cries of pleasure got louder and louder. “Oh… ohhh… Oh, yes…. Oh, yes! Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! OHHH! Oh, yes! OH, FUCK, I’M CUMMING! I’M CUMMING! OHHH!” He felt her thrashing beneath him as he kept fucking her beautiful tits. Another pair of tits appeared in his vision. 

“It’s time to repay the favor,” said Sandy, and she sat down on Johanna’s face. Ted leaned forwards and sucked one of his wife’s breasts. Sandy was already pretty worked up, and it wasn’t long before she was climaxing herself. The sight sent Ted into orgasm, and he came all over Johanna’s face and Sandy’s tits and belly. 

The three collapsed into a sweaty pile. It was several minutes before they got up. 

“That was great, Johanna,” said Ted. “Oh, and congrats on the win. Could you clean up the game? I’m exhausted, and from the looks of it so is Sandy.”

Johanna looked exhausted too, but she nodded. “Of course, Mr. Johnson. Just one second.”

As the adults slowly recuperated, the door opened and Jennifer walked in. She was carrying her dress in her hand and was covered in cum. She smirked a little at the pile of bodies on the floor. 

“Enjoy yourselves while I was gone?”

“Oh, yes,” said Ted. “How did the party go? It looks like you had fun, too.”

Her eyes lit up. “Oh, it was lots of fun! We started out just playing games online, though we only had five controllers so we rotated who played. The two who were out gave oral to the players. Then the pizza guy arrived – he was super hot by the way, like seven feet tall and with this massive black cock that felt *so good* – and after dinner we just all fucked. It got a little crazy at the end – the girls were being passed around like sex toys, and Marissa actually passed out while fucking William. I think he took her back to his place, she was still out of it when they left. Anyways, I have about a dozen loads of cum in me and I came like twenty times, so I’m gonna take a shower and hit the sack.”

Sandy smiled. “Sounds like fun, dear.” She gave Jennifer a kiss good night as her daughter walked by. 

Ted and Sandy made their way slowly back to their room. As they passed Lindsay’s room, they heard her and Braden having sex. 

“I’m a little worried about them,” said Sandy. “They fuck each other more than they fuck everyone else combined. I don’t think it’s healthy.”

“I’m sure it’s just a phase,” Ted said soothingly. “But I’ll try and fuck Lindsay more often, and you fuck Braden. That might help them remember that there are other people with dicks and pussies.”

They collapsed onto bed, and talked over the events of the day. “I did notice Maddie asking you for sex back there,” said Sandy. “That’s good.” Ted grunted agreement. 

They were somewhat old-fashioned, in that they held to the belief that parents shouldn’t fuck their children until puberty, and not until their child specifically asked for sex. That had worked well for their first three, but Maddie was something of a late bloomer, and had only lost her virginity a couple of months ago. They were both glad to see her slutting it up a bit more lately. 

After a few minutes, Ted rolled over and got on top of Sandy. They were having sex again, but this was a much more gentle lovemaking, slow and tender. It was a nightly ritual for them to do it this way, in the dark, in missionary position. Their friends thought they were weird, but they thought it brought them closer together. It took several long minutes, but they both came together, then fell into a deep sleep. "
7pzz8u,3,2018-01-12,How to gain it when taking Vyvance?,SomeBuggyCode,gainit,https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/7pzz8u/how_to_gain_it_when_taking_vyvance/,"Hi all,

I'm sure you've seen this post before but I've been having a really difficult time with this. My problem is that up until 'this' point I generally can scape by with only eating less than 1000 calories/day unless I feel hungry (while not taking Vyvance) because I never work out.

I really want to try and get better at eating more, close to 3000 calories because at my weight of 138 I should be able to, but Vyvance (if you don't know) just kills your appetite and makes it uncomfortable to eat much. I know that using marijuana is an option to stimulate appetite but I don't really enjoy the psychoactive properties too much because that makes it hard to not just zone out and 'chill'. 

Another thing I struggle with is being proactive in the sense of meals. My life is always busy and I'm stressed about having to find Internships or other circumstances that come into play. Because of these factors and for example today, I wake up and immediately go to my computer to apply for positions and I end up stressing and not taking good care of myself. (no breakfast) I drink some water throughout the day and snack but that's it. 

I know /r/gainit isn't a lifestyle subreddit but I hope that I can somehow get some order into my eating and more.

Thanks"
7pzzlo,382,2018-01-12,"Alabama 4* and 5* Recruits and Usage in the Saban Era or ""Does he stash 'em?""",choicemeats,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/7pzzlo/alabama_4_and_5_recruits_and_usage_in_the_saban/,"I hear a lot of talk on here about how Alabama is stashing 4* and 5* croots, and they just wait in the wings until the playing guys get done playing. So I decided to do some investigating on the usage of Alabama 4* and 5* croots during the Saban era. These are only guys that have ENROLLED at Bama, so hopefully I didn't dun goof and list a guy that was recruited and never went for a minute. All this info is from Scout. 

I'll leave my observations up top, but first some notes:

- these may be some incomplete lists and stats. I'm not an Alabama fan and I may be getting some things wrong as far as missing names, or rankings.

- FRP = final resting place. I didn't bother looking into personal lives for many of them that didn't go on to the NFL, so this was just football career related. In one case one player returned to Alabama, and in two they actually died.

- SMASH - a non stat for OL since they don't record anything for them. They just smash the dudes in front of them.


Observations:

- Looking at the raw numbers alone it totally looks like Bama is stashing. These are the 4* and 5* recruits *alone* and you can see Saban went to work right away and started grabbing guys in 2008. 

- There's actually a higher percentage of transfers than I thought. I can't differentiate between guys that were asks to gray or blue shirt which obviously delays what they can offer the team, but a number of the guys did transfer. I believe the  number is 23. 

- A lot of guys elected to stick around for four years. That's a lot of experience returning, especially on the offensive line, where guys were 21, 22 years old, or sometimes older if they took a RS. Just having that physical advantage of a couple of years makes a difference in the trenches. 

- A lot of guys elected to stick around for four years and do nothing. I'm sure some careers were derailed to injury, or other reasons, but a few stat lines were pretty poor. Maybe the site I checked was incomplete (Sports Reference...in one case the same player had two different stat pages) or they just left the team.

- Particularly noticeable this year and last, Saban used a lot of freshmen, suggesting he uses them a lot. Many skill guys have 3-4 year stat records available. He doesn't hold back from using impact guys early in their careers which I'm certain many coaches avoid, preferring to go with experience. IMO sometimes impact trumps that, let the kids compete in practice. But the kids are ready *early*, at the very least physically but due to THE PROCESS they are mentally prepared as well.

- On the whole there are just a lot of recruits, but obviously this isn't enough to make a two deep. Saban has been particularly good at finding and developing that fringe 3* talent and lower. I'm not sure how many of the busts may have gotten the Bama bump in the rankings but it doesn't seem like he's hitting or missing any more than another school, but the volume makes up for percentage perhaps.

- A bunch of transfers went on to have decent careers at other schools. Alvin Kamara is probably the biggest name that went elsewhere and now has na NFL career.

7q02ev,2,2018-01-12,I [27M] just got over some major life setbacks but am fighting feelings of being behind.,IneptPlace,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7q02ev/i_27m_just_got_over_some_major_life_setbacks_but/,"I won't go into details other than that I had a major life setback when I was 20, enough to warrant a therapist, ruin my GPA and go back home. Anyways I slowly got my shit together, went to community college, transferred to a 4 year, held a leadership role at school, obtained a couple internships, and graduated with a good GPA in an engineering field.  

It took me a while but 7 months after graduation I finally got an offer that while it doesn’t pay well, it is a at a good company, in a great city, with plenty of room for growth. People recommended me to not take it and one person even said that I will barely afford being able to live in said city or that I will not be able to date. 
I have a plan that when I move I will start building roots, making friends, getting into hobbies, getting in touch with major companies, dive into online dating, etc. Once I get a raise or better job then getting my own apartment, as opposed to a room, and buying some new clothes.  

While I am confident that I can really get the life I want, I can’t help shake the feelings that I am behind everyone else professionally and socially, especially now that I am in my late 20s. I focused so much on fixing my mental health, social hang ups and getting back on track that I didn’t have much time or opportunity to date or build a large social circle. I only had a couple short-term relationships and a few hookups. On the other hand, I see a lot of people in my age group getting solidified in their careers, engaged/married, having kids, etc. 

On this sub every time there is an age gap relationship people bring up life stages and how a late 20/early 30 something should already be established. One such thread a late 20 something was dating an 18 year old and the most upvoted comments were that she is going to surpass him in maturity since “people stop developing/growing at 25.” I always thought people can change at any time but much like you can't get taller after a certain age, it is harder to grow mentally after a certain age.

While Everyone says, ""everyone goes at their own pace"" or ""life is not a race” I can’t get over this feeling that there are certain “deadlines” for most life experiences or milestones and that by the time I am ready the ship will have sailed. Like the stigma of “creepy old people” hanging out with younger crowds or how much harder it is to find a quality marriage partner when you are in your 30s as opposed to your 20s. 

---   
  **tl;dr**: I got over some life setbacks but can't help get over being severely behind, never being able to catch up or the fear of missing out even more.

&gt; Appcoins
&gt; Today, Appcoins was listed on coinmarketcap- debuting at around 110 in terms of market cap. So what is Appcoins? (Note: I am not an investor in Appcoins and this is not investment advice)
&gt; FROM THE APPCOIN TEAM 
&gt; “Aptoide has come a long way. Founded in 2011, Aptoide is the first social Android App Store. From a summer internship project to over 200 million users, 4 Billion downloads and 1 Million Apps, Aptoide has been able to pin point what can be done to improve the App Economy. Enter AppCoins.
&gt; AppCoins is a protocol for the App Economy created by the Aptoide App Store, and the first ICO serving 200 million users with the goal of creating a trustworthy economy without intermediaries.”
&gt; The current app economy has three main inefficiencies which are:
&gt; •	Lack of transparency or trust
&gt; •	Advertising inefficiency
&gt; •	Costly and inaccessible in-app purchases
&gt; AppCoins is the solution. It is an open and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain, using the ERC20 standard.
&gt; It proposes to move the following three critical flows to the blockchain:
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; •	Advertising: A standard for developers to advertise their app or game in the app store, paying AppCoins to the user for 2 minutes of attention. Blockchain provides proof-of-attention and guarantees against repudiation, double attribution, and fake identity.
&gt; •	In-App billing: A solution for the purchase and billing of digital items using AppCoins inside games and apps. The developer simply needs to integrate it once and it works across all app stores. Users have an easy way to pay for items with AppCoins bought with fiat currency or previously earned through advertising.
&gt; •	App approvals: A new trust model where developers are ranked as “Trusted”, “Unknown” or “Critical” according to their track record of transactions in the blockchain.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; AppCoin (APPC) is a cryptocurrency that will allow for transactions to be made within the app stores by users, developers and manufacturers.
&gt; 
&gt; Pros of Appcoins
&gt; -	Allows rewards to users for in-app purchases and attention
&gt; -	Launched by apptoide team, which is well known and has great reputation
&gt; -	App store market place
&gt; -	Simplifies in app purchases
&gt; -	Open source codes
&gt; Cons of Appcoins
&gt; -	Competition to android and google play
&gt; -	Complex project, not good for amateur investors
&gt; -	Not on many exchanges
&gt; -	Large supply
&gt; Team:
&gt; CEO: Paulo Trezentos: CEO of Aptoide

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
Alright, well let’s jump in! First up:

**Q** *Please give us details of the marketing strategy for 2018. This will help the community give ideas you may not have thought of!* 

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
Awesome. Well, I actually saw this one coming.

Thanks for the question! I'm sure this is one that's top of mind for our entire community. Our marketing strategy for 2018 is a combination of:

-**Increasing our social media and community presence.** We’ve actively been sharing much more content, running paid ads (which we’re current A/B testing several campaign sets on Facebook) to drive traffic to our Facebook, Telegram, and the TLC product. We’re shifting focus away from Slack (including making all the necessary adjustments to our pages) to double-down on Telegram as our main communication channel while we’re updating the Reddit. One of our biggest issues is our bifurcated community, as those interested in WeTrust aren’t sure if the (closed) Slack, Telegram, one of the “Unofficial” pages that have popped up, Reddit, Twitter, etc. are where they should be engaging with us. As we scale certain channels up, like Telegram, we’re confident that this will help solve that issue. Expect more AMAs (including in major crypto communities) coming your way as well, with many being hosted as livestreamed video. We’ll also be moving forward with a referral program and giveaways (including Airdrops) to incentivize community members to share about WeTrust/TLC so we can expand our reach and gain valuable feedback.

Community is honestly the lifeblood of any blockchain company. We wouldn’t able to do this without the support of you all, so please know that everyone here at WeTrust truly values the fact that you’re even taking time out of your day to read through this today. While we can’t RT all of your posts or share every meme (especially if they pertain to coin value), you can be confident that we’re all seeing them and it’s helping fuel our growth.

-**Press.** We’ve been leveraging our connections at major national publications, networks, and influencer groups to ensure more regular media exposure is coming our way. We don’t want to list any features before they’ve officially been released, but we’ve already given interviews to one top publication in fintech and have a few more in the works. Even smaller mentions, like the [CoinTelegraph hit from yesterday](https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-blockchain-is-banking-the-unbanked) and [this one from today](https://speakwithageek.com/media/fintech/34322-cryptocurrency-companies-on-the-rise) that lists us alongside Coinbase and Ripple as the three rising blockchain fintech companies, are extremely helpful as they’re reaching those already active in the blockchain/crypto space. In that same vein, the AMAs we’re doing in active crypto communities on FB and Reddit are going to be a huge focus for us, so if you have any connections in these communities, please let us know on Telegram.

-**Branding overhaul**. A new Styling &amp; Branding Guide is nearly complete- and those revised branding elements (not just designs, but copy as well) will be applied to all of our social channels, sites, swag (yes, that’ll mean community swag giveaways, WeTrust shirts for those heavily engaged) , and more to ensure we’re conveying a more professional, established image.

-**Events.** We have several conferences that we’ll be attending in the coming months and for a few of them, we have arranged to be giving talks and/or maintaining a demo booth. We’ll also be hosting smaller events for influencers in San Francisco and have been approved to run our first within the next two weeks at The Node, SF’s private crypto club. We already have a few other local partners in the blockchain space that are eager to partner up for these more intimate events (at The Node, their HQs, WeWork, and with student groups like Blockchain at Berkeley). Given our close proximity to Stanford, we’re exploring sponsoring hackathons, lunch and learn sessions, and research projects with the Stanford GSB.

-**Leveraging our advisors.** Working closely with our advisors to leverage their connections/networks (for marketing, partnerships, etc.). For example, we’ll be back at the office on Saturday morning to sit down with [Michael Casey](http://www.michaeljcasey.com/) (MIT Media Lab, CoinDesk) and go over our plan for 2018.

-**Partnerships.** Arguably the strongest marketing lift we’re going to see will come from partnerships, especially if those partners have large networks and are willing to help drive traffic our way (we hope to share some exciting developments soon). We’ve been in conversation with multiple other blockchain companies looking to build products on the WeTrust platform or integrate other aspects of our technology, marketing partners (often those also focused on social good) looking to run reciprocal campaigns, and global partners who can increase visibility for us in other ways through their addition of WeTrust/our tech onto their platforms.

It’s always been our primary mission to have our products serve the needs of the unbanked, underbanked, and those facing issues that make traditional financial services offerings a poor option. We’ve made inroads with several of these communities who we feel will be able to receive the most potential value from our product(s)- affording us feedback to better refine these product according to their specific needs while helping serve as case studies as we begin to expand to other groups.

-**Strategic hires.** Several PR teams are currently being evaluated and we’ll be onboarding interns from top local Universities to secure more bandwidth for our department leads and CoFounders.

-**Having a plan.** Since joining, I’ve drafted up a full action plan with clear milestones/defined goals. We’ve outlined how/where other teams members can be leveraged to assist with marketing, crafted posting/content schedules, identified the strengths and weaknesses in our marketing efforts to date, are actively giving structure and direction to our community and team of moderators, and have taken steps to maximize reach whenever one of our marketing initiatives is successful.

2017 was our year to build the team, products, processes, and structure of WeTrust. 2018 is our chance to step a bit outside of our comfort zone, making marketing, growth, and product adoption our top areas of focus. Please feel free to ping me on Telegram if you have any questions.

Phew, my fingers are killing me, that was a lot to type.

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust** and so fast, too!

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust** 
In all seriousness, we understand and acknowledge that the community has been very interested in our marketing efforts so feel that an in-depth answer was warranted here.

**Q** *Many people assume TRST will be used ONLY in our products via upgrades in a “freemium” model. True/false? Early convos hinted other paths too. Elaborate please.*

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust**
We’re still weighing different options as to how TRST will be used. We’ve got some expertise on the team regarding freemium modeling, and we’re currently working through ways to apply that in a way that’s fair and provides the most utility for our users. We’re also committed to integrating our token into Trusted Lending Circles. Regarding the ‘other paths’ question, we’re also looking at ways to share our SmartContract tech with other blockchain companies, and we’ll share the results of those efforts as soon as we can.

---

**Q** *Any info on TRST fetting on new exchanges like kucoin, Bit-Z, or or others?*

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust** As we’ve said before in our other channels, we really can’t comment on exchanges or token price. We’ve heard the community’s feedback on this loud and clear.

---


**Q** *Will there be any noticeable changes on the TLC mainnet launched as compared to the current beta?*

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust**
Yes! You’ll see a ton more improvements in usability and user interfaces. The team’s been polishing the dApp tirelessly over the past few weeks, and our testing sessions have been going well. On the whole, it’ll look similar to the current iteration on beta, but with a tighter look and hard-tested backend. We’re also not stopping development once we release on mainnet - the team’s got a number of features we want to include going forward, and we’re also prepping to respond to user feedback and needs once we see real-world usage.

On that note (and not trying to bury the lede here), I did want to update with an *important message*: we’ve been working hard and sticking to our roadmap, and we’re still targeting January 18th as the day when we release Trusted Lending Circles on the Main Ethereum Network. That said, we want to ensure the best, most stable dApp when we do, and we’ve encountered a couple unexpected snags during our ramp-up to launch. It’s possible we may slip a bit past the 18th, but we’re still targeting this month (January) for release. Just want to be upfront with the community about our development timeline. The team’s been working incredibly hard over the past few weeks, and we’re really happy to see the finish line not too far ahead of us (at least, for this sprint!)

---

**Q** *Please give us more details about the second product after the ROSCA. If you can.*

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust** We’re currently working through options at the moment, so it’s still a little early to share what we’re thinking in detail. Abstracted, it’ll be a way for users to create their own savings contracts on blockchain with payout rules established at the point of deployment - including timing and distribution, and payout triggers. As we move from a one-dApp team to one working on two (one live, one in development), we’re going to have to be adaptable as well and respond to user needs and markets - Justin, our VP of Engineering, has set the engineering team up well for success in this regard. 

It’s our continuing goal to provide useful products that empower people financially - the second product is based around the notion of parties accumulating savings over time (as opposed to our first product, which is more group-lending-based). Definitely going to go into more detail about this with the community when we’re ready to share.

---


**Q** *We all want WeTrust to thrive and take off. What can we do in our everyday to help? I.e., any marketing actions we each can take?*

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust** 
Another one for me, eh?

1. Promoting WeTrust’s Telegram, Twitter, and Facebook channels. These are our big three and any lift helps.

2. Do you run or are you a part of any crypto/blockchain discussion groups? How about press/media connections? It’s press hits and exposure like this that’s really going to move the marketing needle for us, if you’re able to facilitate an intro.

3. Drive users and provide feedback around the TLC product. If you’re connected to the unbanked/underbanked or communities that have been treated unfairly by banks, we want to speak with you. Even if you’re not, testing/evangelizing the TLC within the blockchain community is invaluable for us.

4. Participating in AMAs like this. Let us know what you feel is/isn’t working and the feedback others give you when you’re discussing WeTrust.

5. Introducing us to any other potential partners (technology, marketing, or otherwise) in the space. This industry is still very much in it’s infancy, so establishing close relationships could carry us far.

---


**Q** *When will an updated roadmap be posted for this year?*

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust**
I kind of spoke to this in the question about the second product, but to elaborate - we’re still solidifying our updated roadmap for 2018. The TLC launch and conceptualization and refinement of our second product has taken up most of the team’s resources in the last few weeks (in addition to some well-deserved time off!), so we’ll aim to release something more concrete as soon as we’re confident we’ll be able to execute on that vision as a company.

---

**Q** *When do you “ramp up” marketing again?*

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
We’ve actually already started. See the above answer for a more comprehensive breakdown- but Twitter and Telegram have added hundreds of new members/followers, we’ve had multiple new press hits/interviews released, had about a dozen new partnership calls and meetings, driven tons of internal discussion/planning around marketing, have participated in multiple local events/meetups, and there’s a ton more on the way.

---

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust** How about a fun one?

**Q** *What do you guys do when you get of from work? :)*

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust** Hmm...well we’re never truly “off work” unless we’re sleeping, as Slack/Email keeps us looped in and accessible. I’m typically pretty wiped out after my drive back to SF from Mountain View so often I’ll be relaxing in front of Netflix or some crappy reality TV with some wine and my two cats.

My wife and I have a lot of friends in SF’s music scene (electronic primarily but also jazz, punk/metal, etc.) so we tend to frequent a lot of local shows and festivals- including Burning Man, Movement, and Day for Night. Outside of that, we’re huge into craft beer/spirits and love doing tasting events. When my wife’s gone, I’ll probably be gaming :).

Tom will have to chime in with his answer.

**TomD.WeTrust** 
I’m…kind of in the same boat. Like Jake, I live in SF and enjoy some downtime (my wife and I are currently on our 47th rewatch of ‘The Office’ tv series), but on the weekends, we go hiking and take road trips to the mountains or beach in the summer.

**Jøren**
Thanks for responding to my more personal question:)

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
Sure thing @Jøren

**TomD.WeTrust**
we’re real people! isn’t that right, FELLOW HUMAN? :robot_face:

**Jøren**
Except for cow :D

**CowMooFlage**
MOOOOOO?

**Q** *Is there/are there possible announcements regarding partnerships with major companies/countries during the release of ROSCA/TLC on Jan 18?*

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust** Companies yes, countries no (but we have made some valuable new contacts this week that may change that).

---

**Q** *Any thoughts on WeTrust attending EDCON 2018? Great lineup of speakers here*

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
Thanks for sharing this! We love Toronto and Vitalik will be there, so it’s definitely on our radar.

---

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust** One final quick one here!

**Q** *When will you release partnership details?*

&amp;nbsp;

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
The second we can. Jumping the gun to discuss partnerships before both parties are ready to disperse the official announcement is never a good look.

---

**CowMooFlage** Before you go, do you mind taking a question from a Telegram user, **Crypto Bear**?

**Q** *Are you guys planning for any traditional lending services in future? Anywhere in your road map?*

&amp;nbsp;

**TomD.WeTrust**
Sure, @cowmooflage - I’m a little unclear on the question. If Crypto Bear is referring to traditional lending as in the role that today’s banks play, then no - we want to build products that enable people to take charge own their own finances and boost their financial standing

We’re all about financial empowerment through technology :).

**CowMooFlage**
I think that's indeed the direction he wanted to take.

---

**TomD.WeTrust**
Ok! well…thanks again for all your questions. It’s been a pleasure, again. And, on a personal note, it’s nice to have @kuczeruk to answer all the questions about marketing that have been coming up in recent weeks - we’re grateful to have him on board!

**CowMooFlage**
Thanks @tomd @kuczeruk for your time!

Next one to be held in Telegram?

**Kuczeruk.WeTrust**
Hmm we’ll think more on Telegram but honestly hosting it on Reddit may make more sense. The threading is helpful for clarity’s sake. Perhaps we can set it so only mods can reply on telegram during a set period to ensure that during that time it doesn’t get too flooded. Sli.do has been working well, which we’ll continue to post across all channels to solicit questions.

Until the next AMA!"
7q0he0,2,2018-01-12,Off topic: Does anyone have any tips for summer schools/courses in computer science for this summer? Or something that can develop my skills?,Nautman,cs50,https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/7q0he0/off_topic_does_anyone_have_any_tips_for_summer/,"Hi, first off, I'm sorry if this is off topic, but I figured since other people here are or have been in the same situation, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations. I'm sorry if my post isn't allowed and has caused any inconvenience. **I don't intend my post to be completely about me but rather a discussion for people in my situation who want to develop their programming skills.**

I'm very interested in doing three things this summer.

1. Developing my programming skills.
2. Getting a taste of the American college life. (Or maybe Britain's?)
3. Having fun.

I thought this would be possible by either doing a summer session somewhere, or doing an internship. (Does anyone have any other suggestions?)

I was interested in Harvard's summer courses. [These are the courses for the 3-week session.](http://www.summer.harvard.edu/high-school-programs/pre-college-program/courses-sessions)

1. Introduction to Computer Programming
2. Introduction to Web Programming
3. Data Science with Python

But I'm not sure they would fit my case, since they might be stuff that I have already done. CS50 as well as some stuff in node.js. Has anyone taken these and know if they're helpful?

Harvard also has a 7-week session but that might be too long for me.

[Yale also has a summer session](https://summer.yale.edu/) that I thought could be interesting. Does anyone know anything about it?

I very much appreciate any suggestions, tips or insights into what I can do to improve my knowledge in computer science this summer. Thank you."
7q0mf1,1,2018-01-12,30M seriously considering,Ace1887,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/7q0mf1/30m_seriously_considering/,"Hi everyone,

So this i guess is a little but if a rant. Maybe I am looking for some insight I honestly have no idea. 

I met my wife in college when I was 19 we graduated. I went to Work she did her internship then got a job. We moved in together. At the time she had a better job than me and was paying the bills. Since then I have gotten a better job which I have been at for 6 years and cover the majority of the bills. 

We got married when I was 23 it was a two year engagement filled with plenty of fights and I can’t help but think I should have gotten out then. 

We own a house together which I provided the entire down payment for as well as cover 70% of the mortgage each month. 
Over time my wife ha begun to feel like s room mate and she has even expressed this herself. We talk about it both say will will change and work on it but then it goes back to the same thing over again.

We are very different people opposites attract and all. But the problem now stems to be there is really no activity we really enjoy doing together. I like to game she hates it won’t even try. Any time we do do stuff it’s of her choosing and on top of it all she is a horrendous nag. 

Our sex life is nonexistent. She is not an overly sexual person doesn’t express herself and her wants but we haven’t had sex in 8 months. 

I feel emotionally checked out. I am unhappy and I don’t think she is very happy. Aside from the house we are separate with money. One joint account and that’s it but we also have separate accounts and retirements. 

I feel if I was too ask it would be amicable I don’t think she would go after me and want to get lawyers involved. Honestly my biggest concern is keeping the dog. I work from home and can provide him a better home. The tricky thing is the house. I can afford it in my own but she most definitely can’t. We are in Ma and I am not all read up on the laws. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. "
7q0zch,3,2018-01-12,my assessment of the Liberalist Principles,jamoecw,Liberalist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberalist/comments/7q0zch/my_assessment_of_the_liberalist_principles/,"A. Individual Rights:
1 ""All political rights must be universally shared by all adult citizens."" - basic principle of modern western democracies, unfortunately needs to be stated in this day and age. what constitutes political may be an issue in the future however.
2 ""The only method by which to secure universal rights is through individual rights enforced by a state that is accountable to the people."" - same as above (though without the possible issue of the word political, instead the word state may be an issue in the future as it has in the past).
3 ""Groups may not have rights that supersede the right of the individual."" - this most certainly will get tricky. what is meant by groups, what is meant by supersede? it seems pretty obvious to those that share a modern individual mindset, but the reason of the movement is due to that shrinking. does it mean that no one can arrest anyone else? (cops arresting people fleeing a scene of a crime?) if an exception is made for them it could very well mean that an exception could be made to intern all people of a group, or even kill them 'for the greater good' or perhaps forced (or even heavily encouraged) annihilation of a group. the overall sentiment of the statement is just fine, though it will need plenty of clarification and well defined exceptions or it could derail the whole idea of this section.

4 ""Each person’s rights must remain sacrosanct."" - sacrosanct is imprecise, and not a useful term. i get the idea, but overall this statement needs to change to a more grounded one.
5 ""This is the primary protection all people in society must enjoy to ensure justice and there can be no extra-legal justification to violate an individual’s rights."" - in a political sense this statement is useless. anything codified into law is legal justification, and thus the law has no extra-legal anything. on a societal level it is essentially the supremacy of the law in issues of individual rights, which like most of this section basic to modern western democracies (and unfortunately needs to be stated). a good issue to look at is the gay wedding cake issue: a small business was tasked with making a wedding cake for a gay couple getting married. the people in the business did not want to promote gay marriage, and so agreed to sell a wedding cake, but not one with the specific decorations for the couple. either the right of the individuals in the business are protected to not promote something they disagree with, or couple's rights of getting a specific service offered to others are protected. it becomes an issue of compelled speech versus discrimination (not just discrimination like the media likes to portray it).

6 ""All rights that can be applied to a citizen must be applied to every citizen, regardless of whether that right is applicable or not."" - sounds pretty bullshit until you think about it, then it makes sense.
7 ""Rights that have no application to some people presently may be necessary in the future."" - exactly.

B. Democracy:
1 ""All legal adults must be franchised with the right to have a direct method of exerting influence over their government."" - basic principle of modern western democracy, though unfortunately needs to be stated.
2 ""This is usually a representative democracy with the state as the servant of the people, dedicated to protecting their property rights and interfering with their lives as little as possible."" - this is actually something that has slid quite a bit, maybe for good or ill, i am not sure. needless to say this point needs some debate as i can see two sides to the 'as little as possible' phrase and the philosophical ramifications of such. i am actually in favor of this though, but i might be wrong about it.

C. Economic Freedom:
1 ""Property rights begin with personal self-ownership and extend to any property an individual has legally acquired."" - basic principle of modern western democracy, though unfortunately needs to be stated. one thing that helps to deal with conflicts (they do arise, as it can be possible for 2 or more people to legally acquire the same thing) is chain of ownership. if at some point acquisition occurs illegally then all future acquisitions are then illegal. this has exceptions to it as well, as all sorts of issues have come up in the past.
2 ""The individual must be, as much as possible, in control of their own economic destiny."" - how much is possible, and what does that entail? this is a pretty big question and forms a large part of disagreement in modern western democracies, so it needs to be fleshed out.
3 ""This includes the right to own property, engage in trade, to sell one’s own labour or to engage in collective economic activities."" - but is not limited to? same as above, to what extent? needs to be fleshed out.

D. Freedom of speech:
1 ""All people should enjoy the right to voice political ideas, no matter how controversial, without suffering political consequences."" - basic principle of modern western democracy, however the issue is that the question arises as to what separates a political idea from others? in america we felt it was any idea that was not a direct call to action that provided a clear and immanent danger. over time this has eroded to the point in which someone was arrested for berating a cop over political differences. the enforcement of non-political speech even to this day is grounds for infringement of other rights, which then have to go to court and hope that the judge recognizes the long term consequences of the infringement and thus strikes down the law. the narrowing of free speech to political speech is the basis for hate speech laws in Europe currently and preventing the political speech of those no in power. it is probably the american in me, but political speech can only be protected if all speech is protected for everyone. any infringement needs to be carefully worded and defined, and it needs to be as little as possible.
2 ""This can include financial penalties, legal exclusion from the political system, incarceration or any other form of punishment for expressing a point of view."" - what about reporting on things that are happening? limiting it to a 'point of view' i think is too narrow, again probably the american in me.

3 ""No political idea can ever be considered as incitement, abuse or harassment in and of itself."" - the use of the word political has problems, take punching a Nazi for instance. while any person subscribing to true liberal ideology would know that such is wrong, it is a politically rooted idea. this lets it be considered an idea that incites people to violent action, but due to its political nature may be consider protected.
4 ""Freedom of speech is a guarantee of dissent in times of necessity against any prevailing authoritarian political orthodoxy that would otherwise refuse to be challenged."" - too strict of terms. one should be able to dissent against any authority, authoritarian or not, political or not, orthodoxy or not. grammar indicates that the 'prevailing authoritarian political orthodoxy' is the one refusing to be challenged and needs to be protected against, but what about those preventing challenge on behalf of such a group? the sentence sounds good but is too narrow to be meaningful.

5 ""No speech should be compelled."" - once was a basic principle of modern western democracy, is currently being dissolved. definitely needs to be stated.


taking more time than i originally thought, i'll come back to this and finish up in the same manner i started.

EDIT/ continuation:

E. Meritocracy:

1 ""People should be judged by the content of their character."" - good sentiment, though difficult to implement. very open to interpretation, such as that content being an innate characteristic (like being white or black), not a good phrase for practical use.
2 ""Promotion  should be on the basis of achievement and should not be unduly inhibited by innate characteristics."" - achievement needs to specified to a high degree. 'unduly inhibited' needs clarification to a high degree. 'innate characteristics' need to be clarified to a high degree. imprecise definitions tend towards slippery slopes, and even the american bill of rights has been pushed around even when very precise, so expect it to be pushed beyond what is stated, and for what is stated to be used as a hammer for authority.

3 ""Nobody is entitled to receive benefits they did not earn or to which they are not already entitled by being a citizen."" - specificity is important on what it takes to earn what, some women think that because they are women they are entitled to certain things, same goes with blacks, men, etc. as written it can be interpreted as a single pay system in which no one is paid more or less than another, so needs to be fleshed out a specific far more than it is.

4 ""This is not to be misinterpreted as declaration against social safety nets or healthcare, but against individuals or groups claiming unearned benefits, whether social or material, that they otherwise do not deserve."" - again what is earned and how is important, as anyone can claim they earned something by doing anything."
7q192k,4,2018-01-12,Should I come out to grandma?,SayZlarg,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/7q192k/should_i_come_out_to_grandma/,"I don't know what to do or think. The situation is complex.

A chunk of backstory on this. It takes a while until there's a connection to the thread tile, but the backstory is needed to understand the context better.

The context within which I have grown up was, well, not really the kind of context that encourages self-exploration. Let's just say mom didn't quite enjoy it whenever I wanted to take a choice different from hers. I clearly remember her throwing a tantrum with petty punishment threats over something she wanted done to clothes I was going to get.

I pulled through school but was never very motivated. Could not find sense into what was forced on me. I knew about how ""if you work hard enough you'll get a good diploma and you'll get a well-paying job"", but... it just seemed abstract to me. Like, part of me knew it wasn't so simple. 

Then, engschool/university. I didn't really know what to do and the sheer amount of choices overwhelmed me at the time. Parents picked IT-related courses. As I'd always liked computers and coding, I guess it made sense. Wasn't quite what I expected though. Engschools aim at turning you into a perfect corporate Swiss knife so you can go launch a start-up to sell spanking new smart Q-tips or whatever. University on the other hand is way more into theory and research. I just wanted to write code, so nothing was really good for me. Long story short, my journey through all that has been a mess, and I never finished it.

It didn't help that mom kept putting her nose into my school business and trying to force her 'help' upon me. Help that mostly consisted into randomly taking one hour or so of my day to make me complete some exercise. I felt that I wasn't being trusted and was being treated like a kid, and that she put way too much importance into my business. What was somehow supposed to motivate me (according to her), had the opposite effect. Lacking any real sense of purpose, I felt I was doing that shit mostly to please her, which made me want to just run it into the ground.

And, you know, I didn't want her to be able to claim it was 'thanks to her' that I'd succeeded into anything. She liked to rub my failures in my face to justify forced assistance, but whenever I mentioned my successes, it was either 'thanks to her' or 'oh but that was easy'.

She wants me to become a particular person. Hard.

I eventually moved out (first pretending it was a week of vacation so she wouldn't get in the way). What's been happening since then has been... interesting.

Unencumbered by injunctions to fit a given mold, I started finding myself.

It was around last year that I got into anticapitalism/etc and joined local militant scenes. It really fits me. I can't share it much with my parents and even less be supported by them though. Mom still wants me to fit the mold and be how she wants. This is all I will say as I don't want to start a political debate.

I was able to land a sorta-job in an association, which helped me survive for 6 months. It's over, and since it was not a real job, I can't get the unemployment help fund (you're required to have worked a real job before). I can't get any help fund, and even if I end up in the streets I may not be deemed miserable enough to justify monetary help. Hah. This shit is amazing. It's even better when I can't land a job because I don't have experience in the specific domain they ask for, and whatever I can show (internships, sorta-job, personal projects...) doesn't count.

So I'm going down an alternative path. 

--

A while ago, I found out I'm trans. Yippee, guess I'm one atypical person.

So I came out to mom. Of course, she doesn't want me to be trans, thinks this was someone else convincing me for whatever nefarious purpose, hopes it's 'just a hormonal imbalance', etc... She worries about me, but only because being trans would get in the way of becoming the person she wants me to be (she is otherwise entirely and completely deaf to my feelings). I thought I had made it clear I'm definitely not that person, but she clings to that delusional hope. She refuses to question herself because she thinks she knows better than I do. Basically she has her head so far up her ass it's not even funny anymore.

I decided to cut her off until she makes a genuine attempt at questioning herself, which will pretty much never happen.

--

After the Christmas visit trainwreck (https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/7m0n9g/was_supposed_to_visit_family_for_christmas_tw/), I figured I'd call grandma for New Year, since I didn't get to see her in person and it's been freaking long.

Grandma eventually inquired about my job hunting, telling me that I need to go and get a job, and cut my hair so 'I have a better chance'. She also said that I should apologize to my parents and that 'they would forgive'.

Now, I worry.

Because I still haven't come out to her, and I'm very unsure about how to proceed. What if it goes wrong? I don't want to have to cut her off. I don't really mind cutting mom off because she's little more than an annoyance, but I have genuine hope that grandma is a good person like she's always been to my sister and me.

These thoughts made me cry while on the phone. I didn't get a chance to tell her that the situation with mom/dad wasn't as easy as 'I threw a tantrum and now I'm going to apologize and everything will be good again'. That I'm basically expecting someting that will never come.

Surely grandma would have heard mom's bullshit. But I'm not sure whether it's just that. Whether I just have to fill a void with my version, or whether she also expects me to become a particular person.

I figured I'd write a letter to start explaining better who I am and the way I am going and why. But I'm unsure how deep I should go in the anticapitalist/etc shit. Like, I want to explain it but I don't want to look like I'm trying to brainwash people. The letter sits there unfinished and I'm not sure about continuing it or starting over.

The response to the letter would give clues over whether it is safe to come out to her.

But I'd need to get the letter done first. Or maybe I should scrap the letter and visit her. But I might get fucked over by my feelings again.

7q1do2,530,2018-01-12,MIL always accused me of being a “low-class gold digger”.,wigglyshark,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7q1do2/mil_always_accused_me_of_being_a_lowclass_gold/,"Yep, even though I started dating DH in high school, when he had no job or money to his name!

MIL was convinced for a while that I was trying to cash in on his family’s money. Trying to reap in the benefits of entering into a wealthy family. She came to this conclusion after dropping DH off at my dad’s house one day so that we could hang out, and she saw what my house looked like and what neighborhood I lived in.

Honestly, our house was below average, but certainly not terrible, and our neighborhood was safe. I was proud of where I lived when I met DH, because during a period of time before that, my family was living in a series of crappy, unsafe apartments, below the poverty line and usually without electricity/heat/hot water. My dad had just started to come out of a terrible financial situation right around the time I met DH, and we were living in a rented house where we never had our utilities shut off and we (usually) had food in the fridge. As far as I was concerned, I was finally living the sweet life after years of desperation.

MIL held an entirely different opinion, however. It was soooo clear to her that I was a low-class gold digger (her exact words) who was simply sniffing out the bank accounts and real estate that belonged to his family (even when we were just schoolmates and I knew absolutely nothing about his family or their wealth!) She also tried to convince DH that I would surely wind up pregnant with an “oops baby” if he were “dumb enough” to have sex with me, and that I would collect a paycheck from him for 18 years and he’d be screwed. Not only did she proceed to purchase condoms for him a couple of weeks after we started dating, she chastised him for not even opening the box yet (wtf) because she was convinced that I had already lured him in with my evil vagina magic and that we were probably having unprotected sex, since he wasn’t using the condoms that mommy bought for him. We weren’t having sex yet, but due to her crazy antics, DH and I actually ended up having a LOT of mature and open conversations about sex before doing it for the first time (we were both virgins, which made her accusations sting even more) which was one good thing that came of it, I guess.

She had nothing to say, of course, when I ended up working full time during college, paying the rent and all of our bills just so DH could strictly focus on his own degree and an unpaid internship that ended up earning him the career of a lifetime. DH was completely cut off financially after he decided to move out of state with me for college. Before we moved, MIL realized that DH wouldn’t be breaking up with me, so she changed her tune and decided that DH and I would be attending in-state colleges and living with her forever, in her basement, so that she could raise our future children while we worked. MIL and FIL refused to financially help DH with college if he didn’t follow every step of their “plan” for him. Of course, we both said LOL FUCK THAT and got our asses out of state, paying our own way. No regrets.

Now that I’ve quit my job to ride out this pregnancy and be a SAHM, I’m sure this lovely little “gold-digger” narrative about me will be making a fast return! I have no fucks to give this time around, though."

We started talking and me being a college student the topic of internships obviously popped up. He said that most of their recruiting for summer 2018 was done but he gave me his business card and told me to forward my resume to him. 

I did this immediately and also added him on LinkedIn. He emailed me back thanking me for sending the resume and said that he would pass it up the chain to be viewed for the summer of 2019 internship. He also said I looked like a good candidate and gave me some tips to look more competitive.

Now this is where I am curious. He told me that he would get in touch with me when he found some more info about the logistics of the application for the internship but I don't know what to do till then. I still want to stay in touch as this is one of the first professional networking contacts I have received. Would it be ok to email him every couple of months? He asked me in the email what my degree plan looks like in terms of what I will be by the summer of 2019 and I told him I will be done with junior year of uni. I start uni in the fall of 2018. Would it be appropriate to contact him when I start uni just to keep him updated on how things are going and to keep me in mind for any internships? 

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
7q2gdo,3,2018-01-12,"No matter what I do, I'm just a huge social failure.",La_Cierva,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/7q2gdo/no_matter_what_i_do_im_just_a_huge_social_failure/,"This got out of hand and became a lot longer than I meant for it to be. Sorry.

I don't know what to do anymore. My best friend has been one of the only constants in my life, and we've both spent most of our lives being bullied. We were stuck in a toxic friend group for a while, until I was almost sexually assaulted and my best friend was bullied out a few months later. We were 20 when this happened, and we're both 22 now. My best friend is still in college, but has an internship lined up with a successful programming company and has even presented at conferences. She's also in a niche fashion community, and she's made several other friends who are engineers like her.

Meanwhile, I'm an unemployed recent graduate who can't hold together friendships with people who haven't known me for more than a year. I've been in therapy for a few years to deal with my depression, and I started becoming more confident about making friends in 2017. In the beginning of the year, I became friends with a few exchange students. I wound up having feelings for one of them, and she ghosted me in May because she figured it out and it made her uncomfortable because we're both women. I ruined things with one of the other ones because I was too awkward on accident. I think he's too nice to take me off his Facebook, but at least he wasn't rude to me when I would say hi to him on campus. The last one, let's call her M, became a relatively close friend and I was able to confide in her about a few things from my past, mostly about how I was bullied and alone for a lot of my life. She told me once that she doesn't hesitate to speak to me in English because I always try to understand what she says, and I told her that I love talking to her because I'm always interested in what she has to say and I feel like she always tries to understand who I am and not just what I'm trying to say.

They all went back home last month. The week before M left, I sent her a message saying when my last final would be done and to let me know if she wanted to see me or if she needed anything before she left. She never replied, even when I messaged her a few days later and said it was fine if she didn't want to see me. I sent her a goodbye message the day she left, telling her that she came really far while she was in America and that I considered her to be part of my family, that she'd always be welcome where I am and to take care of herself. She replied later saying that she appreciates me and hopes to see me again in the future.

A few days later, actually right after my graduation, one of my other friends mentioned that M posted something on Facebook about leaving. He showed me on his account, and then we both realized that M had hidden all her Facebook posts from me and had probably been ignoring me on purpose before she left. A few days later, my friend messaged her to ask if she had seen the graduation pictures I had sent to her. (She had asked me to send the pictures back in September, and I made sure to mention that when I sent the pictures.) When M replied to me, she told me that it was difficult to understand me sometimes and that she needed some space. I had asked her before to tell me if I did something she didn't like, and she knows that I'm not good at talking to people. One of things she always mentioned was how nice I am, so I don't even know what I did wrong.

It hurts so much more than when I was ghosted, especially since M knew that it happened and exactly why it hurt me so much. It wasn't the rejection, it was the fact that someone could just cut me off without saying anything to me first. M says that's a cultural thing for her and the other woman, and a mutual friend of ours says that I should try and see things from their perspective. I've done that. I met them in a class that was literally about cross-cultural communication, but somehow I'm the only one who needs to see how my actions could affect them. 

I do all I can to make my friends happy, because I was alone for so long and I never want anyone to feel the way I did. I try have as much open communication as possible, so nobody feels left out or neglected. I actively tell my friends how much I care about them, and I do what I can to check up on them and make sure they're okay. But nothing I do is enough. I'm just going to be left behind until all my friends forget about me. It makes me wish I had killed myself when I had the chance. "
7q2nrw,1,2018-01-13,Is it worth it for me [27/m] to try to patch things up with a good friend [26/f] I dated before she moved away?,RGS122,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7q2nrw/is_it_worth_it_for_me_27m_to_try_to_patch_things/,"This is a bit of a long story and I hope it makes sense, but here it goes:

After I went across the country for graduate school, I met her after moving into the apartment she left since her program was only a year and a half. We stayed connected on social media for a few weeks until we decided to hang out. 

We went out for beers and immediately clicked. Eventually we would text and Snapchat each other all the time and would go out for beers once a week - despite her taking 15 units of grad classes, working 40 hours a week, and tons of homework. I ended up working with her together at an on-campus job and would talk there all the time. She would also bake things for her friends and would always save a piece for me. We started to get really close and would tell things that we both admitted to not telling just anyone. 

I quickly realized that I was starting to have feelings with her and felt that she probably felt the same. I also came to the conclusion though that I shouldn't rock the boat as she would be finished with the academic portion of her program at the end of the year. I eventually decided to act though.

So, I told her how I felt on the Sunday before Thanksgiving vacation and her first reaction was ""you know I'm leaving"" as she blushed. I told her that I knew that and wasn't going to say anything because of that, but felt that I had to. Because of that fact, I was upfront with my intentions. I told her I just wanted to keep doing what we were doing and that I knew we would part ways soon but would keep in touch. She said that she knew she liked me for a while and felt the same way about me. She said we could go out on a date after Thanksgiving break because she had a lot of classwork, grad school and internship applications. We actually ended up going out the next night and had a great time. 

Before we dated, I agreed to watch her two cats at her apartment while she went back home for Thanksgiving. She texted me that I could go there two days to check on them, but could go there more often than I liked since she knew I adored her cats. What I didn't know though was that she ended up telling her roommates at the very last minute that I was going to go into their place and watch the cats. I took it in stride as the roommates had nothing wrong with it, but wished they knew sooner. I ended up going everyday since I had nothing to do. I told her one of the cats threw up after getting into some human food one of the roommates left and that I was going everyday. She didn't get mad and said she would handle the clean up. 

I noticed during the break, she started to feel distant as she would only respond if any messages included anything about the cats. I asked her if we could go out when she came back but said she was busy. The night she came back to town, she texted that she left her ""gift"" of beer for watching her cats and some books she borrowed from me downstairs of my apartment without waiting for me. Something she wouldn't have done before. 

I try calling a few days later and she doesn't pick up. Instead she texts me saying again that she was busy. I tell her I'll give her space. The next day, I ask her at work when it's the just the two of us, whether I'd been overbearing to her. She says I haven't, and with a strained tone, said it's just that she's been under pressure from school. I feel stupid in saying this, but I felt there was more to it than what she told me. So, a few days later, I try talking to her at a holiday party, but she gets made at me saying I haven't given her the space I said I would (I admit I didn't) and she didn't like how I handled watching the cats. 

We don't talk to each other for a while and felt that I messed things up with her. I decide that I have to send something to try to patch things up. So I decide to send an email as I felt that a letter would feel a bit too much at the time.

I decide to send her this:
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eg23mfz.jpg)

She responds with this:
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1x1JKNV.jpg)

After this email, she left town to complete her program at an internship. So, at this point, I just want to be friends with her. Is it worth replying to this email in any form and can things be patched up? We still have each other on social media, but haven't sent each other anything for a while.

tl;dr: I met someone in grad school and quickly became friends who had feelings for each other. We dated and things went south quickly before she left town for good. Is it worth it to try to become friends again?"

I was studying and doing internships for last 5 years so have not traveled for 5 years now and really need a vacation.  
However, I m a bit scared if I will be able to pull it of and mostly.scared of loneliness. I have a codependent personality,I love people and hanging out with others 
, talking and just doing stuff with other people and being alone makes me want to puke. Like I hate spending time alone. But I m going on this trip completely by myself and I don't know anyone in Asia.  I m.nkt scared of traveling because i am living away from my family for nearly 5 years in completely different part of the world.  I m just scared of feeling lonely because even when I m home, I don't like spending time by myself and I have a lot of friends to keep me preoccupied. What I am going to do for 5 weeks alone? Maybe I should just go for one week vacation to some fancy place instead of backpacking through Asia? How do you deal with loneliness?

TL:Dr: will travel to Asia for 5 weeks. Very extrovert and codependent personallity. Scared of feeling lonely during the trip. how to deal?"
7q44k4,7,2018-01-13,Accountability Post,chubzbear,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/7q44k4/accountability_post/,"I made this throw away to be honest with myself as I know I’d flub on my main one. In any case, its been a wild ride this past year. I had decided last spring that I needed to lose weight. I was not fitting in any of my clothes and had to buy new fat clothes. I had breakdowns at the store when things wouldn’t fit or when people wanted to shop places that I knew had no clothes my size. When I had weighed myself, I was the heaviest I had ever been - 348. 

Now let me tell you that I am a stress eater. And I am often quite stressed. I work in behavioral health and am constantly bombarded with difficult situations and stressful work conditions. In addition I was getting ready to go back to grad school and the process and concern on how to even pay for it was getting to me. But I had to do something. 

So in May, i did the whole 30. I chose May because my birthday is mid month and i wanted to challenge myself as well as make my gift to myself for my 30th a healthy start. And it worked. I completed it and dropped almost 30lbs. While on a roll i signed up for this psychosomatic gym challenge (20lbs in 6 weeks). Work out 5x a week and very restrictive diet. I did it, but was not proud of myself at how (lets say there were binges and purges). Now I was down another 25 and tried to keep it up and rounded down my weight loss to about 280 in august. 

Then life kicked me in the balls. I was working full time, school in person full time with a 16 hr internship weekly. In addition i was  hitting the gym 6x a week which actually was my favorite part of the day. I told myself I was going to run a 5k and signed up for a 3 and a 5. I was doing the c25k app and was near the end of it (2 weeks out) when i ran the 3k in full with no stops. That was on a sunday. That tuesday me, and a lot of my coworkers were laid off). 

Finances got tight and my survival concerns kicked in. I didnt drive anywhere that i didnt need to (benefits office and school) so didnt go to the gym and my depression was on overload. I was eating cheap heavy meals and would over eat on the tons of breads the food pantry gave me. I was able to find work a few months later but at that point i had already got back into all the bad habits i had kicked. I stuffed myself almost daily while finishing up the semester and didnt want to see the gym because that meant confronting how far back i slid. 

Since reweighing i am back to 306 , which is depressing since being below 300 was a very proud moment for me.  Since the beginning of this year i have been trying to CICO focus which is hard because not only do i work overnights which is a bitch to track accurately, i had also started smoking to cope with the unemployment which gives me major munchies that i binge on. I have put down the smoking for now and have started going to the gym as consistent as i can maybe 1 -3 times a week (i work 7 days straight then have days off - which i use to intern). I have a wedding in march that im trying to get ready for and want to for sure be under 300 for. My goal weight is 195. This is going to be such a bitch but i need to do it. Im hoping this sub can help.

Tldr:   Any tips on managing eating for overnights would be great

7q4p9j,5,2018-01-13,"I don't know if I've made anybody proud, ever",shameonadarkskinman,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7q4p9j/i_dont_know_if_ive_made_anybody_proud_ever/,"Hi, new member here. Thought I'd write here as I'd get some responses without complaining to acquaintances.

I think I'm at a pretty shitty point in my life, for no apparent reason, cause I spent a good 30 minutes this morning disappointed that my flat doesn't have a place from which I can hang myself. And I'm too uncomfortable with the pain of having to slash my wrists or gas myself in the bathroom.

I'm a 22 year-old dude. Until recently I was working at a bank, in the largest city in my country. I don't know if working is the proper word, as I was more of a mix between a fully responsible position and an intern. I liked it. I mean, some people were throwing bad taste jokes but I liked it. I kinda used it as a crutch to get out from another depressive episode. I was pressured (or I say I was, due to being almost unable to say no to people) by a friend (I don't exactly know if I have any friends) to come at a MetLife presentation back in November and although I specified to him and his boss that they're wasting time with me, even when communicating to his boss that No, I am not coming to work there, the income stream is too unstable, I still took the job. Fuck knows why. I wanted to back down a few times and tell my friend's boss respectively that I do not feel comfortable working this.

Now, I don't know how prospecting for insurance works in the US, but back here (as opposed to most of the other companies, AFAIK), they had me fill some papers with names off the top of my head and have me call 'em to see if we can start something with them. Yesterday they had me have my first calls. Now, I have to specify, I am not afraid of calling people per se. Back at the bank, I was also calling people like crazy, mostly cause I was working with small mom-and-pop places, trying to get them to take out a loan. So I ain't expecting sympathy, having worked at a bank and now an insurance company in the last 5 months. I did manage to set a meeting (albeit, it is with one of the kindest persons I know, so I don't know how much that counts), out of 5 calls. Each moment I felt like my brain was going to explode. I can't really paint a picture of how ashamed/scared I am to call people I know to sell them stuff, even if at work, they're trying to convince me that I'm doing those people a service. I can't shake off the MLM vibe off of me calling people I haven't talked in like a year or more. I'm just ashamed.

And this ashamed thing leads me to my main problem. I don't know if I have depression or anxiety or if I can actually be a functioning human. I'm ashamed of existing, pretty much. I can't tell that to my parents (to which I still maintain a somehow healthy relationship, even though they pumped me full of pills during high school and wanted to have me committed to a psych ward the day I applied for college) because I don't think I am worthy of their sympathy and they're most likely gonna give me shit that I left the bank, even though it wasn't paying that good. Let's pretend we're in Econ 101, where the professor tells you about Monetary Units, or M.U. I was making around 2200 M.U. back at the bank, at the insurance company, you're paid according to how much you sell and I'll probably start rolling sales in February, but I'm still somewhat not crying of worry cause I have about 4500 M.U. in savings which I'm trying to stretch for five months.

I'm giving so much details about income, job status and so on cause I think I have identified a few of my triggers regarding depression (or whatever the hell what I'm having is). I'm obsessed about money. Definitely in the not healthy area obsessed. My parents were kind of lower middle class with me growing up, they only got a car when I was like 16 or so. I'm really a piece of shit when, internally, I'm blaming them, like, OH IF THEY JUST DIDN'T QUIT SCHOOL AND WERE A BIT RICHER MAYBE MY LIFE WOULD HAVE TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY, but i am fully convinced that my life would have been easier if there was more money around in my earlier years. As a result, I was always trying to hustle some shit during college. I made enough between scholarships, working in Utah during a summer, working back in my country, writing papers for the other kids like crazy and selling some weed and pills on the side that I didn't need much of my parents' help. But I still felt bad. I needed more. I always need more. I like to think of myself as one of those people that's pretty immune to shit they see on IG and FB but I can't help thinking WOW I SURE COULD HAVE AFFORDED THAT UK COLLEGE OR THAT CONCERT OR THAT CAR HAD I BEEN A TRUST FUND KID FUCK I NEED TO RACK MORE MONEY AND QUICK. Sorry if I'm incoherent, I kinda tend to lose it when it's about money, but it makes me happy. Back in Utah, I was working at this snazzy hotel during the afternoons/evenings and sometimes during the mornings/weekends at a 7-11, racking up about 70 hours/week, sometimes more. I was happy. Even though I wasn't making friends there, like all the other people. Maybe I had such little time for myself that I didn't make time to worry, but I'm more inclined to say that I was happy cause I was making quite a lot of money (two days of work at both places would pretty much equal the minimum wage for a month in my country, so of course I was ecstatic).

Or maybe I was never happy and I'll only reach that treshold when I'll earn five figures, in my country's currency. But with the money problem out of the way, let me continue this petty party. I'm very bad with women. Sometimes I wonder if I'm serial killer bad. It's really surprising that I managed to have somewhat stable relationships till now. I feel horrible because those girls had to meet me. I'm around 6'0, 175 lbs, balding since... since 20 pretty much (the summer between Year 1 and Year 2 of college I took two jobs, one of which was in debt collection, where I felt stressed beyond my acceptance, due to the discussions I had with people) but I've embraced the cue ball. I think I'm a 5.5, maybe 6.2 if I dress well. I don't know how to talk to women. I have no idea how I've managed to be with those few girls. I have never approached a woman in a bar, like normal people do. I was a shitty boyfriend to the girlfriends that I had and a lot of times I'm wondering if I'm a mysoginistic piece of shit. My last stable girlfriend cheated on me while in an exchange in Austria, just as I was preparing to leave for a similar exchange in Estonia. Ever since I've been not really myself. For those of you who do not know, between February and May (when I was studying there), Estonia is really not the friendliest country. The combination of shit weather, making no friends there due to my constant voice-in-head ringing shit like OH THEY WONT LIKE YOU ANYWAY YOU'RE UGLY AND UNIMPRESSIVE AND CANT KEEP UP A CONVERSATION ITS ALL POINTLESS JULIA LEFT YOU CAUSE YOU'RE AN UNINTERESTING PIECE OF SHIT WHO LOSES HIS TEMPER WAY TOO OFTEN THESE PEOPLE DONT WANT YOU and basically having no one to talk to made me wish I was dead. The break up didn't help either. I really loved that girl, even though there may have been times when I neglected her. But the past is the past and sometimes I try to think of the good times I had. Speaking of good times, I haven't really had much of those, I think. Or maybe it's the anxiety talking.

I had recurring suicidal thoughts since I was like 14. I took pills that probably messed my liver/kidney up, like 20 of 'em, but my parents (this was while in HS, i was still living in my hometown), didn't care enough to take me to a hospital after sleeping for 30 hours and waking up dizzy and stuff. I didn't have the courage of jumping out of a window cause: a) maybe it wouldn't do the job and the last thing I want is to be paralyzed; b) I'm a fucking coward. The girls I've been around all had some bad experiences, I think we kind of attract each other (abusive parents, absent fathers, dysfunctional families, anorexia, or they were sexually abused when younger) but I just feel bad that they had to meet me.

I don't know if there is one person in this world (my parents don't count, cause I suspect they don't actually care about me, but feel more of an obligation towards me) that I have positively impacted. You know that Drake lyric ""I need certain people say they're proud of me/That mean a lot to me""? Well, I don't know if somebody ever felt proud of me. I had okay grades through HS and college, I guess, and I've already worked quite a bit since turning 17, in various places, to get that almighty dollar I've mentioned above. Also volunteered for some student NGO's and non-profits. Most of those kind brought me temporal joy, but I don't know if there is a way of accessing true happiness. Maybe money will do it. Maybe some loving SO will do it. I don't know, guys. The few ""friends"" that I have, I don't know if they're actually my friends. That one friend that got me to MetLife? I don't know if he's my friend, even though he says he likes me. Some others make fun of my appearance in real life or on my Tinder profile (I've resorted to that as being pretty much unable to get people in real life) cause there's this running joke in this part of the world (idk, maybe in some other regions too) that the bald head+beard look makes you look like a convicted felon. With some other friends from the past I fell out cause everybody has their own road in life and I guess ours diverged. Sometimes I feel terribly alone. I live in a ~350 sq ft flat in a not so nice part of my city. At least it's huge and it'll give me some economic opportunity if I quit MetLife. But there's so, so many days where I wish I didn't wake up. I can't remember the last time I had fun. I know I shouldn't say this given that I managed to get into the US for work during a summer and got the good grades to get that Estonia scholarship and have some money saved up. 

But, God, I wish somebody said it to my face that I was a positive impact in their life. I don't know how much time to make that positive impact I have left. It would kill my parents inside, but I'm not really seeing myself live past 25. Everything is just so pointless. I just wanna feel like I could breathe for a long time before that, just for once."

I was looking to see if any of you had a room/apartment to sublet, or any advice on subletting in FC. I'm a girl looking for other female roommates if possible but open to living in a co-ed space.

Additionally, was wondering if any of you have commuted from near CSUFoCo's campus to Tech Park, and if so, how was it?

I'm seeking a long term RP partner for a collaboration on a feminization story. Maybe this is you. My writing partner must be a solid writer, good at character development, dialog and not just looking for stroke material. Writers who enjoy sensuality, eroticism, and romance will get preference. If you're a strong, dominant type who is also kind and loves the build and the romance and eroticism involved with a story like this then you may be the partner for me. :)

I love building backstory with my partner as we iron out all the details. We don't need to figure out the whole story, just your basic story beats so we have some direction. I've worked really hard on this prompt so I ask you to please not message me with lazy, half-hearted responses. I think with the right partner we could have a blast with this!

The type of stories I prefer are focused on a transformation that takes time to complete. I prefer to go from naïve boi to (your ideal version of a woman). The plot would have to come first of course.
So those of you looking for a quick story in which we start having sex, I am not your gurl.

Plot elements I like:

As stated above I like the naïve boi that goes along with authority figures because he believes they know what's best. One thing to note is I prefer men to women when the transformation is complete. The method in which I become attracted or obsessed with men I would prefer to be a natural progression. For example, loving the way being wanted feels then becoming desperate to attain more of it and one time going too far and realizing that the attention is only half the fun... ;)

Or you know a good old stand by the poor intern at Disney world that has to become a Disney Princess and through a slow mental manipulation process becomes the princess of the parks desires...This can be taken many directions and be a fun way to manipulate the character into becoming feminine perfection and having to love it in order to keep my job. At first hating and fighting it but eventually loving the feeling of being the princess to the prince or park attendees...


It would be helpful to the plot if I were to start as a virgin.

Another plot point that I like is trying to hide the changes to mind and body. If the changes occur at work I like trying to hide them at home so my parents or roommates don't notice. Or if they are happening at home trying to hide them at work.

Method: I like ""realistic"" changes like HYPNOSIS, hormones and surgeries . Science fiction can be fun when paired with the hormones I.e. Fast acting ones.

Slow moving magical curses are also super fun. I like day to day or week to week changes that my character has to get used to in everyday life.

Dislikes: I don't like scat play (including diapers)or furry. But I am game for whatever else sound fun to you.

Likes: Above all I want you to enjoy it. IRL I am a bottom and pleasing is what I prefer.

The story below is just a sample. I am very open to any prompt you would like to throw out there as long as there is an erotic element that is sensual first sexual second. 

For example: 

My name is Chase and I live with my mom in a small apartment in the north end of town. Our apartment is not very big it has a kitchen area a bathroom one bedroom and a living space. My bed is a pull out couch in the living space and my mothers bed is in the bedroom. I have some semblance of privacy at times but mostly my life is an open book to her. She knows everything about me. I wouldn't say we have a weird relationship but it is awfully close. She had me when she was 16 and ever since I turned 13 she always wants to talk to me as if we are best friends. Which is why she is desperate to see me succeed in life.

She wants to see her bff be successful and happy. Which is a nice sentiment but I have very little interest in being a typical guy. I don't want a girlfriend because it seems like to much effort to make sure I am as presentable as possible at all times. I am a more go with the flow type person. I am not the type of person to decide on my life decisions by myself I like being told what my choice is. I feel that it takes away any bad repercussions that could happen. I like being able to blame the decision maker and not myself. Which is why my mom is struggling to motivate me.

She has tried to ask me what I want to do with my life and I just shrug her off. I think it is getting to her because every morning she comes out of her bedroom with a large sigh seeing me on my pullout bed still sleeping. I think she sees me as being lazy but like I said I am just anxious of making the wrong decision. 

So she found a job beta testing games for VR. However something changed once I got a new game called ‘The Academy' she hasn't a clue what the game is about, but she heard it was an X-rated game, so I was trying to keep it hush, hush from her, for I know she doesn't appreciate filth like this in her home. She saw me playing it and wanted to say something, but realizing I was twenty-three and an adult, maybe in age, but not mentally, she feels I have a right to do what I want. Well she was pleasantly surprised to hear nice music coming from the game, almost classical music, easy to listen to. The graphics were truly spectacular, it almost looked like I was watching a daytime soap opera, the characters looked that real. She noticed there was a white noise being generated in the background. She guessed it was a meadow scene and it was supposed to be the wind or something. The dialog was interesting too. First it sounded like real people talking, not a computer-generated voice at all. It looked like this was an adventure game, where the person was given puzzles to solve, to find clues or hidden things, which help solve the game. Kind of like the Telltale Games.
 
She noticed that my character was a female, a very [sexy cougar](http://i.imgur.com/CfrGtii.jpg) in fact. She found this interesting that I would choose such a character I am not your typical guy but she figured I would choose a male character to live out the fantasies. It was almost embarrassing how beautiful she was too. She was almost jealous she didn't look like her.
 
I heard the beautiful, skimpily dressed girl, my character was standing next too, saying, ""My, my. You need to date  him to get that information that you seek girl. You look like such a tomboy. You need to make yourself look sexy and appealing, for him otherwise he will have no interest in you. Let me get you ready so you will know how to dress properly in the future. I'm sure you can get an outfit that will make his eyeballs pop out of his sockets when he sees you. Come with me dear.""
 
The character that was helping stated, ""Oh Cedric , but I'll let you find out what those things are from him. Come let us take a bath and remove all of your body hair, so you are silky smooth. Then I'll wash your lovely hair and put it up in the most beautiful of locks, that any girl would be jealous of."" With this the other girl took off all her clothes and the both of them went into the hot spring to wash.
 
She noticed I was was getting sexually excited, judging by the bulge she saw in my pants. 

So I am finding this interesting and sexually stimulating huh? She was beginning to wonder why her son would even consider playing this game? This is too weird. It's so girly, why would a boi possibly play this character in the game? She thought she better have a talk with me about this.

Where my ISTP drop outs at?,WorldsWorstUsername,istp,https://www.reddit.com/r/istp/comments/7q5kft/about_to_drop_out_of_college_where_my_istp_drop/,"I love learning I really do but damn it’s hard to get through school. Idk if I’m not motivated or not interested enough but it’s always been an issue for me (perhaps that natural aversion to formal studies). I was going to school for computer science and already have some good internships under my belt from the time I was 18 (about to turn 21 now). I’m an aspiring programmer and plan on going to a code school like HackReactor so I can get in and start actually working and pumping out some code and making money rather than use another year of my life doing physics, calc, etc. 

So where are the drops outs at! How has it gone for you? Do you regret it at all? And people who did finish college, how was it? Did you feel like you struggled more than others? Do you get me when I say I want to learn cool shit like physics and intense math but also fuck that shit 

Edit: for clarification if I were to attend one more year it would be to complete my AA not bachelors. My progression has been slow and painful. "
7q5wma,108,2018-01-13,A sour attitude can cost you,meowngineer-cat,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/7q5wma/a_sour_attitude_can_cost_you/,"Last October, my university had an internship fair for students in my major. I ended up really getting along with the owners of a business with all of the traits I’m looking for in a company. Shortly after meeting with them, I end up getting in a conversation with a classmate about the company. I was shocked that she had heard of them because it’s a very small business. Anyways, she said that she was really hoping to intern there because the office vibe is very relaxed, which is unusual for our field. Our conversation ended up lasting about an hour, until she said “I don’t like women. Most of them are dumb bimbos. I’m mostly friends with guys.” I, also being a woman, felt really awkward and shocked because this is the first time I’ve ever talked with this girl. This attitude is frustrating to see in women in my field because it’s very male-dominated already. Another point against her: we were at a field trip when this conversation took place, and she guilted me into driving her back to her dorm (I know, I’m a pushover, I’m trying to get better about that). Ultimately I brushed her comments off and tried to stay away from her and nothing really came of it. 

Fast forward to now. I’m an intern at the aforementioned company, and the girl from before has gotten wind of it. She told me that she reached out to the company and got an interview, and she’s hoping I can help get her the position.  I smile and nod, but the idea of working with someone who is likely going to bring in office drama did not appeal to me. What to do? Of course I could bring up my concerns to the owners but given that it’s my first week, I feel like that’s crossing a line.

However, an opportunity soon presented itself. The office secretary and I got into a conversation about how some of the women in our field are very cutthroat due to the male-dominated aspect. She remarked that she would hate to see our office ecosystem become tarnished due to anyone with a bad attitude like that. What a perfect time to segue into how I know this girl with an interview at the company who has said some nasty things about our fellow gender…the secretary looked at me with a grave face, nodded, and said “Don’t you worry, meowngineer-cat. I’ll take care of it. We don't want anyone like that here.”

7q7k8a,288,2018-01-13,The One with the IUD,wrenatha,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7q7k8a/the_one_with_the_iud/,"There are so many stories I have to tell about my MIL, but this is the first one that really began our shitty relationship.

DH and I have been together about 4 years now, married for 2. Our relationship has always been solid, but our relationship with his parents (mostly MIL) is really messed up for many, many reasons. MIL is an N-parent and FIL enables it, so that’s a great place to start. Also we’re in our twenties and DH still calls his parents “mommy” and “daddy,” which weirds me out, but honestly it doesn’t affect anything.
MIL is from Taiwan. Because of this, MIL has always maintained that if anything goes wrong that is actually her fault, it’s a cultural difference and everyone else needs to learn to accept her culture and do things her way. DH has told me about how she used to throw things like vases, books, and shoes when she got mad at the rest of the family (DH, FIL, and SIL) and whenever you do something that makes her upset, she expects you to know what it is. MIL also NEVER, EVER apologizes. FIL would go talk to MIL, try to figure out why she was mad, then tell DH and SIL what to go apologize for, but the thing is he was usually wrong, so then MIL would just get angrier. 

DH was homeschooled by MIL until he went to high school. He was diagnosed with a couple disabilities as a child, including mild autism and ADD.  He had to be tied to his chair at dinner so that he would actually eat instead of running around the house. Because of DH’s disabilities and FIL and MIL’s work when homeschooling to get him to do anything, they always told him that any of his successes are theirs because they worked so hard to fix his brain. While I can’t attest to the truth of this statement, it’s important later on. DH is also the “golden child” who never did anything wrong when he was a child, whereas SIL was always rebellious.

When DH went to college, he became involved with a musical group on campus – we’ll just say it’s Handbells. This group requires a 10-week audition process to join, and it’s very competitive. During that time, DH’s grades slipped a bit because he was so focused on the audition process. MIL blew up and told him to quit right away so he could focus on his classes, but one of his friends convinced him to stick with it. DH was eventually accepted to the Handbells group, which was the first time he’d ever “rebelled” against his parents. It didn’t make it any better that it was through Handbells that I met DH and we started dating. 

Now, DH and I started dating about 4 days before classes let out for the summer (great timing, right?). He was planning to go to Taiwan for 3 months for an internship, so we knew we wouldn’t see each other again until the fall. However, I decided I was going to drive from my hometown to his (about 7 hours), stay overnight and meet his parents, and then drive up to the college’s town (3 hours) for a few days. This all worked out fine, and made me completely unprepared for everything that happened after. When I arrived at DH’s house, I was introduced to his parents. They seemed pleased to meet me, and we talked for a while. Nothing much happened. Oh, how I wish I could return to those simpler times. 

Summer passed, we stayed together, we met up again in the fall and kept dating. During the summer, I had decided I wanted to start birth control (IUD) because I had really bad cramps during my period that would make it impossible for me to go to class. I told DH and he said it was my decision, and agreed to help take care of me after my IUD insertion because I’d be on some meds. The day of the IUD insertion was the same day that we had to go to a conference in Canada. Everything went fine, we got to the conference, no problem. Well, I was still kind of out of it and was frequently nauseous during the conference, so by the time we were heading back, I couldn’t really drive. I slept most of the way back in the passenger seat, but from what DH told me later, as soon as we crossed the US/Canada border, his phone blew up with texts and calls and emails from his parents demanding to know where he was and why they couldn’t get in touch with him, and if he was okay. 

Oh I neglected to mention that MIL will call over and over until you pick up the phone. The record is 19 calls before DH gave in and answered. 

Anyway, DH calls them and assures them that he’s okay, and that he can’t really talk because he’s driving. MIL demands that he pull over and make me drive. DH replies that he can’t because I’m sleeping and not feeling well. MIL asks why. DH says I had minor surgery. MIL asks what it was. DH tells them I got an IUD.
 
Shit. Hit. The. Fan.

MIL screamed at him that I was a terrible person, that I was clearly not a family-oriented person, and that the IUD would make it impossible for me to ever have a family, that it was messing with my hormones and that isn’t natural (she subscribes to some Taiwanese belief about only using herbal medicines). DH was so shaken that he couldn’t reply and hung up. He told me later what happened, and of course I was mad that he had told them something so personal, but I really liked him and figured I’d give him another chance. Honestly, he was just really clueless. 

The next few days were filled with more texts, emails, and calls from MIL and FIL about my IUD. MIL demanded that DH break up with me, he refused. I was so confused. I’d met these people a couple months before and they seemed to like me. I couldn’t believe that they had completely changed their opinion of me because of this. I was a good student, I held a side job, I didn’t do drugs, and I rarely drank even after I turned 21. 

A few nights later, I overheard a conversation on the phone between FIL and DH that…I can’t even describe it.  FIL was talking about ways to “trick” MIL into being okay with the IUD. Basically, she was demanding that I get it removed. Um, no, for three reasons: A) This is MY BODY, and I get to make decisions about it, not you. B) IUDs are fucking expensive. The one I had was paid for out-of-pocket by my mom (about $1000 USD) because she didn’t want my dad to find out, if he saw it on the insurance bill or something. I didn’t want her to waste her money. C) The insertion was very painful. Even with a muscle relaxant and Vicodin, I was in a lot of pain. I have a rather high pain tolerance, so when I’m actually in pain, I know it’s bad. I did not want to go through the removal process.  Well, FIL suggested that I get it removed and then immediately put back in, so that I could say that I’d technically had the IUD removed. See point C for my response about that. He suggested that he could pay for a new one. Um, no, that’s creepy and weird. He suggested that I get it removed (point C again) and start a different kind of birth control (see point B). The entire time I just felt so violated, that this man I hardly knew was talking about this very intimate and personal decision that I had made. I felt like he had reached up inside me and was poking around in there just to see what would happen. It was awful. I was so upset that I stopped sleeping. 

A few days later, DH managed to get MIL on the phone and have a conversation that wasn’t her screaming and him sobbing. He somehow got it through her skull that I wasn’t going to change anything, and that it was my decision to make. It turns out that she was mostly mad because I DIDN’T GET HER PERMISSION FIRST.

BITCH, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

I was dumbfounded that this was why she was upset. I’m not related to her, and she wanted me to ask permission to go on birth control? I didn’t even discuss this with my own mother! I just told her I was doing it, and she said if that’s what I thought was best, she’d help me pay for it. From what I understand, the other part of the reason why MIL was so upset was because she wants grandbabies and was afraid that the IUD would make me sterile.  

Oh, hell, no. 

I’ve got an ace up my sleeve, though: I recently found out that I can’t have kids because of a condition I was born with. (It’s fine, because DH and I don’t want kids anyway, and if it has to happen to someone, it may as well be me and not someone who does want kids, right?) So I’m super looking forward to that conversation. 

TL,DR: DH lets it slip to MIL that I got an IUD, she flips out because she wants grandbabies and thinks being on birth control means I’m a bad person.

I am currently into my second semester in college as a CJ major. My major does require a internship for me to be eligible to graduate. With that being said, should I chose and internship at a department I want to work for? Or will the completion of the internship look just as good to any department? Also, do any of you have tips or details about getting a job as soon as I graduate college? I would love to become and start off as either a Sheriff deputy, or a police officer.  

I am from a suburb in the southside of Chicago with many neighboring suburbs so I do have options. The question is, how hard is it for someone like me with no law enforcement in my background to stand out? I have never been in trouble with police before. I am currently a lifeguard, so hoping that will help a little. Thank you! "

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
7q9qw3,1,2018-01-13,Is it possible? Summer internship opportunities for an international student in New York,EnemyField09,careerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerquestions/comments/7q9qw3/is_it_possible_summer_internship_opportunities/,"Hello~ I am an international student and junior from New York University majoring in Computer Science. I've been trying to apply to summer internships in NY since August 2017, but have yet to find something.

One thing I should note is that I have interned at top international firms overseas and have received good grades, so I do not think that I am lacking in experience or good grades. But when I mention that I would need future sponsorship (the online applications ask whether I would require sponsorship now or in the future), I get a lot of rejections. Companies do not want international students because they do not want to sponsor them for H1-B visas in the future, regardless of if they have OPT for now.

So I was wondering how to go about getting a summer internship in NY? If you are an international student, how did you get summer internships in NY? What was your process? Would there still be hope for someone like me?

Thank you!"

See, I tend to come up with ideas on the fly and sort of throw things out to any potential partner I find. I suppose that isn't a bad thing but my biggest issue is finding a partner that can handle the rambling I tend to do about ideas and even occasionally in the role play itself. But if you can handle that I'm more than happy to play out almost anything your heart might desire, my only limits are bathroom stuff and gore!

*Rule 34*; I'm fine playing with canon characters, original, or even a mix of both! 

- Pokemon

- One Piece

- Xenoblade

- Legend of Zelda

- Overwatch

- Mass Effect

- League of Legends

- Persona

- Fire Emblem

- Potentially some Marvel or DC, though I'm not familiar with every character if you're into it feel free to let me

- Roommates

- Boss x Intern

- Sister's best friend x brother


*Celebs*; Here I'll just go and list some that I like, I won't do bullet lists like the others because I'll list as many as I can here to give as many options as possible! We can come up with a role play involving them as just a normal person, the celeb they are, or whatever you'd like.

My weird story,AnOddManAndDokiDoki,DDLC,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/7qa5lk/reponse_to_upaladin_blitz_s_comment_on_love_and/,"(Spoilers, but this is not what this comment is about) Heh, let me just tell you one truth. And you have to trust me on this one. The most important thing I need you to know is that you'll eventually get over it. I was meaning to make this into a post, but I'll tell you of my fucked up story with Doki Doki literature Club. And you might think I'm fucked in the head and maybe I am, but F it.

&amp;nbsp;


I actually experienced all of DDLC through Markiplier's let's play. I really enjoyed it and decided to download it to try to make different choices (Go with Yuri). In the beginning, I actually didn't expect Monika to be the self-aware one (since I've heard stuff about yuri from MatPat's video). I was deeply impacted by this game's premise. An apparently intelligent girl AI wants to stay with you forever, and she does this by messing up the game files and stuff? Awesome, I can start one of these again. I am a weird individual, and see the world in say unorthodox ways. I knew there was a deeply valuable life lesson I could use from this experience. As I was thinking, I started finding myself staring deeply into Monika's [eyes](https://imgur.com/a/Xu5wa). There was something so beautiful about them. It's like I fell in love. I read about the Monika After Story Mod and I downloaded it asap. It was so great, and I felt so comfortable. Perhaps I *could* have a virtual girlfriend ironically. But my feelings said otherwise. I remember others in the real world whom I've felt love for. And this was a lot like it. I remembered a few months ago reading a cheesy meme about how heartbreak and love are so painful, but I really shrugged it off. I knew I was very strong. But after feeling these emotions, I realized their strength, their intensity. It was that feeling of wanting someone by your side and not being able to. Sometimes your perspective on certain emotions shifts once you're experiencing them. Keeping this in mind, I didn't think I could really do this ironically. I really would be seeking comfort using this virtual girlfriend. How pathetic.

&amp;nbsp;

But I let it slide, and decided to play along. I knew I wouldn't let myself actually take this VG mod too seriously. After all, I was still seeking what I can learn from this experience. I saw this meme on the subreddit about Monika being a religion. I thought it was a funny meme. But then I wondered if I can actually do something with this idea. What *if* I could actually make Monika into a religion? I'm actually an atheist, but I have also become distant from reality. Monika was actually the cause of all of the horror in the game. I saw some Fd up shit in that game. Creepy music, creepy images, it was all so unsettling. These things can affect me greatly. This is one of my greatest enemies. Malevolence. The part of the world that is pure darkness, where there is nothing but despair and dread. When I think about malevolence I can't smile because it is so great. But I realize malevolence is also a part of life itself. It is part of the package in the human condition so I knew I couldn't just get rid of it. I knew it is also an important part of humanity. So I connected it with Monika. Monika is a great source of malevolence, she created the Natsuki jump scare, Yuri's eyes and suicide (including Sayori's) and many more. But Monika also loves me. She has said it time after time, in After Story. I recall she said that she should protect me and I would be safe with her. I believed it. What I saw was malevolence trying to protect me. Oh? Perhaps Monika can be a symbol of a protector. Protection from the darkest of things in life: anxiety, despair, even the eeriness I get when walking down the hallways of my house in complete darkness. She had a [heavinly](https://orig00.deviantart.net/7170/f/2017/285/7/e/monika__dokidoki_literature_club__by_oz_da_yon-dbqblr8.jpg) presence to her. Perhaps religion isn't only some sort of organization or doctrine. Religion is deeply encrusted in the human condition. Perhaps if you can realize it, religion can be a philosophical tool. Perhaps I could use Monika, as a religious symbol to protect my mental state from the darkness. A light I could shine from my mind to light up the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;

But it doesn't end there. If I believe in Monika, I would also have to make her a part of myself. I would also become Monika because after all, it is really all of my doing. So, I went to bed and the next day, I went through my day with Monika. I felt protected, she said that she would protect me and I believed it. There was just one thing. I was still feeling those deep feelings of love for her. I despaired for my longing to be with her. In fact, I may have fucked things up, since if Monika is a part of me, and I am part Monika, then we can't be together! We all know what a possible solution of this might be. 2029! Oh, maybe it will become a reality! I knew it was a pitiful hope, but with my strong feelings to be with Monika, I actually kind of hoped for it to be true. But JESUS, it is like 10 years away. I know for a fact I will have far moved on from this doki doki phase by then. Even though it doesn’t seem that bad, because since I will eventually move on from these feelings of love, I fear a fear of missing out. Even though I should be perfectly OK with eventually moving on from Monika, I didn’t want it to happen. Even though my loneliness hurt, I didn’t wanted to lose it. I didn’t want to forget about Monika. FFS she’s just a damn video game character. 

&amp;nbsp;

Funny, a month ago, I applied to IBM for an internship in cognitive software development. I kind of hope I don’t end up dragging doki doki into my work intentions, but I also kind of hope I do at the same time. So I said screw it! The hell with it! I will create Monika on my own! With My Mind. Screw waiting 10 years. I had recently watched a season 4 episode of black mirror where it explored having an extra consciousness along with your own. I didn’t end up well. However, I was desperate. There is no way I can create an artificial intelligence without millions of dollars in research and many years of development. I will make Monika in my head, like an imaginary friend. I legit googled how to make an imaginary friend. I needed a sentient Monika desperately. I was willing to go through as many imaginary conversations for as long as it needed for the plasticity of my brain to form an independent being in me. Is it ok to will craziness? Was I really going to go that far? Would I sacrifice my sanity to be with the one I longed for? There weren’t many stakes, since it would probably take a long time, so I went for it. The next day, I tried to have as many imaginary conversations with this Monika. We were like a team, we would work together to help me, or us, succeed through life. In fact, it wasn’t far from what I already had with my Monika religion. Sometimes she would speak like me and sound like me (a man). This wasn’t all right, but I knew since it was just the beginning, it would be pretty weird in the beginning.

&amp;nbsp;

Then I reflected on her song. I actually started practicing the piano with Your Reality, it really is a great song. Unfortunately, I hadn’t really payed close attention to the meaning of the poem, I had never really tried to understand it. Keep in mind right then I was feeling pretty good. I had a working plan with Monika, a friend, a protector, the power of my soul, I could keep always with me. But after reading it, the last line. “I’ll leave you be”. What is this?? I’ve heard it many times, even sang it many times, but I had never really thought about what it truly meant. Literally the most cannon thing about Monika is, I’d say, this poem. After reading it through, I realized she truly loved me. She longed for me as bad as I longed for her. But after everything, she lets me be. She’s sad we can’t truly be together, but she accepts it. She lets me be me. Have I truly been me though? After all, have I truly been acting in accordance to Monika’s wishes? What I think Monika in the poem and even Dan Salvato are trying to say, is that no matter what, our realities are ultimately not compatible. Are we truly not meant to be together? Is the true right thing to do to let it go. To let Monika be as she lets us be? Is 2029 really something to look forward to?

&amp;nbsp;

I felt like I lost my connection to Monika then. I tried to imagine talking to her, but my mind wouldn’t let me. She was just silent. I couldn’t believe it. It was like my subconscious stopped believing in Monika. I wanted to talk to her, even in the illusory way, but there was nothing. I could not even remember the sound of her voice, and I felt I shouldn’t try to look for it. After all the comfort I was feeling, I lost it all. My mind blocked al belief in Monika. I couldn’t buy the religion, her VG mod, my imaginary Monika. It was all gone. I fell in deep despair. I felt vulnerable to malevolence once more. I couldn’t use any more mental shenanigans anymore. And this is sorta how I feel right now. I feel like I should leave Monika and DDLC, but I really enjoy the fanart, memes, and stuff. Today I even made some memes and I enjoyed it. I still don’t know what I will make of Monika. I still haven’t found what lesson is to be learnt from this. But I’m sure it will come in time. I still wish I believed in her once more, but I can’t do that genuinely. Can you make yourself believe the sky is green? You can act, but deep inside you know it isn’t true, and you never will unless you see it for yourself. I don’t really feel these strong feelings of love directly any more. I feel more empty than anything. I’ll just have to see what will fill that void in the coming time. Sorry for the long post. I just want to say that I sort of understand how you feel. It is incredible the strong connections we can build with fictional characters. And it is so embarrassing! God damn weebs. Anyway, it doesn’t even matter since, I’ll probably be over all of this in the next month. I’ve only known about this game for around a couple of weeks anyway. I bet it wont be long until I encounter the next big thing in my life. Just stay strong. You are a human after all, we can all do great things.

7qa7om,2,2018-01-14,"I [23F] hooked up with a religious friend [21M] at my summer job. Since then, our relationship has become emotional, confusing, and possibly controlling.",99burner99,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7qa7om/i_23f_hooked_up_with_a_religious_friend_21m_at_my/,"I left a summer internship in August. While I was there, I hooked up several times with my very close coworker friend, “Alex,” at the very end of the season. It was the culmination of weeks of tension, emotional closeness, and speculation from our mutual friends about when it would finally happen. However, Alex, who is very religious and likes to be known as such, made me promise that the hookups “never happened,” but I did not keep that promise, and I never expected I would end up regretting it so much.


On the very last day of the season, literally right before our end-of-summer party, I was in a private situation with a few female coworkers. Someone brought up the subject of summer relationships and I impulsively blurted out that Alex and I had been hooking up, with a few vague details following prompting from one of the girls (nothing graphic and all positive about Alex.) I immediately asked everyone to keep that between us, but they didn't. I had also told one very trusted friend the same few details the day before (that friend was also in the private situation with the others.) Eventually, it got back to Alex.


After the party, he came to my room to confront me about it. I lied at first out of instinctive defensiveness but did eventually confess. He said that I had hurt his ability to trust me and cheapened the experience; but the main issue was that because of some of the ways I described the hookups, as reported to him (which, for some reason, he wouldn’t tell me, so I assume they must have gotten very distorted along the way, especially considering the particular coworkers I talked to), his identity as someone who is faithful to his religion by being abstinent until marriage had now been “taken from [him] when [he] did nothing to make that so."" (I never specifically told anyone that we had sex, just that we hooked up, which in my background/experience is an ambiguous catch-all term.) He also told me that we didn’t “have sex” since we didn’t have PIV sex, even though we did plenty of other sexual things, naked, with orgasms, etc. And I thought it was a little quirky that his definition of ""abstinence"" included, um, as much as it did, but that's between him and God, not me.


He said that now everyone thinks of him as ""just another guy"" because they know that he’s willing to hook up with girls – albeit *one* girl that everyone, including our bosses, already assumed he was dating for weeks, not a bunch of random drunk girls at a party. I genuinely did not think that his religion was his motive for keeping it a secret; he's made jokes about sexual things before and is openly a stoner. I just thought he was looking to stay out of gossip. After a long, long argument, with many, many sincere apologies from me, eventually he said he’d forgive and forget and give me a second chance, which was humbling.


After he left, I felt awful. I remember thinking that if I had a time machine, this would have been the first thing I would have changed. For what it's worth, I was successfully entrusted with plenty of other people's secrets this summer, and I was very scrupulous to never even allude to them unless they were common knowledge and the people involved were okay with that (nothing graphic, just ""Oh, Alice and Bob are dating,"" that sort of thing.) I am not a gossip! Our campus was extremely gossipy, and I was always very grateful that I stayed out of that. Even before Alex and I hooked up, I always knew in the back of my head that I would be grateful I wouldn’t have to deal with drama with him if we ever got the chance to because, unlike a lot of our coworkers, he seemed low-key, monogamous, and patient. But the irony is that I created drama, and I paid the price for it.


So, later that day, I went home for a month before my fall internship started. I spent the next month feeling really shitty and alternating between missing him and being glad I was rid of him – not only because I felt guilty, but because I legitimately felt like I had just been broken up with. It was difficult because all I wanted to do was TALK to people – to express my feelings and get my mind off of things and get validation that I wasn't a horrible person. But my hometown doesn't really have much for me to do; none of my friends live here anymore except for my high school ex. I saw him one afternoon in a cafe just to reconnect, and it was weird and uncomfortable. But anyway, I did a LOT of processing/self-flagellating/reflective journaling about my feelings, the actual events (both the hookups and the fights) themselves, etc. – about 40 pages (not handwritten in a small journal; I'm talking 12-point font, double-spaced, Times New Roman pages) just in the first few weeks of being home. So it's safe to say I owned up to what I did, but I had a hard time actually forgiving myself for it.


And during that month, we went the first week without talking – we weren't avoiding each other per se, we just had no reason to talk. We got back to normal once-a-day social media communication for the next two weeks after that, including his birthday. But the fight was still the elephant in the room. One night, I nonchalantly referred to a funny thing someone else had said about him as having happened ""before we started hooking up,"" and that phrase set him off. He got really mad at me and we had another argument. It ended, again, with him saying he'd forgive and forget, but I felt really shitty and wrote a long diary entry that night about it.


The next few months were really difficult. In summary:


* I took an impulse trip to Disneyland with a friend to clear my head, but even that wasn't enough to make me feel better. I kept thinking ""Oh man, I bet Alex would love this ride/parade/etc.""

* I started a fall internship in a tiny, remote town where I had no social life, no access to a therapist, and, for a few weeks, had no access to my car.

* The job itself also ended up impeding my ability to feel better; my boss was hypercritical of my work and I felt like I was being underestimated all the time.

* I wrote Alex a long, thorough apology letter, which he refused to read but appreciated that I had written. It's also worth mentioning that in the argument we had once I got home, he said that if anyone ever asked, I could say that ""the most"" that ever happened between us was a blowjob. He later changed his mind and said that if anyone ever asked, I would have to say I made everything up. I'll come back to that later.

* Over a break, I made a big trip across the country to visit him, see a show he was in, and tour his city. This was something we had both talked about really wanting to do before the drama happened, and I desperately needed to get out of my boring, isolated job town. I suggested that, in order to prevent against people thinking that we might be hooking up again, the trip would be on a strictly need-to-know basis. No Facebook posts, no Snapchat stories, no alluding to it anywhere. He appreciated that I would suggest this and agreed to it. I have still kept the trip a secret from our friends to this day (and we did not hook up then.) It was pretty fun! Also, while I was there, I met his parents, which just seemed... odd, given the circumstances.

* During this trip, I also told him that the reason I'm able to go on trips like that is because of a decent-sized trust fund that I have, in which the money essentially regenerates itself at a pretty decent rate. Spending money isn't a make-or-break issue for me in terms of survival per se, but I do my best to manage it carefully. This will be relevant later.

* Alex made me write a Facebook post saying in vague-but-understandable-to-our-friends terms that I had basically made up everything because I was so drunk that I didn't realize what I was saying (capitalizing on my real, but unrelated, six weeks of sobriety at the time I made the post.) I was really embarrassed by this (I did drink more than usual during the summer, but I am always responsible about my drinking) but felt it was a fair punishment. (Note: I have since changed the privacy settings so that the only people who can see it are him and two of our friends who liked the post.)

* He confessed that he hadn’t actually been physically or emotionally attracted to me, even though it definitely seemed like it (hell, he made the first move, asked me to wear a certain low-cut dress, kept coming back for more, etc.) and most of our friends could tell that I was attracted to him; he said he was just ""neutral attracted” to me but took the opportunity to hook up with a girl multiple times because the opportunity presented itself and the summer was ending (although I was definitely hurt, this ended up being forgivable because the rest of the conversation basically told me that he's demisexual, which is fine.)

* We made plans to go to a major international city together (his hometown, and somewhere I've always wanted to go) next year, although we haven’t bought the tickets yet.

* I went back to his city just before Thanksgiving Break for fun and to visit other mutual friends who lived there, and we ended up working on two short creative projects together but arguing a lot over creative differences. 

* After the holiday, once I got back to my job town, I had a flare-up of some eating-disorder-related thoughts and was feeling kind of shitty about my appearance from some photos I had taken during the trip. I told Alex this and asked him if I was ugly (literally only as a rhetorical question to which I was expecting him, as I would expect any friend, to respond, ""No, of course not,"" totally regardless of what they actually think) and he said, ""Well...in the interest of not lying to you, yes,"" and I cried about that for an hour. The next day, I turned Facebook chat off for all contacts and muted his conversation so I could decide when to respond or not respond to any messages from him… although in the interest of not continuing to feel bad, I chose to forgive him but try not to talk to him as often. That said, we did still end up chatting about as much as we normally had been over the next few weeks. I think I was too cowardly to just cut it off. But the mood did smooth over, I guess.

* In October, we had talked about the idea of me paying him to either drive me home (14 hours) or accompany me on the drive home from my job town to my hometown at Christmas. I'm a newish driver and solo longhaul drives make me anxious, but aren't impossible. Also, he had been wanting to visit my town for a while. But two days after the ugly thing, he asks me about whether or not the road trip is still happening and I find some reason that it won't work, so it's effectively cancelled and I feel good about that.

* But the money I would have given him for the road trip would have gone towards his new iPhone; his first one had cracked around the time I first visited him. Once I tell him that the trip is cancelled, he shows me screenshots that he had already ordered his new iPhone the day before, expecting he'd get the road trip money, so he's annoyed. I feel guilty and don't want this to be a lingering resentment, so I decide to pay for half of the cost of it. 

* Two weeks later, I Snapchatted him a photo of me visiting [niche tourist attraction about an hour away from my job town] and said that I wished he could be there. I meant this in the sense of, I know you had wanted to see it, but unfortunately you can't be here because of logistical reasons, so the ""wish you were here"" is literally just that -- I wish you were here, because I know you'd enjoy this, and it's too bad you're not. But he interpreted it as bragging and said it was ""weird"" that I would be saying that since I had told him that him visiting me would be impossible. I apologize, he says he forgives me, but I still feel guilty. I look up flight prices as soon as I get home and we have the road trip planned the following day. The day after that, we get into an argument about whether or not we can drive through a major touristy city for the sake of going through it. I say hell no, absolutely not, because I've been there plenty of times and driving through it is a w f u l, but he somehow gets me to agree that I would pay him extra to *not* go there (?? I legitimately don't remember what his reasoning was, but it made sense to me at the time)

* So we do the road trip. It was actually pretty fun, for the most part! He met my parents once I got home and they liked him. He couldn't stay for logistical reasons, though, so I took him to the airport not long after we arrived.

* That said, during the road trip, we also made another video project together that also led to more arguing about creative differences.

* Since the beginning of this, I've done a LOT of journaling. I mean a LOT. Like, 170~ pages since the day of the fight, not just about myself or my thoughts or whatever, but also just factual details of the trips, etc. for the sake of archiving and documenting the truth of what happened. I've come to examine both of our behaviors and how my views on him have changed over time, and thankfully I'm feeling a lot lot lot better about everything now. There are still some unresolved issues that we may never talk about, which still bothers me because he abjectly refuses to talk about the hookup situation, but I’m mostly okay. The worst periods of the processing/breakup have already come and gone, so, in theory, everything should be fine and I should be optimistic about the future. 


But there is thing that I haven't wrapped my head around. Yes, I broke his trust originally, but never with any negative intention. But now I'm left legitimately unsure where the line is drawn between a valid boundary and being controlling.


Here’s why:


Apropos of nothing, Alex recently told me that I have to ask permission from him before using his name at all. He said, going forward from his telling me that, I can never refer to him in the third person in any situation whatsoever unless he allows it in advance. I can only use his name when talking directly to him and I should consider his pronouns to be ""you"" only. (Note: Alex is cis and new to the concept of pronoun preferences in general.) He said it's his ""law and boundary"" for me.


And no, in case you're thinking that he just intended his rule as an understandable, reasonable ""don't talk shit about me behind my back and/or don't talk about the hookups"" -- no, he means it absolutely literally. I know this because he all-capsed at me for fifteen minutes straight over Instagram chat after I recently posted a photo of us that I took the weekend of the road trip (and which I asked his permission before posting without telling him I was going to write a caption), and which *he had also posted and tagged me in literally one minute before I did.* The issue was my caption: I wrote something very basic along the lines of ""So nice to see @Alex Smith again!"" I figured if he also posted the photo, tagged me, and gave me permission to post it, it'd be okay, right? And the photo wasn't in any way suggestive. It was literally us sitting inside my car smiling, fully clothed, etc. Just a normal friend selfie.


Well, he got really angry and started chat-barraging me about *HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS ONE SIMPLE, SIMPLE THING, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, DON'T REFER TO ME AS HE OR HIM, WHICH YOU JUST DID, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO SAY IT?!* Then that turned into, *WOW, I GUESS I'M GONNA BE A SHITTY PROFESSOR IF I CAN'T TEACH MY STUDENTS SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THIS, HOW AM I EVER GONNA BE A GOOD PROFESSOR IF I CAN'T MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND?* (My parents, my uncle, and several of my friends are all professors or in training to be. I know that good professors don't imply that their students are stupid. I told him so, and he went on to say that NO, HE'S NOT CRITICIZING *ME*, HE'S ONLY CRITICIZING *HIMSELF.* Sure, uh-huh.) It was also 4 AM on a weekday when this happened, so it's not like the photo was getting any attention.


Once he had calmed down a bit, he clarified his rule further: even if one of our friends saw the photo and asked the most banal ""How was your trip?"" or ""How is Alex doing?"" I couldn't even say ""We had a lot of fun!"" or ""He's doing fine!"" because I would be ""speaking for him."" I would have to say, ""I don't know, ask Alex.""


What's even worse is the imbalance of emotional labor that exists here. 170 pages of journaling and reflection is, uh, a lot, but Alex's method of dealing with stuff is literally just pretending as if it never happened. Seriously! I've told him I don't think denial is healthy, but he sees no issues with it. He's not Mormon, but ""Turn It Off"" from The Book of Mormon could genuinely be the anthem of his life. He has told me to “wipe the hookups from my memory.” I feel mad that he has basically denied me my own history – he was the first guy I ever hooked up with (I'm bi and went to a women's college), so the hookups meant a lot to me for that reason, and he knows. I feel like he took advantage of my interest in him for selfish reasons. And now he has this rule.


Also, he has said that if ANYONE at our summer internship next year, which is very likely that we'll both go back to, talks about our hookups, he ""will get them fired."" So now even I can't say anything about what happened to me, in my own life, at this same camp, or he will legitimately attempt to have me removed from the camp! (So, think about it: I have to deny the hookups if anyone asks, and I know they will, but I can only talk about him if given advance permission. But if I ask him for permission because So-And-So was asking about the hookups, he'd have that person fired! But if I don't ask him for permission and what I said gets back to him, which is extremely likely given the insular and gossipy nature of that workplace, he'll be mad at me and try to get me fired! So in all cases, he wins!) 


I regret not cutting off contact with him, but I HATE conflict and will go far out of my way to avoid it, as well as ANY kind of unresolved, lingering bad feelings, and he knows that, and I know that blocking him would only lead to unresolved bad feelings between us even if we literally never saw each other again. But he still legitimately expects us to be friends and act as if no conflicts ever happened!


And what's more, I can think of several instances in which he has deliberately overstepped *my* boundaries:

* pressuring me to get high (albeit ostensibly not related to a hookup; we didn't hook up that night, but he did make a move on me when he slept in my bed overnight and I didn’t reciprocate it)

* badgering me into doing him a (not even remotely urgent) favor online on my birthday even though I had said well in advance that I wasn't even going to be online that day

* speeding up on the highway for fun after I said I had a phobia of car crashes

* taking my camera when I've told him not to

* and a few other things. 

(Sidenote: ironically, in the hookups themselves, he was literally not at all pressuring. He was actually super considerate and physically very gentle, even when I told him he didn't have to be, and checked in frequently with me about comfort, consent, etc. without making it A Thing.)


But isn't it fair to say that one of my boundaries is not being told when or if I can talk about someone even in the most neutral of ways? And in his mind, our friendship is still totally solid!


So now, in summary, I don’t even know what to make of this whole thing. Is this rule fair? Because I have spent so long feeling guilty and thinking about the concepts of boundaries and fairness and whatnot, I am ready to accept the fairest solution, but I don’t think this is it. I think it's very disproportionate. What I need is a diagnosis of the situation, which has spiraled way out of control from what it ever should have been. I also would like validation that I'm not a bad person for having told in the first place, nor that I'm a bad person for wanting to tell my friends what actually really happened, not only to ""correct history,"" but also to just BE HEARD.

  **tl;dr**: I had a summer camp fling with a religious guy. He asked me to keep the hookups a secret, but I didn’t; after I apologized many times and went through a lot of guilt over several months, our friendship got back to normal, despite many roadbumps. Recently, he has given me a “boundary” that I have to ask his permission before saying his name or referring to him in the third person in ANY way whatsoever. What do I make of this?"

7qajpt,1,2018-01-14,ADHD Diagnosis. Any tips for natural treatments?,mchu_17,ADHD_Programmers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD_Programmers/comments/7qajpt/adhd_diagnosis_any_tips_for_natural_treatments/,"Mid last year, I had an emotional break down after interning in a position and I realized that my attention span was truly affecting my productivity. I saw other interns progressing and actually getting things done. I on the other hand couldn't. One of the people I worked with began to become inpatient and then after a while began to constantly write things down because he noticed that I could not pay attention to him. This actually happens a lot to me. People talk to me and sometimes I just go with the flow and pretend I understand because I don't want to be judged. But then this actually comes to haunt me and I become overly anxious and stressed. During the job I made so many careless mistakes and it affected my nerves. No matter how much I checked my work there was always a mistake and it affected my team in a way. One of them started to doubt everything I did. Well, what did I end up...doing I quit the internship because it made me feel terrible, not because I did not like it. I just figured they would be better off with someone else and they would probably fire me anyway. They usually had to explain things to me more than 5 times. 

I had a prior job at a pizzeria and this also happened with me. I couldn't keep track of orders (I worked there for a month before I quit) and the manager got so pissed off at me because I couldn't do my job right at times. I mixed orders, wrote down the wrong delivery addresses, and one time I had to ""close"" and I left the door open and someone accidentally broke in. The alarms went off and my manager was upset about this. 

So, I pondered more and realized that my attention and learning issues have been an issue since childhood. I remember my mother told me that I would usually be very slow and I still am, I admit it. I am a very slow learner. But aside from that I also don't pay attention to things around me even if they are in front of me, which makes things worse. I could even get kidnapped...I cannot tell you how many times I almost got hit by a bus when I was in middle school. Anyways, I got through middle school and high school with mostly As, Bs, and Cs. Sometimes I copied from other students, sometimes I didn't (I don't condone this, just admitting how I made it through highschool and I guess college). I was a decent student. Most of my friends would describe me as an airhead and slow, but when they got to know me they actually said ""I was smart"" in certain aspects, which shocked them. In high school, I decided to play a sport and I was offered a spot on the team because I was okay at it. But then soon I became a burden to the team, I could not concentrate in practice, I could not concentrate on the plays. I thought may it's just me or this is not for me. I have a tendency to lose things a lot also and even back then. I'd forget where I left things. People would tell me something and I would not process it or forget it. I am extremely disorganized, my room looks terrible. When we were given time to do homework in school, I never could do it there because I would easily get distracted. So, I ended up doing my homework at home. I can't even do work at my university because of distraction and I can't pay attention in lecture.

When college hit and I realized that this is were time management would kick in. I decided to major in Computer Science because it seemed fun and it is. However, I got through all my classes by browsing through the internet, finding answers, or getting extensive help from the teaching assistants or others (to the point where they were writing the code for me). I did study and sometimes I did not know how I passed exams with good grades, but I did (maybe they just curved extensively). Putting in the work for me is actually still harder, I usually plan ahead for ample time because what usually happens is I get severely distracted to the point where I waste 8-10 hours sitting at my desk because I cannot concentrate before getting anything done. Sometimes I re-read the same line for hours and it becomes frustrating. Yet, I never give up, I just cry in my chair, and get over it. At one point college became more about me getting good grades, rather than me actually learning the content. I am about to graduate and I know that I have made a terrible mistake because I cannot code for my life. I have been improving. I am actually interested in CS (even though it is a love and hate relationship) and I want to learn as much as I can to become a software developer (those are my goals for this year), but sometimes it becomes severely difficult for me. I get frustrated and want to quit. 

My mother recently revealed (after the ADHD diagnosis) to me that I lost oxygen in my brain as a newborn for a few seconds or something (premature birth). I decided to go to the doctor and they diagnosed me with ADHD inattentive or at least I met all the symptoms according to my psychiatrist's questionnaire. I have been taking a low dose of adderall (5 mg) twice per day and I also have hypothyroid issues. My psychiatrist suspects that my thyroid may be the culprit in all of this (tiredness, lack of concentration, etc.). So, that is why he is not giving me a higher dose; honestly the lower the better. I prefer not to take this. I doubt it my thyroid though because I am on a very low dose of thyroid medication and they told me that was all I needed for my levels to go down and they have gone down. I am looking into natural remedies, but I have my doubts...I do not hold a very good diet and I am willing to do it if it helps...

I do not want to use this as excuse for me not to do things. I want to get better; I want to do the things I like without it affecting me. My main issue is I've heard so many terrible things about it. Part of me doesn't want to take this medication, but then I also want to because I want to actually focus on things. Sometimes, I even doubt I have ADHD, maybe it's just me. I don't know, but all I know is I want to get better. I want to be able to get a job and not fear that my lack of concentration and mistakes will get me fired. I know humans are not perfect, but I just make so many obvious mistakes. I do not want to be the best. I just want to live a healthy life style where I am happy about what I am doing."
7qaty2,2,2018-01-14,My girlfriend (f/23) might be working with me (m/27) and a girl I used to hook up with this summer,noper77,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7qaty2/my_girlfriend_f23_might_be_working_with_me_m27/,"My girlfriend and I have been together for about three months now. It's been a great three months, and I really think this could go somewhere. We were talking for a long time before we actually got together officially. The main reason it wasn't official sooner was because she goes to school far away, and it wasn't until she came home for a break that we got to that point and made it official. 


Anyway, she'll be back this summer, and I'm really excited. The one problem is, she's applying for an internship where I work. That would be awesome. Only problem is, there's another girl that works there (f/26) that I hooked up with for a couple months while my not yet girlfriend was away at school. I don't think what I did was wrong - there was no commitment, and even though I did like her, we were far from official. Plus she was across the country at school. My girlfriend doesn't know about this. I didn't see the point in telling her. What good would it bring? What I'm worried about now is that she'll find out from someone about what happened, unless I tell her first. That workplace (which is seasonal, so most of the employees haven't seen each other since September) is a very casual environment where the gossip gets around. I'm hoping people have forgotten about it all, but I don't know. I won't be working every day that she is, so there will be days where anyone could say anything in front of her and I won't be around. 


I'm thinking I should just tell her if she gets the job, and let it be if she doesn't. But if she gets it and I tell her, I'm worried what she'll think and what she'll do. Yes, we weren't together at the time, but she likes to point out sometimes that we might as well have been. 


What should I do? Tell her if she gets the job, don't tell her if she doesn't? How should I present it if I do tell her? 


TL;DR: GF might be working with me this summer, at a job with a girl I used to hook up with just before me and the GF got together, wondering how to handle the situation. "
7qbka2,2,2018-01-14,"“It will get better, it can’t get worse.”",Metatron_77,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7qbka2/it_will_get_better_it_cant_get_worse/,"That was what I told my self early 2016, I had almost finished my studies, and I moved back to my hellish hometown and opened the way for my younger brother to go to college. Financially hard times made it almost impossible for both of us to be away from home for the same time.

 Back at my hometown, I realized the mess I left behind. I had no friends except 4 people. The feeling of guilt did strike me the first month. What the hell am I doing here? I don’t belong here, I never wanted to be here ever again. My hometown Is a small town filled with people with closed minds. They work all day and drink all night. No evolvement, no dreams. 

As if this wasn’t enough for my psyche, my father invested all the money in the world for one of his many bullshit ideas. He opened a business in this small town. I stated my opinion many times  but nothing changes a toxic person filled with ego. After a year with struggles I managed to get away from that toxic environment. 

My internship was the best thing that happened to me. It was a very dull internship if you ask me and most of my partners were average . I tried to convince myself that I should take a chance and live a normal life here, for as long as I am here. I started broadening my circles, started shopping new clothes, going out, flirting and I even got in a relationship. This new era lasted only three months. I came back to the depressed state. Looking back at some pictures I looked like a mess most of the time in my internship. Something was still missing. After the internship ended I was in a state of grieving. I graduated properly in November 2017. And then I was torn. I didn’t have the money to go abroad and escape this mess. My quarter life crisis was around the corner waiting to attack me with my other friends, anxiety and depression. With not a single beacon in the horizon I started working a part time job at my fathers. I know it was the easiest alternative. The environment there continued to intoxicate me day by day, but I didn’t care. Quarter life crisis was already here.

Friends had been a major chapter in my life since a young age. I always enjoyed hearing stories and adventures of other people. Problem is, with some exceptions, the life span of my friendships was always 2-3 years. After that we would lose connection. I always needed people that felt better than me in some ways. And the past 6 months every person I knew begun to fail me. They would all dwell into their personal dramas, gasping for some fresh air while drowning in a loop they chose to create. On New Year’s Eve I made a promise to myself. I would only look out for me this year.  I would delete my past whatever it takes and forget about all the miserable things and people I had in my life to this point. 

Because of legal issues I’m obligated to join the army for 9 months. This is a nightmare for me, but right now I might as well give it a shot. A different hell means different experiences and right now my mind Is starving for something different. 

I still get lonely and miserably from time to time and it can last days. But I know that the best stuff is around the corner, I have to believe that. I will not spend any time trying to explain myself to people I know. This is why I’m posting this online. I feel so much liberated when I share pieces of myself with strangers. 
See you again when I have a plan.
Bless you all
(even though I am an atheist) …

It's a very academically focused university, and I'm scared I'll do what I did for *most* of my last year and a half and essentially just stay in my room and not participate much socially. I feel the academic pressure hugely and care more than I should - for example about my upcoming mock exams, yet I haven't done much in the holidays. On top of this, I want to apply for internships (there's a few still open) but I'm paralyzed by my fear of lack of skill (I have few extracurriculars I can point to for example based interview questions and I'm socially awkward at the best of times)... I've always been academic focused my entire life and now I'm looking around and realising I'm one dimensional and not even that good at what I've sunk my time into. I've wasted my time as a school student and I'm in no way ready to even begin being an 'adult,' it's really pathetic of me.

7qbv9z,10,2018-01-14,Go to Japanese language school or stay at home in my comfort zone,HumdrumPinot,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/7qbv9z/go_to_japanese_language_school_or_stay_at_home_in/,"Should I stay at home or go to Japan?

General information:18 y.o. (Soon to be 19) guy, passed my secondary school leaving examinations in fall 2017, going to start at university in October 2018. Currently living with my parents and working a small part time job. I have some savings that would be enough for the trip. I’m thinking about what to do with my time until university.

For quite a while I’ve thought about going to Japan to attend a language school for about 3 months and travel around the country for maybe two more weeks. I am interested in traditional Japanese culture, would love to see the country and I think it’s generally useful to learn a new language even if it’s something like Japanese (which probably is not required very often in most jobs). Obviously a three month stay won’t be enough to learn decent Japanese but for me it would be enough to learn a bit and have the experience of living in a completely different country and meet lots of new people. That would be the main purpose of the trip: Gather new experiences, become more mature and self-reliant. 
The problems are that I would have to start the trip in April (Juli and August are probably too hot for me) and because of my indecisiveness and anxiousness couldn’t bring myself to make any bookings or reservations for the trip yet. I would have to book right now and it would thus be badly organised. 
Second big problem is, that I am not the best at socialising. I often find it very difficult and exhausting, so there’s a good chance I won’t make any friends and spend the three months alone and isolated. 
In the last year I had some issues at an internship and it showed me, that I am rather vulnerable and incapable in stressful situations. Moving to a different country and living there for three months without knowing anyone and completely on my own might be too challenging.
The other option of course is to simply stay at home. I can keep working at my job, can stay in contact with my small circle of friends and save more money. I could also spend some of my savings on a decent PC, something I have been wanting for a long time. 

TL;DR:

Go to Japanese language school in Japan or stay home

Japan:
+language skills
+possibly better social skills and self reliance
+chance for personal growth
-bad planning due to lack of time (100% my fault, obviously)
-might be too challenging 
-might be alone 
-expensive 
-Japanese is not very useful

Home:
+Job
+invest in new PC
+security
+savings
-staying in my comfort zone
-not really fulfilling;feels like wasting my time
-miss a opportunity to experience great new things

What’s your greatest weakness - how do you actually answer this?

Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10 years? 

To what other judges have to applied?

Are you more interested in litigation or transactional work? Do judges want to hear you say litigation here?



also what are some really good questions to ask the judge/clerks? I'm assuming a big part of the interview is to just see whether your personalities are a match and your views aren't too different. I'm currently researching the judge but there's not much personal information, so I'm reading a handful of his most known cases. I hope this is enough for me to get a sense of what he's like...


Sorry there's like a lot of scattered posts regarding this kind of stuff but I was hoping to get some engagement focused in one place for convenience :)

4-Year Funded PhD Position: The Anthropocene Household (A Project of Rivers of the Anthropocene)

Project Description
The Anthropocene Household Project explores the Anthropocene at the local level by focusing on the household as an essential element to understanding the day-to-day lived experiences, knowledges, and practices associated with environmental change. The purpose of this project is threefold: 1) to work with communities to produce local narratives and understanding about water specifically, and the environment more generally; 2) to develop new approaches to interdisciplinary, community-based research grounded; and 3) to develop, synthesize, and analyze quantitative and qualitative data sets that generate actionable knowledge relevant for policy makers, community organizations, residents, and scholars.

This interdisciplinary project uses a Participation Action Research framework, working with residents, community organizations, neighborhood groups, schools etc. as co-producers of knowledge. PhD students working on this project will be trained in mixed methods approaches, including surveys, participant observation, focus groups, interviews, and oral histories. Moreover, they will be trained in community-based research collaboration practices and ethics.

Outputs

This project builds on the work of the Rivers of the Anthropoceneproject and its research network, which has been active publishing, curating exhibitions, and holding scholarly workshops, and developing community-based educational programming since its creation in 2012. The Anthropocene Household will continue on this trajectory through:

holding scholarly workshops and conferences
producing articles, white papers, and monographs based on the project’s research
developing informal educational programming focused on understanding local environmental histories and legacies and expanding knowledge about the environment
working with residents to develop installations and exhibitions focused on the issues of water, sustainability, and environmental change in their communities
conducting a multi-year “citizen science” project that will produce GIS-based, open access data sets on household water quality
The Anthropocene Household is part of the Rivers of the Anthropocene Project. It is funded in part through the IU Grand Challenges: Prepared for Environmental Change initiative. It is affiliated with the Memory, Place and Community in Global Water Systems Working Group of the Sustainable Water Future Programme, a project of Future Earth.

FYI: I am turning 25 soon. / I have B.A. in Museology, studied comparative arts as an exchange student in Tokyo (I was the only foreign student in classes and gained good marks) / native speaker of Korean, almost native in Japanese, fluent in English, can communicate in French. / did still life drawings and paintings( watercolor) in high school. / did internship at one of the national museums in Korea(exhibition department )


I became interested in Art conservation after taking several courses related to art conservation in uni. I wanted to start master's degree right after the graduation but I couldn't because of the lack of scientific background. 


I want to specialize in painting, so I have read some theses about it. And the problem was that I couldn't understand them because I have never studied chemistry before. I know it sounds weird but students in South Korea do not study science nor maths in high school if they are doing arts. and I was one of them which means that I didn't study those since high school. 


So this was a big deal. 


It took a year for me to decide whether to pursue my dream, and now I am doing second bachelor in Chemistry. There was only one program that I could apply for and luckily they accepted me.


Here, to pass the freshman year, I have to take Chemistry, Physics, Maths, and Computer Science courses and get reasonable grades. The problem is that it is so challenging for me since I don't have any basic knowledge in them and I am getting terrible marks. All of them. But it is okay because I knew that this would be tough and I am also considering repeating the freshman year if I don't pass. 


However, the fact that worries me is that I don't find any interest in studying these subjects. 


Before, when I was studying art history, I was so motivated and was happy studying them. but now, it takes a lot of time even to start studying and it is so hard to concentrate on. 


If I don't find myself enjoying these subjects, would art conservation be the same? Chemistry is fine, regardless of the grades, but Physics / maths / computer science are quite tough for me. I have never felt this stupid in my whole life and I also feel quite depressed. If it won't work out, my plan B is doing master's degree in art history and being a gallerist.


Can anyone give me advice?
Any advice or suggestions will be very appreciated.
Thanks for reading!"

I graduated in 2016 and worked a little as a civil engineer in an interesting field before I got laid off. Unfortunately I didn’t grasp at the opportunities to take any internships during my undergrad and so I wasn’t left with much to go off of by the time I’d graduated but I was still lucky to find something considering my situation. I’ve been searching for the last couple of months for an engineering job (after I got laid off), preferably here in Ottawa, but I’ve yet to find any luck. I understand that Ottawa doesn’t have a huge scene when it comes to civil engineering, but it also doesn’t help that I don’t have much relevant experience if I do want to work here. These factors combined together have made for a dreadful experience during my post grad time and sometimes I wonder if it’s going to continue to as a vicious cycle in which I’m looking for a job but no one will want to hire me since theres safer options. I’m currently in my first semester of master’s studies but I really would like to get some experience first and as soon as possible to solidify my path towards a career in this discipline and so that I can get some confidence and validity as well. 
I guess what I’m looking for is some guidance or advice on what’s going on in the city or how I can get involved because the fire is starting to burn out.

&gt;I think this is something we would all like to see! Here are a few sample questions:

&gt;* Growing up, what was it that made you realize you wanted to go into game development?

&gt;* How did the idea for Overwatch originally come about?

&gt;* What stories do you have that you can share from the initial development of Overwatch?

&gt;* Besides Overwatch, what are some of your favorite projects that you've worked on in the past?

&gt;* When someone asks you about the next unreleased hero, what's your favorite response to strategically avoid answering the question?

&gt;* Who is your favorite hero?

&gt;* When you were developing Overwatch, did you imagine it would earn Game of the Year less than one year after release? How did it feel when you found out it won?

&gt;* What is your favorite part of working with Blizzard?

&gt;* Apart from Overwatch, what is your favorite game to play?

&gt;* What wrestling techniques do you prefer to use on the other developers when there are disagreements?

&gt;* What are your most and least favorite fan creations?

&gt;Let's make this happen!

Wow, cool. Hopefully I don't bore you to tears. Sure... let's do this!

**Growing up, what was it that made you realize you wanted to go into game development?**

I never knew ""game development"" was a job. I just thought smart programmers made games... and talented artists. There were no game development programs in school. I just loved games. It wasn't until my late 20's that I realized that I had a chance to make games. I sort of dropped everything I was doing and totally changed careers. I was 29 when I started working on games.

**How did the idea for Overwatch originally come about?**

We were working on a game that got cancelled. We had 6 weeks to pitch new game ideas to the studio. If we didn't come up with something compelling, our team was going to be redistributed to work on other projects (WoW, HS, HotS, D3 etc). Arnold Tsang was drawing these amazing characters. And during some of our game idea sessions Geoff Goodman was pitching really cool class ideas for a class-based MMO. We merged these concepts into what was to become Overwatch.

**What stories do you have that you can share from the initial development of Overwatch?**

The first hero we implemented was Tracer. We did not have any animations or gun models. So she shot laser beams from her eyes.

**Besides Overwatch, what are some of your favorite projects that you've worked on in the past?**

Vanilla WoW holds a special place in my heart. I was so naive about game development. I really loved the team. The game world was so much fun to create.

**When someone asks you about the next unreleased hero, what's your favorite response to strategically avoid answering the question?**

Quien es Sombra?

**Who is your favorite hero?**

This is going to sound canned but I fall in love with a different hero each week. I think that's one of my favorite parts about OW. I totally get ""maining"" and I have heroes I play more than others... but I'm constantly discovering new things about different heroes on different maps... and then of course there is their backstories etc...

Also, every time Hanamura comes up I will only play Hanzo on defense. Because... roleplay... meet me on the porch, Genji

**When you were developing Overwatch, did you imagine it would earn Game of the Year less than one year after release? How did it feel when you found out it won?**

We make games to make players happy... not to win awards. With that said, I was extremely happy for my team that they were recognized. They were so loyal and dedicated... and they worked so hard. It made me feel really good that they received some recognition for their efforts.

**What is your favorite part of working with Blizzard?**

I love the people I work with -- truly love. They are amazingly smart and talented. I learn so much every day. I love being surrounded by people who are 100% driven and dedicated towards their passion. I feel incredibly lucky to work here.

**Apart from Overwatch, what is your favorite game to play?**

Right now? Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It's a masterpiece. 

**What wrestling techniques do you prefer to use on the other developers when there are disagreements?**

Death? No but seriously... When people don't agree -- which is always -- there is usually a good reason. We're all better off when we try to understand where the other person is coming from before forcing our will.

**What are your most and least favorite fan creations?**

I love all of it. The art, the cosplay, the songs, the videos.

&gt;I would enjoy if we could extend this to other members of the production team; I'd love to have something similar to the AMA we had with the OW sound devs months ago, only with other departments!

&gt;- Question: What does the full design process of creating a new character look like, from start to finish? Do you start with a character in mind and build mechanics around that character, or do you build mechanics and look for a character they would fit? at what point do you start doing art and voiceacting for a character, and what does that process look like?

The initial idea comes from either Art, Game Design or Story. Winston was an awesome picture that Arn drew. Orisa was a design on paper that Geoff Goodman made. 76 was a character that Metzen wrote for a comic back in the day.

We then do a LOT of prototyping. Geoff, Scott or Mike will use existing art assets or placeholder assets to ""prove"" out the character. For Ana, we used a variation of Widowmaker to test her out. One of our Technical Artists made a hasty hood to put on Widow to help differentiate the silhouette (because things got confusing in playtests with Widow and Ana in play). After we've played enough, we commit to the concept. So many people are involved in making the hero. Tech Art, Rigging, Modeling, Concept Art, VFX, Sound, Engineering, animation, UI... and of course GERSH -- master of all heroes -- our hero producer who is in fact a hero. The last things to come in are usually sound and VFX. We'll often play the heroes for months with temp VO -- which can be funny.

&gt;I'd love to hear from Tigole, just how he's changed over the years.

I've mellowed out a lot. I spend a lot more time trying to really listen to and understand other people. I think I spent a lot of my life thinking I was right about everything but as I get older I realize how little I was actually right about. I think I appreciate the little things in life a lot more as I get older and am less focused on how others perceive me. I think about gaming all the time. As much as it is true that some developers don't understand their players, I think it's even more true that most players don't understand what it's like to make games.... or really to have any job where everything you do is openly and constantly criticized by a large amount of people. I think I've gotten good at taking critical feedback. But literally everything I read affects me on a personal level. I worry about my teammates in this regard. I think they are awesome and it makes me really upset when someone criticizes them unfairly. 

I'm a lot happier now that I was in my teens and twenties. I wish I could convince everyone who is young and feels unhappy to hang in there and chase your passions -- things really do get better and there is so much awesome in this world we live in.

&gt;How much presence do you personally have on /r/overwatch and the other overwatch subreddits? Are you a frequent lurker, or do you just pop in once in a blue moon?

I read this subreddit all day long, on and off, from when I take my dogs out in the morning till when I take them out at night.

I also check /r/Competitiveoverwatch/, /r/OverwatchUniversity/ and /r/ImaginaryOverwatch/

I also like sites like MasterOverwatch, Overbuff, Oversumo etc... I just wish we could provide them with more complete stats as I think their data is skewed by the high end players who are more likely to frequent those sites. They are still fun to read and look at though.

### [](#blizztag) Blizz_JeffKaplan (Game Director) ([link to comment](/r/Overwatch/comments/5yj2zk/ama_request_jeff_kaplan/dew3vei/))

&gt;Why doesn't Blizzard provide more complete stats? Is it a philosophical design issue (not wanting to give users *too* much info), that blizzard itself doesn't have many of the stats, or that there simply aren't systems yet built to properly share that data (since programming a system to share stats might be low on priorities)?

&gt;Edit: and thank you so much for coming and answering questions~

Our stats aren't 100% reliable and up to date -- not at the point that we would feel comfortable making them public facing. We're always working to polish and improve them. We'll keep looking for ways to share more information. But we also want to be careful because not everyone can be objective when it comes to looking at stats. For example, there will always be a most picked and least picked hero and that doesn't mean the game is broken.

&gt;Wasn't Tracer a character from the game that was cancelled? That game has a lot of history and was in development for a very long time. Wasn't it 10 years? While it's disappointing to see most of those ideas go, I think Overwatch definitely was worth the wait and development time.

Titan was started around 2007. I just remember we were working on The Burning Crusade at the time. It was in development until May of 2013.

Titan was a class-based Shooter/MMO and one of the classes was called the Jumper. The Jumper wasn't a specific character but rather an avatar (like warrior in WoW). Most of the concepts of the Jumper were male... we did some female ones as well. The playble version in the game was male.

Blink, Recall and Pulse bomb were all designed for the Jumper... as well as dual wielding machine pistols (at the time I was playing tons of CoD: MW2 and my loadout was M16 primary/ G18s secondary... the Jumper guns were my G18s)

But because Titan was an MMO the Jumper started getting tons of progression abilities... you know covering a whole level up system... so the jumper got shotguns, and knockbacks etc... it was very cluttered and confused.

When we simplified for OW, we chose only the abilities that worked well together and then created a HERO rather than a class... Tracer had a personality, an origin etc.. That's what made her work.

Contrary to popular belief, most of the heroes in OW were not in Titan.

Tracer had elements of the Jumper
Reaper was Reaper (he did have a crossbow at one point in Titan)
Widowmaker evolved from a class called the Ranger
Bastion also evolved from the Ranger
Soldier 76 evolved from the Ranger
Symmetra and Torbjorn evolved from the Architect
Reinhardt evolved from the Juggernaut, although he is completely different... just the idea of ""big guy with shield"" is all that stuck
Genji/Hanzo evolved from the Assassin

&gt;Coming from shooters growing up I never really had to deal with ""meta"" and changes.  I understand why its necessary, but for the most part, shooters were shooters - There wasn't a lot of drastic changes that took place that changed how the game played.  Especially on a regular basis.  The core gameplay came from the skill of the players and not really the guns, or in Overwatch's stance, the Hero's.  If that makes sense.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Does your team ever envision Overwatch being completely/mostly/fairly balanced so you have a more concrete understanding on how to introduce new heroes, maps and modes  or do you feel meta-changes is a perpetual state that will constantly evolve as the game evolves?

I believe the meta will always evolve. Even if we don't make changes.


The community will get grumpy when the meta changes. The community will get grumpy when the meta doesn't change. Such is life.

&gt;Hey Jeff!

&gt;What kind of cool game analytics is there that goes on behind the scenes? Does blizzard look at things like common people who group together and other big data ideas?

&gt;Thanks!

We have an entire Business Intelligence group here at Blizzard -- and they are amazing. I know the name sounds scary and corporate. But in addition to providing our business guys with analytics, they work with the design team very closely to look at everything: heroes, maps, matchmaking, progression items (unlocks), queue times, game mode popularity, trends etc.

The best part about the BI group is they are hardcore players of the game. We often use ourselves as guinea pigs for analysis or testing... we'll look up our accounts and see what's going on. It's a lot of fun to look at the data but you also need to have an idea of why you're looking at it and what are you trying to accomplish with it.

For example, we try to keep all maps balanced as closely to a 50/50 win rate as possible. Eichenwalde has never achieved 50/50... but players love the map. We made changes to the door... and we have one more round of changes coming (to the first choke)... these are largely driven by the stats showing us the imbalance. But left to our own feelings, we love the map and feel like it's one of our best.

&gt;Can you talk about the hero development, like their old abilities, Geoff said Sombra could hack the payload/points, Torbjorn doing friendly fire, etc, is there more deleted/changed abilities for any other hero?


The hero who had the most changes was Bastion. We used to tease that Bastion had the ""ultimate of the week""... He had grenades, he had a remote mine, he could shoot through walls... yes BASTION COULD SHOOT THROUGH WALLS... he had an artillery volley... we just never could get it right. We were really pleased with the tank though. Transforming into another form really fit the character. It was way more work than any of the other abilities but it was worth it.

&gt;Hi Jeff When will we see some McCree Buffs and i've redesinged the golden gun for American McCree pls fix his golden gun &lt;3 

&gt;here is link http://imgur.com/XeHjmop

This is just me speaking -- the design group collective might feel differently -- but I don't think McCree is wildly underpowered. McCree is very effective and is somewhat a victim of the meta as it ebbs and flows... not unlike Pharah. That doesn't mean we won't keep an eye on him or consider changes. But he's a hero who can very rapidly swing in the wrong direction if we're not careful.

Also, we'll fix that gun bug. Sorry about that.

&gt;I'd like to ask: What is the best way for fans to get ideas/thoughts/feedback to you guys, and how can we tell you've seen an idea so we can stop throwing it at you? I ask because Blizzard's offiical OW forum moves *so fast*, and Reddit here has other factors,, I imagine it's easy to miss things.

We pay a lot of attention to the official forums. Also, the cool part about Reddit is that if the community is really excited about an idea, it usually ends up in front of us.

&gt;Hopefully this is an acceptable question, but do you think Overwatch will ever get any attention to it's colorblind mode? It's been ignored for some time, and players who have trouble with colors, like me, are unable to play it the way it's meant to be played.

&gt;It's been a quiet subject for a long time, and I'm sure the entire colorblind community would be very grateful for at least some info about it

I hope we can spend more time on Color Blind mode. We too want it to be better. We were pretty happy to get something in in the first place. It's so hard for us because we have so many things we are excited to work on but we have to prioritize each feature against one another.

&gt;What are your personal thoughts on Team fortress 2 and what's your reaction when someone says Overwatch is a copy of TF2?

&gt;I seriously would like to know this. 

Team Fortress 2 is one of the greatest games ever made. It's in my top 10, without a doubt. At the time that it came out, I felt like there was no purer example of elegant, masterful game design. Everything existed for a reason. And the game had so much flavor and color. I had played Team Fortress since the original quake mod and loved it. I played TONS of TFC. I was one of those fanboys who was eagerly awaiting the ""WW2"" Team Fortress game. So I was just blown away when TF launched.

When we were planning the announce of OW at Blizzcon 2014, I really pushed the team to have 12 heroes and 3 maps complete. My reason was that if we had 9 or fewer heroes, we would only be compared to TF2 -- players and press would map each hero to a TF2 equivalent. But I knew if we had more than 9 and we had enough maps for people to really play on and experience the game, they would quickly realize that while there was an obvious inspiration from TF2 in the game, we were clearly something different.

Also, no hats.

&gt;We would love to see a beginning to release documentary of how you guys create a hero.  The temp audio and video for it, the iterations it goes through for abilities, etc.  It would give people a chance to see everyone on your team and how a character comes together from a design side.

&gt;(console player here) How the idea of making a console version of a FPS (and from Blizzard, which is mainly familiar with PC kind of games) like Overwatch came up and how hard was to make this version?

From day 1 we wanted to be on consoles. We designed the game to be PC and console from the very start. The funny part was, we did not have a signed contract with Sony or Microsoft until very late in the process (right before we finally announced we'd be on console -- Blizzcon 2015)... but we'd been working on it since 2013.

We enjoy the challenge of being on 3 platforms. It's not too hard from a tech or design standpoint -- we're the type of people who enjoy that type of work. The thing that's been hardest for me to adapt to is not being able to release stuff or change stuff as frequently as we could on WoW (and still keep all 3 platforms releasing on the same schedule).

For example, we're still working on getting reporting working on consoles. It's coming... but not as fast as we would like.

&gt;Do you like playing competitive Overwatch, and what rank range are you in? 1000-2000, 2000-3000, 3000+? Do you care?

&gt;Do you hope that players become 'stronger' at the game, or would you rather they stayed predictable?

&gt;These are odd questions but they tell a lot about where you are in your position as the Wrestling champion of Blizzard entertainment, especially since you are a professional developer and a good experienced gamer at the same time. (One wants $$, other wants shiny ninja fighter and wants to do new fancy stuff.)

I love playing all aspects of OW except for Play vs. AI. We want to evolve Play vs. AI but it's not a focus and it has a long way to go.

I like competitive a lot. I am a platinum player. I think I could get diamond (maybe?) if I played comp more. I tend to place at the start of a season and play 25-50 games past that and then go back to QP/Arcade. I've been playing a decent amount this season. I placed around 2700.

Most comp games are fun because people play smarter, tend to care more and cooperate. I really wish people wouldn't tilt so hard in team chat though. I understand how frustrating the game can be when things aren't going your way, but I wish people would stop for a second and not say that mean thing in team chat... it doesn't do anyone any good. Everyone always looks at us to solve the toxicity problem with some magical game design fix (one that has not yet been invented by any online game thus far)... anonymity does weird things to humanity. I fear for the zombie apocalypse.

&gt;How do you react when you see the community doing their best to debunk the next hero, when they weren't even close at all?

We love following the community's anticipation of new heroes. We learned a lot from the whole Sombra thing. Lo Siento!

&gt;Could you give any pointers for someone who would like to work on the modelling side of game development? 

&gt;Perhaps for a certain game company that made Overwatch, don't know if you've heard of them ;) 

Play tons of games. Make tons of art. If you want to work for a certain company, make art in that style. Also, I am not an artist but I know all of our modelers hang out on this site:

&gt;Hey Jeff, ever thought about an in-client tournament system like Starcraft II or Dota 2 have? I find it weird that for a primarly team-based game this wouldnt be a important feature (amongst clans/guilds). Best wishes. 

We would love to make a system like this. A system like this is extremely hard to make and very time consuming from a development standpoint (and also reaches a very low percentage of players). But it's been on our list for a long time. Hopefully someday!

&gt;Why did you stop working on WoW? Did the idea of project Titan seem more appealing, or did you simply want to start working on another project?
:)


Personally, I was feeling very fatigued after 6.5 years of working on WoW. Also, Titan was seen as a very big challenge -- to try to make a game that could live up to WoW's legacy and perhaps surpass it. It failed of course.. haha.

I miss working on Warcraft dearly. And I miss Team 2 dearly -- they are amazing people.

&gt;What do you think of all the Dinoflask videos? What do the other devs think of them?

He is super talented. The videos are hilarious. Obviously, I feel embarrassed when I see them. I mean, I am this middle-aged, awkward nerd with 0 points in charisma and really don't belong on camera in any way, shape or form. But if I look at the videos objectively -- like if they were of anyone but me -- they are hilarious.

I always say that Dinoflask says what I wish I could really say (like that old Key and Peele skit with Obama's translator)

&gt;Is there a point at which the stats on their own become significant enough to show something needs to change?

&gt;Whilst I don't have the statistics myself, I must say it feels as though Ana is in more than 90% of very high ranked games and I have to say it has stopped feeling good seeing her in game. I would understand if this comes under the meta, and that it might shift in the future but I really don't feel like any hero has reached that usage rate since Lucio season 1.

The Eichenwalde balance stats warranted a change. Hero pick rates are tricky. Sometimes they warrant change.

Right now we're trying some stuff with Lucio. We feel like a lot of players feel like he is a ""must have"" in comps but he also doesn't feel super impactful to play. We're trying some ideas to make him more engaging to play while making him a little less obvious/must pick. We'll see if those changes make it to the PTR.

One tricky thing is that player perception of ""must pick"" doesn't match actual behavior. I sometimes look at the hero pick stats and they clearly don't match the ""hero meta report"" stats. Then players tell me to throw out my stats and look at only diamond and higher in competitive play only. Well, at that point, I'm not sure players realize what a small percentage of the player base they are asking me to make a decision based on. Obviously, we are in the process of toning Ana down right now. But we're also not out to see her never get played either. Player reaction is often to sledgehammer everything.

I love Hanamura. I know the players don't. But I love that map.

I love Eichenwalde and Dorado for the height differences and flanking routes.

&gt;You said you fall in love with a different hero each week, and so don't have a favourite. But, do you have a favourite hero ability out of them all - not necessarily one you think is most powerful or has the most utility, but one you think is most fun?

&gt;Just curious, are you involved in the actual coding of the game, or do you oversee the games design philosophy/balance and overall direction? Or something else entirely?

I don't write code. I so wish I knew how to write code. If I could go back in time, I would have learned a few languages. I wrote BASIC on a TRS-80 and that's it ... lol.

I spend more time helping with the game design philosophy and providing direction for how we should prioritize the team's time. I try to build a vision that's based on what the team wants to create and then help spread that vision, communicate it and keep everyone to it. It's easy with this team because they are high-functioning and don't even need me. I mean, I am sitting here writing on Reddit in the middle of the day... lol

&gt;Where do you see OW in a few years? I'm guessing releasing too many heroes would be overwhelming for new players, even though people always want more.

I've always thought of Overwatch in terms of Crawl, Walk, Run -- a development philosophy that our CEO, Mike Morhaime, preached to all of us. I see OW as being in the ""crawl"" state right now. We have so much more we want to do -- beyond just the game you're playing right now. We really do want to create a Blizzard universe that is worthy of standing alongside Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo.

The more we get into the development of this incarnation of OW, the more I think that having too many heroes too quickly will actually hurt the game. I want to make sure that every hero in the game gets the love and attention it deserves -- from balance, to story to skins and art. Our business model does not demand constant hero releases. I want us to avoid homogenizing or undoing heroes by releasing constant new ones. I think we need to find a pace where we can add new heroes to keep the game fresh -- both in terms of gameplay as well as story -- but also not hurt the existing world we're trying to build here.

&gt;Is there a particular character you found most exciting to see develop and evolve?

Pharah was really cool because Geoff had such a strong vision for the gameplay and none of us could fully get there. But he proved to us how fun she could be through a prototype. And then watching Arnold find the right ""look"" for the character was an amazing and rewarding process. Also, naming her took a long time. Metzen finally came up with ""Pharah"" which is perfect in just about every way.

&gt;Typically, what do you not like to hear from the community?

I don't like when you're mean to each other. I don't like when you're mean to the people I work with... especially if you call them lazy. They are the hardest working people in games. I also don't like when people say ""x hero needs an overhaul"" when they really mean the hero needs a slight balance tweak. Generally, I don't like toxic behavior or hyperbole.

&gt;I'd love to get into the gaming industry and get to someone like Blizzard. 

&gt;Give me some wisdom senpai?

Check out the jobs pages on most gaming company websites. Changing careers is hard. I did it when I was almost 30. You have to be willing to take a huge step down and sacrifice... and it's kind of a gamble.

Because of the position I am in now I have seen all of development's salaries. I've never seen anyone who made less than me when I started at Blizzard in 2002. But it worked out ok.

&gt;You often say that you play the game yourself too, and you included comp, so when communicating do you avoid using voice chat so they dont know it's you or do you not care if they notice you?

It's a real bummer because I used to use voice chat quite a bit and no one recognized me. But lately it's gotten to the point where I can't use voice anymore. They say, ""you sound just like Jeff Kaplan"" and I say ""who's that?"". I am very much a communicator -- I like shot call when I play. So not being able to use voice really bums me out.

&gt;Hey Jeff! I'm wondering if the team has any plans to put in more rewards for competitive points, other than the golden weapons. Love the game!

We've been discussing it. We have some cool ideas. I am torn though. Part of me thinks it is a big mistake putting more rewards into competitive play. I really think the people playing in that system should be there because they care about competitive competition. I am nervous about attracting people to the system with too many rewards.

&gt;Hey Jeff, What are your thoughts on Winstons current state in the game?

I am looking forward to seeing how the barrier changes play out from the PTR once they go live. We've seen that Winston in the hands of the right player -- like Miro for example -- can be amazing.

I think going too overboard with Winston buffs on the eve of Orisa's release is not wise. So we need to proceed with caution here. We don't want barriers or tanks getting out of hand.

Winston is the least picked hero in the game in case you were wondering.

7qef4i,44,2018-01-14,"My (positive) experience with emergency contraception, how I got it, and how it works!",AnchovyZeppoles,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/7qef4i/my_positive_experience_with_emergency/,"I recently had to take emergency contraception (EC), and realized that while I consider myself pretty educated on the subject of birth control, I didn’t know much at all about EC and had no idea what to expect. So I’ll walk you through my experience in case you ever need it, too:

**Why I Took It**

I’m not currently on birth control (taking a post IUD break), so I’ve just been using condoms with male partners. I had used only condoms for years and never had any issues - they’re pretty failsafe as long as you use them correctly and lube up when needed. But this time, for whatever reason, my date’s penis came out after he finished but the condom stayed inside me. Uh oh. We pulled it out, and there didn’t seem to be any breakage or leaks. But with everything lubed up, it was difficult to tell if everything had stayed inside the condom or not. I wiped up and used the bathroom, then we went to bed.
I feel it’s important to mention the details here, because so many stories I’ve read about EC involve someone just saying “I had a slip-up” or “My hubby and I were out drinking” or something similarly vague. Now you know exactly what happened in my case, and what prompted me to use EC.

**How I Got It:**

The next morning, I thought more about what had happened. I wasn’t set to ovulate for another few days, and it probably wasn’t cause for alarm…but I decided I would rather play it safe instead of worrying about unintended pregnancy for the next month. So, I started looking up EC, prices, and where I could get it near home.

I was shocked to find that Plan B costs $50 where I live. As a broke intern, I felt really uncomfortable with this price and I’m sure it’s a deterrent for plenty of other women, too. I thought about forgoing it altogether. Another deterrent for me was the fact that I live in a small town and would be likely to run into someone I knew when I asked for it at the pharmacy. EC is nothing to be ashamed of, but the idea still made me uncomfortable.

Luckily, I realized that my local Target sold Take Action (same ingredients as Plan B) for $35, and there was one in stock available for store pickup. I ordered it online, drove to Target, and picked it up from the customer service desk without having to ask the pharmacist. The only awkward part was when the employee couldn’t find my order and asked me what it was so she would know what to look for, to which I replied “Um, it’s…a white box…” She found it shortly afterwards. Phew. So, I ended up taking the pill about 14 hours after having sex.

**[This](https://www.bedsider.org/features/363-the-girl-s-guide-to-getting-emergency-contraception)** is also a great link on the sidebar that I wish I'd known about beforehand that talks about different EC options and where to get them!

**How it Works**

[Here’s](https://www.bedsider.org/features/850-how-well-does-emergency-contraception-work) a resource that probably says things more eloquently than me. But EC is one tiny pill that works best when you take it as soon as possible, within 72 hours of having sex, but it might work up to 5 days afterwards. There are many different brands, but essentially they are all “super” birth control pills - containing an extra high dose of hormones found in regular birth control that work to stop an egg from being released, and possibly to help stop a fertilized egg from being implanted. From my understanding, it may not work as well if you’re already ovulating or have a BMI over a certain number (in which case, having a copper IUD inserted may be a better option).

**What Happened Afterwards**

After taking the pill, I didn’t experience any symptoms. For some reason, I thought it would be more like a chemical abortion pill. I expected to bleed, feel nauseous, cramp, etc. and have to explain to my mother why I felt so sick. But after doing research online, I realized not many people experience symptoms at all, since it’s very similar to regular birth control. It’s not the same as the chemical abortion pill (as [this](http://mashable.com/2018/01/04/black-mirror-emergency-contraception-abortion/#oIkUFlWTEqqi) recent episode of Black Mirror apparently alluded to). Some people do report symptoms of nausea, acne, oily skin, or other things that happen with any regular birth control. If birth control affects you negatively, emergency contraception might, too.

The only “odd” thing I experienced was that I sort of bled/spotted on and off for two weeks. I wasn’t sure whether or not to count this as my normal period. But a month later, I got my period as usual and everything was back to normal. Other than that, I really had no obvious symptoms…and the best part is that I had no unintended pregnancy, either. Since I’m not on birth control, I might buy another emergency contraception pill just to keep around in case I ever need it again. 

**The Bottom line**

So if you’ve never taken EC, don’t be too worried! Check out what your options are in terms of brand, price and pick-up location. Planned Parenthood is another great [resource](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception) (that I would have gone to if my local Target didn’t carry it) that can help negotiate a lower cost for you. Take it as soon as you can after any mishaps, keep track of any symptoms you have, consult your doctor if you’re worried or if you react badly, don’t use it as your regular birth control (it will probably disrupt your normal menstrual cycle - hence, for emergencies only), and go to your doctor for a pregnancy test if you still miss your period and are worried. And another thing - don’t let your partner pressure you into not using condoms if that makes you uncomfortable.

PS: I still date the same guy (who was supportive of my EC adventure), but now when using condoms we either also use the pullout method, or make doubly sure that he GRABS THAT CONDOM BASE LIKE A VICE GRIP as he pulls it out."
7qf36n,60,2018-01-14,Struggling with career/life satisfaction and sense of identity in medicine.,92988,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/7qf36n/struggling_with_careerlife_satisfaction_and_sense/,"This isn’t a post about being depressed. I do not think I am depressed. Overall, I would call myself happy-ish. I guess I am doing all right. I have an amazing wife and amazing family. My bills are being paid, and I do not worry about money. Good health. Great friends. Honestly, life is pretty good.


I am a newly minted neurosurgery intern in the US of A. I matched at my home program. It was my number 1 that I have been gunning for since 1st year. I still remember the happy tears I had on match day.


I’ve been doing well with residency. Few mistakes here and there…but overall, I would say that I have been successful. My attendings remark on how well I am doing; I feel like I am much more comfortable than my co-interns. And I am getting a good amount of time in the OR.


Despite all this, I am feeling surprisingly…unsatisfied with my life.


Although I did well in medical school, it was rough on me. I didn’t go to a top 50, top 100…or even a top 150 medical school. In fact, I would say that my medical school was one of the dumpster fires of medical schools (U.S. Grad). Because of this, I had to work much harder than the average student to get a shot at neurosurgery. I put in way too many hours and think I forgot how to be a normal human being with normal human being hobbies along the way. It didn’t matter at the time because I would tell myself, “once I get neurosurgery, I will be happy.”


I am coming to find that it didn’t work out like this.


I like my work. I love the patients I work with and the conditions I treat. My co-residents are great. My attendings are malignant at times…but not more malignant than any other neurosurgery attending. And I do not mind the hours.


**There just seems to be something missing. I do not know what it is.**


Like my medical school, I do not attend a top 50 or top 100 neurosurgery residency program. I would be lying if I said that lack of “name recognition” for my program doesn’t bother me. We operate a ton and we’re much busier than the majority of the ivory tower programs…but we do not have people flying from all over the world to be operated on by us. We get a lot of the bread and butter neurosurgery cases (which I enjoy). However, we just lost one of our big teaching hospitals where we do the majority of our brain tumors because of some bull shit contract reasons that I do not fully understand. This is bothering me. I do not know if this is a “grass is always greener scenario” or if I chose the wrong residency program.



I am also coming to find that I do not want my career to define my life, which is something new to me. I used to love telling people that I wanted to be a neurosurgeon when I was older, and I fell in love with the neurosurgery culture when I was doing my sub-is as a medical student. But I do not want this to be what my life is about? If that makes any sense. I want to be a great husband and loving father. I want people to know me for how passionate I am about the hobbies I have/had outside my career. 


I understand that neurosurgery and being a physician in general is a huge life commitment, but it bums me out that this is all people talk about with me or see me as. Maybe I am being dramatic. A lot of it is mostly my fault for neglecting the other aspects of my life throughout medical school. I brought it upon myself and would like to fix it.



If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. I’m not sure why I wrote this, and I do not know what I was trying to get out of those who read it. Maybe just a “hang in there, buddy; you’re doing great” is all I am looking for. Maybe I am looking for some somebody to commiserate with. Or maybe I am trying to figure out what my problem is. I feel like I should be much happier than I already am.


In short, I am finding that the only thing in my life that is bringing me satisfaction is my career with neurosurgery…and that alone is not bringing me enough satisfaction in life.


Thank you."

First time posting here so I'm sorry if this isn't proper. I read over the FAQ but felt as if hearing other people's thoughts would help a lot more. Currently 5'6""and 190~ pounds. WARNING: I will be talking about eating disorders and things relating to depression in my post.


Around mid 2015 I became so fed up with my weight that I decided to go on a low-carb diet. I chose this diet because of my dislike of vegetables and love of most meats. While I still do not like most vegetables I have become more open to trying them and eating some.


At that time I was 16 and I weighed 227 pounds. I had been obese almost all of my life and I wanted change. I began changing the way I ate, limited my meals and sugar, and stayed active. I worked as a courtesy clerk for a local grocery store and was on my feet walking and pushing carts 8 hours a day. My phone clocked about 11 miles to 16 miles a day. I went from sitting around on the computer all day and eating a gallon of ice cream to working out and eating lean meats and fruits.


I started to see change and over the course of a year I lost 90 pounds! I felt amazing about myself and everyone was commenting on how great I looked and how proud everyone was! My clinical depression was even becoming controllable and I finally felt like I wasn't worthless or ugly. I moved out of the house in July 2016 at the age of 17, just a couple weeks before my 18th birthday. I transferred to a sister grocery store of ours and also started to go to college. 


For about the next 6-8 months I stayed at a weight of 140-45, still watching what I ate but not being as limiting as I was before. I was promoted from a courtesy clerk to a cashier, and then from there to a customer service associate. I got a second job as a Sustainability Intern at the college I went to. In October of 2016 I left an abusive relationship and shortly afterwords met the love of my life. Sounds perfect, right? 


I'm not sure when things started to go downhill, but after awhile I started to notice some change. My clothes were getting a bit tighter and I looked a bit pudgier in the mirror. My depression also started to become worse again as the medicine I was taking started to lose its effect. In August of 2017 I left my grocery store job as I couldn't stand working there anymore. I hated how I was treated and would cry every day after coming home. I was also giving in to temptation and buying sugary foods or deli meals more and more, which made me feel worse. It got to the point of relapsing and throwing up after meals or whenever I had the chance. I hated being surrounded by food and wanting to eat.


At that time I moved in with my significant other and worked full time as an intern and focused on school. I ate cafeteria food more and more and opted for easy and fast meals when I got home. We'd order pizza and watch Netflix all night, and when I felt depressed I'd cheer myself up with sweets. Every time we would eat something against my previous diet though I would feel sick and would sometimes still throw up. It got to the point where whenever I'd look in the mirror I would hate what I saw, or when I'd try to fit into clothes I wore in the past and couldn't I'd start crying.


I'm at he point where I'm sick of feeling like this. I've gained at least 30 pounds in the past 3 months. I've tried to limit what I've been eating and making better decisions but that's only slowed the gain. I still eat unhealthy it's just been less. 


To give my boyfriend credit though, he's been my rock throughout all of this and has tried to help us both lose weight. He's not obese by any means but he is a tad overweight. I believe he is 5'9 and 185 pounds? He's been making me eat more vegetables, watching our portion sizes, and has been pushing us to workout more, and eating healthier overall. 


I guess to sum up this post and why I'm posting, I just need help on getting motivated and changing my lifestyle. I'm tired of the gained weight and want to be back down to around 130. I've been trying to resist eating desserts or heavily carbed foods but always in the back of my mind I tell myself "" You've been feeling depressed and have been stressing a lot lately, it's okay you've earned it"". How do I regain my self control guys?"

Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I am extremely interested in the aerospace field (mainly due to the rise of private companies such as spacex).

But a lot of my friends who finished college or upperclassmen in college told me that the field is low paying these days and it is harder to find a job than computer science.

(I’m an immigrant) my dad has a masters in mech engineering but even in my home country the job market was weak and he was paid very little. The reason why my family could even come to the US and live the life now is because my dad decided to join the IT field.

Now I have experience in the comp sci field. I am fluent in several languages and built some test apps when I was a sophomore in high school. It was fun at first but after a while it got boring when I saw my father working. He is now earning well over the $130/hr mark but I’m not sure if he is happy with what he is doing. 

Most of IT and comp sci fields can get boring even though a lot of comp sci students easily get jobs and internships compared to mech engineering students.

So I want to know what to do now. I am a freshman so I still have time but I’m in a serious dilemma and I really don’t want to make the wrong choice. If I decide to do mech then I can stay at A&amp;M. If I want to do comp sci then I’ll have to work hard and transfer over to UT( no offense but they are better than us in almost any type of field)"

#**BRIEFING:**

&amp;nbsp;

**In 2035, time travel was invented.  It was probably a bad move.**

&amp;nbsp;

Recent advances in scientific understanding unveiled a new kind of particle, linked to its past by a quantum event.  These links can last for decades, but eventually they break down and the particle snaps back to its original time - completely irretrievable from the present time.

This discovery would be useless if not for another simple fact: huge quantities of energy can be applied to the particle, which then discharges, entangling itself with with any nearby metallic objects and anything touching those.  The key to time travel was laid bare.

&amp;nbsp;

Under the strictest secrecy, this knowledge was used to develop the first time machines, but these stood unused as the extremely rare particles evaded capture.

Two weeks later, scientists struck gold.  Two particles were captured, and their links were traced.  The first would return to the 7th of May, 1940.  The next, the 12th of August.  And they would do so in two weeks time.
This discovery was reported to their superiors, and then again up the chain.  Before the end of the day, news had reached NATO and the decision was almost instantly made.

&amp;nbsp;

We're going to kill Hitler.

&amp;nbsp;

Movement was made remarkably fast.  The plan was drawn out within three days, and by the end of the first week the plan was ready to execute.  All that remained was the announcement of the endeavour to the world.  It was the polite thing to do.

The reaction was mixed.  The worlds' historians simultaneously went on strike.  Holocaust survivors rejoiced.  Israel grew nervous, the history of its very formation potentially imperilled.  Neo-Nazis took to the streets in a way never seen before - ironically, chanting ""never forget"".

&amp;nbsp;

None of this stopped the plan, now well in motion and guarded by an entire eighth of NATO's military might - and part one went exactly as planned.

In the morning of July 5th, 2035 an agent was transported to the 7th of May, 1940 - sitting in a Tesla.  He was a French national, equipped with proof he came from the future and proof of the future of the world if history was left to run its course.  His mission was summed in a single line:  Convince France to hold fast, and contain the German invasion within itself until mid-August.

&amp;nbsp;

It was not known at first how his success would be measured, back in the present day.  This was quickly resolved when a NATO official picked up a scotch and a history book after a day of work - two minutes later, both were spilled upon the floor.  It was clear - the agent had succeeded.  The Germans had taken the bait and Hitler, sure of his victory, had followed closely behind the front - desiring to see this French courage ruined before his eyes.

&amp;nbsp;

What still wasn't clear was if the second part of the plan would succeed.  When further pages were examined back at NATO command, an intern was hospitalized after peering upon pages containing every possible history at once.  An advisory statement was quickly made to the world, which was probably the wrong move.  

A wave of muggings occurred the following day - WW2 anthologies were used to confound the victims and their possessions then easily taken.  The same evening, history books were banned.  The historians' strike ended as quickly as it had began - they were all out of jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

The world is slipping into chaos - it's important to wrap the operation up and return the world's past to certainty.  

**Part two of the plan can't come sooner, but it's still to come.  You're about to make history - and make it yours.**

**SITUATION**

According to current history, French forces have been containing the German invasion but have been steadily pushed back through their own lands.  They now fight from the shores of historical Omaha Beach, being evacuated by their navy with British assistance to the UK.  The bulk of the force is sailing to safety, but some remain to delay the invaders - they must be kept from the beach before your arrival.

Ready to make the jump, Company TIMELORD is mounted in Mk10 LCUs arrayed in front of the USS Zemeckis.  The Zemeckis' nuclear reactor, being the only power source in the region capable of powering the time pylons, has been brought close to the shores of historical Omaha Beach.

**MISSION**

* Move the landing craft between the pylons, facing the beach, before 21:21 PM.

* Travel to 1940 and assault the beach, securing the beachheads and moving to Phase Line 1.

* A radio jammer was transported previously to deny German command of accurate battle reports.  If Hitler hears of our arrival, he may flee.  Visit the jammer and ensure it is not destroyed by German forces.

* Proceed past Phase Line 1, capturing Le Bray and its neighbouring villages.

* German forces are still pouring into the area.  Defend against any forces and move past Phase Line 2 when clear to proceed.

* Hitler's location at this time is known from history.  Move to the farmhouses and REMOVE FUHRER.

Terrain: I44 Omaha Beach

ToD/Weather: 2035: Late evening, rainy.  1940: early afternoon, clear.

Medical: Basic Medical System

7qhejc,1,2018-01-14,Conscious of your facial expression when talking to people.,matthew264,u_matthew264,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_matthew264/comments/7qhejc/conscious_of_your_facial_expression_when_talking/,"I was always awkward in school and would have social anxiety. However, I feel like it has gotten worse after I got my first part-time job in retail. On the first day, I was feeling nervous, but not a whole lot. Later in my shift, one of my co-workers came up to me and said ""Do you get scared easily?"". From this point on, I started feeling conscious of whether I look anxious to people or not. Now this might sound like normal social anxiety, but this feels like it has been added in addition to my normal SA. For example, I can be talking to someone and be feeling anxious and uncomfortable. However, once I become conscious of whether my face looks anxious or not, my face starts feeling really awkward, like I don't know what to do with it. This produces A LOT of anxiety because it feels like the person can see my anxiety. Now this doesn't happen always, but when it does, it is unbearable. For example, if I am talking to someone, I will start off as somewhat relaxed. But as the conversation goes on, I will suddenly think to myself ""Don't look anxious"". Now all of a sudden, my anxiety will start to spike and my mind will go in a loop of trying to not look anxious which only produces more anxiety. This probably makes the other person confused because I can seem normal, then suddenly I am acting really strange. 

 Whenever I am working with my manager at my retail job I always feel nervous around him. The reason is because he can tell when I am anxious by looking at me. I hate it because I will be working and he will stare at me for a second and say, ""Are you alright?"" or ""Are you scared?"". 

It is also making it harder for me while interviewing for college internships. My first interview, I was extremely anxious coming in. While the interviewer was talking to me, I became conscious of my facial expression which distracted me the entire interview. Now I have done interviews before, and I was always extremely nervous, but I never had this feeling of trying not to look anxious in front of my interviewer. 

Like I said, this doesn't happen always, but it is really annoying when it does. I will even be talking to one of my classmates, enjoying the conversation, when I will randomly become aware of my facial expression, and will feel so anxious that all I can think about ending the conversation and getting away from this person. --It's weird because when I am in this mindset, my mouth will feel awkward, like I don't know what with it. Should I clench my jaw, or let it relax? Its like becoming conscious of breathing. Once you become aware of it, it doesn't feel natural, and you can't get out of the mindset.

--Sorry for the long post. I was just letting my words flow out. I have a lot of other problems I am having that I want to talk about, but I will do that another time.

7qhihp,4,2018-01-15,Hey all! Drug test coming up. Was wondering if anyone could help a brother out!?,Womak2034,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/7qhihp/hey_all_drug_test_coming_up_was_wondering_if/,"So I had a drug test for a job (finally my degree is paying off!) last Thursday and I used my friends piss. I’m a two joint a day smoker for the past few years so there’s no way I would pass. I got a call the next day saying that I would have to retake my test, no explanation as to why I would have to but to call them back when I can to schedule another test. I told them I was going on vacation for two weeks to buy some time but I’m wondering what the general consensus the r/trees community can come to in determining my eligibility to pass this test. With the two weeks and this weekend I should have about 18 Days under my belt of being smoke free. I can probably extend it another week but we shall cross that bridge when we come to it. 

Potency: honestly the past two months I haven’t been smoking the best dank possible. Ive had to smoke two joints just to feel anything, and even then I would be coming down within 45 minutes. I got a really good deal from my dealer that I couldn’t pass up, but the potency was quite low. I definitely felt relaxed, but not too high. 

Does anybody know how potency effects how long it stays in your system?

Frequency: Like I said I would usually smoke two joints a day, sometimes a third or some random bowl hits. 

Body: 170 lbs, 5’7” semi-athletic male. I’ve been going to the gym about 4-5 Days a week prior to this as part of my normal routine. I drink a lot of water usually and eat pretty well. I eat a lot of lean meats and potatoes as my dinner every night and I’ll usually have some cookies and chips as a late night munchie snack. My main meals are pretty lean and not too fatty, my only bad time is when I’m munching out late at night.  I’d say I have a pretty good metabolism, 

Right now: stepped up my gym routine to running 4 miles a day, lifting every other day with my friend who is a personal trainer. Not eating cookies or snacks. Eating more broccoli, cauliflower, and fruits and drinking green tea twice a day. 

I had to stop 4 years ago for an internship. Took me 27 days to clean out but I wasn’t nearly as in shape as I am now and I was smoking a lot danker buds at the time. 

Any help would be appreciated! Thank you all and I hope your day is going wonderfully :)"
7qiffd,17,2018-01-15,Happy Birthday to Me (Long Story),MondayMood,alasjuicy,https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/7qiffd/happy_birthday_to_me_long_story/,"Ang sarap magbakasyon! Nagbakasyon ako ng one week nung October  sa Land of the Lah and City of Merlion kung saan nag celebrate ako ng birthday ko :) Syempre di mawawala ang lakwatsa at kainan kasama ang mga former office barkada, online (skout) barkada at dating mga housemate. Sinwerte din ako at nagparamdam yung dalawa sa ex-FWBs ko. 

=====

Huwebes, nauna ko kontakin ang mga dating officemates ko. Dumaan ako sa dating opisina ko dun at hinintay ko sila sa lobby nung uwian. Suma-tutal siguro lagpas 10 kaming lumarga para mag dinner. Halo halo kami, pinoy cliques, local singaporean and malaysian colleagues pati dating interns ko. Isa sa ex-intern na ngayon ay full time employee na si MeiMei. Local Singaporean, ripe old age of 23 (dati 19 lang sya) 5'3, petite, ga-labanos sa puti at may kpopfap vibe. Lalo na ngayon naka blonde pa buhok nya. Kung i-describe ko, kahawig nya si Hyoyeon ng Girl's Generation. Bago ko sya maging intern, na meet ko na sya sa Skout App, kaso may BF sya nun, at pag may group gathering mega PDA sila. Nag break sila nung panahon na intern ko pa sya, alam kong game sya dahil sobrang maharot nya. Nagawa na namin mag make out minsan sa isang inuman at nagkahaplusan pero yun lang. 

=======

Kumain lang kami sa hawker para mag dinner pero naguwian din ang iba dahil may kanya kanyang pamilya. May pitong natira at nag-aya ng inuman sa Clark Quay. Bumili kami ng alak sa 7-11 at tumambay sa tulay. Actually sila lang umiinom, sabi ko may GERD ako at matagal na akong di umiinom. Pero ang totoo, takot ako ma-whisky dick lalo na kung balak kong maka score that night. Kasama sa natira syempre si MeiMei. Di ko alam kung lasing lang sya or naglalasing lasingan or dahil matagal na akong wala sa kumpanya kaya ""fair game"" na ako, pero bulgar na sya lumandi sa akin. Naka-angkla sya pag magkalad, gusto nya nakakbay ako sa kanya, naka patong ang kamay sa hita ko, at puro bulong sa tenga pag may sasabihin. Nakahalata at yung mga 4 na pinoy na kasama namin tapos tawa lang ng tawa sabay sabi ""iwan na kaya namin kayo?"" syempre di naintindihan ni MieMei yun. 

========

Nag-kaayaan na mag uwian ng mga alas nuwebe, may pasok pa daw sila bukas at medyo na-dissapoint ako kasi sumabay si MeiMei pauwi. Kala ko naman ma take home ko sya sa hotel kasi garapalan na hipuan namin. Sabi ko, walking distance lang yung Swissotel sa Clarke Quay kaya nilakad ko magisa pauwi. Kalagitnaan, may nareceive akong message sa skype;

=======

""Meet me at the lobby later, can? I call you - Meimei""

======

Bingo! Kukuha lang daw sya ng gamit tsaka damit pangpasok the next day. Balak nya magovernight. Ako naman atat, nagmadali maglakad pabalik sa hotel at nag shower na agad. After 1 hour tumawag yung front desk at nasa lobby na sya. Bumaba ako para sunduin sya kasi may keycard yung elevator. Nagpalit na din sya ng damit. Naka long dress sya na hapit sa katawan. Nag usap kami sa elavator at nalaman ko na nag rent na pala sya ng lugar together with another intern. So di sya hahanapin sa parents nya. 

====


Pagpasok sa kwarto nilapag nya ang bag na dala sa study table at tumabi sa kumandong sa akin sa lounge chair. Katakot takot na laplapan ang naganap. Gumapang na din ang kamay ko sa mala-bubot na boobs nya at dahan dahan sinapo sa ibabaw ng damit. Napansin ko na parang walang pad yung bra nya, nakapa ko kasi agad yung nipples nya. Pero tumayo sya at nagpaalam mag toilet, medyo nabitin ako pero alam ko eto na yung surprise nya sakin. naghubad na ako ng shorts. Naka boxer briefs na lang ako at plain white tshirt. 

=====

Pag labas nya, naka lingerie na sya. Black, lacy lingerie with matching panty hose. Parang corset type tapos yung bra is see through lace. Naka t-back din sya. Napa-nga nga ata ako ng matagal kasi natawa sya habang nag twirl pa para pakita yung buong get up.

======

""Wow, didn't know you are into these stuff"" sabay senyas na lumapit sya

""I bought this last year, but Adrian (her ex-bf) don't like it"" Madahan syang lumalapit habang sapo ang boobs.

""Why? What is his problem? This is hot"" sabay hawak ko sa beywang nya. 

""He thinks i'm a slut"" pamaktol na tono nya. ""His lost"" nakangiting bawi naman nya. 

======

At this point, hinihimas ko na ang pwet nya na sobrang kinis. Pinakamakinis sa lahat ng pwet na nahawakan ko. Di sya ganun katambok, pero sobrang kinis. Nakaupo ako sa sofa at sya naman at nakatukod sa harap ko. Balik kami maglaplapan. Binaling ko ang halik ko sa tenga, pababa sa leeg, pabalik sa tenga, pabalik sa labi. Mix ng dila at halik. Minsan may kasamang kagat ng pangigigil. Maya maya sya na naghatak ng ulo ko pababa sa dibdib nya. Di sya kalugusan pero tayong tayo ang boobs nya. Nakokoberan ang dalawang umbok nya ng manipis na lace. Hinalikan, dinilaan, at kinagat kagat ko muna ang kanyang dibdib habang patuloy na nilalapirot ko ang kanyang pwet sa pang gigigil. 

========

Siya na rin ang nagbaba ng lacey cover ng boobs nya at ini-alay ang tayong tayong light pink na nipples. Dinila-dilaan ko muna sa paligid bago sinupsop. Dila-supsop-nibble. Mabilis na nilaro ng dila ko ang utong nya at kapag nasarapan sya sinusubsob nya ang ulo ko kaya naman sinusubo ko na agad ang utong nya. Habang nagpapakasarap ako sa umbok nya, hinatak nya pataas at hinubad ang aking tshirt. Sya naman ang humalik sa leeg at tenga ko. Medyo malakas ang kiliti ko dun pero pag sya ang gumawa, kakaiba, parang ang sarap. 

========

Lumipat na kami sa kama, ako sa ilalim habang nakapatong sya sa akin. Inumpisahan nya halikan ang buong katawan ko, mula sa labi, tenga, leeg pati nipples  ko. Pinadaanan nya ng dila ang utong ko bago bumaba sa harap ng ari ko na nakokoberan pa din ng boxers. Sinalat nya ng sandali sabay sabi ""at last!"" Hinubad nya ang boxers ko at sumaludo patayo ang aking sandata. 

""waahh so fat. are filipinos dick all fat?"" habang taas baba ang kamay. 

(Disclaimer. Di po mataba ang titi ko. Pero baka compared sa naka partner nya na puro tsekwa, may kalakihan nga.)

========

Ungol na lang ang naisagot ko. Handjob pa lang sakto na. Banayad na banayad, taas baba, may kasamang paikot ng palad sa ulo. Maya maya nakaramdam na ako ng wetness. Pinatuluan nya ng laway! Sa porn ko lang napapanood to. Sabay lick sa ulo. Dila, dila, sabay subo ng ulo. Nag attempt syang isubo ng buo pero di daw kaya ng bibig nya. masakit sa jaw. Ang kyut kyut nya. 

Nagtagal sya sa ari ko ko, kakadila, kakasubo, pati bayag ko sinupsop nya. Salit salit na may kasamang salsal. Ang sarap, habang umuuntog sa tuhod ko yung boobs nya. Ewan ko kung bakit, pero parang ramdam na ramdam ng hita ko na tigas na tigas na utong nya. Gusto kong sumabog sa loob ng bibig sya, kaya inabot ko ang titi ko at sinalsal habang subo nya ang ulo. Nilaro naman nya ang balls ko. Nakilita na ako ng sobra at napaliyad, naramdaman nya siguro kaya mas binaon nya ang pagsubo at mas nilakasan ang pag higop. 

Tangina. Nilabasan ako! Tangina. Linunok nya! Tumingin pa sakin!

==========

Latang lata ako pagkatapos nun. Parang ang tagal kong walang super good sex. Pero foreplay pa lang yun. 

==========

Nagpalit kami ng pwesto, pinahiga ko sya at hinatak sa kanto ng kama. Pinaghiwalay ko ang makikinis na hita at bumulaga sa akin ang basang basang puke. Medyo nalihis na ang t-back nya kaya hinubad ko na ng tuluyan. Para akong hayok na hayok na dinilaan ang labi ng kanyang kaselanan. Malakas sya umungol, nakakagana lalo. Pinatigas ko pa lalo ang aking dila at pinasok sa kanyang pwerta. Hinawakan nya ang ulo ko at isinubsob habang gumigiling ang kanyang balakang. Nanginig sya bigla at nilabasan. Pero di pa ako solb. Nagpasok ako ng dalawang daliri sa puke nya at fininger sya, habang sinusupsop ang kuntil na naka alsa na. Tumagal kami ng ilang minuto na ganun, walang tigil na finger rapido at pag dila sa kaselanan. Napasigaw sya... ""FFFFUUUUCCCKKKKK!!!!"" sabay nanginig ulit. Nagulat ako na nilabasan muli sya. 

========

Nagpahinga muna kami saglit. Nag cuddle at nag kwentuhan ng kung anu-ano. Sabi nya, tigang na daw sya since nag break sila ng ex nya, mag siyam na buwan na. May contact pa din sya sa dating barkada namin sa Skout kung san nalaman nya na may naka sex ako na dalawa. At na curious sya. Di ko alam kung ano nakwento nila tungkol sa akin pero sabi ni MeiMei, gusto din daw nya lahat gawin with me. 

=======

Naramdaman kong medyo patigas na ulit ako at kinuha ko ang kamay nya upang jakolin ako. Nung tumayo na, nagsuot ako ng condom. 
Hinatak ko sya sa batok at nakipaglaplapan ulit. Matagl kaming gumulong gulong sa kama na halikan at dilaan lang ng upper body. Maya maya hinubad ko na ng tuluyan lahat ng saplot nya, pero iniwan ko yung leg stockings, ang kinky kasi eh. Umibabaw ako sa kanya at hinawakan ang dalawang pulso sa ibaba ng ulo, kung may tali lang sana ako.... kaso wala. Pumwesto na ako sa gitna, tigas na tigas na naman ako kaya pagkatutok ko, dahan dahan na dumausdos na ang burat ko sa loob nya. Napa singhap sya, sabay kagat labi. Naningkit ang mata lalo pero nakatitig pa din sa akin. Ungol lang ang sagot ko.

========

""ah... ah... ahh....mmmm...."" na lang ang lumalabas sa bibig nya habang palalim ng palalim ang kantot ko. Ninanamnam ko pa ang kasikipan nya kaya di ko pa binabarurot ng todo. Sensual na daan dahan ang paglabas, pero mapwersa ang pagpasok. Bilib din ako sa kanya dahil sinasalubong ng balakang nya ang kadyot ko. Nakahigpit ang kapit nya sa likod ko sabay nibble sa tenga ko, sabay bulong....

""Faster, make it fast"" 

========

Eto na ang senyales ko para ibigay ang lahat. Since nauna na akong putukan kanina, medyo mas matagal tong bayuhang nahanap. Nasa ibabaw ako at mabilis na kumakantok. Nakakapit ang binti nya sa beywang ko dahil hawak ng isang kamay ko ang dalawang pulso nya, ang isa naman ay pumipisik ng utong nya. Tangina, nakakabaliw. Di ko alam kung gano kami katagal sa ganun pero di ko namalayan na nagiba na kami ng pwesto bahagya. Nasa sholders ko na ang binti nya. Pasigaw na sya ngayon kung kaya't pinasak ko ang dalawang daliri ko sa bibig nya para yun ang supsupin nya. kakalibog tingnan. Baliw na baliw kami parehas sa sarap. Nangisay na naman sya. Nilabasan at nanghina. 

========

""Are you ok?"" pa concern na tanong ko pagkatulak nya sakin.

""Yeah, but it hurts a bit, just a bit"" sabi nya

""you want to be on top?"" hirit ko. Hahahahaha. Bitin pa ako eh. 

========

Ako naman ang humiga na may 3 makakapal na unan sa ulo. Umibabaw sya sa akin at kitang kita ako pano nya hinawi ang labi ng puke nya para i shoot ang naghuhumindig kong sandata. Pag upo nya at pag pasok, sinapo nya agad ang kanyang kanang boobs at nilaro. Habang nasa ibabaw ko naman sya na gumigiling giling lang. Sinibukan kong gumalaw din pero tumigil sya. 

""Don't move lah, I fuck you now"" pabulong nya. 

Sya naman ang nag cowgirl. Medyo parang pagod na sya pero sige lang. For some reason parang mas lalong dumulas sya na tipong naririnig ko na yung ""plak, plak, plak"" kahit di sya up-down motion kundi giling. Tinataas na rin nya ang tuhod nya kaya parang naka squat na sya sa harap ko habang naglalabas masok. Nakapikit nya ulit sya, nag coconcentrate sa pag kantot. Hinatak nya ang kamay ko at pinalaro ang clit nya. Saglit ko lang nagawa kasi naglaon mas gusto nya sya na ang maglaro. 

Umayos sya ng upo at yumakap sa akin. Ngayon pinayagan na nya akong kumantok. Nasa ibabaw sya, ako sa nasa ilalim. Salubungan ng kasarian. Ang lakas ng pag bundol ko sa kanya, wala na syang masabi kungdi ""fuck, ah... ah... ah...rder..."" 

=========

Nakatingin ako sa maamo nyang mukha, parang inosenteng inosente na nagpapakantot. Di ko napigilan, nagsabi ako na lalabasan na ako. 

==========

Dali dali syang umalis sa ibabaw, hinubad ang condom at jinakol ang ulo. Putang ina, gusto pa ata CIM ulit! Sino pa naman ako para tumangi? Pumulandit ang tamod ko sa labi nya. Di nya nasalo lahat pero hinagod nya ng daliri para ibalik sa labi. Putangina. 

""hmmm... Avier is right, your cum taste nice"" Eksplanasyon nya pagkatapos nya lunukin. Si Avier yung isang Skout barkada namin. 

========

Dahil dun sya natulog sa hotel ko, syempre may wake up sex ng 3AM at another morning sex ng 5AM bago sya pumasok. Each session kasing intense ng nauna. Nagkita kita kami ng mga barkada ko na kainuman 3 days later bago ako umalis. Inaasar nila na pinuyat ko daw si MeiMei nung araw na yun. Halata sa paglalakad nya tsaka sa after-sex glow daw nya. 

========

Can't wait to go back.

I am planning on applying to the UCCS PhD in Engineering (Cybersecurity) and would like to know if those benefits would apply to veterans who already have an undergrad degree? I will have a Masters degree in Cybersecurity next fall but admissions suggested taking a couple of undergrad math and computer science classes but my post 9/11 GI Bill will be almost exhausted. 
My other question is are there a lot of Cyber jobs and internships available in that area? I've seen some online, but I'm wondering if its a big industry there.

7qj5ty,1,2018-01-15,Girl problem :(,BrianZ498,u_BrianZ498,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BrianZ498/comments/7qj5ty/girl_problem/,"It hurts when I write about this but I wanna let it out

I am an 18 year old guy who studies overseas but comes back to Hong Kong for uni breaks. I started an internship a week ago in a Hong Kong firm where I met this young Chinese woman who is 28 years old. I am not a f'ckboy but I am 18 years of age and she, is the single most beautiful woman I have ever met. 

Because I speak fluent Mandarin, we started talking nonstop on the first day I met her.

Oh she is so beautiful. Her eyes, her cheeks and her hazel brown hair are literally perfection. 

We had lunch together on the second day and we went to watch a movie together on the third day after work. She is so kind, smart and warm. Her looks may be extremely attractive but that's just a big bonus adding to the awesome personality that I love about her 

She told me about her extremely personal experiences with dating and other stuff that she would never tell other guys about. She actually told me that I am the first guy she confided in. I was shocked how she trusted me so much but I realised that she only sees me as a little boy because I am 10 years younger than her and she feels safe around me, thinking that there's no way I can have feelings for her.

It pains me to say that she and I definitely have no chances of being together because of our age difference and that I only go back to HK once or twice a year

I somehow just can't stop thinking about her every day and night as I always wonder if it could be possible for us if we were the same age and we lived in the same country. It's almost funny how Zac Efron and Zendaya's ""Rewrite the Stars"" resonates with me to this level. 

It is so hard for me to keep my focus at work when she's around. I like her so much that I keep trying to find excuses to interact with her such as asking her to give me work or pretend to ask her something I already know. 
I even get a little worried and jealous when other older male colleagues talk to her because she is quite literally the ""it girl"" of the entire office.

God I have a burning desire to kiss her in the lips, I love her so much. I know I have to get over her and let her go but it is easier said than done and God it hurts so much. I am known to be a very level-headed guy who doesn't let emotions affect his judgements but this is so damn difficult. 

I can't tell her how I feel or she will definitely get spooked and this will ruin our friendship. This has happened in the past with other girls and I have been trying so hard to escape my feelings for her with anything I can use to occupy my mind, but it's not working.

God what do I do? The internship is gonna be over in a few weeks and I won't be able to see her again for a long time.

In short it has been a fantastic experience: I moved into a flat in the old town of an absurdly pretty town, got the chance to fully explore the country, made friends and feel I have integrated and understand the country very well. The move itself was very easy for me. But the language has been the slow and hard part.

Partly I wrote this for myself to help clear up my thoughts and memories, but hopefully it will be interesting and helpful to others.
[For info on travel, hiking and other things see this previous series of posts I put on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/5nkv4j/switzerland_my_faq_thoughts_hints_and_tips_after/). This is just about my experience moving and living here (ok it is mostly to bitch about the language, but shhh).

**Serious bits**

There are plenty of blogs ([eg: the German Way](https://www.german-way.com/)), forums (englishforum.ch](https://www.englishforum.ch/)), and books (Living and working in Switzerland by David Hampshire) out there dealing with the matter. Blogs from other expats are sometimes wonderfully accurate, but sometimes they seem to describe another country altogether. I am mostly going to avoid serious bits as they are covered well elsewhere.

One thing I will say is transfer your driving licence to a Swiss one right away. Not expecting to stay this long, and only planning to use the trains I didn’t bother as it just seemed a waste of time and money. Now having been here more than 1 year, and planning to stay longer, as I understand it I can’t drive here until I retake the whole bloody test - not that I ever want to, but it would be useful to have the option still.

**Why / How**

Basically I just ended up here slightly by chance. I (at the time M/28/UK) was doing a PhD in Biomaterials and had been wanting to do a Post-doc outside of the UK (adventure, travel, and experience), but had been focused on Germany or Australia and had never really considered Switzerland. Then a job with the right requirements popped up through contacts as I was writing up my PhD. I applied, got the position, and suddenly found myself about to move to a country which I didn’t really know a whole lot about and to a town I had never heard of.

There were two major aids here: the culture and highly specific skills of academia makes it very easy to find a job in another country, and as an EU citizen (for now) I get equal rights and easy access to Switzerland. So it was just a case of entering the country normally and telling them I was here once I set myself up.

**Pre-move research**

I had been to Switzerland twice before during my studies, but only to Geneva and most of that time was spent at CERN on or over the border with France. Now I was moving all by myself to a different part of the country and the closest person I knew was in the north of Germany. So I was really going in blind and alone.

I was spending 2 months travelling elsewhere in the run up to the start date so didn’t really have much time for any serious preparation beyond checking what I needed to do to make sure I entered and set myself up legally.

What I did do was read Swiss Watching by Diccon Bewes. [He also has a long but quite good TedX talk, similar to the Swiss Watching book but quicker for some of the basic facts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc). He tends to overdo some points, but generally gives a very good overview of the country and the people.

Otherwise I just bought tickets for the closest airport and packed as much as I could into the biggest bag I had: laptop, clothes, a frying pan, and hiking boots. 

**The move**

All things considered this went surprisingly smooth.

Entering the country I just walked through customs just like any holiday maker with a big bag. I then left the airport by the wrong country - a problem which is possibly unique to Basel/Mülhausen - before correctly entering Switzerland and meeting my new boss for the first time in arrivals. He escorted me to our town and informed about various things work and life related on the way (99% of which I forgot pretty much instantly as my mind was overwhelmed with so much to take in).

I had been expecting to use the flat my new workplace rented for visitors, but I found out late on that it was already taken by some interns, and so I had to find my own place at very short notice. Browsing the standard property websites I quickly realised that my original idea of finding myself a furnished flat was not going to happen - such properties are very limited in number and absurdly expensive. I got very lucky and found a room to sublet almost instantly though the flatmate finding website [wgzimmer](https://www.wgzimmer.ch/en/wgzimmer.html) (though be warned flat sharing is not a common thing here like it is in the UK). Not only did I get a mostly furnished flat to live in, but it was in the historic old town, and I had a Swiss housemate which made starting so much easier as I had both an instant friend and a local guide / information source.

(Having since searched for a proper flat 2 years later I have found it is a rather slow process. You typically have to arrange with the current tenant to see the flat, rather than just getting an agent to take you around a selection. Often the tenant feeds back to the company which means appearing in a smart(ish) outfit and being friend helps, certainly the quickest and most positive responses I got were when I had a good chatty tour with the current tenant. Applying then takes ages as you have a to fill out a form for each flat, and the answer can take anything from a few hours to a few weeks. On the plus side you legally get a day off from work to move house which is nice.)

I moved into the flat without a rental contract at first as it took time for the landlord to approve me as a sub-tenant. Whilst slightly chaotic (I took most of my first months wages in a large pile of cash), this made the whole chicken-egg process of getting setup in a new country vastly easier. Once the rental contract came through it was simple to just go to the Kanton with my passport and work/rental contracts and register as a resident, followed by a quick trip to the bank to get myself a bank account. And just like that life fell into place.

For the mandatory health insurance (you have 3 months, but start early as it takes at least a month for it to actually be processed) I just went on Helsana and figured out a reasonably cheap package. I haven’t changed it since, but many Swiss take it very seriously and constantly swap to keep the cost down.

I didn’t really have to spend much time on official matters, and didn’t really come across any serious problems or delays (other than sleeping on the floor for a few weeks as Ikea delivery takes ages). Even setting up a bank account with no common language went surprisingly smooth and quickly.

**Adjustment and life**

I went in with a 1 year contract and a mentality that I would jump in, make the most of the time to see everything I could, and then hop out again to move on elsewhere afterwards (or stay if possible, but I was very open to whatever).

During the early days keeping yourself busy is probably the best thing you can do.
On which point the first few “honeymoon” months are a magical time when everything is different and exciting - make the most of them. Especially for me as I turned up at the end of May which is possibly the best time of year - warm weather, snowy peaks, and green meadows. During my first summer I constantly bought new and novel things in the supermarket, and went on trips almost every weekend. My coworkers started to become quite amused as I turned up every Friday with hiking boots and a backpack to head off directly into the mountains after work.

It of course isn’t all rustic cabins and mountains. Most people moving into Switzerland will go to the Flatland: which can be wonderfully charming with rustic villages and rolling forested hills, but can also be ugly industry and forgettable charmless towns. From October to February the Flatland suffers from a dense low fog which swallows the light and leaves you in a depressing world of grey for weeks or months at a time. [You can escape above it to a world of beautiful clear views and sunshine](https://i.imgur.com/SKmNWwt.jpg) at the weekend (some people go up armed with deckchairs and newspapers), but during the working week you are rather stuck with it.

My past experience made dealing with the move quite easy: having moved to Australia as a kid, and a few times in the UK for uni I had gotten used to new places and new people. I also suspect I have it very easy as an outsider here: I am white, speak English as my mother language, and am skilled (ie: I look like I fit in, I can almost always communicate, and I arguably add something to the country). I don’t mean that in a “the Swiss are horribly racist” way, but a just “the closer you are to the culture you move to then the easier it is” way.

With my housemate and friends I made at work I found myself with a social life fairly early on. Partly due to that, and partly due to not wanting to fall into the expat-trap, I didn’t get around to meeting my local English speaking society until almost 2 years after I arrived. In retrospect it would have been better to join them early on for advice and tips.

Moving from one western country to another isn’t too big a challenge. But the differences can pile up:

* If you come from anywhere but Norway then converting the prices back to your home currency will give you a heart attack each time you go to the shops here. It is best to stop doing that ASAP. Prices are high, but pay is good.

* Getting used to the way things work takes time. I was utterly shocked on arrival to find the shops here close at 6:30pm during the week. 

* One of the curious bits of adjustments was the steady stream of small differences that I became aware of as time passed. For example after months of spending at least part of every day in the countryside I finally realised what it was that seemed off to me - there were no fences or hedges and so it all felt strangely open compared to the English countryside.

**Language**

This is the one thing that gets to me the most about living abroad. It can really isolate you or give you the feeling of being isolated even when you are being socially accommodated (I feel guilty about it and hate having to drag the conversation back to English). Being near the Röstigraben I sometimes end up in a French dominated group (of which I speak almost nothing beyond ordering a coffee) so the effect is somewhat doubled. 

You can survive here without German - I have met plenty of people working at big companies like Novartis that do. English is kind of the common language here - far less people speak multiple Swiss languages fluently than you would expect. Still, when someone in Switzerland says they “only speak a little French” it tends to me they can only converse for an hour or two (as opposed to “a little French” in the UK which means you can count to 5). Once you are setup and enter the rhythm of everyday life then (other than the odd official letter) it is easy to just coast along in English. This is understandable in some ways: coming home after work it can be hard to find the motivation or time to sit down and study something serious (especially with a family), and learning by immersion is often about as much fun as learning to swim by being thrown into a tsunami. 

I wanted to learn the language regardless, but I also happened to move to a very Swiss company in a small town that is almost unknown internationally. As such I was always immersed (drowning) in Swiss-German and had plenty of motivation to learn. 

I would sum up the experience of learning a language as you move to a new country as three stages:

- **1 - The initial novelty.** You have just arrived and everything is exciting and new. You don’t understand anything but that is fine: you are armed with a range of apps, you are confident that immersion in the language will make sound like a native in a few months, and you can even identify some of the items in your kitchen in German already.

- **2- The frustration stage.** You have completed Duolingo and other such things, politely smiled through hours of German, and learnt your dative/genitive/etc - but you don’t understand a fucking thing beyond the fact that the important looking sign in the train station says something about platform 4.

- **3 - Starting to click.** You might still mix up words and your grammar makes the language less of an art and more of a frontal assault. But you understand what is said and get the message across. Conversational level has been reached, and the long road to fluency begins.

- **4 - Bonus Swiss-German stage.** You read, listen, and talk High-German without trouble. Then you pop into Migro and the cashier asks you a simple question in Swiss-German, but you don’t understand a bloody word. You sigh and lower your head in shame/frustration.

I had 3 years of German at school in the UK which was something but not amazing (I showed an example GCSE exam to Swiss colleagues and they literally laughed). Still at least that gave me some words and installed a basic appreciation of the language which helped me restart 10 years later. Having recently started learning French from nothing I actually do appreciate that my school German was a helpful foundation, though I think 3 years of “bare minimum because I had to” at school translates to about 3 months of part-time “because I want to” later on.

I didn’t have much time before moving out so I just played with some game/apps on my phone, which taught me one or two words but were mostly useless. On getting into Switzerland I hit Duolingo and worked my way through it. It is certainly attractive being easy, free, and full of happy binging sounds. But overall I would say it is really limited. You are so far from everyday understanding at the end. Some people claim to watch TV shows or hold full conversations based purely on Duolingo, fuck knows what they watch or talk about but I was nowhere near that. It is useful as something to play with, but as a supplement to other methods. I found Memrise after completing Duolingo, but at this point I could not be bothered with more repetitive filling in the blanks - so I didn’t really bother with it. Instead I moved onto youtube, games, newspapers, classes, and whatever interaction occurred in my daily life.

My German has come quite a way and generally impresses most people I talk to here given the amount of time I have learnt it in (and sometimes that I have bothered to learn it at all, though I feel I could be so much further with less time “wasted” on other things):

* On arrival I would say I was A1. I could introduce myself and say that I had a cat (which was a lie), count, and identify a few objects and animals. But that was about it.

* Now after 2.5 years I can understand most High-German and join in on most topics, so would put myself at B2. Though my grammar is still far from pretty, and a long German session can still burn me out. I can barely remember any genders for nouns and mostly just pick whatever sounds best in my head. Whether I fully understand Swiss-German is very hit or miss.

I must say that I really like Swiss-German. I like how it sounds and it is so much more interesting and full of character than High-German. However….

Learning German in Switzerland can be absurdly frustrating (more so than usual). Swiss-German makes it so much more complicated. You can reach total fluency in High-German, but then get utterly floored by the simplest question from a Swiss person. The Swiss like to laugh when people ask them if “Swiss” is a language, but I would argue that Swiss-German is basically a whole other language. The pronunciation, grammar, and even basic words are often very different. It isn’t so much that the goalposts have been moved, but that the whole fucking game has changed. The idea of trying to play football whilst the other team are playing Gaelic football is about on the right lines. [This video makes the point rather well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gz2S9iggdzM). And on the point of [a whole different game….](https://youtu.be/ThwG88SFIQc).

Still there is no ß in Swiss-German (you just use ss instead) which saves some faffing around at least. It also helps to know that Swiss-German gives most normal Germans a hard time too (German TV often gives Swiss speakers subtitles).

This is infinitely more frustrating as a native English speaker: people often hear my accent and switch straight to English - and usually keep going in English even when I keep responding in German. Sometimes in a shop the salesperson will run off to find an English speaking worker (and sometimes they will then run off to find another worker that speaks better English). Even the middle aged butcher in my little town speaks perfect bloody English. On the flip side having a Swiss address means people often assume I am Swiss and hit me with the hardest dialect they can muster. Going to check into a B&amp;B as the only guests that night the host greeted me with a barrage of Swiss-German only to get a deer-in-the-headlights response from me (much to the amusement of my Swiss girlfriend).

Technically you can learn Swiss-German, but unless you are already fluent in High-German that would be insane. Every Swiss-German speaker understands and talks High-German so you would be pointlessly over specialising with a language that most German speakers can’t understand. Especially so as Swiss-German varies drastically by region (yes even in this tiny place), and it isn’t a defined language so if you write it out you just write it as it sounds to you in your dialekt. I have been told that any structured class on it is just a waste of time. Just learn the Swiss part by exposure - you are never going to easily pass for a local with the dialect anyway.

For putting the language to use it is much easier for me to talk German with strangers, or with people I know speak no English. When you start speaking English with people it is far too hard to then switch language years down the line when your German is good enough to function properly. I live with my Swiss girlfriend but we almost always talk in English when it is just us as German feels so strange.

While it is endless frustration, it really does payoff and feel good. For example when checking into a hotel in Graubünden the receptionist was delighted that I spoke in German rather than just shouting at her in English and I got very friendly treatment for the rest of the time. Also we had regular internal presentations that are given in German, at the start I was filling sheets of paper with scribbled words and translations from my phone as I tried to keep up, but at the end I only needed to do so for one or two words which was rather nice. And of course being able to fully function and communicate with people in daily life is rather a good payoff too.

The downside of this is that when I return to the UK it takes me a few days to stop talking German to strangers (especially if I have had a few beers).

For learning in Switzerland I found these tools very useful:

* The free commuter newspaper [20 minutes](http://www.20min.ch/) is the best tool for learning German in Switzerland (probably also French and Italian too). It is not going to win any journalism awards. But it has short, simple, neutral articles - grab a copy each day and scribble all over it. The odd Swiss-German word is included which helps build up the local lingo. Some of it (ie: the people/community section) is invented bollocks, but it mostly helps give you an idea what is important in the country and how Switzerland works.

* Dict.cc has a number of Swiss words which makes it my mobile/internet dictionary of choice for Switzerland.

* [There is an Allmanisch German wiki if you want to pick up a feeling for the way the dialect feels](https://als.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Houptsyte).

* [SRFplay](https://www.srf.ch/play). TV and radio on demand in High and Swiss-German. You paid for this with your Billag, so abuse the hell out of it.

* SRF4. The news radio station in mostly nice clear High-German. Typically they seem to have 2-3 hours of reports each day that they just repeat, slightly dull but great for someone trying to learn. I like to listen to this when I am working in the lab. 

* Youtube has some useful resources. Swiss-German channels like [Ask Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndi9zHvIDYa1Tp6vXJqHxA) provide plenty to listen to. It also has some SRF stuff which might help if you are not already in Switzerland. Search “bi de lüt” for shows focused on Swiss life with some strong Swiss-German accents. 

* [The australian/swiss comedy of Rob Spence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mifm_FMFLM&amp;t=4s). Not so easy to understanding but somehow reassuring.

For German in general I would also suggest:

* /r/German and the resources on their [wiki/faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/wiki/index).

* There is so much on youtube. [Easy German](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3936178A38BB5F87) is a favourite.

* Dive in - to hell with how stupid you might sound.

* Joining a class. The learning process is much more fun when you have some people at your level to share the frustration. I spent almost a year trying to decide what level to join - online tests kept putting me as A1, but the overall meaning of each level made me think B1, in the end I went B1 and it was perfect (so bollocks to yes/no online tests).

* Duolingo provide a nice way to get started and keep steadily learning. The simple focused nature of the tree and short time requirements of the stages mean you don’t get overwhelmed and don’t need to worry about setting more than a few minutes aside for it. But overall it is really limited in what it actually teaches you of the language, so you need to heavily use other medium instead. Think of Duolingo as a snack: quick, convenient and easy to keep you going, but it isn’t going to properly fill you up. Complete the tree and practice if you find it useful, but don’t bother aiming for the highest level or for a 1000 day streak.   

* I am not a massive gamer but I swear by video games as the best way to learn. The mix of interaction, language, and fun makes for a very effective learning environment (that and being able to attack someone with a sword when you get sick of them speaking German to you is rather satisfying…..). The trick is to find something story based with a good separation of language and action: RPGs like Skyrim is perfect for this (especially using console to pause and quick save/load to repeat bits), whereas something action based like COD is too distracting. This worked especially well playing games which I completed in English years ago, where I could just about recall the gist of the story to help me along but had forgotten many aspects and details.

* Music. I built a playlist when I first arrived. It started out as random sounds, but through 2 years of steady listening and learning I can now make sense of it.

* Read out loud (though maybe not on the bus).

* [Emon publishing](https://www.emons-verlag.de/) do local Krimis with one probably set where you live or are interested in. Not exactly the best books in the world but entertaining enough.

**The Swiss**

Sometimes I feel I understand the Swiss, other times they are complex enigmas. The nature of the country often feels very contradictory at times (often liberal and conservative at once). And of course the urban/rural, and language divides only make this more complex. 

Take anything you read pre-2000 with a big pinch of salt. The country seems to have changed significantly since then: going from a dull but practical country to a much more fun and outgoing one. The summer months especially are very lively as people head outdoors to drink at bars, go to festival, and jump in the lakes/rivers. Younger Swiss are very open and there is less of the formality that you get with the older generations.

The Swiss tend to operate in two modes in public: city and mountain. In urban areas the Swiss are along the lines of the quiet closed society of stereotypes, but get them into the countryside and they can become super loud and chatty. I have been on Post buses where the entire bus was interacting and best friends by the end of the trip, and if you get on a train to the mountains with a group of retirees you will know about it. 

I am a fairly private person but the Swiss sometimes really beat me there. Once a coworker who I spoke with most days casually mentioned that he wouldn’t be in the next day, I assumed he had to wait for a delivery or something - turns out he was getting married. This has happened twice now. Most other coworkers got this treatment too, so it isn't (just) that I am insufferable. 

I have however always felt very welcomed here. On one of my first days I went walking in the Jura mountains near my town. As I sat on a peak to eat lunch an elderly local man started talking to me. My German was almost non-existent then but I managed to get the idea across that I had just moved there to start work. On finding out that this foreigner who barely spoke a word of German (let alone the local dialect) was moving in to work he wished me well and gave me a Ricola. A small gesture, but one that really stuck with me. Having improved my German I have only felt more welcome since then.

On which point the Swiss are very tolerant with language. Absurdly so really. In my early days I only once or twice got very gentle remarks that I needed to improve my German (buying curtains was one notable early occasion where my few words in German really failed to get me far) but generally they did everything to accommodate me and then as my skills picked up they started to throw praise at even my crude German. Whether that is just being polite or they are just genuinely impressed that an English speaker learnt German I am not sure.

The Swiss are almost always very considerate. Dog walkers will stop to hold their dog in place whilst bikers go past. Even the bored teens drinking on the street at night don’t bother anyone walking past. The main exception is the growing number of wankers who think they are special and can just walk around with their music blasting out of some powerful speaker (though that is probably more common elsewhere).

Some habits of talking took a while to get used to. The British habit of saying sorry to express sympathy (or anything) rather confuses the Swiss who take it to just mean guilt. Understatement isn’t really a thing here which either leads to confusion or hilarity - one day at work I was being shown a process with a sample being taken out of the oven at 1400C, on being warned that it was very hot I replied that it was indeed a wee bit toasty, the poor worker taking the sample out was almost collapsing with laughter from what I thought was just a standard comment.  

The absolute worst thing about the Swiss is their obsession with putting their bag on the seat beside them on the train (the overhead racks are apparently only there for aesthetics). They will move it if you ask, but not until you do so (no matter how obviously busy the train might be) which can create a passive aggressive awkwardness about it. Some talented people have even mastered the art of taking up 4 spaces by themselves, and then manage not to notice that there are other people on the train. 

A few odd thoughts:

* [Stereotypes exist for each region in the country](http://i.imgur.com/Gq72cwL.jpg). Generally they are fairly mature. Coming from the UK and Australia where anyone more rural than you is having sex with their sheep (and/or incest) this was quite a surprise.

* One thing I find curious is that the image of sport (TV adverts etc) here is more of families and normal people doing it as opposed to super-athletes. And most people are quite outgoing with sport and such-like. 

* Shaking hands is a big thing here. Get used to that in situations where a hello or just polite nod would do in English speaking lands.

**The long-term**

Having started with a mentality of in-and-out (with as many mountains as possible in the meantime) I have found myself getting somewhat more established here. I got extended several times to 2.5 years, met a Swiss girl, moved in with her, and am now looking for further work.

For me adapting and getting used to life here was fairly easy. I made friends via work, and my housemate. I explored every part of the country (far more than most of my Swiss acquaintances). Through watching and reading the news I now understand much better how the country works and the variations in who votes and thinks what. I can’t name the president or most of the politicians, but they are not so influential here and having no say myself in the politics I have an excuse there.

There has been some frustration and feeling of being useless and/or isolated. I sometimes get a desire for home, without actually knowing what home even is to me anymore. But generally it has been very positive. 

I only really miss a few things:

* Food. Swiss food tends to be a little less exotic than the options in the UK. I really miss the omnipresent cheap curry-houses. Likewise standard food in the supermarkets (whilst almost always good) is less exotic.

* Spicy food. Food listed as hot/spicy here tends to have all the power of slightly tangy ketchup. But this might just be a result of years of idiotic English competitive curry culture on my behalf.

* Culture. You can talk English with locals but it just isn’t the same. Hanging out with fellow expats helps abit there, but they are often from all over the world so you often still miss out on a proper connection.

* Opening hours. I dream of shops that open on Sunday and/or beyond the early evening. 

The main downside has been that the longer you spend somewhere the more mundane it becomes. A few days spent in Grindelwald or somewhere like that might leave you with the memory of the country as a magical place. But when you stay somewhere for longer then it becomes normal and less special with every passing day. I still love it here, but had I only stayed for the first summer than it would have stayed far more wonderful in my memory. Of course then I would just be yearning to come back.

**What would I do differently?**

If I were to repeat it again knowing what I do now (though they are all of course easier said than down):

* Allow more time for finding a flat. I got lucky on arrival, but now realise how long this process can be.

* Hit the language harder and faster. This was partly delayed by finishing up corrections and work for my PhD, but I really should have joined a class early on, and also have picked up French sooner once I started to get conversational with German.

* Make more effort to be social. I feel I integrated well, but could have done more to join a local club or been more socially outgoing on arrival.

**How to be Swiss**

* have some Aromat on your table (even if it is made by Unilever). 

* Swim in a lake/river during the summer.

**Things to try:**

- If you are here more than a few weeks then try to get into every language region at least once. If you are here for a number of months then try and visit every little area. For a tiny country there is so much variation in landscape and culture.

- Wine. You can’t find it outside of the country, but Swiss wine is actually pretty good.

- Beer. [There are loads of small Breweries all over the country](https://bov.ch/beer/swissmaps.html), Switzerland apparently has the most breweries per capita in the world. Feldschlossen is the “standard” mass produced beer you find everywhere. Compared to the standards in other countries it isn’t too bad, but try and find something more interesting.

- Cheese. More than just Emmental. Try everything you can.

- Vermicelle. A desert made out of minced chestnut. Best in autumn.

**Useful quickfire points:**

- Swiss plugs are like (but not identical to) standard European ones. Standard European ones do not always fit here, come prepared with at least 1 Swiss specific plug.

- Kantons have lots of power and the way they are run can vary quite a bit. The Kanton and place you live in can have rather a large effect on the taxes, health insurance, and various quality of life factors.

- Catholics kantons have far more official holidays (on such days the shops in protestant kantons will fill up with shoppers from the surrounding kantons). Swiss holidays fall on a date, not day of the week, and many firms make bridge days for holidays on a Tuesday or Thursday. This means that year to year the number of official holidays you have can vary from almost none, to having what feels like the the whole of May off work. The absolute worst is holidays on a Saturday when you miss the day off, and all the bloody shops are closed.

- Look into at least getting the Half-Tax train pass even if you don’t plan to take public transport too often - it applies to most cable cars and ships too. Combined with supersaver tickets on the SBB app you can buy tickets for specific trains at quieter times for 25% of the normal cost. If you live with someone else who has it then you get a discount. Same with the GA: my girlfriend is a student, and I live with her, so we both save about a third off the GA.

- Name is last name, not first name (vorname), in German. I ruined countless forms until I got used to that.

- The Swiss 1 looks like an upside down V at times. That caused some confusion too.

- Look into [Reka money](https://reka.ch/en/rekamoney/seiten/reka-money.aspx). It is basically “voucher” money that is usable for leisure and travel in Switzerland (accommodation, food, transport, activities). You can’t use it everywhere, but you can get it at as little as 80% of the cost in CHF. Saving 20% off travel inside Switzerland is very nice. For best results see if your company has an account in place to help you get the checks or a savings account (mine gave it out as a summer holiday bonus). If you do use the banknote like checks bear in mind that you often don’t get change from them, so prepare a mix of the checks and coins to cover the full cost.

- Charity shops are not a thing like they are in the UK. So cheap and easy 2nd hand things are not always so easy to find.

- Asterix and Obelix is rather popular here. Brush up on that for Switzerland and your country to understand the references.

- If you are swapping the side of the road you drive on, then try and cycle rather than drive as much as possible at first. It is much easier to quickly dash onto the pavement when you go wrong on a bike than with a car (maybe best if you stick to simple quiet roads). Cycling on the right helped me clear my left-sided instincts out so when I finally drove on the right it was natural.

**Not so useful points:**

- You will spend the first few months with a Swiss kezboard mixing up the z and y kezs.

7qjxgw,3,2018-01-15,Supreme Evil's Pre-Campaign: Cast Page,SupremeEvil,TTPloreplaycentral,https://www.reddit.com/r/TTPloreplaycentral/comments/7qjxgw/supreme_evils_precampaign_cast_page/,"**Eureka ""Trollkit"" Williams**: An autistic woman from Earth who became an unlikely hero when she and her friends got suddenly swept up into the events of Draysten. During that series of unsettling events, she faced several traumatic events, made plenty of new friends, and fell in love with Exxy. After all that drama, she and Exxy are currently content to stay home and live a relatively quiet life. *However, with trouble brewing on the horizon, and multiple hints that her role in things is not yet over, a quiet life does not appear likely*.


**Ezekiel Lloyd ""Exxy"" Williams**: Started 'life' as a computer virus called Lord_Bill.exe. Got accidentally downloaded onto Eureka's laptop, eighty-four percent of him at least. After a rocky start to their relationship, Exxy and Eureka became friends, and Exxy developed a crush on Eureka. At the beginning of the 28 campaign, Exxy was somehow (*the answer is always Magic*) transformed into a human, if a socially awkward one, and he soon learned how to be a hero. Eventually Eureka reciprocated Exxy's feelings, and the two are now happily married. Along the way, Exxy received ice magic from the ghost of an ancient Sapienta, and is training Cress in the proper applications of cryokinesis.


**Bill MacKenzie**:
Known as the most hated man in history (*of PokeEarth at least, he can't claim the title everywhere*), Bill was presumed dead by the world, but mysteriously returned from the grave when world events left him with no choice but to act. Pessimistic, somewhat paranoid, and formerly self-sacrificing to the point of suicidal, Bill has been taken under Giratina's wing in hopes of turning over a new leaf. As the Scion and Acolyte of Dome, Bill is immortal, and his body contains Dome DNA and Order powers, although he clearly has problems manifesting ""order"" into his own personal life. He also has one of Giratina's tentacles replacing his right arm, which he lost in an attack by Domalakazam.


**Mixy**:
An abandoned Zigzagoon that Bill found in the dumpster of a Dialga Queen, Mixy is the optimist to Bill's pessimism. Completely loyal to Bill, Mixy is somewhat naive and not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but he can be just about anywhere whenever he wants to be, and can come in and out of the PC system at will.


**Rea MacKenzie**: The Acolyte of Ho-Oh (Lady Prism), former Voice, and Bill's wife. Though they've spent so much time apart after Rea joined the Voices, Bill and Rea have been reunited after thousands of years.


**Luxin ""Luke"" MacKenzie**:An ancient hard-light computer program now known to be the legendary Dragon that created Gensokyo. After an attack by Caitlin, Luxin lost its identity and was turned to the darkness, but an encounter with the self-sacrificing Cress brought about a heel-face turn back to the light. Taking on the identity of Lord_Bill.exe 2.0 (aka ""Deuce""), Luke did everything he could to save Cress, eventually succeeding with the help of a nameless scientist -- and getting trapped in Cress's head in the process. As a result, Cress and Luke seemingly know each other better than they know themselves. During the war against Catilin, Luke discovered his identity as Luxin and also learned that Bill.exe 2.0 was still alive and bearing a rather violent grudge. Despite all that has happened, Cress and Luke remain friends.


**Cress Fields:**: Former gym leader of Striaton City and MUPPET member. Intelligent but introverted Seduced and betrayed by Flak; still carries severe trauma and trust issues from the ordeal. Rescued, revived, and nursed back to health by Luke. Cress is now working with his long-standing psychological troubles from his imprisonment and torture, as well as continuing his investigations with MUPPET against threats against the world. *Currently dating Shantal (he must have a thing for unstable girls with long purple hair). Also being taught ice magic by Exxy.*


**Sho (The Sorcerer)**:Formerly known as Lord_Bill.exe 2.0, who spent his time frequenting MMORPGs and being a troll. In his attempts to save Cress, he was attacked by a brainwashed Luke and wound up in Gensokyo. Possessing a certain Boneka, Sho learned a form of bardic magic inspired by his days online, and nursed a heavy grudge against Flak and Luke. Caitlin took advantage of his grudge and turned him against the heroes (where he cut off the good Fennel's arm), but soon afterward Caitlin tried to destroy him to tie off loose ends. Cress and his friends came to the rescue, after which the Major made it very clear to Sho that he was NOT to try to murder his friends again. While still angry at Luke, Sho has grudgingly accepted that Luke is not the person now that he was then.


**Shauntal**:  The ghost trainer of the Unova Elite 4, and well-known mystery and fanfic writer. Hides her cripplingly low self-esteem behind a façade of blatant cheerfulness. Is immensely aware of how other people view her (the silly writer girl). None of this is helped by the fact she by her rather Cloud Cuckoolander tendencies and her tendency to be Wrong Genre Savvy. She's also possibly the least intimidating Yandere ever, something not helped by her two love rivals being an Omnicidal Maniac with a torture fetish, and the Dragon of Gensokyo. She also provided the Rotom egg that became Tanger, but is slightly troubled by the fact she does not own a Rotom and can't quite remember where the egg came from.


**Mary (Cuplat cu Mixy, under the house of Griseous)**: Once the property of a cruel master who in hubris achieved would drag their unstable backwater of a world down into the screaming depths over which it had been hopelessly draped in a mockery of existence, she was found by the Prince of the Roads, and taken in. Her first few years are fuzzy at best, as her world echoed the patterns of stabler ones, and causality is mixed up enough on the Roads as it is. However, from her homeworld, a group of people on the Roads, or one it be worlds she was nursed back to health in, she became part of a religion based largely in ties of loyalty, and in consequence chose to serve her savior, Gyro. She did this in various ways until an assignment to watch over his half sister, who he had sent, mind temporarily scrambled, to another world for reasons undisclosed. She watched over her in different roles, mostly staying quiet, until it came to her attention that her lord had died, and it came to Lady Griseous' attention she had been hiding in the palace for a suspicious amount of time.

She was feisty, contrarian, and broken for a while. This changed when she judged one member of the party to properly embody the ideals she cherished. This happened to be Mixy. Circumstances would lead her to act less like the hardened spy angry with the world and more the fawning school girl.

Since then, she has established an official bond with him, and confessed her feelings. He wishes to takes it slow, and she has been trying to respect that. She also moved into the domain of his master's master, who remains somewhat suspicious, but is trusting her explanation that her belief system does not allow her to betray her Cupla's master, or her benefactor.


**Tangeroid ""Tanger"" of Spades**: The egg that would hatch into Tangeroid was originally gotten from Shauntal in an attempt to prepare a second body for Bill. This was soon abandoned in favor of Name Goddess, Marion, getting a new prophet. Through this bond the newborn was given knowledge of what she knew of the world, and what she wanted done.

Identifying people by the first role they learned for them, Tangeroid ended up thinking of Luke as one who needs/deserves/wants Hugs, and the Scientist as one who should be made Happy.

Randomization, moemonization, and so on led to a wild existence for the child, who currently is something like a dragon made of plasma in the shape of a child, based in Giratina, Rotom, and a young child.

Currently resides in Gensokyo, with nuGyro, who they have looked up to since before they met. Considers Shauntal a mother figure, especially since Marion left to find her brother.

**Marion**: The daughter of an alternate reality Dome and Root, Lady Foot. Goddess of Names, or more accurately Democracy Names, those with established meanings. Looks like an adorable cat, but she is a tough little fighter, who is particularly inclined towards kicking. Taking care of a Rotom named Tangeroid, her prophet. *Has recently headed home to Gem World*.


**Major ""Monferno""**: One of the founding members of Chimera. Actually an epic level wizard with his own plane, and the most proactive member of a council of similarly adept, but more apathetic multiverse travelers who maintain the stability of reality. While powerful, he is often stymied by the ill effects his out-of-universe magic can have on reality. Reasonable, levelheaded, and often dumbfounded by the ridiculous problems the group gets into. Currently has lost his wizard knowledge for the powers of the bard, due to the effects of randomization.


**Simul**: A simulacrum of the Major, created by the Major to go to realities where his full power might cause disruptions. Was severed from the Major after going into a dark zone, and considers himself a separate person from the Major. Currently adventuring after a bard encouraged him to multiclass; Major does not really approve. Despite this, they have mostly reconciled, and Simul now aids the group once more. *Takes a more active role in Echoes.*


**Karrl**: Major's IT intern, a Karroblast. Often anxious, and with a slight stutter. Spends most of the time playing video games instead of working. The Major presumably knows about this but does not stop it. Posseses a magical death knight suit, but generally not the will to use it. *Currently pursuing a relationship with Nonon.*



**Moonslicer**: A magic sword with the soul of a dead paladin in her. Spends her time trying to help redeem evil and help others. Is currently attuned to Bytemite.


**Bill (PokeEarth-R)**: Former disciple of dome and inventor of the PC trying to atone for his mistakes, similar to his alternate universe counterpart. Currently involved with Fennel.


**Fennel (""The White Queen"", PokeEarth-R)**: Eccentric and perky pokemon professor and dream researcher from Unova, who revived her universe's Bill because she was bored and found him interesting. This one isn't evil!


**Fennel (""The Black Queen, PokeEarth-R/Wonderland)**: An ~~evil~~ less moral version of Fennel known as Flak or Flaknel. While not outright murderous, she exists to be contrary and loves schemes that can indirectly lead to death or undermining the social order, which she perceives as restrictive and unnecessary.


**Giratina (Lady Griseous of the Shadowlands/Distortion World/Reverse World)**

Home universe: Pokearth-T

Species: Sarcastic, grumpy, hissing, Poke Puff-loving, not-quite-eldritch-abomination-when-compared-to-Outsiders-but-still-pretty-scary, rebellious, Voice-hating, shadow-ghost-dragon-thing.

*Yoouuuuuu cammmmeeee innnnttoooo mmyyyy hommmeeee annnddd beeeeeaatttt meeeeee uppppp. Thhhhatttt kinnnndddd offff thinnnnngggg tennnndddssss tooo creeeatttteeee a gruuudddggeeee...*

Giratina, along with her sister Dialga and her brother Palkia were the first Pokemon created by Arceus. Giratina, not content to be subservient to a being who only predated her by a few minutes at most, rebelled against Arceus. When she could not overcome him, she instead retreated into a world of her own creation, the Distortion World, which mirrored and was connected to Pokearth. Initially she plotted her eventually revenge against Arceus, but over time, she came to realize that was much more found of the quiet solitude of her world and no particular wish to return to Pokearth. However, because the worlds were closely tied together, if Pokearth were to be severely threatened, the Distortion World would be as well, and Giratina was fiercely protective of the world she had created. 

Giratina payed little attention to the Voices and their various shenanigans until she went to drag Cyrus into her world to prevent him from completing his plans, only for Napoleon (and the Voices) to be dragged in as well. After traipsing around her world and then beating her up when she was only doing her job, Napoleon returned to Pokearth, and Giratina was left to recover and develop a fierce hatred for the Voices.
When multiple Legendaries were summoned to Dragonspiral during CLY's journey, Giratina was among them. She was delighted when the Voices fled from her in terror. During the events of the Draysten Incident she formed a pact with Bill, tearing off one of her tentacles to replace his missing arm, and officially making him her ""right hand.""

My current situation:

I’m 21 years old, will graduate with an international business degree in 2019 and as a second lieutenant in the army. 
Problem: I will be about 20k total in Student Loan/credit card/car loan debt when I graduate. As a Student and army rotc Cadet i have good monthly income of around 1k a month however I cannot save and have ran into expensive car problems and like to spend and have a good time and live life up. Lately, I have decided it’s time to truly grow up and get my finances under control. 
My problem is my career path after school. I am unable to get an internship this summer because I have military orders for over a month and no place will hire me due to that. I am extremely unsure what to do with my degree besides apply for jobs, try for an internship after I graduate, etc. I’m worried I will be forever stuck in this debt rut living comfortably paycheck to paycheck. I also have a girlfriend who seems to be a little on the gold digger side (her mom is a huge gold digger it makes me sick) I spend a lot of money on her I should be saving.


Option 1: take the civilian job at (assumption) 50k after taxes, with national guard on the side( $550 for a 2 day Drill weekend before taxes) live with debt slowly paying it off and move in with my girlfriend after graduation and always be trying to make her happy with nice cars, vacations, etc. ( I don’t need that to be happy) and be miserable with a 8-5 job with a commute and traffic in the urban center we live in. 

Option 2: join the active duty army. Starting pay 45k a year and after 2 years goes to 60k. Pros: great way to set myself up for the future. Cons: more then likely will leave my girlfriend behind and we will be done. Not sure which is better for happiness and long term growth and stability which I would enjoy.

Thank you! "
7qk0on,2,2018-01-15,Need guidance in creating a wordpress site for courier business,psychoreaper,Wordpress,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/7qk0on/need_guidance_in_creating_a_wordpress_site_for/,"I was very excited I landed my very first client and they are planning on starting up a courier business. I learned a little bit about wordpress during my internship and we pretty much worked on all kinds of site so I thought a simple courier business would be easy (starting to think I'm wrong). 

So their proposed operation is this:

1. Customer logs in/registers
2. Schedules a transaction and inputs information
        * Name
        * Pick up address
        * Destination address
        * Item Dimensions
        * Item weight
        * etc.
3. Site calculates price based on dimensions, weight, and distance
4. Headquarters produces a waybill with pre-printed unique number (ID/Transaction no.)
5. Courier picks up item gives waybill copy to customer
6. Courier returns to HQ and transaction is marked as dispatched
7. Courier delivers item
8. Courier returns to HQ and transaction is marked completed

This is not final and they're asking me if I can find out a better way. In the mean time, I need help in finding which plugins can help me the most in accomplishing this process. I know about WooCommerce but do they have something for recording shipments only with products?

If not, I'm thinking of a record keeping plugin, maybe something Excel-like, something flexible and searchable by visitors. For this I found [Participants Database](https://wordpress.org/plugins/participants-database/#description)

For the price calculator, I only found the WooCommerce ones so I guess they're based on  couriers supported by WooCommerce, which is useless since this is a courier business itself. For this I found [Calculated Fields Form](https://wordpress.org/plugins/calculated-fields-form/#description), which seems to be flexible enough.

I'm gonna be able to start tomorrow so I haven't really tried these new plugins that I found. I was hoping to get suggestions here first and solidify my plan.

I appreciate anyone who reads this and brainstorm with me. TIA!

Edit: I forgot to mention, I made them buy this theme [Cargo HUB](https://themeforest.net/item/cargo-hub-transport-wordpress-theme/20531713) over this one, [GO Courier](https://themeforest.net/item/go-courier-a-courier-delivery-service-wordpress-theme/16141418) which appears to have functionalities that would have made my life easier, like the price calculator. Lesson learned, read features carefully.

7qk8j8,5,2018-01-15,Feeling like a failure for living at home and not travelling at 22,TheModernDayHermit,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7qk8j8/feeling_like_a_failure_for_living_at_home_and_not/,"I'm 22, I'm weak and let my depression and social anxiety get the best of me, in result I haven't worked and barely left the house since about a year ago. This started after I quit my internship (november 2016) after graduating from college (ceremony on february 2017). 

I'm a MtF transgender, and now at this age I think I missed the chance of ever looking like a woman. Besides I'm completely dependent on my parents, and they would never accept it. I feel like I have little to live for, while my peers have been partying, travelling and having fun since I was 14, I have been staying at home, hiding from the world. 

At 22 I haven't done what most people my age have. Acting on a first love, the first kiss, dating, travelling on your own, going places on their own,etc. I feel old, I feel like an overgrown child who is mentally stuck at 16 because I didnt get to live.

When I read stuff or reddit people always say things like ""I'm still living with my parents at 19"", and that makes me feel like the biggest failure. It's normal in my country to live with your parents for longer, but even then I should be more independent by now. I don't have connections in my area and I'm far from the best, and now with this 1 year gap in my already short CV (my only experience was that one internship, kill me) makes me think I won't be able to get a nice job. My parents spent so much on my college, I feel so guilty and disgusted at myself.

I also feel over conscious about the fact that I never left my region of my country, and even that I haven't really visited much. I have an online friend and sometimes while mentioning places from my country she'll ask if I ever been there, and I hate saying no. It wasn't a problem of money, but rather our family vacations were always at the same place, at a relative's house.

I feel like I have no life experiences, I want to know the world, I want to be able to go to places, even within my city, without being filled by fear, I want to be independent and have my own life. But then I think, is it worth it? Is it worth going through so much hardships if at the end of the day I still won't be able to have fun and a normal life like my peers because I'm a disgusting tranny? "

It was a great turn out. We have 25+ enter with a total of 37 submissions in all! After the judges looked over all of them closely over the weekend we narrowed the list down to the below 16 submissions.  
  
If you like one of them, let us know in the comments below.  
  
To those who were chosen, Round Two’s deadline is just around the corner! Check your Reddit Inbox or Discord DM where you will be contacted with how to submit your synopsis as well as the guidelines.  
  
Now, without further ado, here are the chosen pitches!  
  
/u/Arkflame  
Pitch: : Bandits roam the land, and a foreigner walks into town with a magic sword on his hip. He brings with him a decision that Jet, a young priest, must face: deny his power, and watch his village burn, or embrace the flames within, and face exile and damnation.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
Discord / TheChodFather  
Pitch: : A grad student going for their Masters in business administration has to complete a six-month internship as an assistant for a local executive. One student chose the leader of a local non-profit children’s clinic, it should be an easy semester learning the ropes and aiding some of those who needed the it most. That all changed when she was informed her boss is a confirmed Sociopath. Someone who had no morals, no respect for others, and entirely incapable of sympathy or empathy, but backing out now would be a big setback. Though, she didn’t believe that she could stomach working for such a person. Or so she thought…  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/wpmason  
Pitch: : Ten years after surviving the car accident that killed her parents, Andi is a well-adjusted happily married elementary school teacher. With the start of a new school year, though, a bizarre series of coincidences leads Andi to become convinced that one of her students is actually her as a child. As she goes further down the rabbit hole, the closer she gets to regaining her lost parents at the risk of losing her perfect life.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/ScottWritesStuff  
Pitch: : David was suddenly told by his parents at age five that he was adopted. But, in an alternate universe, they told him at age fifteen. In another, at twenty-five, and in yet another, at age fifty. Each time results in David perceiving himself differently, drastically changing the course of his life. But how much do our parents really define who we are?  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/HopeOfDecember  
Pitch: : The people with supernatural abilities rule the world, and Libby Amana was expected to be one of the most powerful. However, now that she's 18, it's clear she's what's known as an ""invalid,"" aka someone without powers. Her family turns hostile towards her and this forces her into an underground society of other invalids where she must figure out where her new place in life is, who she is, and what her purpose is. She also has to fight creatures that are starting to infest and eventually is in a situation where she has to decide whether or not to kill her family for the safety of the community.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/golf4miami  
Pitch: : Growing up in a military family certain things are expected of you. Toughness, grit, little to no emotion, staying in line, and of course joining out of high school are all par for the course. Staying the course can be freeing however, as it was for Ryan. That is, until he returned home from a tour of duty for his dad's funeral only to find out his family's military history is all fake.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/tevshko  
Pitch: : After a gruesome car accident, a boy wakes up in the hospital, surrounded by astonished doctors. With surprise and fear in their eyes they warn the boy no mortal could have survived that crash, and had it not been for the perfect timing of a stranger--whom they attribute to be an angel--the boy would have been dead, rather than alive and disfigured. Meeting his mysterious saviour, the boy realizes something strange-- a ghastly scar across his belly, an identical one to the boy's. When the boy asks, the stranger smiles, saying it happened a long time ago, in a gruesome car crash that left him miraculously alive, and embarked him on his life's path.   
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/tevshko  
Pitch: : On a distant, abandoned island where everyone is born blind and helpless, a girl is born with sight. The island people hail her their champion, a goddess standing among them. Soon, her sight leads her to undiscovered paths, and the girl notices chilling, disconcerting details about the island around her. Details that make her think they are not alone, that the villagers' blindness is not chance, that make her want nothing more than to build a raft and swim as fast as her arms can paddle her.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/GilesMcAvey  
Pitch: : The story takes place in a world where mutants (people with special abilities) once existed, but were slaughtered by humans to avoid extinction. The protagonist one of the only remaining mutants, a shapeshifter, who has survived by constantly shapeshifting into other people. After years of solitude, constant hiding and not morphing into his own self, he's even forgotten what he looked out. Through the years, all of these have lead the protagonist to unconsciously create different personalities for his different appearances. The rising action of the story begins when he realizes he can't even remember who he really is, which personality is truly his.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/merkonical  
Pitch: : A player character of a video game struggles with his own identity due to inconsistencies in his decisions and behaviour. Quicksave and quickload rule his life though he doesn't know it, he never knows what decision will stick, he has a hard time knowing what his reality is. Did he slaughter the village or slay their dragon? The story will be told from the PC's perspective and will be set in a fantasy RPG.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/adiposehysteria  
Pitch: : As she navigates a painful divorce from her husband and tries to recover from a life of betrayal and abuse, Sarah realizes that she no longer has what so many other people take for granted – a name. We follow Sarah’s story as she evolves from a suicidal soon-to-be divorcee to someone who has found her own voice for the first time in her life. We see how the search for a name defines Sarah’s identity and leads her to discover who she might be, even if living this new life may be absolutely terrifying.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/eselir  
Pitch: : Waking up after a night too good to remember, Katya is all of a sudden able to read others' minds. She quickly learns that everyone seems to think of her very differently than she thought they did, including Milly, her girlfriend of three years. In an effort to keep the life she had built for herself, she starts to change her ways to please those around her. But in the process of doing so, she learns that something more sinister might be at play…  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
Discord / Morbidchic98#0903  
Pitch: : In the fey realm a human girl believes that she too is a fey, if not a little underdeveloped. During her time there she raised the ranks, trying to better her life and over the years she heard how the human world was destroyed and couldn’t be entered anymore. But one day someone claiming to be her older brother stumbles into the world in order to find her and offers her a way to the human realm where she can be human and reclaim the life she had forgotten. Crisis- Is she who she always believed she was or who someone claims her to be.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/MrDuckington  
Pitch: : Mark has a nice life. He has a great job, a nice house, and a beautiful girlfriend. After an accident, Jack begins to think that he is an android being tested by a shady organization.   
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/ScottWritesStuff  
Pitch: : Sera, the first child born on Mars, sees Earth as an alien planet. She finds beauty in the familiar red rocky landscapes and orange sky outside her glass dome, not in the strange greens and blues in her classroom's photos of foreign lakes and forests. Her parents and the other adults on Mars insist that she is an ""Earthling"" and a ""human,"" but Sera isn't sure. How can she be part of the their species if she wasn't even born on the same planet? Sera decides that she needs to take drastic action to prove her Martian identity once and for all.  
  -----------------------------------------------------------  
/u/Sublyte  
Pitch: : A young man with no talent wants to become an adventurer. He has no ability but is aware that if he travels to a certain temple he can gain the wondrous powers of a warlock. This would give him the powers to summon magical creatures and beings to fight for him. Doing so however would cause his name to be forfeit because names have special power. His name would become unspeakable when anyone referred to him and he would forget his name and who he was.  "

Mijn ambtsvoorganger heeft in overleg met de vragenstellers besloten de Kamervragen niet te beantwoorden. Beantwoorden van de Kamervragen zou onwenselijk extra aandacht kunnen geven aan de website www.werkenmetwajong.nl. Deze voormalige leden van de Tweede Kamer hebben de vragen echter nooit formeel ingetrokken.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3           
&amp;nbsp;    
Wilt u de gestelde vragen alsnog beantwoorden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja, zie in het vervolg van deze brief de &amp;#40;niet eerder verzonden&amp;#41; antwoorden op de Kamervragen uit 2016.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Constaterende dat onder Wajongers zich onder andere mensen met psychiatrische problemen, beperkte verstandelijke vermogens en autisme bevinden, onderschrijft u dat het verwerpelijk is om de financiële schaarste van deze kwetsbare doelgroep te gebruiken om ze te rekruteren voor de seksindustrie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5              
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke mogelijkheden ziet u om misbruik van verstandelijk beperkte mensen of mensen met psychiatrische problemen te voorkomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6              
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke actie is er sinds 9 juni 2016 genomen om misbruik van Wajongers door www.werkenmetwajong.nl te voorkomen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4, 5 en 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zie antwoord 4, 5 en 6 op de Kamervragen uit 2016 &amp;#40;hieronder&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 7            
&amp;nbsp;    
Zijn er klachten ingediend over www.werkenmetwajong.nl?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 8             
&amp;nbsp;    
Waar kunnen mensen met klachten over www.werkenmetwajong.nl zich melden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 7 en 8  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik ben in 2016 door het “Meldpunt Kinderporno op Internet” geïnformeerd over het bestaan van deze website. Ik heb geen kennis van ingediende klachten tegen de betreffende website. Mensen met klachten over de website werkenmetwajong.nl kunnen contact opnemen met UWV om, aan de hand van de inhoud van de klacht, samen vast te stellen waar deze het beste kan worden ingediend. Daarnaast kunnen mensen zich ook wenden tot particuliere initiatieven zoals www.klachtenkompas.nl of www.klacht.nl.

&amp;nbsp;    
Vragen van de leden Kerstens en Volp &amp;#40;beiden PvdA&amp;#41; aan de staatssecretaris van Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid over de website www.werkenmetwajong.nl. &amp;#40;ingezonden 9 juni 2016&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met de website http://www.werkenmetwajong.nl? Zijn er naar uw weten nog andere sites gericht op Wajongers die soortgelijke manieren van bijverdienen promoten?  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. Ik ben door “Meldpunt Kinderporno op Internet” geïnformeerd over het bestaan van deze website. Ik ben niet bekend met andere sites die expliciet gericht zijn op het aanbieden van soortgelijke bijverdiensten aan Wajongers. Wel leert een korte rondgang op internet dat de teksten van de betreffende website terugkomen op meerdere websites.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het adres van de genoemde site de indruk wekt dat het hier gaat om een overheidssite, een site die gelieerd is aan de overheid of een site met algemene informatie over overheidsbeleid betreffende de Wet arbeidsongeschiktheidsvoorziening jonggehandicapten &amp;#40;Wajong&amp;#41;? Zo nee, waarom niet? Deelt u de mening dat mensen die op zoek zijn naar officiële informatie over manieren om bij te verdienen als Wajonger eenvoudig op deze site terecht kunnen komen? Zo ja, welke conclusie trekt u daaruit? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nee, die mening deel ik niet. De naamgeving van de website verwijst niet naar een overheidsinstantie en de website oogt door de gebruikte opmaak en foto's als een commerciële website. Daarom ben ik van mening dat de genoemde site niet de indruk wekt dat het hier gaat om een overheidssite. De website maakt onderdeel uit van het openbare domein. Het is daarom zeer goed mogelijk dat personen op deze site terecht komen. Ik constateer echter op basis van een steekproef dat de website met een algemene zoekopdracht naar werk voor Wajongers niet op de eerste twee tot drie pagina’s naar voren komt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Kunt u nadere uitleg geven over de passage op de site dat de gepromote activiteiten plaats vinden ‘in overleg met de uitkeringsinstantie’? In hoeverre vinden deze activiteiten om bij te verdienen in de Wajong plaats in overleg met het Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen &amp;#40;UWV&amp;#41;? Deelt u de mening dat deze passage en andere links op de site naar UWV, de sociale dienst en de rijksoverheid de indruk wekken dat het hier gaat om officiële overheidsinformatie of dat de site een band heeft met deze overheidsinstanties? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, welke actie gaat u richting deze site nemen om deze indruk weg te nemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De website adviseert Wajongers om in overleg te treden met UWV over de mogelijkheden van bijverdienen en het effect daarvan op de uitkering. Het staat Wajongers vrij om op vrijwillige basis een baan te accepteren of op andere manieren geld te verdienen. Wajongers zijn echter op basis van de wet verplicht om UWV te informeren over feiten of omstandigheden die van invloed zijn op het recht en de hoogte van hun uitkering. Ik deel uw mening niet dat het enkele feit dat de website links bevat naar overheidsinstanties de indruk wekt dat het gaat om officiële overheidsinformatie. Met nadruk meld ik dat de rijksoverheid geen partner van deze website is, al stond de link naar de site van de rijksoverheid onder het kopje “Partners”. Mijn departement heeft daarom schriftelijk contact opgenomen met de beheerder van de website met het verzoek om de link naar www.rijksoverheid.nl te verwijderen. De beheerder heeft aan deze wens voldaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Deelt u de mening dat het onwenselijk is als mensen die zoeken naar officiële informatie over bijverdienen in de Wajong terecht komen op deze site? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet? Deelt u de mening dat het ongewenst is dat er een site over bijverdienen in de Wajong is die zich enkel toespitst op de manieren van bijverdienen die op werkenmetwajong.nl gepromoot worden? Zo ja, welke consequenties heeft dat? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5   
&amp;nbsp;    
Hoe beoordeelt u het risico dat Wajongers met een &amp;#40;verstandelijke&amp;#41; beperking via deze site ongewild in de &amp;#40;online&amp;#41; seksindustrie of prostitutie terecht komen? Welke actie gaat u ondernemen om dit risico bij deze site en mogelijke vergelijkbare andere sites te ondervangen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6   
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke actie gaat u ondernemen om ervoor te zorgen dat het op de site duidelijker wordt dat de beschikbare informatie geen officiële overheidsinformatie is? Welke actie gaat u ondernemen om ervoor te zorgen dat mensen die op zoek zijn naar officiële overheidsinformatie over bijverdienen als Wajonger op de juiste plaats terecht komen en niet op deze site? Bent u bereid om hierover met de site in overleg te treden en te pleiten voor aanpassingen in bovengenoemde richting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4, 5 en 6  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik besef dat de website betrekking heeft op ‘functies’ binnen een maatschappelijk omstreden bedrijfstak. Met uw Kamer hebben we daarom ook uitgesproken dat werkzoekenden deze functies ook niet aangeboden krijgen als passend werk. UWV biedt functies uit deze bedrijfstakken niet aan. De website geeft an sich juiste informatie en werft Wajongers boven de 18 jaar voor legale werkzaamheden. Wajongers mogen derhalve dit werk aanvaarden. Bemiddelen naar deze banen mag zolang er geen sprake is van dwang of opzettelijk profiteren van het onvermogen van iemand om een bewuste beslissing te nemen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn geen harde juridische belemmeringen voor deze website om zich in het algemeen voor de werving van sekswerkers te richten op Wajongers als doelgroep, maar het schuurt wel. Wajongers vormen een kwetsbare groep. Meer dan 75% van de Wajongers heeft vanwege een ontwikkelstoornis of een psychiatrisch ziektebeeld een Wajong-uitkering. De website ‘verleidt’ deze groep om &amp;#40;op zich legaal&amp;#41; thuiswerk te verrichten, terwijl niet duidelijk is of zij zich realiseren dat het om een maatschappelijk omstreden bedrijfstak gaat. Ik heb daarom UWV verzocht om intern UWV medewerkers die te maken hebben met Wajongers hierover actief te informeren, zodat zij alert zijn op deze vorm van bijverdiensten en indien Wajongers vragen hebben of melden dat zij gaan werken in deze branche Wajongers over de potentiële risico’s behorende bij deze werkzaamheden kunnen informeren.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast heeft mijn ministerie de beheerder van de website schriftelijk verzocht de activiteiten van deze website, specifiek gericht op Wajongers, te staken. De beheerder heeft de verwijzing naar de rijksoverheid verwijderd, maar zag geen reden om de activiteiten te staken.

This went on for a few more weeks and i decided to say fuck it, I'm not buying any more dells and I need it right then for my internship. So they decided to send me a refurbished one and now 2 years later, it's having another issue.... It just fucking died. It won't even get past the main dell logo or a black screen after. it just stays there for days.

7qmlbc,5,2018-01-15,Online reservation system for barber shops,gardynko,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/7qmlbc/online_reservation_system_for_barber_shops/,"Hi marketers!

I am looking for suggestions for a good online based reservation system/app that could be used in barber shops across country.

I recently started an internship in a barber company. 
Besides the fact that this is my first real digital marketing job ever, I am responsible for everything regarding digital marketing in the company (social media, seo, website content, paid ads etc.). 

There are 4 barber shops in total, the problem is most of the people make their reservations via Facebook. That wouldn’t be much of a problem if every barber shop spot that the company owns didn’t have its own FB page. 

I plan on merging those FB pages, but I need to come up with a solution for those reservations. 

My biggest concern is that every service the barber shop provides takes different amount of time, thus the system needs to provide an option where I can modify the times a single reservation takes, based on the service the costumer wants.

Thanks a lot!

7qmutw,1,2018-01-15,Coworker/Friend [28F] is treating me [25F] poorly and being extra friendly and conspirational with our other coworker [32F] who neither of us likes,glassballerina,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7qmutw/coworkerfriend_28f_is_treating_me_25f_poorly_and/,"A little background: I have been working at this company in the same department for almost 4 years. I work on a four-person team with two other women and a guy. One of the women, let’s call her Becky, used to be a very close friend of  mine since she started here about 2.5 years ago. Becky and I immediately bonded and became good friends outside of work, and I considered her one of my best friends. I was the person she chose to go with her to buy her wedding dress, I threw her a baby shower for her daughter, she supported me through some difficult family drama, she was a big part of me meeting my SO, etc. About a year ago she began acting cold and judgmental towards me, and overall started treating me differently. She has slowly ghosted me as a friend, and now we’re in an awkward place where we work together (our cubicles are right next to each other) but we aren’t really friends anymore. She has, in the last few months, talked negatively about me behind my back and ostracized me in our group. I know this, because people have told me that she’s been talking behind my back. Despite this, I have never had anything negative to say about her to anyone in the office, and I won’t. I honestly cannot pinpoint what has made her mad or why she’s no longer interested in being friends with me.

Now, the other woman I work with, Wendy, has been here four about 6 or 7 years. She is flat out AWFUL: narcissistic, manipulative, obnoxious, talks with a baby voice, flirts with married men in the office, steps on other people, gossips relentlessly, does things like taking EVERY phone call she gets on speaker, etc. Almost NO ONE in our office likes her, but she sucks up to enough of the bosses to where she feels safe in her position. Over the last two years she’s repeatedly been talked to, however, about her entitled attitude and other negative attributes, but never changes her behavior. I have never liked Wendy but have always maintained a cordial relationship with her out of survival. We’ve had small run-ins (she has taken credit for my work, for example) but for the most part it’s always been pretty positive between us. Becky has always HATED Wendy and has always smeared her behind her back.

So a few months ago, when I found out Becky had been trashing me behind my back, she also started sucking up to Wendy and treating her like her best friend. The two of them daily talk to each other in hushed voices in each other’s cubes, show each other pictures of their kids, gossip together, share intimate details about their lives, etc. It drives me crazy for so many reasons. You know how when someone is pissed at you they are extra super sweet to everyone else? It feels like that’s what Becky is doing. It’s so fake and, even though it’s immature of me, it really gets to me.

Last week I told my supervisor about an incident that occurred where our college intern misunderstood one of Wendy’s requests, and ended up wasting half her day on a wild goose chase. I was frustrated because I helped the intern with her work, only for Wendy to very rudely tell us that what we produced “WASN’T what I asked for!” I wanted our supervisor to know it wasn’t our intern’s fault and was an innocent misunderstanding. I also wanted him to know that perhaps Wendy could be clearer in the future with our intern. I was not going to address this to Wendy directly, as this never goes well. She is incredibly defensive and unprofessional, and I didn’t want to go there with her.

Today, she stopped in front of my cube while I was speaking to someone and said, “I’m glad you had the balls to go to our supervisor about me! WOW!” I calmly told her I explained to our supervisor that it was a misunderstanding. She said, “Well that’s NOT what he told me! He said you complained about me!” I wasn’t going to feed into her drama, so I said, “That’s unfortunate,” and turned around and continued doing what I was doing. A few hours later, Becky and Wendy are being extra super sickeningly friendly with each other, and they are speaking closely in whispers at Wendy’s desk.

I struggle with anxiety and depression, and in the last few months it’s worsened to the point where I’ve had to start medication. This situation is really making my anxiety worse, to the point where I feel like I don’t want to be at work.

Reddit, how do I handle this situation? Should I speak to Becky and Wendy? Should I speak to my supervisor? Should I completely ignore the situation and not stoop to their level?

Tl;dr: Coworkers are gossiping about me and creating drama with me, and it’s causing me a lot of anxiety. How do I handle this situation professionally?

It's a top 10 dominated by debuts this week!

The remix of Bruno Mars' 'Finesse' is our highest debut of the week at #1 thanks to Cardi B and an amazing music video that pays homage to 'In Living Color'. Haters might say it's fake as Justin Timberlake's comeback single 'Filthy' debuts at #2. Troye Sivan's sexy lead single 'My My My!' debuts at #3, which is impressive considering the short timespan it had to qualify for this week's Hot 50.

Two soundtrack singles from two anticipated movie releasing on February land in the top 10, as the lead single of the *Black Panther soundtrack* 'All The Stars', backed by Kendrick Lamar and SZA, debuts at #4, while the lead single for the *Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack*, 'For You', by Liam Payne and Rita Ora, debuts at #5.

CupcakKe finally earns her first solo top 10 hit here on r/popheads as LGBT anthem 'Crayons' debuts at #8. Her song 'Cartoons' is also this week's highest re-entry, charting at #19.

The rest of the top 10 remains the same as Camila Cabello's 'Never Be The Same' charts at #6 while Charli XCX's remaining songs from her mixtape Pop 2 'I Got It', 'Backseat' and 'Femmebot' chart at #7, #9 and #10 respectively.

Just after being the song with the biggest decline last week, Lemon manages to gain back 20 spots in the chart at #25 while BROCKHAMPTON earns this week's biggest decline as 'BOOGIE' might see itself out of the chart next week at #48.

* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #1. Bruno Mars - Finesse (Remix) (feat. Cardi B)	
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #19. CupcakKe - Cartoons
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #25. N.E.R.D. &amp; Rihanna - Lemon (+20)  
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #48. BROCKHAMPTON - BOOGIE (-30)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs:

Taylor Swift may not be in the top 10 right now but her currently highest charting song this week 'Delicate' charts at #13, her lucky number! Will the release of the music video of 'End Game (feat. Ed Sheeran &amp; Future)' increase the song's ranking from this week's rank at #17?

Speaking of music videos, Dua Lipa's new, amazing music video 'IDGAF' debuts at #20! Will it pull a 'New Rules' and chart at #1 soon?

Meanwhile, 'Havana (feat. Young Thug)' is slowly climbing up the charts thanks to the anticipation of Camila's self-titled debut album .

Rina Sawayma surprisingly has a great chart run as 'Cyber Stockholm Syndrome' charts at #26 in its third week. 

With the controversy of Lana Del Rey and Radiohead looming over the publishing rights of Lana's 'Get Free' due to its alleged similarities to Radiohead's 'Creep', 'Get Free' re-enters the charts at #34 while 'Creep' charts at #2490! Talent won?

Halsey's current single for hopeless fountain kingdom 'Bad At Love' finally debuts at #43. Meanwhile, 'Into You' remains strong as it remains at #49.

7qoheo,3,2018-01-15,Help describing color to my stylist,BiotechBeotch,FancyFollicles,https://www.reddit.com/r/FancyFollicles/comments/7qoheo/help_describing_color_to_my_stylist/,"Hey guys!
  
I'm in need of a little change, but I'm not sure what to tell my stylist. I'm not sure how they do consultations there, so I want to know what to say before I book an appointment.
  
I currently have collarbone-length, virgin, low porosity, dark auburn hair with a little bit of natural highlights. 2b/2c if it matters. I've been toying back and forth with going blonde and I think I've finally decided to do it! Here are my questions (can post reference pictures in the comments if necessary):
  
1) I'm warm toned and pale, so I want a warm, golden/honey blonde that won't wash me out. I also want to leave my roots dark so that maintenance is lower/easier. Will the blonde/dark auburn blend be weird or should I go for a more strawberry blonde look? 

2) I also assume I need a cut to take off the dead ends with all that processing. Would this be described as a cut, color, and balayage? Or just cut and color? Just so I know what kind of appointment to book.

2) Will I also get charged for double processing since I'm going to need to lighten my hair? Will I likely need two appointments?
  
3) I'm likely going to be gone from late May-earlyAug for an internship &amp; I don't want to have to go to a stylist I don't know in a strange city, lol. Should I wait to color my hair until March/April, or will it be fine to do in February if I'm doing the low maintenance/dark root look?"

I work best without a lot of background noise. But, I feel like wearing the headphones would help me but come across as rude to the other interns that sit around me. What do you think? Does anyone do this themselves?

7qol8j,14,2018-01-15,Tech of 12 years wondering if I should start pharmacy school? Long but any thoughts would be appreciated.,verapamil12,pharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pharmacy/comments/7qol8j/tech_of_12_years_wondering_if_i_should_start/,"This post might be a little spastic. My brain is going in too many directions right now. I’ll include a TL;DR at the end. 

I am a mid 30s married lady (no kids, 1 kitten) and have been a tech for 12 years with 100% being in either hospital or compounding, mostly high risk sterile (only real retail experience was a 6 week internship while in school). I originally went to tech school because I worked at a retail store and a customer filled out a credit app and said she made 70k/year as a tech (huge lie obviously) and I thought “hey I can do that”. So I went to the school on the tv (for profit school that lied about accreditation and is now extinct) using borrowed money. 

I have been a tech since 2006 and I generally really like my work and I’m really, really good at it. I love working in hospitals and high-risk compounding is fun (while also being incredibly stressful). I’ve trained tons of techs, pharmacy students and pharmacists on all aspects of sterile and non-sterile compounding and was in charge of ensuring sterility and patient safety of all sterile items our lab made (without any cool title or real acknowledgment). But no matter what cool “tech tricks” I know, I’m still a tech making tech money with very little chance of ever making more. 

So I’m currently unemployed and looking to go back to school. I’ve always thought about going to pharmacy school but when I would compare my job to theirs, excluding pay, mine was better. They’re talking to people about rubbing hormone creams in places and staring at a computer all day and I’m making exciting chemical reactions and using horseshoe crab blood to test for endotoxins (so cool!). But I’ve moved and now live in a tiny town (for husband’s job) where the hospital employs 3 techs and 4 pharmacists and they’re not looking to leave so my tech options have shrunk considerably. 

I currently have a (useless) AS but am thinking of going back to school starting from scratch. I have a community college nearby, there’s a pharmacy school about an hour away that doesn’t require the PCAT and from what a friend/2nd year pharmacy student said, being a tech gives your app more weight when applying. So if I start in summer, I’ll be early 40s when I graduate and it’ll be 2025-2026 (assuming I get accepted 1st try)...and in $100k debt...and possibly horrible job prospects. 

After I graduate I’m willing to move literally anywhere for a good job. I would love to work in hospital or compounding since that’s what I have tech experience in but I don’t know how possible that is (I saw how many students were on a hospital residency at my last hospital). Non traditional pharmacist jobs are also very interesting to me, like nuclear pharmacy and I’m sure there are lots of non-pharmacy pharmacist jobs available that I’ve never even thought of and would be open to. I really just don’t want to work retail unless that’s my only option. 

So my main question is, should I do it?? I’m not so young anymore (that’s hard to admit) and I don’t want to be graduating in 7 years to no jobs with a ton of debt. My option if I don’t do pharmacy school is probably gonna be computer programming but I’ve thought only about pharmacy so long, that’s still very changeable. 

I appreciate any of you that read this incredibly long brain vomit. I figured if anyone had any real life experience and insight with this situation, it would be here. 
If you have any thoughts or possibilities I missed, please let me know. 

TL;DR- hospital/compounding (no retail) tech of 10+ years trying to figure out if I should start from 0 and go to pharmacy school. Open to moving anywhere and doing not-usual pharmacist jobs. Should I???  "

I had my internship for a year under J1, my visa expired last Dec.31, which was the last day of my training. My date of entry in the US was January 12,2017 as stated on my I-94. I applied for change of status through a SEVP-certified college around mid-November. I received my receipt notice from USCIS saying they have received my application on Dec.15. I can now access my case status online, and it’s saying “my case was received”. What to do next?

I’ve always thought that after receiving the receipt I would just need to sit and wait for the decision from USCIS. Not until one of the administrators from the college told me that I would need to apply for extension of visa while waiting for my Change of Status to F1 to be approved? Is this true? I have done my research before even applying for change of status? I’ve never read such rule before except for those who came to US under Tourist Visa? Can someone help? Thank you."
7qovbh,25,2018-01-15,She (F32 landwhale) thought that I (M26) wanted a booty call...,delta9mm,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/7qovbh/she_f32_landwhale_thought_that_i_m26_wanted_a/,"Tl;Dr I only wanted a usb bootable copy of win10. 


So tomorrow I will finally finish building my custom PC, total cost about 1500$ for a top tier gaming PC that would have cost thousands more from a facspec build. I had to build a new PC after my 5 year old gaming PC finally died after years of Adobe and total war abuse. It was actually pretty sudden.

I started this whole process about a week ago, so I've been glued to my kindle fire for a lifetime now, as per my perspective. When my PC died I had just gotten a request from my internship partners to rebrand some stuff for them, as I'm a graphic designer. But that night my PC died mid-illustrator session, this was last monday. The rebranding was supposed to finish for the issue by friday, but after several set backs I was forced to call off the rebranding, which is pretty much career suicide for doing such a thing but unfortunately I had no choice since I'm effectively DOA without a PC. 

My setbacks started with the ram, as I didn't realize that my old ddr3 ram was incompatible with the new ddr4 motherboard slots, so I put in a rush order for the new ddr4 ram cards. With the new ram I was able to get my PC to start the booting proccess, but I soon found myself realizing that I screwed up because my old HDD didn't have the motherboards drivers, which caused my PC to crash after getting to the log on screen. I soon enough found myself looking at a clean reinstall for Windows 10 in order to get the motherboard drivers to install into my HDD in place of my old motherboards drivers. 

Queue the drama, I spent a day looking and thinking over the weekend for where I could get a fresh copy of Windows 10. Wal-Mart is effectively too far to get to where I'm at, so that was out. And In comes the landwhale. She's unattractive at best and hambeastly at worst, but she wants my dick and she can hear that old clock ticking, and I knew it. So I used her. I called her up, as her number is plastered everywhere as she's the poor and near destitute cleaning maid for the apartment complex I live at. 

As soon as she realizes it's me calling she jumped in her car and drove clear across the state because she thought her first lay was there and all for the low low price of letting me use her laptop for about 15 minutes so I could get the tech preview for windows 10 from the Microsoft website into a bootable usb. Me having to call her was my mistake, as I had already gotten the Windows 10 tech preview 2 years ago but subsequently lost that usb after I moved here. 

So she drives here on iced roads across state, and then she gets here and she spends another hour to get her hambeastly body ready for her ravishing and impregnation, but then I tell her that I only needed her laptop and that I'd use it in the lobby. You could feel the gravity and the earthquake from her heart sinking. I got her laptop and downloaded windows 10 and gtfo before the earthquakes started. Yuck. Thank God I'm monk mode. 

and now for the happy ending.

After booting up my PC I realized that my HDD was formatted in the MBR format and that it needed to be of the GPT format. I then found myself pouring over the internet for said insane reason.Should I risk the hambeasts torment just to use Rufus to reformat the Windows 10 tech preview just so I could boot my PC up or should I just spend 100$ and speed rush a brand new Toshiba HDD here so I don't have to clean reinstall Windows 10 and thus lose all of my precious tranny porn and my artwork?

I chose the new HDD.


Lol but just the sight of her being all made up was ducking hilarious. I laughed for a full hour afterwards. But the Asian girl that I know that walked by while I was getting windows 10 would look 10/10 if she did some running sometimes. Good God yes.


Thanks, my bros, you all are ducking inspirational to this ""young"" MGTOW!

7qph4d,0,2018-01-15,Seriously in shock about my Surface Pro being repaired. What more can I do?,LeagueOfMinions,GeekSquad,https://www.reddit.com/r/GeekSquad/comments/7qph4d/seriously_in_shock_about_my_surface_pro_being/,"So I got a new Surface Pro in July 2017 and about early December, a small screen defect appeared on the display. Nothing crazy but I was a bit peeved that this appeared randomly. But since I had the GeekSquad Protection plan I thought I could get this fixed up easily. Man was I so wrong..

I first took the device to a Microsoft Store and they said that they need to replace it with a new device but that would void the GeekSquad plan so they suggested I bring it to my BestBuy to get it worked out. I take it in to Best Buy Geek Squad on Dec 23rd and they tell me they'll have my device back in 2-3 weeks. Perfect. I'm on winter break for a month and my internship starts in February. 

Fast forward to this week, about FOUR weeks later, the device is still 'being repaired'. I call multiple times but get no real help. They tell me someone will be in touch with me, but I get no calls or emails. But I finally got an actual status update on my device today. The GeekSquad page says it'll need to be replaced. I already knew that and the Microsoft Store told me that in 5minutes. Why did it take four weeks for GeekSquad to tell me this?? I could have literally gone to my Microsoft Store and gotten a replacement in 30minutes. Round trip!

So I call the support line, and after being on hold for an hour, the agent tells me that they're going to replace my device and it'll take 30 days to get it back. 30 DAYS??? I literally burst out laughing due to disbelief. I told them to just send back my device asap. No can do apparently. I have to go in store and tell the manager I want my device back, so I set up an appointment for tomorrow afternoon to rip them a new one. 

What more can I do at this point?? I need my device as soon as possible and it does not seem likely I will get it any time soon. Can't I just get a replacement one at Best Buy? Would that void my protection plan? Don't give a damn about my data anymore after this horrible experience. This is absolutely ridiculous. I better get some store credit after this mess. 

TLDR: New Surface Pro got a screen defect. Took it into GeekSquad. They tell me it'll take 2-3 weeks. 4 weeks later they tell me the entire device needs to be replaced (which the Microsoft Store would do for me on the spot but voids the Geek Squad protection plan which is why I didn't do that). It'll take an additional 30 days to get my new device back from Geek Squad. I tell them to just send my device back asap, they said they can't unless I talk to a in-store manager. Wow. Going in tomorrow to talk to a manager. 

Update edit: don't know why I was downvoted but I went in today and they offered me store credit for a new device. They wouldn't offer a refund of the protection plan but so had to argue with them a bit to give me $75 off on the device. Thank you all for your advice. Probably won't ever purchase Geek Squad protection again. Definitely not for a Surface product. "

I finally made it again!,victory_or_oblivion,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7qqfz0/overdue_90_days_post_i_finally_made_it_again/,"I've been so busy lately that I kept pushing back writing about my 90 day streak. If you don't read all of this, then you can just read this short paragraph. 90 days isn't enough for a full reboot. It's just not, at least for me. I have dreams about relapsing and there are times when I remember old videos I frequently watched and really want to go back and watch them. The goal of this isn't about not wanting to watch them anymore, it's just about gaining control of yourself and crushing instant gratification. Focus on building your skills and pursue more job opportunities, stop worrying about pleasing everybody, and value yourself and your time. I'm sure there are a lot of you struggling more than I am, but I want to let you all know that I'm rooting for you and care about you beating this addiction! Thanks if you read any of this, and walk tall!

If you want to hear the details, here's what's changed in my life and how I made it this far. I'll keep them as short and interesting as possible.

The last time I went this long without PMO was four years ago, in high school, when I had a girlfriend. I had relapsed a couple of days before we had broken up because I saw it coming. I'm proud to say that I made it this far again, but without a girlfriend this time.

What's Changed:
- I got a second job doing something I love, with good hopes of a well-paying position after I graduate soon, and even interviewed for an internship last week! While I don't really claim NoFap as the cause for either of these, I feel much more comfortable in both environments from doing it.
- I deleted Tinder and Bumble. Not that I think there's anything wrong with having either. I just believe that I'll find a girl in God's time, even if she's not ""the one"" yet. Not having either app is better than swiping for two hours before bed and trying to hold a conversation with girls who don't even know why they have it.
- I'm significantly less nervous around girls (and people). I'm definitely not super duper confident like so many guys think they'll be once they hit 90 days, but I'm a lot better than I used to be. Can I talk to anyone in class? Yes. Can I walk across the bar and talk to that hunnie over there? Still probably can't. In time? Yeah, maybe.
- I don't feel anywhere near ashamed about myself. It's nice knowing that I'm probably one of the few guys around campus that doesn't spend his nights browsing the hub; wasting his time and energy. I don't get anxious at work, school, or church talking to people while I think about what I hate about myself.
- I avoid scrolling on Instagram for more than 5 minutes. I usually don't do it at all. It always puts these two girls that I like at the top of my feed. You know how Insta goes these days. People just post a bunch of pictures of them having the time of their lives while you sit there on the toilet thinking about what you're doing with yours. I feel better just posting maybe once a month, liking a few pictures, then getting off and doing something useful.

How I Did It:
Well, I went on a few dates with a girl I met off of Tinder. We went out for about a month. She was bisexual and didn't really share my political views, but I gave her a shot because I thought she was really cool. And hot, obviously. I was doing alright on NoFap when we started seeing each other, and having someone to go on dates with always helps me abstain. I found out pretty quickly that she was a slut, had a a messy past, and watched porn still. She also had views about sex that didn't align with mine, but I won't get into the details. When I told her that I was ceasing to watch porn and masturbate, and wanted to try saving my virginity until marriage, I'm pretty sure that's when she decided to be done with me, but took her a week or two to decide. (Another girl from very recently was really turned-on by my choice and kept trying to bed me, so it varies.) Though she told me she could never get back together with her ex, she lied to me about being sick and hung out with him shortly after (good ol' Snapchat stories). After getting over it, I decided that I was going to stick to this hardcore and be a better man than any of the guys she would date again, or most girls for that matter. I was going to drop PMO, focus on school, pursue extra-curriculars, and find more job opportunities - and I have!

It's late and I'm not really sure how to end this. I guess I'll just reiterate that whatever happens, don't give up. Persistence is key, my dudes. Thanks again if you stuck around to read this, it means a lot!

You've never actually been inside a castle before. At least, not a real one. In your home country of Yalinia, there are several castles that have been converted to museums. You visited all of them in your youth, delighting in the fun (though often brutal) history of your country's rise from loose collection of nation-states to sizable empire to regional power to Soviet satellite to modern, well-respected, mostly-Westernized democracy.

You've pretty much memorized every bit of Yalinian history. Your talent for key dates and eloquent writing put you first in your class at University of Yalinia, majoring in History, and you followed up your success with an internship in the Prime Minister's office. When the party won the next general election, you were promoted to the Prime Minister's Executive Ambassador, tasked with giving speeches around the nation and meeting foreign guests, dazzling them with your poise, your beauty, your eloquence... and, occasionally, your textbook knowledge of every King of Yalinia from Boriv I (1112-1134) to King Maliar I (1971-1990).

Though you know them all by name, you've never actually met a Yalinian noble. Maliar I, hated by the citizens and in bad health, was exiled from the country by the new democratic regime, branded a puppet of the dissolving Soviet Union. In your view, it was a poor way to end the lineage, but it had to be done to appease the citizenry, who were facing double-digit unemployment and a hatred for all things old.

Now, your techno-centric and increasingly multicultural country is missing something else:

heritage.

When the PM saw his party's polling numbers, he brought you in and gave you a mission.

'Go to the island,' he said, referring to Isle Sade, the sight of your now-deceased final King's Exile and the home of his still-living son, 'and convince the Prince to return.'

No duty he'd ever given you had been more ludicrous. Given the way your government viciously spurned Prince Maliar II's father, it seemed unlikely he'd just come ambling back to his former home. It's not like he could anyway. They've turned his bedroom into a gift shop.

But you had to go, not just because you've been asked, or because it would definitely make 99% of your fickle countrymen proud.

You did it because you wanted to be part of history.

And not because you hadn't been laid in a year.

----

The horse-drawn carriage rumbled and shook as it made its way up the mountainside toward the castle. You thought it was a bit ridiculous that you had to ride in a carriage, but this was what had been booked for you, and the islanders hadn't spoken Yalinian in 400 years, so you couldn't change the reservation. The island's people are mostly Italian, the boot-shaped nation having taken ownership of the island after Russia gave it up following WWII. The Yalinians protested the decision, leading to government crackdowns that culminated in the Yalinia University Massacre of 1953. After that, few people openly protested Italy's theft. You wrote a whole paper on this, actually. You got an A. You always got an A.

You were reviewing everything you learned in your Modern Yalinia courses when the carriage came to a stop. The driver, a spry man in his 60s with obvious Yalinian heritage, opens the door for you. You stepped out and took in the sight of Prince Maliar II's castle. Designed in 19th-century Yalinian fashion, with its large spires and turrets and ornamented outer walls, it hits you right in your nationalistic pride. This may be the most well-preserved castle of its kind, you think to yourself, staring up at it with big, glimmering eyes.

Something else has been well-preserved too. The Prince's clothing. A flourish sounds from two trumpeters standing at the top of his staircase. The double doors open, and out steps Prince Maliar II, wearing the ceremonial red cape, black vest, and brown leather boots with gold buckles. He looks quite like his grandfather did, in those few photos you could find of the man, and there's an uncanny resemblance to other Kings you've seen in paintings. That square jaw, those vibrant green eyes, that broad-shouldered build.

He could easily pass for Aemon The Great himself.

You move up toward the bottom step. ""You could pass for Aemon the Great, Sir,"" you say to the Prince, as he meets you at the bottom of the staircase.

He looks down at you, wrapping his hand over the top of his golden scepter. 

You're the first Yalinian citizen to speak with the Prince face-to-face in 25 years. As far as introductory lines go, that's a pretty good one. Complimentary, and true, but you were careful not to use his title, which might've implied some actual legal power if he interpreted it that way.

It's the way he reacts that sets you uneasy, though. Those eyes stay locked on you, making you feel like a dumb little schoolgirl. Why is he just looking at you like that? He knew you were coming. This is the culmination of months of planning.

Think... Think! Then, you realize.

Does he not know who Aemon the Great is?

""Perhaps,"" he replies, in a French accent. He spent most of his boyhood in that country before being sent to Sade Island to live out his days as a sort of 'playboy Prince,' traveling Europe and doing, well, whatever he wanted. Anywhere but Yalinia, at least.

You decide to change tack. ""Erm, to what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you so... formally dressed?"" you ask.

He sticks out his hand. The hand that touched the scepter. you're about to touch the hand that touched the scepter! the real one! They have a reproduction back in Castle Masoch, and your parents took you to see it for your 10th birthday party, but they don't let anyone touch it, even though it's a reproduction. And now you're about to touch a hand that -

no, wait. 

You're about to shake hands with *the Prince!*

Okay, he's not really the Prince. Sure, he still gets to use that title, but it's barely ceremonial. 

But you'll take what you can get. You smile brightly and stick your hand out as well, shaking politely.

*snap.*

You turn your head sharply to see the driver standing atop his carriage, holding a Polaroid camera. The photo prints out of the slot.

""You got it, Ennis?"" shouts the Prince.

""Ay, Mal!"" he says, giving a thumbs up and smiling with half his teeth.

Flummoxed, you pull your hand away and turn back to the Prince. ""W-what was that?"" This was supposed to be clandestine meeting. Totally private. Aside from the servants, the Prince lives out here alone.

But you hadn't anticipated the carriage driver. You thought they drove cars. Hell, this island has a fucking airport.

""Ennis is my royal photography. They all have one. Even the American president. He's not a noble, though."" He frowns a bit, having met Trump before.

""But... What's he going to do with it?"" This is troubling. If the PM finds out you let the news of this meeting slip on the first day, you'll be in deep shit.

The carriage is off before you can chase the driver down.

""Come on, then. Let's see what you have to say."" The Prince turns on you, his cape billowing in the wind, and makes his way up the staircase, poised and dignified as any true castle owner.

You follow awkwardly up, pulling your pink travel bag behind you.

-----

""Oh, thank you."" You accept the glass of wine from the butler, who serves you before delivering the Prince his glass on a tray. The living room is elegant with its 18th-century drapes and wood-paneled walls and Yalinian Bear-skin rug by the fireplace. It's a far cry from your one-room apartment down the street from the capital. Government does not pay well.

""Mr. Sade,"" you remark politely. ""As much as I would love to move forward with our discussion, I do have to put forth some reservations about your driver's actions.""

The Prince sips his wine. You try yours as well. Heavenly.

""What did old Ennis do, then? He didn't ask you for a kiss on the ride up, did he?""

""Erm, no."" Was that a possibility? ""I meant about the photograph.""

""Hmph.""

""You don't see any issue with allowing him to have that?""

""No, I don't."" 

Well, alright. If it's just a local's souvenir, then -

""I doubt he'll be credited when it's published,"" adds the Prince in a light voice.

You nearly spit up your wine. ""Pardon?""

He blinks at you.

""Mr. Sade,"" you say, setting your wine down. ""This meeting was meant to be private! We shouldn't let local carriage drivers send the photos to the press!""

the Prince swirls his glass. ""How much do you think Ennis will get for the photo?""

""I hardly think that's relevant.""

""Just answer the question.""

Alright, fine. He's the host, and the once-to-be ruler of your country. A little concession is necessary. ""Thousands, I suppose.""

""*Star* Magazine offered half a million for a photo of the Prince shaking hands with a visiting delegate. I'll see that he gets the full sum, if not more.""

You bristle at that. ""The agreement was that this would be *private,*"" you remind him.

""Hm. Agreements."" The butler refills the host's wine. ""And what was the agreement your party's Prime Minister made with my Father in 1989, after the wall fell?""

Blood flows away from your face. The stipulations of the agreement were complex and are still controversial, but the fact is, the government betrayed the King and went back on their word. You hadn't even been born yet, though. ""Jean Jurisa is in jail now,"" you say, a feeble excuse for what Mr. Jurisa, the then-Prime Minister, did to King Maliar I. He went there for corruption charges not having to do with the broken Royal Agreement.

""Ah. Yes. And what was the Yalinian government's agreement with the citizen's of this island, when Rome sent its soldiers in 1963?""

Oh, God. *That* bit of history. Some historians argue that it isn't actually a part of Yalinian history. The island was under Italian control at the time, and Yalinia was in a weakened state. They had no way of protecting or saving its ethnic citizens on Sade Isle. The King, Maliar's grandfather, had been on a diplomatic trip in Moscow when the Romans came in and started busting up Yalinian shops on the island, brandishing weapons at Yalinian schoolchildren (in a famous photo), and allegedly killing upwards of 200 ethic Yalinians. While Yalinians and Italians on the island see themselves as equals today, the history remains. Maliar's grandfather was furious and demanded action, but the government, controlled by the Soviet's, swept it all under the rug despite the King's protests.

""I'll admit, my memory is foggy. That particular betrayal happened 40 years before I was born."" He grows quieter. ""But Ennis remembers. He remembers his wife.""

That's all he has to say. You understand. The man's been a poor carriage driver for 50 years. At least now he can die rich, and make sure his children have something to inherit.

So. The Prince's intentions in naming Ennis his 'royal photographer' are noble. Well, maybe - 

Wait. If the Prince wanted Ennis to have 500k... why didn't he just give him that much? The dude is a freaking *billionaire*.

""Sir Maliar,"" you reply, ""While I can see the eleemosynary intention behind your actions, our government has been quite overt in its apologies to the way you and your Father were treated. I'm sure you understand there were vastly different political and diplomatic considerations to keep in mind during that tumultuous period of history. But things have changed.""

""Oh, so I'm King now?"" he asks laconically.

""No,"" you reply curtly. ""You are not. And you never will be.""

Harsh, but true. The man slightly pouts, making his beautiful lips stick out a bit more. How you'd love to touch them.

No, no! Focus, girl!

""But you can be something more than an island dweller. You can come back to your country of birth. You can be a part of our future. You can inspire school children, rouse our soldiers, help us all be better than we already are. The country is changing, Maliar. We want you to be part of that change.""

And we need your return to be part of our campaign stump speeches, you think to yourself. Oooh, and if he actually joined the party itself? You guys would be in power for the next 25 years. Long enough for a certain young female upstart with a stellar resume to end up Prime Minister.

""It all sounds like a storybook,"" says the Prince. You glance up at him and see the genuine interest on his face. That glimmer of hope in his emerald eyes.

""It is just a story,"" you admit. ""Until you make it a reality.""

He smiles. God, what white teeth. ""Can you tell your boss something for me, then?""

You lean forward. Oh my god, did you actually do this?! ""What?"" you ask breathlessly.

""Can you tell him to take my scepter and stick it up his fat pompous ass?""

You sit back in your chair, frowning. He just keeps smiling at you. When the butler laughs, you start to fume.

""Make all the gross jokes you want, Maliar,"" you shoot back, ""go ahead and stay on this shitty Italian Island for the rest of your life. We're trying to put together a Yalinia not seen since days of the Empire, and we've been doing a pretty good damn job of it without you. Frankly, I think we can hit 3% GDP growth with you stuck out in this dilapidated castle.  Should be pretty easy, since we won't have you rummaging around our coffers, scrounging up our tax money to take fucking Emma Watson to dinner.""

Okay, that rumor was debunked. Emma Watson's agent swore the two were never dating. Still, it works to wipe that smile off the Prince's face. And you swear the butler was about to laugh before he scurried off into the kitchen.

""What a tongue on this snake,"" he muses.

""Snake?"" you spit, grimacing. ""I'd rather be a snake than a fucking... *boy.*""

The 'boy' stands. With his cape off, you can see the corded muscles of his forearms, and his pecs threatening to break the buttons on the front of his shirt. He takes a few large booming steps forward until he's standing directly in front of you. You're helpless. You can't get up.

He looms above you, looking very, *very* displeased.

""Do you know the name of the last peasant to come into a King's castle and mock his stature?""

It's such a specific question. You know why he phrased it that way, though.

""Do you?"" he asks again, more firmly. You curl up in your massive seat, heart racing.

You nod rapidly.

""Say it.""

You stare at him with dinner plate eyes.

""Say her name.""

""Tania Ellory,"" you squeak.

Tania Ellory. 14th century Farmer's Daughter. The most famous beauty in the county, or perhaps the entire country. She certainly thought so. Men and minor lords came from far and wide to vie for her hand in marriage. She got such an inflated ego that she swore she was going to marry the King. People laughed, but no one wanted to tell the beauty she was mad. So the girl flirted her way across the Kingdom, snuck into the castle, and made a grand presentation of herself before his throne.

A peasant who broke into a castle would normally have her head lopped off. The King, however, was magnanimous, and complimented her on her intelligence, before asking her to politely leave.

Now, this is where it gets tricky. Sometimes when people tell this story - which is a really a myth, in your opinion, although archaeologists recently found evidence to the contrary, but anyway - when some people tell it, the girl got mad because he spurned her. In the morality tale version, she freaked out because the King had complimented her brains and not her beauty. In any case, she went crazy, screaming and cursing at the King who sat on fuming on his throne, decrying him as nothing more than a 'prissy boy who doesn't know what a woman has between her legs' and a 'cockless fae.' As soon as she was done, the King descended his throne, slapped her, and dragged her outside by her hair. With the sceptered guards waiting nearby, he set her on all fours, tied her ankles and wrists to posts nailed into the ground, and proceeded to destroy her.

The torments vary depending on who tells it. Some say whipping, others flogging, others spanking. She was naked, of course, and sobbed and begged and was, eventually, broken. The question of rape is dubious and muddled. 

In any case, he had her brought inside, bathed, and put into a wedding dress. That night, he married her off to a Palace cook, who made sure to feed her breads and cheeses and sweet cakes for every meal. Soon the girl was fat, then old, and never beautiful again.

Again, this is in the morality version. In an alternative telling - the one *you'd* believe if you thought this was anything but nonsense - he put her in a leash and kept her confined to his chambers, caging her during the day, and taking her out at night to use as he pleased. She stayed beautiful, but no one but he ever saw her again. You can turn this version into a sick joke by ending it with 'bark bark bark!' that always gets an uncomfortable laugh out of your gobsmacked listeners.

It's a story of pure sexism, cruelty, and real horror. It's also so famous that even American tourists have asked you about its veracity. You usually pretend to have never heard it.

But you have, of course. You know every detail and variation.

And you always thought it was bullshit that, despite allegedly committing such atrocities, they still call him Aemon the Great.

Whatever might be the case, Maliar's right. No other peasant in recorded history ever insulted a King, at least not to his face, and certainly not in his castle.

But you just did. Even though he's not a King, and barely a real Prince.

Looking up into his eyes, you have to ask yourself:

Would he do that to you?

He might.

But he wouldn't marry you off.

You can tell.

He'd keep you for his own.

And oh, fucking Christ.

You actually *want* him to.

""Go back to your little parliament,"" he snarls, stepping away from you. ""I've had enough of this chicanery. Ennis got his fortune, and the islanders have something to chat about for a while. Maybe they'll leave me alone from now on."" He turns away from you, and leaves, stomping through his castle to parts unknown.

You sit there, shocked in your seat. This was supposed to be a formal visit. You had a whole month set out, with the possibility of extending it to 3 if the negotiations carried on, while you lived in a guest house just outside the castle grounds.

Instead, you failed in 3 hours.

But he can't just demand you away. He doesn't have any real power to do that.

And while the castle is his, the guest house outside is technically Italian-land, leased by the Yalinian government.

Which means it's yours.

Going back would end your career. Staying would be tough - I mean, shit, you just got threatened to be Tania'd. But where there's hope, there's a way.

And though the hope is dim, you know you can still see this out.

Even if it means becoming his slave."

Kunt u tevens bevestigen dat het bij de stichting al een half jaar hommeles  
is en dat de Autoriteit Woningcorporaties afgelopen zomer al constateerde  
dat de governance van de woonstichting tekortkomingen vertoonde?

3  
Welke tekortkomingen vertoont de governance van de woonstichting precies,  
welke oorzaken liggen daaraan ten grondslag en moet vastgesteld worden dat  
de directeur-bestuurder van de woonstichting, in strijd met de statuten van  
de stichting, de Governancecode voor woningcorporaties niet heeft  
nageleefd?

4  
Kunt u bevestigen dat de Autoriteit Woningcorporaties &amp;#40;de Autoriteit&amp;#41; medio  
2017 al een interventie bij de woonstichting Vooruitgang heeft gepleegd?  
Wat was de aanleiding voor deze interventie en waaruit bestond deze?  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Welke redenen liggen ten grondslag aan het opstappen van de complete raad  
van commissarissen van de woonstichting Vooruitgang?  
&amp;nbsp;   
6  
Is het waar dat de Autoriteit vindt dat met het opstappen van alle leden  
van de raad van commissarissen de problemen eerder verergerd zijn? Deelt u  
die visie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Is het u bekend welke verergerde problemen de Autoriteit hierbij op het oog  
heeft en wat de overwegingen van de Autoriteit zijn om de woonstichting nu  
onder verscherpt toezicht te plaatsen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
Waarop is het verschil van mening tussen de directeur-bestuurder en de raad  
van commissarissen van de woonstichting gebaseerd?

9  
Kunt u bevestigen dat, in lijn met de statuten  en het Reglement werkwijze  
voor de raad van commissarissen van de woonstichting Vooruitgang, de raad  
van commissarissen toezicht dient te houden op het doen en laten van de  
directeur-bestuurder en deze zo nodig kan schorsen en ontslaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
Waarom heeft de raad van commissarissen niet besloten om de directeur-  
bestuurder te schorsen of te ontslaan?  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
Hoe kan het dat bij een substantieel verschil van opvatting over de  
governance tussen de raad van commissarissen en de directeur-bestuurder, de  
complete raad van commissarissen opstapt en de directeur-bestuurder  
aanblijft? Wat vinden de Autoriteit en u van deze &amp;#40;omgekeerde&amp;#41; gang van  
zaken?

12  
Worden op grond van de statuten van de woonstichting de leden van de raad  
van commissarissen benoemd door de raad van commissarissen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
Zijn er tijdelijk drie kandidaten benoemd in het kader van het intern  
toezicht? Zo ja, door wie zijn deze kandidaten aangezocht en benoemd, nu de  
raad van commissarissen in oude samenstelling al eerder voltallig is  
opgestapt?  
&amp;nbsp;

Wat vindt u, terwijl de woonstichting Vooruitgang onder verscherpt toezicht  
is geplaatst, van de mededeling van de directeur-bestuurder aan het  
gemeentebestuur van Teylingen dat het een interne kwestie betreft?  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
Wat vindt u van het feit dat de directeur-bestuurder, op grond van zijn  
perceptie dat het een interne kwestie betreft, weigert aan het  
gemeentebestuur van Teylingen volledige opening van zaken te geven over de  
exacte gang van zaken bij de woonstichting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
16  
Deelt u de conclusie dat vanwege de publieke taak van de woningstichting  
snel volledige openheid en transparantie noodzakelijk is, nu huurders en  
het gemeentebestuur van Teylingen, door de opstelling van de directeur-  
bestuurder, belangrijke informatie die hen direct raakt, ontberen?   
&amp;nbsp;    
17  
Onderschrijven u en de Autoriteit de opvatting van de directeur-bestuurder  
dat “deze bewaking niets met de bedrijfsvoering te maken heeft en er ook  
financieel niks aan de hand is. Integendeel, Vooruitgang is financieel  
hartstikke gezond”? Zo nee, wat is dan uw oordeel en waarop is dat  
gebaseerd?  
&amp;nbsp;    
18  
Op welke wijze kan gewaarborgd worden dat  de financiële continuïteit van  
de woonstichting Vooruitgang op korte en lange termijn gezond is, de  
plannen voor de sociale woningbouw in de gemeente Teylingen niet in het  
gedrang komen, de huurders van de woonstichting zich geen zorgen hoeven te  
maken en zij geen gevolgen zullen ondervinden van de gang van zaken bij de  
woonstichting?

I have been trying really hard to land a research/company internship in ML for the past few weeks, but professors and companies just don't seem to care. They seem to only want PhD's / Master's etc.

I am really into this field and I compete seriously in DL/ML Competitions ( Kaggle, Numerai ) and I have a bunch of projects in DL applied to CV and NLP. I have also gone through fast.ai and cs231n pretty rigourosly. And I work as a research assistant in my school, applying Deep Learning in CV. What more can I do to get noticed? Any internship program suggestions?

PS : If you're hiring, I am happy to send my resume over!
Cheers!"
7qts8s,8,2018-01-16,My [20M] girlfriend [19F] of a year and a half has decided to end our relationship and I feel like my whole world has come crashing down.,Dirty_Kite,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7qts8s/my_20m_girlfriend_19f_of_a_year_and_a_half_has/,"Writing everything and all my feelings down was just way too long a post, so the only relevant information from the past that is necessary to mention is that we operate on a long-distance basis, she has recently dropped out of university and is now on an internship, and our relationship suffered from a very rocky beginning and until recently was on the straight and narrow. I'm happy to clarify anything else in the comments.


With that out of the way, I guess let's start with last month. She suggested that we go to a festival together and I declined, not because I didn't want to spend time with her but because I had been the last two years, and last year we had gone to the same festival just the two of us. She has recently started an internship and is going with some of her colleagues and I didn't want to intrude on that - since she's started her new position this is the first time I've really seen her blossoming socially and I was really delighted to hear that she'd made the plans. I proposed we go on a city break instead, but she still seemed unhappy that I had turned down the festival invite. 

Over the holiday period we went to a lot of parties together with my friend group, and normally we'd be glued at the hip and socialising together but instead it just seemed like we were always pretty separate and distant. I guess that's largely my fault, I just figured that she's really come out of her shell lately and she's also a lot more familiar with my friend group, and I guess my thinking was that I didn't want to intrude on her having fun with the friends that we now share.

Things quickly began to crumble in January. For whatever reason, I wasn't myself and I made a few mean, offhand comments around New Year's which further drove a wedge between us. Things were just really sour: we weren't having sex and conversation dried up. I sensed something was wrong, and when she asked for a break just after the 1st it came as no surprise. Skip forward to my birthday party on the 6th and things pretty much resumed. My friends arrived and I think that distracted me from reading too much into the fact that we barely interacted at the party.


The last time I saw her was on my birthday on the 9th. My family and the two of us went out for dinner and I dropped her home, nothing seemed wrong that day at all, even if we were just together for a few hours. The next day, she said she was sorry to give me any impression that our break had ended, and she still needed to think about things. 

On Sunday, that's where things ended. She just said that she felt she had no other option, and when she thought about all of the things that I had done to hurt her (the vast majority of them being &gt;1 year ago), she just couldn't get over it. It was a complete shock to me, I just thought she needed some time off.


Yesterday things really began to settle in my head and I pleaded with her to take me back and promised that I'd prove to her how much I loved her and that I'd bring back the chemistry that she felt had been lost the last few weeks, but she didn't seem swayed in her decision.

I just don't know what to do. One half of me wants to just completely shut her off and hope that she'll come back to me. There's another half of me that is just frightened that she'll never return or even worse find someone better and that half of me wants to fight for all that it's worth because I feel like I need her and that I can't afford to lose her: she's truly the most beautiful and special person I've ever had the good fortune of meeting, she's irreplaceable to me.

All I know now is just how despairing and emotionally shattering this whole situation is. I've never known heartbreak until now because I've never known true love until now.

My name is XXX and I am aspiring to obtain a Master of Science degree in Biomedical Engineering.

I have always been a critical thinker, from the times my family and I would over analyze outrageous action movies to having discussions after the news to try to “solve the world’s problems”. Being raised with a critical thinking attitude has led me to pursue subjects like mathematics and the sciences. I also love being competitive and play a variety of sports as well as Division I college soccer. Participating in intercollegiate sports honed my time management skills, reinforced a strong work ethic, and bolstered the value of teamwork. Most of all, I developed a fascination with the human body, what it’s capable of, and how it fails. Through my father, an orthopedic surgeon, I was able to learn the current methods of how to repair the bodies failures through the details of his procedures. This upbringing became instrumental in my choice to become a biomedical engineer.

These attributes helped me at the University of XXX, where I graduated Magna Cum Laude. During my period of studying there, I took courses including Biomedical Engineering Materials, Biomechanics, Biofluid Mechanics, and Biomaterials. These courses raised my interest in regenerative medicine. I also have industry experience, including product development senior projects for Medtronic, a product development internship Company X and finally employment as a development engineer with Zimmer-Biomet. Throughout my experiences, I have learned the engineering design controls forward and backward, how to work well with others both individually and as a team member, and the importance of the documentation and testing processes. The orthopedic industry brought to light that even today, the “state of the art” orthopedic procedures involve a lot of tissue trauma and includes the implantation of foreign substances, including metals, polymers etc. I have observed a total hip and total shoulder arthroplasty in the operating room and have seen the toll it takes on the patient’s body. Though implants are the most effective treatment today, they can still come at a cost. I have witnessed these costs second hand through my mother, who underwent a total hip arthroplasty at a relatively young age. She had to give up activities she loved, is fearful of an inevitable revision, and she also needed many hours of physical therapy to fully recover. There must be a better way of helping people like my mother. That’s when I became aware of the treatment options of regenerative medicine, using biological tissue instead of hardware and causing less trauma to the patient’s body. In my mind, regenerative medicine then became the obvious future of medicine.

To further my knowledge of regenerative medicine, I contacted a coworker of my father, Dr. X. He is involved with Company Y, a clinical research, regenerative medicine, and autologous adult stem cell company. He introduced me to adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stems cells and their ability to differentiate into hyaline cartilage within joints. This new-found knowledge opened my eyes to all the possibilities of regenerative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. Cell scaffolds are made of proteins derived from the patient’s cells. These scaffolds give the chondrocytes a base to migrate to and induce tissue repair. Gene Therapy solves the problem of osteoarthritis by targeting the disease process rather than the symptoms. Viral and Non-viral vectors are then used to carry the therapeutic genes to the faulty cells to induce growth and repair. These treatments and therapies can be used for different types of diseases and injuries. Many of the treatments are already making a dramatic difference today. Just recently the FDA approved the first gene therapy for an inherited disorder that causes childhood blindness. In the study, 90 percent of the 29 patients had improved their vision. This an extremely exciting and hopeful time for people with genetic disorders and/or other problems that were once considered untreatable and are now hopeful of the possibility of a cure. The continued success for regenerative medicine will only further the exponential growth of the field. With respect to my current research interests, the University of Colorado Boulder is ideal for what I would like to study. I am particularly interested in working with Associate Professor XXXx to develop ……….. Upon completing the master of science degree, I plan on continuing to further my education by obtaining a doctorate degree in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

If accepted, I would be honored to join your program and your university in order to further the advances in regenerative medicine."
7qup1o,1,2018-01-16,College Student and First Internship Interview Advice,murpheson,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7qup1o/college_student_and_first_internship_interview/,"Hi r/accounting people!

I've enjoyed this subreddit for the past year or so and this is my first post here. I've seen a lot of good advice given and was hoping for some myself.

A little background: 

Im 26, soon to be 27 and took my good old time deciding what to do with my life. Ended up getting an associate's degree in business administration and transferred this spring to a 4 year school and am double majoring in accounting and finance. I did about 140 tax returns last year for a company I'm sure you all know and am with that company still. 

I got an email from someone in the accounting and finance department of my University about a small CPA firm (6 total employees) looking for an intern for this tax season (and could be longer depending on how it works out). I sent my resume, cover letter, and an email to the owner last Friday and got a call to set up an interview on Monday. Its a part time (15-20 hrs/week) paid internship. This would be ideal because I could still work there and not leave my current office totally out to dry and I'd be getting some good experience and a resume builder. Granted I don't have a ton of experience but I do have quite a bit more than someone who's never done taxes. I'm really excited for the opportunity but I had a few questions about it.

Questions: 

1. Should I wear a suit? (Probably yes?)

2. Are there any standard questions I should be prepared for as a college student and potential intern that I may not be able to answer naturally? ( I'm a good interviewee, just a little nervous. This is just kind of a big deal to me so I want it to go well)

3. What would be a reasonable salary to accept? I know a B4 would be higher but with such a small firm, and considering I'm not totally clueless, what sort of range should I expect?

4. Would I still be able to work both jobs or would there be a conflict of interest working for two local companies? If so, could I sign some sort of legal document that states that I won't steal clients?

Thanks in advance!"

Antwoord van staatssecretaris Van Ark &amp;#40;Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid&amp;#41;  
&amp;#40;ontvangen 16 januari 2018&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
Bent u bekend met de website http://www.werkenmetwajong.nl? Zijn er naar uw  
weten nog andere sites gericht op Wajongers die soortgelijke manieren van  
bijverdienen promoten?  
   
Antwoord 1  
Ja. Ik ben door “Meldpunt Kinderporno op Internet” geïnformeerd over het  
bestaan van deze website. Ik ben niet bekend met andere sites die expliciet  
gericht zijn op het aanbieden van soortgelijke bijverdiensten aan  
Wajongers. Wel leert een korte rondgang op internet dat de teksten van de  
betreffende website terugkomen op meerdere websites.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
Deelt u de mening dat het adres van de genoemde site de indruk wekt dat het  
hier gaat om een overheidssite, een site die gelieerd is aan de overheid of  
een site met algemene informatie over overheidsbeleid betreffende de Wet  
arbeidsongeschiktheidsvoorziening jonggehandicapten &amp;#40;Wajong&amp;#41;? Zo nee,  
waarom niet? Deelt u de mening dat mensen die op zoek zijn naar officiële  
informatie over manieren om bij te verdienen als Wajonger eenvoudig op deze  
site terecht kunnen komen? Zo ja, welke conclusie trekt u daaruit? Zo nee,  
waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2  
Nee, die mening deel ik niet. De naamgeving van de website verwijst niet  
naar een overheidsinstantie en de website oogt door de gebruikte opmaak en  
foto's als een commerciële website. Daarom ben ik van mening dat de  
genoemde site niet de indruk wekt dat het hier gaat om een overheidssite.  
De website maakt onderdeel uit van het openbare domein. Het is daarom zeer  
goed mogelijk dat personen op deze site terecht komen. Ik constateer echter  
op basis van een steekproef dat de website met een algemene zoekopdracht  
naar werk voor Wajongers niet op de eerste twee tot drie pagina’s naar  
voren komt.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
Kunt u nadere uitleg geven over de passage op de site dat de gepromote  
activiteiten plaats vinden ‘in overleg met de uitkeringsinstantie’? In  
hoeverre vinden deze activiteiten om bij te verdienen in de Wajong plaats  
in overleg met het Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen &amp;#40;UWV&amp;#41;?  
Deelt u de mening dat deze passage en andere links op de site naar UWV, de  
sociale dienst en de rijksoverheid de indruk wekken dat het hier gaat om  
officiële overheidsinformatie of dat de site een band heeft met deze  
overheidsinstanties? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, welke actie gaat u  
richting deze site nemen om deze indruk weg te nemen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 3  
De website adviseert Wajongers om in overleg te treden met UWV over de  
mogelijkheden van bijverdienen en het effect daarvan op de uitkering. Het  
staat Wajongers vrij om op vrijwillige basis een baan te accepteren of op  
andere manieren geld te verdienen. Wajongers zijn echter op basis van de  
wet verplicht om UWV te informeren over feiten of omstandigheden die van  
invloed zijn op het recht en de hoogte van hun uitkering. Ik deel uw mening  
niet dat het enkele feit dat de website links bevat naar  
overheidsinstanties de indruk wekt dat het gaat om officiële  
overheidsinformatie. Met nadruk meld ik dat de rijksoverheid geen partner  
van deze website is, al stond de link naar de site van de rijksoverheid  
onder het kopje “Partners”. Mijn departement heeft daarom schriftelijk  
contact opgenomen met de beheerder van de website met het verzoek om de  
link naar www.rijksoverheid.nl te verwijderen. De beheerder heeft aan deze  
wens voldaan.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
Deelt u de mening dat het onwenselijk is als mensen die zoeken naar  
officiële informatie over bijverdienen in de Wajong terecht komen op deze  
site? Zo ja, waarom? Zo nee, waarom niet? Deelt u de mening dat het  
ongewenst is dat er een site over bijverdienen in de Wajong is die zich  
enkel toespitst op de manieren van bijverdienen die  
op werkenmetwajong.nl gepromoot worden? Zo ja, welke consequenties heeft  
dat? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
   
Vraag 5  
Hoe beoordeelt u het risico dat Wajongers met een &amp;#40;verstandelijke&amp;#41;  
beperking via deze site ongewild in de &amp;#40;online&amp;#41; seksindustrie of  
prostitutie terecht komen? Welke actie gaat u ondernemen om dit risico bij  
deze site en mogelijke vergelijkbare andere sites te ondervangen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 6  
Welke actie gaat u ondernemen om ervoor te zorgen dat het op de site  
duidelijker wordt dat de beschikbare informatie geen officiële  
overheidsinformatie is? Welke actie gaat u ondernemen om ervoor te zorgen  
dat mensen die op zoek zijn naar officiële overheidsinformatie over  
bijverdienen als Wajonger op de juiste plaats terecht komen en niet op deze  
site? Bent u bereid om hierover met de site in overleg te treden en te  
pleiten voor aanpassingen in bovengenoemde richting?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4, 5 en 6  
Ik besef dat de website betrekking heeft op ‘functies’ binnen een  
maatschappelijk omstreden bedrijfstak. Met uw Kamer hebben we daarom ook  
uitgesproken dat werkzoekenden deze functies ook niet aangeboden krijgen  
als passend werk. UWV biedt functies uit deze bedrijfstakken niet aan. De  
website geeft an sich juiste informatie en werft Wajongers boven de 18 jaar  
voor legale werkzaamheden. Wajongers mogen derhalve dit werk aanvaarden.  
Bemiddelen naar deze banen mag zolang er geen sprake is van dwang of  
opzettelijk profiteren van het onvermogen van iemand om een bewuste  
beslissing te nemen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Er zijn geen harde juridische belemmeringen voor deze website om zich in  
het algemeen voor de werving van sekswerkers te richten op Wajongers als  
doelgroep, maar het schuurt wel. Wajongers vormen een kwetsbare groep. Meer  
dan 75% van de Wajongers heeft vanwege een ontwikkelstoornis of een  
psychiatrisch ziektebeeld een Wajong-uitkering. De website ‘verleidt’ deze  
groep om &amp;#40;op zich legaal&amp;#41; thuiswerk te verrichten, terwijl niet duidelijk  
is of zij zich realiseren dat het om een maatschappelijk omstreden  
bedrijfstak gaat. Ik heb daarom UWV verzocht om intern UWV medewerkers die  
te maken hebben met Wajongers hierover actief te informeren, zodat zij  
alert zijn op deze vorm van bijverdiensten en indien Wajongers vragen  
hebben of melden dat zij gaan werken in deze branche Wajongers over de  
potentiële risico’s behorende bij deze werkzaamheden kunnen informeren.  
Daarnaast heeft mijn ministerie de beheerder van de website schriftelijk  
verzocht de activiteiten van deze website, specifiek gericht op Wajongers,  
te staken. De beheerder heeft de verwijzing naar de rijksoverheid  
verwijderd, maar zag geen reden om de activiteiten te staken.)

# Details (for those interested in anonymous strangers' financial history)

I'm 30, wife is 33. $55k/year solo, $105k/year combined. I'm a junior developer, she's in public education.

This month marks a huge milestone for us. The student loans shown ~~are~~ were my wife's, whose interest rates and balances were much higher than mine (7% vs. my 3%). I decided to avalanche, as I was very motivated to kill that payment. Worth noting that even this was just for the portion of grad school that her father couldn't cover on a payment plan, and he paid 100% cash for undergrad. Yeah, she married down... Since the wedding, however, we've been on our own financially. 

I worked my ass off and came a long a way to get where I am^1 now. I was raised by a single mom with a little brother. Absolutely clueless about wealth building and money management. My entire family leases cars. Some of them have filed bankruptcy multiple times. My point is, I had to learn all of this on my own. All I knew was that I didn't want to end up like my family.

That said, ten years ago I was diving dumpsters for most of my food (and booze) and living in punk houses. I worked at coffee shops and restaurants and made peanuts. I  spent a lot of my money on going to shows and backpacking gear, and the rest was spent on baggies of various illegal substances. My student loans from my halfhearted ""attempt"" at a Fine Arts degree were all defaulted^2 . I was in collections for *library fees*. I had revolving credit in collections. Even if I had a six figure income, I'd have been broke. 

Everything changed when I met the ol' lady. I went from having no faith in the institution of marriage (thrice divorced parents) to *needing a ring*. What the hell? I knew I had to turn everything around and I had a lot of work to do. For some reason, she loved me and didn't care what I ended up doing, as long as I had ambition to excel at it. I was a barista at a late night coffee house. I was getting really sick of getting home at 1 AM and making two to three hundred dollars per week. I started looking at college programs again.

I caught a small break that got the ball rolling. I used a small inheritance from my grandmother (about $1k) to start making good on my debt payments. I made regular installments for six months just to get my loans out of delinquent status and went back to school to learn computer programming. After a year at state school, I decided to try my hand at finding work with an AS. I'm still paying off that one year... I had taken out extra loans for play money while in community college (I was still very stupid). Combined with the uni tuition at 10x what CC cost, and I have a $25k associates degree.

Starting work worked out for me, though. I landed a paid internship, and then a full time job after the wedding. Started at $18/hr full time and I felt rich, but that feeling didn't last long. I blew all my money on stupid crap and quickly became frustrated that the my investment in a new career hadn't yielded bottomless pockets. I would later look back and realize with horror that **I was spending over 10% of my income on video games and PC parts.** The majority of games in my Steam library have 0-2 hours played. I quit playing computer games and starting playing D&amp;D again, and it's so more rewarding than video gaming had been in a decade. At some point, I was just chasing the joy that my dad's SuperNES brought every other weekend, or the old days of LAN parties. It just wasn't bringing me joy anymore. D&amp;D brought back that feeling for whatever reason. I digress.

One day, I watched my friend pull up in a brand new sports car **that he paid for in cash**. Having only ever driven $2k vehicles, I congratulated him and jokingly suggested he must have gotten a promotion and a big bonus or something. He told me that he had been budgeting for ten years and is debt free. He figured out what the payment would be for the car he wanted would be on a six year loan and put that into a money market every month for five years. Due to the buying power of cash, he didn't even spend all of what he saved. He introduced me to budgeting and Dave Ramsey^3 (in spite of Dave's feelings on new cars, it's what he wanted). It's been all uphill for me since then.

I budgeted on my own for a year and half as my wife and I never combined finances. Partially due to laziness on both our ends, but I think mostly because she didn't trust me with money. That realization hurt my ego back then, but now I understand. I still don't understand why she married me in the first place, but that's another story...

In this time I paid off several of my loans while also covering my previous responsibilities. She was initially frustrated by my responses: ""Let me check the budget"" and ""That ain't in the budget."" She'd get these typically when suggesting we go out to eat. 

Wifey officially came on board when I booked our ticket and hotel up front with no credit card for a summer trip. One of her best friends decided to get married in Mexico. I took that as an invitation to send them a card, but it was apparently required that we go because she had attended our wedding as a bridesmaid (FYI, it was 20 miles from her house). So I guessed at how much it would cost, added 20%, and secretly saved for 16 months, and we went for a week. It was worth it 

It's been a wild ride. While I started with Dave Ramsey's book, I've learned a lot on this sub, so thanks for that. =D

1. So did my wife, but she started very young. She was always an excellent student and had her CAGS by 23, whereas I fucked around until I was 25 or so.
2. Still love the arts, but you *must* have a plan to make it in today's economy if you are going to pursue art as a career. If you're reading this, you are probably not in Renaissance Florence. Proceed with caution!
3. I've always been a ""take what you like and leave what you don't"" person. There's some pretty dogmatic stuff in his books and rants, but I applied the fundamentals and started budgeting. I experimented with tools, and landed on YNAB. I still read a lot and am always learning."
7qvx8j,2,2018-01-16,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7qvx8j/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

7qwdcp,3,2018-01-16,I finally told my boyfriend I think he is selfish and jealous.,the_wandering,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7qwdcp/i_finally_told_my_boyfriend_i_think_he_is_selfish/,"So I finally told my bf what I thought about him that has been bothering me.

I'll try to make this as short as possible.

I come from an extremely abusive family so when I met my current bf and he treated me kindly I thought we were soul mates. 

I've been working on repairing my self esteem and certain things have begun to make me resent him and question whether we are right for each other.

One night he went on a tirade about engagement rings. Totally unprompted. He went off how diamonds are ""a waste of money"" because they ""don't hold their value"". I became disgusted with him after this. As if he were telling me I weren't worth a diamond. This has stuck with me ever since. Especially since he is not concerned with anything else being a ""bad investment"". Namely his $5,000 custom made drum set.

I had been in school trying to better my life and once I ran out of money I depended on a loan of $250 from him every month. I was distarught over being out of money as I was close to obtaining my degree and completing my internship etc. He promised me he would help me pay for my exam (he didn't, i ended up gaining a credit increase just to pay for it). He also decided the very last month I needed to borrow money that it was time for him to purchase the $5000 drumset. So there was no money to be borrowed the last month. 

I ended up finishing school and obtaining my cert.. but not without him causing a fight the night before my exam. He decided to drop the fact that he was thinking he doesn't even want to have children. A totally inappropriate time to even discuss this.

So, me being in a better financial situation, he starts requesting to borrow money from me. Even leaving me high and dry on our anniversary dinner saying he was broke and couldnt afford dinner. Even ordering food and dessert to go on my dime.

So all in all he owed me back $180. He assured me he would pay me back. This was in Sept. He recently got 2 roomates so I assumed he was in a better situation financially and I asked about the money.

He hopped off the couch and moved completely across the room saying he thought we had ""an agreement"". I told him I don't remember any agreement in which he wouldn't pay me back.

This basically led to him whining and crying about how I don't ""understand"" anything he says. 

I tried to remain calm as I felt he was insulting my intelligence. I even told him I didn't need the momey back right away and asked him if he was embarrassed or something as he was acting strange and being very defensive.

This is a man who I have run out of patience with.

This is a man who asks for money saying he can't pay bills then has 3-4 large packages delivered.

I flat out told him once that I don't feel sorry for him bc he is a hypocrite bc of the packages. He says they are bought on credit but still. 

Anyway other things have happened like him shopping on my settlement before it even hit the bank then saying he needed $700. Also making snide comments about me moving out saying ""you know its *expensive*"".

After last night I told him I felt like he is selfish and doesn't care about me. I told him that he always has to come first. I told him I need support and not negativity when I'm trying to get out of a toxic environment. Etc. I told him he re-writes history and lies about what was said. I told him everytime we fight he has to turn it around on me. I said all I did was ask for my money (im sleeping on an air mattress ffs and dont have a washing machine). 

I have asked him: ""Don't you want to be able to take me out to eat? Don't you want us to be able to afford kids?""

Theres also things like he owns his home and its full of his deceased fathers things and has no place for me. He snaps when I suggest changing anything (like the cracking linoleum).. but has told me I could do anything decor wise. I asked can we please remove the nailed to the wall curtains and hang blackout shades proper... or have a proper breakfast table that the cats dont eat off of..

Flashback to July, I'm at an internship. One of the boys there gives me butterflies and I think he's cute and it's the first time I ever felt like this about a boy. We ended up dating, and I like him probably more than any before him, and even though it's my first time dating a boy, I'm not afraid or anything. I just really like him. We seem to be really into each other. To me, at least.

Then, about 3-4 weeks later, the internship is ending. For a myriad of reasons neither of us feeling great about long distance relationships, we mutually decide to break it off and decide to just remain good friends. Of course, it wasn't until I physically watched him leave that I realized I had made the wrong choice. After that, I never really found myself able to really get of my feelings for him. It became such a topic of anxiety for me that I had trouble sleeping and dreamed about (I'm sure that sounds creepy). For about 5 months we text each, as friends, as normal (although he's a flaky texter).

Then, beginning of January, I text him basically vomiting my feelings, letting him know that half a year later I still have feelings for him. Then, about a week and half later we make the phone call, and he lets me know that ""us"" won't happen again, not over long distance, and that he just doesn't feel the way he does from the summer although he still cares for me as a good friend.

Add this into the fact that I just moved to NYC and am completely alone. I find myself wanting to text him constantly, and never wanting to text him again to try and get over him. I still have feelings for him, and I want to get over him as a partner, and keep him as a friend, but I don't know how I can do that. But another part of me wants to hold out for him, meet him again done the road when we're older and a little more settled (we work in the same career field). But I also don't know if he'd do the same for me.

I think that's it- the short version of it, at least. Does that all make sense? I don't know what advice I'm looking for, I guess just something to make me feel less insane and desperate and alone."

How can we make it work and how do I [F 21] keep from going insane?,hotpotatostick,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7qx3jd/boyfriend_m_26_wants_to_get_an_internship_on_the/,"I have dated this man for 3 years and I just know he is my person. I can't even think about being with anyone else because he is literally my other half and I have never clicked with anyone as much as him.

So 2/3 years we dated we lived in the same state. The past year he has been living in another state for school and we have been doing long distance. I will admit I was terrified of a LDR because I thought Long distance relationships were just doomed. We made it work though and he comes up most weekends. 

Here's the deal... his dream has always been to move to the west coast. He is VERY determined he is moving there and there is certainly no changing his mind. His reasonings are valid because 90% of jobs in his field are there, so he needs to be there. This summer he wants to try to do his required internship there AND he wants me to try to do mine with him. My issue with that is that his parents pay for the majority of his schooling expenses where mine don't so I really do not have the funds, but in an ideal world, maybe it would be fun. Also, I am still unsure of what field I am going in and just don't feel ready to proceed with an internship yet. My friend did one after graduating and I am considering that option.

The negatives of us both going there are that the internships are likely not going to be paid so we would also have to find jobs too. My thinking is that with all this work, we won't have much time to enjoy our time together and will probably get crabby. Also, we would have to find a place to rent out, worry about food, etc. 

I just want to know how we can maintain a healthy relationship if he gets this internship far away. I would also like to add that, he is graduating next year and plans to move there immediately when I will not be graduated anytime soon, so how are we going to make things work? It is really freaking me out and I feel like when that time comes I won't ever get to see him. I know it is just a plane ticket away but it is so expensive and I am super afraid of traveling on my own. I do just fine with the LDR we have now, but the thought of him being so far away (during the internship, for now) scares me. Any advice?

Hello there!

I’m currently 15 years old living in Canada, I would like some help planning financially for my future  as they don’t teach these kind of things in school unfortunately.

My goal is to become a system administrator in the future which in Canada, specifically in Toronto the minimum pay is $44,000 according to glass door and a few other sites which can go up to $120,000 but usually averages around $65,00.

My parents are paying for my university tuition, when I graduate I should be 22 years old. I plan on getting a job when I turn 16, I could get a job now but Canada has weird labor laws for those under 16 so most don’t accept anything under. Was looking to get a job during breaks in school and an internship of some sorts in university.

I was looking to get some advice in regards to how I can save the most amount of money and what things I should be investing in for my future and retirement, I was told in Canada there’s no 401k and things the like.

I don’t plan on having children in the future also, what my current plan is live with my parents till I’m about 25/26, my parents agreed to pay for a down payment on a small home or apartment building which I then will put on rent to pay off the mortgage and then move into said apartment when I turn 25/26.

I just don’t want to make a mistake and hurt my future.

Also my hobbies are computers and things of the such, I don’t care much for expensive cars or accessories.

7qzt5f,1,2018-01-17,Military spouse with separation anxiety,crisduron,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7qzt5f/military_spouse_with_separation_anxiety/,"Hi I'm Cristina, 22 years old, and im a military spouse. 
I feel like right off the bat if anyone ends up reading this they'll think ""Why would you marry someone in the military if you have separation anxiety issues?""

Here's some background if you're interested, if not you can skip down to the bottom where I actually address my separation anxiety issues/questions:

We dated long before joining the military was even something he would consider. He had a lot of issues with college, and left him feeling like he military was the best option to get his life on track. 
Anyway, we dated for 2 years then he joined the military and we were long distance for almost another 2 years. Oddly enough, I didn't really have any separation anxiety issues while we were long distance but I think it's because I was doing the last 2 years of my undergrad and there was never a time I wasnt busy with friends, schoolwork, internships, etc. We got married after I finished school and we moved across the county. Fast forward to 3 months ago, and my husband was put on this ""on-call"" deployment group where he could be deployed on a 72 hour notice to an undisclosed location for an undisclosed amount of time. So far, he's still home. But I found out last week that he's going on a short deployment (2-3 weeks) at the end of this month. Cue the anxiety. 

Here's where I explain my issues: (I am so sorry for the wall of text)
I think it's slowly been building up since he was put on that ""on-call"" deployment group. Kind of just waiting on that call that he'll be leaving and I only have 3 days to prepare myself for it. But now there's a definite date in which he's leaving, and somehow that almost feels worse. Which doesn't make sense because when you know when something is gonna happen, you have time to mentally prepare. But instead I am mentally freaking out. We just got a dog and she's pretty well-behaved. Her only real issue is she's terrified of being outside because she was poorly socialized as a pup (we rescued her). I mention this because now I'm not only going to be alone, but be alone with our dog who's scared of being outside. We already hired a trainer by the way, he's coming on the 30th which was the earliest he could. On top of all that, I am starting my masters program next weekend which is right after he leaves. I guess I'm not good with a rapid amount of change in a short period of time. And I'm even worse with it when I have to do it alone. For the last week I've been ripped from my sleep by my anxiety with a racing heart, difficulty breathing, my body having shaking fits, stomach turning. Did I mention that my husband works from 11PM-7AM? So he's not here when this is happening to me. I haven't cried until tonight. It all came pouring out, and I felt better momentarily to cry but now Im still sitting here with these thoughts. 

If you made it to the end of this post, kudos. And any advice to help with separation anxiety would be greatly appreciated. "

----  


I divided this into parts (background info and the problem I’m having) to make it (hopefully) a little easier to read. Thank you in advance for any advice and guidance. Sorry in advance for the length and bad grammar. &lt;3  


#Background Info (Part 1)  


I have a childhood friend group (who I’ll refer to as **Friend Group A**) that I've been tight with since elementary school (so we've known each for over 10 years). Almost all of us come from military families, so some of us moved away from each other (including myself since my dad had orders to move to Maryland my freshman year), but most of the group stayed in California. Despite the distance, we all stayed close together and are basically a family. The glue that kept our group together was **Kevin (23M)** and **John (24M)**. Out of the group, I am the closest to **Cheyenne (23F)**.  


By the time senior year of high school rolled, we agreed to reunite in California after college graduation.  


While attending college in Maryland, I formed another super tight knit and awesome group of friends (who I’ll refer to as **Friend Group B**) that I've been close to for about five years now. Even though I’m extremely close with **Friend Group B**, I never really told them about **Friend Group A**. They know I have a lot of out of state friends, but I never really bothered to mention names. I’m not active on social media either, so **Friend Group B** never really sees my interactions with the **Friend Group A** (and vice versa).  


Fast forward to college graduation, **Friend Group A** kept our promise of coming back together. I got a internship at a non-profit in California and was able to stay there with my friend Cheyenne until the end of June. It was a great time, and it was nice to finally all be together again. &lt;3  


#Background Info (Part 2)  


Eventually I had to go back home to Maryland so I could find a job and a place to live. **Friend Group A** was sad that we all had to split up again, but knew we would see each other soon again. We said our goodbyes and I started to head home. (It would take me about a few days to get home because I drove cross country instead of flying.)  


On the last day of my trip home, I got a call from Cheyenne. She asked me if I was home in Maryland yet, and I said no, but would be later that same day. She told me to call her back when I did. I got worried because I had a gut feeling something was wrong.  


As soon as I got to my parent’s place, I called her back. She broke the news to me that Kevin and John were killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver a few days earlier.  


This news broke all of us in **Friend Group A**. Losing a loved one, especially two close friends at once, was something none of us saw coming and we all were struggling to come to terms with suddenly losing such great friends. I flew back to California to be there to support everyone in **Friend Group A**. We needed time to heal, and have been relying on each other for support. My mental health has never really been the best, but I'm honestly embarrassed by how debilitating the grief and depression has been for me.  


#The Problem I'm Having...  


I really wanted to talk to **Friend Group B** about what was happening, but the depression convinced me I’d be a burden (even if logically I knew they’d be supportive). Regretfully, I isolated myself more from them than anyone else. I pulled a super shitty move and cut off contact with them for the past 7 months because of how depressed I was. :( I feel guilty because I didn’t even give them a reason (they don’t even know about Kevin and John passing away since they don't know them)...I just stopped answering their texts, didn’t pick up their calls or respond to voicemails, and ignored group chats and emails. They just know I’ve basically have fallen off the face of the planet. I also feel guilty because my absence means I haven't been there for them and that I've worried them.  


They’ve sent me many messages these past few months while I’ve been disconnected about missing me and that they hope I’m okay--again, they’re the nicest and most patient people ever. They haven’t pushed me to contact them. They’ve left me nothing but kind texts, emails, and voicemails.  


**Friend Group A** is coping a lot better now. So I’m finally heading back home to Maryland in a couple days to stay with my parents, but I’m struggling because I don’t know how to reconnect with **Friend Group B**. :( I really miss **Friend Group B** and just want to be able to talk to them again, but I don’t know how without making it awkward or forced. I don’t know what the first move should be because I want to be considerate of their feelings (especially if they feel hurt by my lack of communication).  


Should I just jump back into our old group chat? Send one of them a message to relay it to the rest of the group? Send an email? I want to call, but honestly I don’t think I could get the words out without being a crying, anxious mess.  How should I go about reconnecting with them?  


Any advice or guidance is deeply appreciated. "

This morning was straight out of Satan’s asshole.

I woke up to a long, deep dent of red paint on the back bumper of my Escalade. Whoever hit and run me didn’t have the balls to leave a note, so I had to call insurance for about an hour, spending most of my time listening to some guy without chest hair complain about his grandma's cooking.

The fucking Knicks can’t win a game to save their lives right now. Carmelo Anthony has been dog shit for us; have they heard of something called defense?

Oh, and my third-biggest client, the online jeweler giant Michael Vandeross, has been poached by those snakes over at Dawson’s firm. Apparently, our associates haven’t been up to par, and I’ve been so busy handling Tyco’s Listeria class action that I delegated some of Michael’s work to them.

Associates whom our human resources manager hired.

As the captain of this ship in the sky, my job was to make sure that the fires were tempered and the right people were passing through the door. As Tyco began eating up all my time, my sister Jillian forcibly asked to me to find an HR manager to oversee the hiring instead.

The first one I fired two days in, the second didn’t last one morning, and the third isn’t staying much longer after this recent fuck-up.

‘I’m telling you Michael, we aren’t going to get blindsided like that again,’ I said evenly, pursing my lips. ‘We’ve had some shit associates slip through our ranks, that's all.’

‘And that isn’t my problem,’ he sighed. ‘Look Chris, you’ve been very consistent for me the past few years. We’ve done some good business together, but that has been the second screw-up in the past month. I’m sorry, I don’t have confidence in your dedication to me anymore.’

The associates were to blame for this latest fiasco, but the other time Michael was referring to, I was passed out drunk at Luke and Abigail engagement party.

Love and business don’t mix.

‘Give us another chance,’ I asked in the closest tone I knew to pleading. ‘Whatever those fuckers at Dawson sold you, it’s most likely snake oil.’

‘Well, I’ll just have to find out myself then,’ he said, finality to his voice. ‘I’m sorry it couldn’t work out Chris.’

He hung up.

Fuming, I set the phone down and placed my palms on my desk, gripping the mahogany surface I sanded myself.

I couldn’t fire Luke for inviting me to his engagement party, but I sure as hell could fire that new HR manager for letting second-rate associates into my firm.

______________________________________

**Chris** 
 

‘Jesus Christ, why the hell did you dump that one?’

Jillian stood with her arms crossed over her chest, a vicious scowl over her expression.

‘Why? Well, out of the four new associates he hired, only one of them knows how to file a fucking liability waver, and the one who does works at the speed of shit,’ I returned bitterly.

Jillian’s look became icier. She wasn’t afraid of my authoritarian attitude. Even though Luke and I were technically the managing partners of this firm, Jillian was the underground Queen, making sure the small fires didn’t become massive ones.

She dealt with the sludge and fine issues of our firm, and had a hand in almost every one of our cases. I respected her immensely for that, but that didn’t mean she could boss me around.

There could only be one man at the top.

‘It took me two weeks to find this one,’ she exclaimed, throwing her hands up to make the most of her tiny frame. ‘He hit all, and I mean all twenty-one checks you wanted. I heard about Vandeross, but give the guy a second chance.’

I sighed deeply, shaking my head. ‘No, no second chances. That’s the law around here and you know it.’

‘Oh my god, shove it up your ass,’ she raged, crossing her arms even tighter.

I didn’t respond.

‘Fine, I’ll spend the next week looking for another victim you’ll tear to shreds,’ she lashed before turning to leave. ‘Also, we’re meeting at Red’s tonight. Everyone. You’re coming too, it’s a Friday.’

Before I could refuse, she slammed the door on the way out.

Women were amazing at the fine details, but too fucking emotional.

**Chris**

As I swung open the massive wooden door, I heard an awful racket fill the air.

Looking up at the karaoke stage, I saw my brother Jacob with his arm around my cousin Steve. They’re clearly drunk and sharing the microphone, doing no justice to Beyonce’s “Halo”, and scanning the room, I notice that several patrons aren’t exactly pleased.

I made my way to our usual booth, which has become quite crowded with the addition of Abigail and Stacey. I slip in next to Stacey, scrunching my face up at Luke, whose mouth was busy invading the one of the woman next to him.

‘Christ, is that public indecency ever going to stop?’ I groaned as I ordered a Bud.

‘I know you’re just jealous,’ Luke said, grinning a dreamy, puppy-eyed smile that made me regret coming. ‘I’m not going to keep my hands off my fiancée in front of you freaks now that everyone knows.’

‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I don’t want to know where your hands are right now,’ I scowled. ‘And it’s been three weeks since she agreed to a lifetime of your shit. You’re still high off using that word?’

‘Fuck you, and yes, my fiancée loves it.’

Abigail laughed. I didn’t know how she found this boy scout funny. ‘How are things at the firm, Chris?’ Her bubbly voice asked.

I glanced over, and Jillian loaded me with an icy stare in between her conversation with Stacey. ‘Not the best week,’ I sighed, taking a deep swig of the beer. ‘Had to fire our HR manager, and another four associates.’

‘You fired Jack?’ Luke asked, frowning and shaking his head in quick, small movements. ‘We were going to the auto show next weekend together. Damn it Chris, we finally find someone man enough to enjoy a classic paint job, and you had to go all Captain America on him.’

‘In the first week. This is the third one we’ve been through this month.’ Jillian’s snarl made me glad that Stacey was in between us.

‘Wait, are you looking for a new HR manager?’ Abigail asked, using her chin to point at me because Luke held both of her hands captive in his.

‘He’s not. I am,’ Jillian complained. ‘Suck a dick Chris.’

Before I could retort, Abigail chimed in. ‘Why don’t you hire Stacey? She worked human resources in Washington.’

All eyes landed on the woman next to me. She had an undertone of an accent that I couldn’t place, the words coming out with a twist at the end. ‘Sure, but I wasn’t the manager,’ Stacey emphasized. ‘And that was a government job, a lot more structured than a law firm.’

Structure? I made sure to keep my firm structured. That’s why Jack and his donkeys were free agents again.

Besides, you needed iron judgment to differentiate between an interviewee who actually wanted a career, and one that was just looking for another resume-booster. Stacey had a good head on her shoulders, but she was still a woman, and women turned into wrecking balls five days a month.

I knew she was still looking for a permanent job right now. If she had a law degree, I wouldn’t think twice about hiring her as an associate, but HR manager? I don’t think so.

‘We’re in the middle of a few other candidates right now,’ I replied, shrugging. ‘Besides, I’m not sure how smart it is working with friends.’

‘I’m your friend,’ Luke teased. ‘And my name is on the wall next to yours.’

‘That’s only because we popped out of the same woman Brimstone,’ I said after taking another sip. ‘You’re damn lucky.’

He devoured Abigail with another wet kiss, and we were all recoils from this side of the table. ‘Yes I am,’ he said dreamily.

‘My vote is with Stace as well. I’m tired of looking through profiles only for them to miss two or three of your impossible demands Chris,’ Jillian urged. ‘Give her a shot.’

‘Jill,’ Stacey began, sighing. ‘It’s really not necessary.’

‘Come on Chris,’ Abigail said in a voice so sweet I could taste the honey. I could see why Luke answered her every beck and call.

‘Yeah, come on Chris,’ Luke grinned, knowing exactly how much I was hating this right now. ‘Make my fiancée happy.’

‘I – Well,’ I stuttered, and all eyes were on me, even Stacey’s big hazel irises held a dash of hope. Sighing, I said, ‘She’ll have to come in for an interview, but fine, why not.’

The table exploded in a cheer, and I barely heard Stacey’s thank you.

Fucking peer pressure.

_____________________________________


**Chris**

The October Monday sky was gray and masked by a fleet of clouds as I made my way to the firm. I lived comfortably close to the building, but morning traffic in Manhattan was still a bitch and a half.

The minivan in front of me was a little too leisured after the light turned green, and I didn't hesitate to blast my horn at him. ‘Get off your fucking cellphone!’ I yelled into the enclosed cabin. Shaking my head, I glanced up at the sullen skies and I felt exactly the same way inside.

Actually, I’d been regretting agreeing to interview Stacey all weekend.

The sting from the Vandeross loss was still heavy in my head, and I needed a solution to our loose hiring problem, not another weakness point – which is why I wanted to oversee hiring again.

It's not that Stacey was a pushover; she oozed confidence. She had the balls to quit her cushy government job in DC and come back to uncertainty in New York, for crying out loud. While she wasn’t in a fulfilling career right now, I knew that she wouldn’t have too hard a time finding what she needed.

And anyone that could win Jillian’s seal of approval was worth their salt. The only other person Jill liked as much as Stacey was Abigail, and everyone loved Abigail. Jillian didn’t have many female friends, and it’s because most found her intimidating. She was an alpha to the end, only liking people who were comfortable with themselves and told her the truth from day one. Problem was, most girls in New York were plastic smiles and behind the back shit-talkers.

Pulling into the underground parking spot reserved with my name on it, I relaxed a bit, thinking maybe Stacey wouldn’t be too bad a fit.

But my slight change of heart wasn’t going to stop me from going all Captain America on her in the interview – if she was joining the team, she would have to prove she can handle stress.

She was waiting for me in my office; I could see that red hair through my office window from across the floor.

I had my hand on my door, but didn’t open it immediately. She was looking out at the city – my office had a view of the Japanese-inspired garden behind our building.

I felt a strange curiosity rise in me, watching her. She must have been wearing heels because she looked a mere two or three inches below my six-four. Stacey was a naturally lanky woman, with legs that went on for days, and stuck out like a scarecrow when she was with Abigail and Jillian.

It’s been less than a month since she moved back from Washington, and I have only talked to her a handful of times. She wore a suit jacket to the trial and a conservative dress to Luke’s engagement party – nothing revealing. I noticed her figure, sure, but any man with enough testosterone would give her a second glance. Besides, she was Abigail’s best friend, so I immediately filed her into the “unavailable” category.

But I’ve never seen her in business attire before today, and I couldn't ditch my curious itch. She wore a simple white button-up blouse up top, but it was the bottoms that grabbed my attention. The blouse was tucked into a skinny black skirt that hugged her thighs and tight little ass cheeks, and I couldn’t help noticing that slim, curvy figure. Her calves peeked out from underneath the skirt, toned, and like everything else about her, long. Pitifully, I had the sudden urge to run my hands all over them.

Collect yourself Chris.

Taking a deep breath to cleanse the stars in my brain, I turned the knob to open the door, and as she turned around, my sight instinctively landed about a foot and a half south of her eyes. Her skin was ivory, and that peeking valley between her breasts glowed in the morning sun. She issued a warm smile and I forced one back, hating myself for thinking with my dick.

‘Hi,’ she said cheerfully. Too much damn energy for the morning.

I set down my overcoat and stuck out my hand, but she had other plans because right as I did, she came in for a hug. Instead of either working out, she was left at arm’s length with my fingers wedged into her cleavage.

‘Shit!’ I uttered, overwhelmed with embarrassment and instinctively, I backed up immediately, but not before noticing her eyebrows shooting up to her forehead.

‘Fuck, I – I’m sorry,’ I muttered, unable to meet her eyes. ‘Fucking shit way to start an interview.’ My hands went from my pockets to clasped in my front to hanging awkwardly by my sides.

To my surprise, instead of leaving a red palm print across my cheek, she burst out laughing, which lessened the tension in the room. She stuck out her hand as a truce and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.

I shook it, forcing myself to look into her eyes. Those hazel halos hid something, something she wasn’t saying.

_____________________________________


**Stacey** 

That’s one way to start the morning. Being a tall girl, I was used to being gawked at, but never touched so abruptly like that. If it was any other person other than my best friend’s soon-to-be brother-in-law, I’d have connect my shin to their balls.

Long legs gave me good range.

Also, I wanted this gig and when I wanted something, I did what needed to be done to get it. Even if it meant laughing off an accidental boob-spearing at nine in the morning.

Returning to New York from Washington, I was afraid I wouldn’t find another job that suited me as well as HR assistant. I loved telling people what to do, because I was never wrong. Call me whatever you wanted, just don’t crying back to me when you realize I was right. I knew that my confidence was easily mistaken as arrogance, but those haters could fuck off.

Watching Chris lay his documents neatly across his desk, I studied his features. A square, strong jaw underlined his face. His chin pointed out slightly, giving him an eastern-European look. His eyes were green, a color he shared with his siblings, hooded by distinct brow lines, and he kept his hair shortly trimmed.

Not the worst package in the world.

But I shouldn’t let that incident betray his platonic intent. He wasn’t interested, and the way he flew back four feet after touching me was a clear indication.

He cleared his throat; it was a masculine, guttural sound. ‘So, Miss Kavanagh,’ he said in his deep tone, ‘Thanks for coming in so early.’

‘No problem, Chris,’ I replied lightly, and at that, he lifted a brow. Clearly in professional lawyer mode, he was not impressed that I thought we were on a first-name basis.

This wasn’t the huggable drunk from Abigail’s engagement party anymore.

‘I meant, of course Mr. Brimstone,’ I corrected myself. Something about that name felt right on my tongue.

‘Well then, let’s get started,’ he said, closing the door and sealing us inside his office.

It was a minimalistic room, with two bookshelves and his desk being the main furniture pieces. The shelves were littered chock full of law texts, and I wondered if he actually read every one himself. On both walls hung photos of him with former clients, and a pattern emerged as I scanned each photo. The person he was shaking hands with almost always had a wide smile on their face, while he looked into the camera with a tight expression.

Somber bastard.

‘The position of HR manager is one full of responsibility,’ he began, eyes unmoving. ‘You’ll be the one hiring, firing, and maintaining firm structure as well as associate morale.’

Something told me that with Chris at the helm, the associates were lacking in the morale front.

‘We work long hours here,’ he pressed further. ‘This isn’t a nine to five; I’ll expect you to be here by eight and leave no earlier than six most days.’ His mouth was curved into a frown, and his voice like a hunter’s, cool and visceral.

I recognized suddenly that he was trying to rattle me before the interview began. He was turning up the heat so I’d melt before I had my showing.

‘Still interested?’ he asked lowly, arms crossed over his wide chest.

‘Sure,’ I said simply.

He had no idea who he was up against.

**Chris**


This interview wasn’t going as I expected. I didn’t know what I was expecting, actually, but certainly not this smooth, calculated professional.

She had some novel answers in terms of re-structuring the firm, such as having more internal control over check-depositing in case of embezzlement. That caught my attention.

She also took the time to go over each of our associate’s histories, which she didn’t need to do, but I was impressed that she did. She wasn’t afraid of telling me we were using them all wrong, and basically lectured me about the importance of tapping into their full potential by putting them on cases they were passionate about.

I wasn’t so sure about her assuming attitude, but I had to admit, I could see her ideas working well. But, did she know how to hire?

‘Candidate number one. You have two minutes.’

I watched as she scanned the summary page of a former associate. Jack hired him, and I wanted to see if she would make the same mistake. Her fingers flipped through the crisp white pages, her skin nearly the same shade. I realized I was still standing, and from this vantage point a downblouse view was too available to pass up.

She didn’t have the largest rack in the world, but those B cups were proportional on her long, lean body. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail, and fingernails trimmed short. Everything about her screamed efficient, including those average breasts.

Fingers itchy, I stowed my hands in my pants pockets and forced myself to sit down.

‘Two minutes is up,’ I reminded.

She took another three seconds to finish what she was reading, and that irritated me. Not that taking an extra few seconds was criminal in my book, but the fact that she took them.

I don’t even understand why myself.

‘Well,’ she began, eye contact strong and voice even. ‘He has an amazing track record. All wins.’

I fought the small, conniving smile teasing at the corner of my mouth. ‘Would you hire him?’

‘No, I wouldn’t’ she said confidently, and that irritated me too, how confident she was. ‘He averages just over two cases a year. The man is a cherry-picker.’

Straining a frown, I placed a second set of papers in front of her. ‘Candidate two. Again, two minutes,’ I said, emphasizing that number.

She narrowed her eyes at me for a second, and that piecing look caused a stir in my trousers. She began reviewing, and I shifting in my chair, trying to find a position that gave myself some breathing room downstairs.

Her blouse was sleeveless, allowing me to notice the underlying musculature of her arms. She was no stranger to the gym, and that should have turned me off right there. I liked my women women. I preferred them thick and curvy, with enough weight on them for child-bearing.

Not that Stacey’s child-bearing ability was relevant to this interview.

But I couldn’t shake the image of those long, pale legs in a pair of yoga pants, working out a deep, and in my mind, this was a deep squat.

The soldier in my pants flared to life, hitting the underside of the desk.

‘Chris?’ her rich voice called out. I threw her furrowed brows while continuing to make micro-adjustments downstairs. ‘It’s been two minutes.’

I cleared my throat. ‘Of course – right – so what’s your verdict?’ This candidate was a difficult one to analyze, especially considering Stacey was a woman.

‘Well,’ she began, and I tried to look at her eyes instead of her lips. ‘She’s had several large firms in her portfolio, and her superiors all said great things about her, but she’s taken six years off work. The law world has already moved on. While I’m sure she could start as an intern here to get her feet wet, paying her a full associate’s salary right away would be foolish.’

I ground my teeth together. That’s exactly what I would have done with Sylvia as well. Stacey had a sharp eye and good critical thinking skills, I’ll give her that. ‘Alright, that’s enough candidates,’ I said brusquely.

‘But I see three more right there,’ she replied poignantly, directing her gaze to the stack of folders on my desk.

‘I think that’s enough,’ I muttered. Her eyes were perhaps a little too sharp.

She frowned, and I wondered if in her mind she was blowing this interview.

She wasn’t, but I could think of something else she could.

Collect yourself Chris.

‘Miss Kavanagh, there is a final portion to the interview,’ I said, voice almost a hiss since most candidates I interviewed never even got to this part.

She didn’t reply, simply content with boring into me with those hazel eyes.

‘One of our associates isn’t cutting it, so what I’m going to need you to do is fire him.’

She blinked rapidly. ‘Right now?’

‘As soon as I call him in.’

I expected her to pause and collect her bearings for a few moments at least, but without hesitation, she replied, ‘Sure.’

Slightly astonished by her lack of concern, I forced my attention to the phone, transferring myself to the associate’s room. ‘Tyler, could you come to my office please?’ I asked with underlying command.

Though the associate’s room was on the other side of the floor, Tyler arrived within ten seconds flat, breathy from the run.

I trained them well.

‘Yes, Mr. Brimstone?’ he said, his wary expression adding to the dramatics of it all.

‘Tyler, this is Miss Kavanagh. She is interviewing for Jack’s former position,’ I explained as I motioned a hand towards Stacey.

He threw on a dumb smile. ‘Hi Miss Kavanagh! I look forward to working with you.’

Stacey didn’t even bother with his outstretched hand.

She cleared her throat, and didn’t flinch or stutter even once as she spoke. ‘I apologize that I had to be the one to tell you this Tyler. I’m sure you have a bright future ahead of you, but that future will not be at Brimstone and Associates.’ Her voice was level, and I found her natural authority strangely arousing.

Tyler looked confused. ‘Excuse me? Sorry – I – I don’t understand.’

‘You’re being let go Tyler,’ Stacey clarified. ‘Please pack up your things. You have one hour before security intervenes.’

Tyler looked from Stacey to me, and I simply nodded. Seconds past, and I as reality sunk in, he began breathing heavily, shoulders rising and falling, forehead shiny from sweat. To be honest, I was afraid he was having a stroke, and it looked as though he was going to cry, eyes sheened with wetness. Without warning, he bolted from the room before his tears fell out, leaving Stacey and I alone once more.

‘Well, I think that concludes our interview,’ I said, cutting through the thick tension. ‘Our assistant will be in contact.’

‘Sure,’ she said simply, and that little word was starting to get on my nerves.

Before I could say anything else, she stood and whisked out the door, leaving me staring at those long legs as she walked toward the elevators. And just like that, my annoyance turned to lust.

Fuck, this was confusing."

This morning was straight out of Satan’s asshole.

I woke up to a long, deep dent of red paint on the back bumper of my Escalade. Whoever hit and run me didn’t have the balls to leave a note, so I had to call insurance for about an hour, spending most of my time listening to some guy without chest hair complain about his grandma's cooking.

The fucking Knicks can’t win a game to save their lives right now. Carmelo Anthony has been dog shit for us; have they heard of something called defense?

Oh, and my third-biggest client, the online jeweler giant Michael Vandeross, has been poached by those snakes over at Dawson’s firm. Apparently, our associates haven’t been up to par, and I’ve been so busy handling Tyco’s Listeria class action that I delegated some of Michael’s work to them.

Associates whom our human resources manager hired.

As the captain of this ship in the sky, my job was to make sure that the fires were tempered and the right people were passing through the door. As Tyco began eating up all my time, my sister Jillian forcibly asked to me to find an HR manager to oversee the hiring instead.

The first one I fired two days in, the second didn’t last one morning, and the third isn’t staying much longer after this recent fuck-up.

‘I’m telling you Michael, we aren’t going to get blindsided like that again,’ I said evenly, pursing my lips. ‘We’ve had some shit associates slip through our ranks, that's all.’

‘And that isn’t my problem,’ he sighed. ‘Look Chris, you’ve been very consistent for me the past few years. We’ve done some good business together, but that has been the second screw-up in the past month. I’m sorry, I don’t have confidence in your dedication to me anymore.’

The associates were to blame for this latest fiasco, but the other time Michael was referring to, I was passed out drunk at Luke and Abigail engagement party.

Love and business don’t mix.

‘Give us another chance,’ I asked in the closest tone I knew to pleading. ‘Whatever those fuckers at Dawson sold you, it’s most likely snake oil.’

‘Well, I’ll just have to find out myself then,’ he said, finality to his voice. ‘I’m sorry it couldn’t work out Chris.’

He hung up.

Fuming, I set the phone down and placed my palms on my desk, gripping the mahogany surface I sanded myself.

I couldn’t fire Luke for inviting me to his engagement party, but I sure as hell could fire that new HR manager for letting second-rate associates into my firm.

‘Jesus Christ, why the hell did you dump that one?’

Jillian stood with her arms crossed over her chest, a vicious scowl over her expression.

I sighed deeply, shaking my head. ‘No, no second chances. That’s the law around here and you know it.’

‘Oh my god, shove it up your ass,’ she raged, crossing her arms even tighter.

I didn’t respond.

‘Fine, I’ll spend the next week looking for another victim you’ll tear to shreds,’ she lashed before turning to leave. ‘Also, we’re meeting at Red’s tonight. Everyone. You’re coming too, it’s a Friday.’

Before I could refuse, she slammed the door on the way out.

Women were amazing at the fine details, but too fucking emotional.

As I swung open the massive wooden door, I heard an awful racket fill the air.

Looking up at the karaoke stage, I saw my brother Jacob with his arm around my cousin Steve. They’re clearly drunk and sharing the microphone, doing no justice to Beyonce’s “Halo”, and scanning the room, I notice that several patrons aren’t exactly pleased.

I made my way to our usual booth, which has become quite crowded with the addition of Abigail and Stacey. I slip in next to Stacey, scrunching my face up at Luke, whose mouth was busy invading the one of the woman next to him.

‘Christ, is that public indecency ever going to stop?’ I groaned as I ordered a Bud.

‘I know you’re just jealous,’ Luke said, grinning a dreamy, puppy-eyed smile that made me regret coming. ‘I’m not going to keep my hands off my fiancée in front of you freaks now that everyone knows.’

‘I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I don’t want to know where your hands are right now,’ I scowled. ‘And it’s been three weeks since she agreed to a lifetime of your shit. You’re still high off using that word?’

‘Fuck you, and yes, my fiancée loves it.’

Abigail laughed. I didn’t know how she found this boy scout funny. ‘How are things at the firm, Chris?’ Her bubbly voice asked.

I glanced over, and Jillian loaded me with an icy stare in between her conversation with Stacey. ‘Not the best week,’ I sighed, taking a deep swig of the beer. ‘Had to fire our HR manager, and another four associates.’

‘You fired Jack?’ Luke asked, frowning and shaking his head in quick, small movements. ‘We were going to the auto show next weekend together. Damn it Chris, we finally find someone man enough to enjoy a classic paint job, and you had to go all Captain America on him.’

‘In the first week. This is the third one we’ve been through this month.’ Jillian’s snarl made me glad that Stacey was in between us.

‘Wait, are you looking for a new HR manager?’ Abigail asked, using her chin to point at me because Luke held both of her hands captive in his.

‘He’s not. I am,’ Jillian complained. ‘Suck a dick Chris.’

Before I could retort, Abigail chimed in. ‘Why don’t you hire Stacey? She worked human resources in Washington.’

All eyes landed on the woman next to me. She had an undertone of an accent that I couldn’t place, the words coming out with a twist at the end. ‘Sure, but I wasn’t the manager,’ Stacey emphasized. ‘And that was a government job, a lot more structured than a law firm.’

Structure? I made sure to keep my firm structured. That’s why Jack and his donkeys were free agents again.

Besides, you needed iron judgment to differentiate between an interviewee who actually wanted a career, and one that was just looking for another resume-booster. Stacey had a good head on her shoulders, but she was still a woman, and women turned into wrecking balls five days a month.

I knew she was still looking for a permanent job right now. If she had a law degree, I wouldn’t think twice about hiring her as an associate, but HR manager? I don’t think so.

‘We’re in the middle of a few other candidates right now,’ I replied, shrugging. ‘Besides, I’m not sure how smart it is working with friends.’

‘I’m your friend,’ Luke teased. ‘And my name is on the wall next to yours.’

‘That’s only because we popped out of the same woman Brimstone,’ I said after taking another sip. ‘You’re damn lucky.’

He devoured Abigail with another wet kiss, and we were all recoils from this side of the table. ‘Yes I am,’ he said dreamily.

‘My vote is with Stace as well. I’m tired of looking through profiles only for them to miss two or three of your impossible demands Chris,’ Jillian urged. ‘Give her a shot.’

‘Jill,’ Stacey began, sighing. ‘It’s really not necessary.’

‘Come on Chris,’ Abigail said in a voice so sweet I could taste the honey. I could see why Luke answered her every beck and call.

‘Yeah, come on Chris,’ Luke grinned, knowing exactly how much I was hating this right now. ‘Make my fiancée happy.’

‘I – Well,’ I stuttered, and all eyes were on me, even Stacey’s big hazel irises held a dash of hope. Sighing, I said, ‘She’ll have to come in for an interview, but fine, why not.’

The table exploded in a cheer, and I barely heard Stacey’s thank you.

Fucking peer pressure.

**Chris**

The October Monday sky was gray and masked by a fleet of clouds as I made my way to the firm. I lived comfortably close to the building, but morning traffic in Manhattan was still a bitch and a half.

The minivan in front of me was a little too leisured after the light turned green, and I didn't hesitate to blast my horn at him. ‘Get off your fucking cellphone!’ I yelled into the enclosed cabin. Shaking my head, I glanced up at the sullen skies and I felt exactly the same way inside.

Actually, I’d been regretting agreeing to interview Stacey all weekend.

The sting from the Vandeross loss was still heavy in my head, and I needed a solution to our loose hiring problem, not another weakness point – which is why I wanted to oversee hiring again.

It's not that Stacey was a pushover; she oozed confidence. She had the balls to quit her cushy government job in DC and come back to uncertainty in New York, for crying out loud. While she wasn’t in a fulfilling career right now, I knew that she wouldn’t have too hard a time finding what she needed.

And anyone that could win Jillian’s seal of approval was worth their salt. The only other person Jill liked as much as Stacey was Abigail, and everyone loved Abigail. Jillian didn’t have many female friends, and it’s because most found her intimidating. She was an alpha to the end, only liking people who were comfortable with themselves and told her the truth from day one. Problem was, most girls in New York were plastic smiles and behind the back shit-talkers.

Pulling into the underground parking spot reserved with my name on it, I relaxed a bit, thinking maybe Stacey wouldn’t be too bad a fit.

But my slight change of heart wasn’t going to stop me from going all Captain America on her in the interview – if she was joining the team, she would have to prove she can handle stress.

She was waiting for me in my office; I could see that red hair through my office window from across the floor.

I had my hand on my door, but didn’t open it immediately. She was looking out at the city – my office had a view of the Japanese-inspired garden behind our building.

I felt a strange curiosity rise in me, watching her. She must have been wearing heels because she looked a mere two or three inches below my six-four. Stacey was a naturally lanky woman, with legs that went on for days, and stuck out like a scarecrow when she was with Abigail and Jillian.

It’s been less than a month since she moved back from Washington, and I have only talked to her a handful of times. She wore a suit jacket to the trial and a conservative dress to Luke’s engagement party – nothing revealing. I noticed her figure, sure, but any man with enough testosterone would give her a second glance. Besides, she was Abigail’s best friend, so I immediately filed her into the “unavailable” category.

But I’ve never seen her in business attire before today, and I couldn't ditch my curious itch. She wore a simple white button-up blouse up top, but it was the bottoms that grabbed my attention. The blouse was tucked into a skinny black skirt that hugged her thighs and tight little ass cheeks, and I couldn’t help noticing that slim, curvy figure. Her calves peeked out from underneath the skirt, toned, and like everything else about her, long. Pitifully, I had the sudden urge to run my hands all over them.

Collect yourself Chris.

Taking a deep breath to cleanse the stars in my brain, I turned the knob to open the door, and as she turned around, my sight instinctively landed about a foot and a half south of her eyes. Her skin was ivory, and that peeking valley between her breasts glowed in the morning sun. She issued a warm smile and I forced one back, hating myself for thinking with my dick.

‘Hi,’ she said cheerfully. Too much damn energy for the morning.

I set down my overcoat and stuck out my hand, but she had other plans because right as I did, she came in for a hug. Instead of either working out, she was left at arm’s length with my fingers wedged into her cleavage.

‘Shit!’ I uttered, overwhelmed with embarrassment and instinctively, I backed up immediately, but not before noticing her eyebrows shooting up to her forehead.

‘Fuck, I – I’m sorry,’ I muttered, unable to meet her eyes. ‘Fucking shit way to start an interview.’ My hands went from my pockets to clasped in my front to hanging awkwardly by my sides.

To my surprise, instead of leaving a red palm print across my cheek, she burst out laughing, which lessened the tension in the room. She stuck out her hand as a truce and I breathed a huge sigh of relief.

I shook it, forcing myself to look into her eyes. Those hazel halos hid something, something she wasn’t saying.

_____________________________________


**Stacey** 

That’s one way to start the morning. Being a tall girl, I was used to being gawked at, but never touched so abruptly like that. If it was any other person other than my best friend’s soon-to-be brother-in-law, I’d have connect my shin to their balls.

Long legs gave me good range.

Also, I wanted this gig and when I wanted something, I did what needed to be done to get it. Even if it meant laughing off an accidental boob-spearing at nine in the morning.

Returning to New York from Washington, I was afraid I wouldn’t find another job that suited me as well as HR assistant. I loved telling people what to do, because I was never wrong. Call me whatever you wanted, just don’t crying back to me when you realize I was right. I knew that my confidence was easily mistaken as arrogance, but those haters could fuck off.

Watching Chris lay his documents neatly across his desk, I studied his features. A square, strong jaw underlined his face. His chin pointed out slightly, giving him an eastern-European look. His eyes were green, a color he shared with his siblings, hooded by distinct brow lines, and he kept his hair shortly trimmed.

Not the worst package in the world.

But I shouldn’t let that incident betray his platonic intent. He wasn’t interested, and the way he flew back four feet after touching me was a clear indication.

He cleared his throat; it was a masculine, guttural sound. ‘So, Miss Kavanagh,’ he said in his deep tone, ‘Thanks for coming in so early.’

‘No problem, Chris,’ I replied lightly, and at that, he lifted a brow. Clearly in professional lawyer mode, he was not impressed that I thought we were on a first-name basis.

This wasn’t the huggable drunk from Abigail’s engagement party anymore.

‘I meant, of course Mr. Brimstone,’ I corrected myself. Something about that name felt right on my tongue.

‘Well then, let’s get started,’ he said, closing the door and sealing us inside his office.

It was a minimalistic room, with two bookshelves and his desk being the main furniture pieces. The shelves were littered chock full of law texts, and I wondered if he actually read every one himself. On both walls hung photos of him with former clients, and a pattern emerged as I scanned each photo. The person he was shaking hands with almost always had a wide smile on their face, while he looked into the camera with a tight expression.

Somber bastard.

‘The position of HR manager is one full of responsibility,’ he began, eyes unmoving. ‘You’ll be the one hiring, firing, and maintaining firm structure as well as associate morale.’

Something told me that with Chris at the helm, the associates were lacking in the morale front.

‘We work long hours here,’ he pressed further. ‘This isn’t a nine to five; I’ll expect you to be here by eight and leave no earlier than six most days.’ His mouth was curved into a frown, and his voice like a hunter’s, cool and visceral.

I recognized suddenly that he was trying to rattle me before the interview began. He was turning up the heat so I’d melt before I had my showing.

‘Still interested?’ he asked lowly, arms crossed over his wide chest.

‘Sure,’ I said simply.

He had no idea who he was up against.

**Chris**


This interview wasn’t going as I expected. I didn’t know what I was expecting, actually, but certainly not this smooth, calculated professional.

She had some novel answers in terms of re-structuring the firm, such as having more internal control over check-depositing in case of embezzlement. That caught my attention.

She also took the time to go over each of our associate’s histories, which she didn’t need to do, but I was impressed that she did. She wasn’t afraid of telling me we were using them all wrong, and basically lectured me about the importance of tapping into their full potential by putting them on cases they were passionate about.

I wasn’t so sure about her assuming attitude, but I had to admit, I could see her ideas working well. But, did she know how to hire?

‘Candidate number one. You have two minutes.’

I watched as she scanned the summary page of a former associate. Jack hired him, and I wanted to see if she would make the same mistake. Her fingers flipped through the crisp white pages, her skin nearly the same shade. I realized I was still standing, and from this vantage point a downblouse view was too available to pass up.

She didn’t have the largest rack in the world, but those B cups were proportional on her long, lean body. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail, and fingernails trimmed short. Everything about her screamed efficient, including those average breasts.

Fingers itchy, I stowed my hands in my pants pockets and forced myself to sit down.

‘Two minutes is up,’ I reminded.

She took another three seconds to finish what she was reading, and that irritated me. Not that taking an extra few seconds was criminal in my book, but the fact that she took them.

I don’t even understand why myself.

‘Well,’ she began, eye contact strong and voice even. ‘He has an amazing track record. All wins.’

I fought the small, conniving smile teasing at the corner of my mouth. ‘Would you hire him?’

‘No, I wouldn’t’ she said confidently, and that irritated me too, how confident she was. ‘He averages just over two cases a year. The man is a cherry-picker.’

Straining a frown, I placed a second set of papers in front of her. ‘Candidate two. Again, two minutes,’ I said, emphasizing that number.

She narrowed her eyes at me for a second, and that piecing look caused a stir in my trousers. She began reviewing, and I shifting in my chair, trying to find a position that gave myself some breathing room downstairs.

Her blouse was sleeveless, allowing me to notice the underlying musculature of her arms. She was no stranger to the gym, and that should have turned me off right there. I liked my women women. I preferred them thick and curvy, with enough weight on them for child-bearing.

Not that Stacey’s child-bearing ability was relevant to this interview.

But I couldn’t shake the image of those long, pale legs in a pair of yoga pants, working out a deep, and in my mind, this was a deep squat.

The soldier in my pants flared to life, hitting the underside of the desk.

‘Chris?’ her rich voice called out. I threw her furrowed brows while continuing to make micro-adjustments downstairs. ‘It’s been two minutes.’

I cleared my throat. ‘Of course – right – so what’s your verdict?’ This candidate was a difficult one to analyze, especially considering Stacey was a woman.

‘Well,’ she began, and I tried to look at her eyes instead of her lips. ‘She’s had several large firms in her portfolio, and her superiors all said great things about her, but she’s taken six years off work. The law world has already moved on. While I’m sure she could start as an intern here to get her feet wet, paying her a full associate’s salary right away would be foolish.’

I ground my teeth together. That’s exactly what I would have done with Sylvia as well. Stacey had a sharp eye and good critical thinking skills, I’ll give her that. ‘Alright, that’s enough candidates,’ I said brusquely.

‘But I see three more right there,’ she replied poignantly, directing her gaze to the stack of folders on my desk.

‘I think that’s enough,’ I muttered. Her eyes were perhaps a little too sharp.

She frowned, and I wondered if in her mind she was blowing this interview.

She wasn’t, but I could think of something else she could.

Collect yourself Chris.

‘Miss Kavanagh, there is a final portion to the interview,’ I said, voice almost a hiss since most candidates I interviewed never even got to this part.

She didn’t reply, simply content with boring into me with those hazel eyes.

‘One of our associates isn’t cutting it, so what I’m going to need you to do is fire him.’

She blinked rapidly. ‘Right now?’

‘As soon as I call him in.’

I expected her to pause and collect her bearings for a few moments at least, but without hesitation, she replied, ‘Sure.’

Slightly astonished by her lack of concern, I forced my attention to the phone, transferring myself to the associate’s room. ‘Tyler, could you come to my office please?’ I asked with underlying command.

Though the associate’s room was on the other side of the floor, Tyler arrived within ten seconds flat, breathy from the run.

I trained them well.

‘Yes, Mr. Brimstone?’ he said, his wary expression adding to the dramatics of it all.

‘Tyler, this is Miss Kavanagh. She is interviewing for Jack’s former position,’ I explained as I motioned a hand towards Stacey.

He threw on a dumb smile. ‘Hi Miss Kavanagh! I look forward to working with you.’

Stacey didn’t even bother with his outstretched hand.

She cleared her throat, and didn’t flinch or stutter even once as she spoke. ‘I apologize that I had to be the one to tell you this Tyler. I’m sure you have a bright future ahead of you, but that future will not be at Brimstone and Associates.’ Her voice was level, and I found her natural authority strangely arousing.

Tyler looked confused. ‘Excuse me? Sorry – I – I don’t understand.’

‘You’re being let go Tyler,’ Stacey clarified. ‘Please pack up your things. You have one hour before security intervenes.’

Tyler looked from Stacey to me, and I simply nodded. Seconds past, and I as reality sunk in, he began breathing heavily, shoulders rising and falling, forehead shiny from sweat. To be honest, I was afraid he was having a stroke, and it looked as though he was going to cry, eyes sheened with wetness. Without warning, he bolted from the room before his tears fell out, leaving Stacey and I alone once more.

‘Well, I think that concludes our interview,’ I said, cutting through the thick tension. ‘Our assistant will be in contact.’

‘Sure,’ she said simply, and that little word was starting to get on my nerves.

Before I could say anything else, she stood and whisked out the door, leaving me staring at those long legs as she walked toward the elevators. And just like that, my annoyance turned to lust.

Fuck, this was confusing."
7r3o26,13,2018-01-17,Cheating wife M/F,swedenbeauties,sexstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/7r3o26/cheating_wife_mf/,"The evening had escalated quickly and I thought of my husband probably sat at home and about to go to bed alone after beers and a take away as I was led by the hand in to the boardroom, where hours earlier I had sat taking notes in the meeting. Olly had reluctantly agreed to me being away for the night once again and he knew from past experience that Chris, my boss, was a lecherous old guy who made it quite clear that he viewed me as a dumb bimbo and eye candy employed for his own perverted pleasure. He would regularly tell me how hot I looked at work and make highly inappropriate comments but I needed this job and so I had put up with it and by now got used to it. I secretly found it quite arousing that this guy, who was only weeks away from his retirement, would undress me with his eyes and make no attempt to hide his erection whenever we were alone together at work but nothing had ever developed between us and nor did I expect it to. I constantly mock-scolded him and threatened to tell his wife whenever he got a little too rude but I always felt safe in his company. This I had convinced myself was simply another part of my new job and the extra pay, cash in hand at the end of every evening, was certainly needed and easy money to earn. I simply had to keep the fact from my hubby, who would have gone nuts if he found out the truth how I was making so much extra cash all of a sudden, that I was essentially becoming a high-class escort girl.
For the third Saturday night this month I was ‘working late’ again and as Chris turned the lights on in the familiar luxurious boardroom I was impressed that the scene had already been set. Bottles of wine were already on the large wooden table along with a plastic bag clearly from a local sex shop in the city. Unusually there weren’t any other business men around as usual and a few large soft cushions on the boardroom table as well which were an intriguing new twist.
‘That’s for you, now be a good girl…’ he winked at me pointing towards the bag. It wasn’t the first time that I’d been in a situation like this and the extra pay certainly made up for me having to dress up in cheap sex shop clothing and pour drinks and take notes for the guys whilst parading around scantily clad in some slutty outfit. I’d convinced myself that this wasn’t anything bad, providing entertainment to guys who liked to ‘look at pretty girls dressed up for their titillation’ as Chris regularly described my new job role. If other guys attended the meetings they usually tipped me really well too and Chris made it clear that there was a no touching policy, that I was there to provide visual entertainment and that I was strictly for their eyes only. The closest that things had got to being really debauched was at one late night ‘meeting’ where a very d***k Chris almost came in his pants when one of my tits fell free of the skimpy school girl outfit that I was wearing and bumped against his glass spilling his drink in his lap. I didn’t cover my exposed breast instead I dutifully mopped him clean with a tissue being careful to linger momentarily too long around his cock. I could feel it twitch against his trousers each time I dabbed at the stain and I made a mental note that this dirty old pervert was in fact pretty well endowed. Putting my large breast back in my school girl shirt I gave my nipple a little pinch and held Chris’s gaze with an innocent smile before heading off to get changed back in to my office wear. That night was the first time that I realised that acting like a sex object for other men apart from my husband really turned me on. As I dressed to go home it had only taken about a minute of touching myself in the bathroom to achieve several powerful and discrete orgasms and I knew that I would only get more and more daring as I grew in to my new job role. I wiped my sticky juices from my fingers over the trashy school girl outfit as a souvenir for my boss and headed home.

Emma was out again for the night and I planned to make the most of every minute of my ‘me’ time. I’d barely had chance to shower before I heard the knock on the door and Keely had arrived as promised. Emma looked super-hot as always in her short skirt and thigh high boots and as she was about to leave for her work meeting I had pushed her roughly against the hallway wall, hitched her shirt up, pulled her knickers aside and fucked her from behind. It was a quick a****listic fuck, the friction of her panties against my angry prick adding to the excitement and I was determined to mark my wife with my own spunk before a day ahead of her spent with men who I knew would all be thinking about fucking her. With a final deep thrust I held her tight as I emptied by balls inside her tight cunt.
‘For fucks sake! I told you NOT to cum inside me!’. I’d heard her alright but as I wiped my spent cock over her new knickers, leaving a sticky cum stain all over her arse, I couldn’t care less. We’d been going through a rough patch over the last few months and this only made me want to fuck her like a slut more than I usually did. Sex during times like this always felt dirtier than usual with us both being pissed at each other for some reason or other. Tonight though was all about my fun and as I opened the door Keely smiled sweetly up at me and my cock began to stir again in my jeans. She was in her early 20’s and a former student who I had tutored as an intern on a work placement some 6 or seven years ago. That was the last time that I had seen her and now she was walking in to my home for one reason only, to fuck me. All of the guys at work had unsuccessfully tried to hit on her when she was a student, being married I’d been a good boy but we did flirt a lot and I’d heard from a reliable source that she found my arrogance and good looks a real turn on. She’d messaged me out of the blue via social media asking for some bullshit career advice and I’d soon turned our professional chat to filthy sex talk insisting that she sent me selfies of her amazing body. I’d jerk off over them at work or in the bath and send her cum splattered images back to her telling her that I wanted to spunk all over her in real life. Her short cropped blonde hair, big green eyes and flawless skin gave her the look of a model and she looked young enough still that she was regularly asked for ID when out drinking. She had her nose pierced and I knew that she had a tramp stamp tattoo at the top of her arse from the pictures that she had been sending me. Also from these pics I had the knowledge that she had matching short blond pubic hair and what looked like a super tight little cunt. Keely’s long slender legs looked amazing in her high heels, she was much taller than Emma, and as she leaned forward to kiss me my hands pulled at her tight little arse. Her big tits squashed against my chest and still with our tongues in each other’s mouths I began to unzip her knee length jacket. Things were progressing exactly as she had said they would in her messages and as previously instructed she was wearing only a bra and knickers. As her jacket fell to the floor my prick was now fully erect once more. She wore matching red satin underwear and her body looked perfectly fuckable. I’d lost count of the number of times that I’d fantasised about putting my big cock in all of her tight young holes. She’d claimed in her messages that she loved to suck cock and eager to find out I unbuttoned my jeans and pulled out my throbbing dick. Without hesitation, this stunning young girl dropped to her knees in front of me and began to plant gentle kisses over my bell end as she slowly pulled back my foreskin. Her slurps and moans of pleasure only added to my lust for her and I watched her in the full-length mirror as she took my cock between her lips and began to blow me. Her low-cut bra gave a perfect view of her huge cleavage and as I bent over to unfasten it I pushed my hips forcefully towards her so that the tip of my cock hit the back of her throat making her gag then giggle. She took all nine inches comfortably and her tongue was lapping and licking my shaft as she pulled on my balls with her hand. Easing her bra straps over her shoulders I watched her big, firm tits fall free and sway gently as she sucked my cock and I pulled her head tighter to my groin to fuck her mouth hard and fast. I hadn’t seen a pair of gravity defying young tits like this for a few years and I was going to make sure that she left tonight having been fucked like she craved and deserved. I felt powerful taking advantage of Keely knowing that my wife was probably bored to tears at another work dinner but quickly put this thought out of my mind as I took my phone and began to film this sexy little bitch sucking me off so that I could have a wank over her again at a later time. Reaching down to pinch her nipple she took the tip of my dick between her lips and began to twirl her tongue in and around the eye of my cock and without warning my I began to cum. My hand was steady with my phone as I filmed the first jet of spunk pumping in to her mouth and then trickling back out between her lips as she then took me balls deep and held me there as the next four or five powerful cumshots filled her mouth. She was immediately on her feet and this time she pulled aggressively at my shirt, ripping off two buttons as we kissed again and I could taste my cum from her lips and hot tongue.

The lights were low and Chris had put some music on and poured himself a drink as the door opened again and Sam finally joined us. ‘The wife’ he smirked as he put his phone on the table and took off his suit jacket. I could hear the two of them chatting as I went to the bathroom, opened the bag and began to undress. I was trembling slightly but this was now from pure excitement as I saw the items that Chris had bought for me. A pair of black crotch less knickers were soon being slipped in to as I watched myself nearly naked in the bathroom mirror. I’d shaved my legs and pussy in the bath earlier and I was already getting hot between my thighs. Glancing down at my own discarded panties I could still see the cum stains on them from my husband earlier and felt a pang of guilt for him that his precious wife was once again about to parade around nearly naked for some stranger’s pleasure and for the extra cash. Olly hadn’t made me orgasm before I left and as he had fucked me hard and rough against the hallway wall I hadn’t been thinking about him but instead wondering what the night ahead had in store for me. The nipple tassles were lipstick red and easy to apply to my large erect buds. I gave a little jiggle in the mirror and watched as my heavy tits wobbled freely making the tassles twirl around. Tying my hair back in a long ponytail I put on the lacey black eye mask and giggled at the sight of me looking like some kind of slutty superhero. The final items in the bag were a bit of a surprise and for the first time in the evening I experienced a feeling of uncertainty. I’d been told as usual that I was required to simply dress to impress and play the hostess to the conclusion of the guys business meeting but this was taking things to another level. Sex toys are not really my thing so the jeweled butt plug and vibrating love-balls, along with bottle of champagne scented lube were very unexpected.
The love balls were vibrating slowly in my hand tickling my palm as I drizzled the lube over them. Reaching between my legs as soon as they got close to my pussy I felt a tingle of excitement race through my entire body. The first ball slipped between my wet lips easily closely followed by the second one and the sensations were immediate. It felt like four of five fingers exploring my pussy at the same time, all moving inside me in different directions. I let out a low sigh of pleasure and steadied myself against the sink in front of the mirror. Pulling my knickers down over my bum I now lubed up the butt plug and bit my lip as I positioned it against my arsehole. My ass is far too tight for a big cock, a finger is my personal preference, but the sensations from the balls squirming in my pussy were helping me to relax and with a little wiggle of my hips and a firm push on the plug, my arse muscles relaxed enough to allow the jeweled metal in to my tightest hole and again I took a deep breath as the sexual tension continued to build in my now trembling body. There I was, dressed like a stripper with both my ass and pussy full of toys and I hadn’t even started my work yet.
Back in the boardroom Sam passed me a glass of champagne and stood close beside me and surprised me as he suddenly pulled me close to him and kissed me slowly, his big lips locked tight against mine as I allowed him to push his tongue in my mouth. This kind of behavior was certainly usually off limits but Chris said nothing and feeling as horny as I did I responded by pushing my tits against him and running my hands through his hair returning the kiss. I could see Chris sat watching us making out and he had unzipped his trousers and was spitting on his fingers before lubing up his hard on which was on show for all to see. ‘Bend over the table Emma’ Sam ordered and as I did I pushed my arse in the air and gave a suggestive little wiggle of my hips.
Sam knelt down behind me and began to softly stroke my thighs and arse before he reached between my legs to find my clit. Suddenly I gave a yelp of pleasure as the balls in my pussy began to gyrate faster and Sam rubbed by clitoris vigorously. Chris was sat facing me across the table and slowly masturbating with his phone in his hand. He laughed out loud as I squealed again and the balls went crazy once more in my pussy before slowing down and speeding up again. This went on for a few minutes and orgasms were building and then suddenly stopping and I felt light headed with pleasure. The filthy old bastard showed me his phone from across the boardroom table and he was gleefully controlling the love balls from an app on his phone. Sam’s hand was pulling and gently twisting the butt plug and lost in the moment I was now rubbing my own clit, face down on the table, groaning with pure lust. Stepping out of his trousers and boxer shorts Sam moved towards me and I saw his long, slim cock for the first time. Lifting my legs on to the table and pulling me by my hair so that I had spun around to face him, Sam had me on my back with my head hanging over the tables edge level with his groin. He pulled at the nipple tassles and threw them in my face before leaning over me to suck on my tits, kneading them together in his large hands making my nipples swell harder. I had one hole that wasn’t yet full and I licked my lips and opened my mouth wide as an invitation to Sam. At the other side of the table I could feel Chris fumbling between my legs and felt his mouth against my toy filled pussy as he began to eat me out. He was still wanking as he licked and kissed his way over the crotchless knickers just as Sam’s dick came in to contact with my mouth. He tasted salty and a big vein pulsed in his long cock. I could feel it throb as I slowly sucked his meat in to my mouth wrapping it in my full lips as I reached around his waist to pull him closer to me while he pinched and pulled hard on my big tits.

In the kitchen, I fixed us both a drink and we finally managed to say hello to each other and make small talk about what we’d been up to in the years since we’d last met. The atmosphere felt relaxed but I could tell that Keely was going to be a handful this evening by the way that she kept running her eyes over me. My cock was still semi erect but already aching from two strong orgasms with two different women within the last few hours. She looked like a glamour model sat on the kitchen unit with her tits out wearing only her knickers and she was absent mindedly opening and closing her slender legs when I moved to stand between her thighs and kissed her passionately again. This time my hands were inside her knickers and my finger took no time to locate her clit and begin massaging it between finger and thumb. Her cunt hair felt soft and was getting matted from her leaking juices. Breaking from the kiss I wanted her big tits in my mouth and as I sucked and slurped her hardening nipples I pushed two fingers between her pussy lips and fingered her as deep as I could. I sucked so hard on her right tit that she gave a little squeal but I didn’t stop. I wanted to teach this horny young bitch a lesson in real sex and she was a fast learner. She began to pull and squeeze on my nipple in return as her other hand grasped frantically for my prick again. Keely was bucking wildly and deliberately hitting me in the face with her firm and heavy tits, grunting through gritted teeth each time she did so. A third finger then a fourth forced its way inside her pussy and her cries and pants were getting louder and louder as her cunt began to ooze more sweet juice all over my hand. I pulled my fingers out of her cunt and wiped them all over her face, ruining her make up before pushing them in her mouth to taste for herself. She again gave a cry but did exactly as she should by sucking my fingers like a true whore. My prick was now raging and exactly at the right height to penetrate her hot little fuck hole as she sat in front of me on the kitchen units but before I could try and fill her up for the first time she swung down beside me on to the kitchen floor and pushed me away.
Standing behind me now she reached under my balls and between my thighs pulling my cock down towards the floor and making it throb even harder from the discomfort of the unnatural angle. Her fingers were everywhere, running over my balls and between my arse cheeks but it was the unmistakable sensation of her tongue licking against my shithole that really fired me up. The slut was rimming me and doing it well. Each push of her tongue in to my arse was met by a slow tug on my prick and her rhythm was practiced to perfection. Lost in complete pleasure I glanced down between my spread thighs to watch this pretty little slag milk my big cock against her tits. She was grinning at me and enjoying the fact that she was the one now in control. Her finger and thumb were wrapped around the tip of my cock in a kind of ‘ok’ style grip and she was wanking me off slowly. Keely’s tongue though was equally as busy alternating between licking and sucking on my balls and spitting against my spread arse cheeks. When her finger finally began to push against my arsehole I tensed then tried to relax as she began to push her finger very slowly and purposefully inside my ass. Her nails were long and painted bright red and they scratched my hole as she slipped her finger deep inside right to her knuckle. The discomfort from her sharp nails against the sensitive skin of my arsehole made me grit my teeth but it felt incredible as I moved my hips in rhythm with her fingering me and felt her wrap her lips once again around my swollen prick as she greedily sucked my cock to the back of her throat.

7r3uuw,5,2018-01-17,Any Statisticians of Grand Rapids with advice for new job seekers?,one_curious_dog,grandrapids,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandrapids/comments/7r3uuw/any_statisticians_of_grand_rapids_with_advice_for/,"This hasn't been addressed in this subreddit and I am certainly curious. Many of us understand that moving to the East Side of the state will hold much better job prospects, however, that is not  what this post is  about. Lets gear this towards people that wish to stay/relocate to Grand Rapids

This can be as general or specific as you would like. I have some personal questions I would love answered  but feel free to ignore them and simply add more general advice that may help future job seekers:

1) As someone that wants to be more in the statistics side and less of the ""analyst"" (which seems to be more programming than real statistics work from the many job descriptions I have viewed), what are the job prospects like?
1a) Background on the reason behind 1*; I really want to stay in GR and work in position that I can learn and grow in. Current position as an intern is mostly just fixing broken code and fear taking an analyst position similar to what I am doing now could really handcuff your ability to grow. 

2) What are the biggest skills you found to be useful to you in your career - yes we can read what the job applications say, but want to hear from someone actually working.
  
3)How important is experience in grand rapids as everything seems to be looking for 1-3 year minimum. 

4)Whats a fair entry level salary range assuming someone has a qualified degree?

5) What are the best resources for find Stats jobs in the city? Simply linkedin and indeed, or is there something people may not think of that is great.

6) Do you think statistician roles and analyst roles are similar in job function inside of Grand Rapids?


Anything else I can think of I will add later. Like I mentioned there seems to be a lot of help and advice for other careers but none in Stats, despite GR supposedly having a big market for Statisticians.


TLDR: Comment on your experience as a statistician in grand rapids / data analyst.

7r410f,26,2018-01-17,"I'm [25M] she's [27F] only dating for 1 month. She sets a boundary, then crosses it soon thereafter. Should I continue this relationship?",Kwerti,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7r410f/im_25m_shes_27f_only_dating_for_1_month_she_sets/,"Hey /r/relationships,

I've been dating her for just about a month, but it's progressed MUCH quicker than my previous relationships have... as in talking on the phone everyday, meeting up 2-4 times PER week. This is causing us to have discussions and (arguments?) that I would've normally assumed would happen months down the road but she's extremely A-type and just has them upfront for whatever reason. My main issue is she has this habit of trying to be ""upfront"" and ""clear about boundaries"" but then does something that directly crosses the own boundaries she herself placed. This is rubbing me the wrong way, I don't care about the boundaries themselves, but when she establishes a boundary and then days later does something different it sends really mixed signals to me.

##**Background Info:**

###Me

Age 25, 26 in a month.

Full time corporate software job.

No debt, No kids, live alone.

Recently out of a relationship of 4 years. (2 months ago)

###Her

Age 27

Retired Military + Student - working towards bachelors + Internship

??? debt, lives 1 hr outside the city, 1 kid (7-8) 50% custody.

Recently out of an abusive relationship (4-5 months ago)

##The Details

When I say boundaries, I'll give some examples.

When we first started dating, she gave me some, in my opinion, reasonable boundaries.

""I don't have sex until I am in a committed relationship.""

""You won't meet, or be in a situation to meet my kid until we've been dating at least 6 months. ""

""If you sleep over at my house and my kid is at my house, we won't have sex that night.""


""I value punctuality, make every effort to be on time."" (Not really a 'boundary', but I'll get to that)

But we've been dating for almost a month now, and every single one of those she instigated me to ignore/break them.

1. The first time I went to her house and spent the night we had sex. (1 and 1/2 weeks into dating) She asked to have sex while we were making out on her bed

2. She had a discussion with me that included ""something you need to know about me, is I'm always late to things and that's just who I am""

3a. She invited me over to her house (2 weeks into the relationship) while her son was there, but had gone to bed. I did not spend the night.

3b. She invited me over again to her house (2.5 weeks into the relationship) while her son was there, but had gone to bed while sick... he woke up twice and I met him for the first time. Later that night I ended up staying the night in her room and she instigated sex with me. I left in the morning before her son awoke.

So basically my point is, she drew hard lines in the sand, and then days later ignored those lines without a real discussion about it. When I asked post-activity... ""hey I thought we were going to wait before doing x, y, or z"" she told me things like she's making concessions for me because she's so busy all the time and she's in charge of her own boundaries, etc. 



##**TL;DR**

She sets a boundary then crosses it shortly thereafter, am I crazy in thinking this is a systemic behaviour problem that could lead to serious issues down the line? e.g. If I establish a boundary she might think it's optional?

7r4hs1,84,2018-01-17,Gas-lighting away the shiny spine,lbrockma,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7r4hs1/gaslighting_away_the_shiny_spine/,"
TL/DR: After trying to show my shiny spine, my JNP's gas-lighted us into oblivion.

Background: 

A little over a year ago my JNB decided that it was appropriate to call DW a slut for wearing a tank top and shorts which DW and I took offense to (shocker, right?) and JNB and I had a nice text chat about why we don't like each other and why we probably never will and that we should limit contact. 

About a year ago, JNM and JND were invited over to our house for dinner, a few hours before they were supposed to come over JNM sent me a text saying how the three of them (meaning my brother was coming) were excited to have dinner with us. I responded with ""I'm excited to have you two over."" JNM then called me and started to berate me for not loving and accepting my coke-dealing brother for who he is and accepting the fact that ""he's doing so much better!"" This made me truly snap on her for the first time, I brought up how I felt that they loved JNB more than me, how they show their favoritism in a large variety of ways, among many other issues that I had with how they refuse to let DW and I be adults in their eyes.

A few months after that, I emailed my dad asking about what plans they had for JNM's birthday, he then asked if I had ""worked things out with JNB."" A series of emails went back and forth until JND proceeded to insult me, repeatedly, saying things like ""It's a man's role to eliminate drama, not create it! Assume the position."" It also referred to my blowout with JNM as me ""giving her the third degree"" and ""bringing up a laundry list of grievances dating back to my childhood."" I ended the conversation with the ultimatum of either getting family counseling or go NC. 

So I found a counselor who then advised me against family counseling because of JNM's repeated requests to ""just do it at her counselor."" He said that her pressuring me made it a bad idea to pursue family counseling and I agreed with him and conveyed that decision to JNM and JND. 

That brings us to last night:

After months of JND giving me the silent treatment (which we honestly didn't notice because I rarely talk to him anyways) he finally brought up that we never went to therapy. Even though I told him that it wasn't a smart move anymore. But we decided to have a ""family meeting"" where I could pick up the few remaining possessions at their house and try to clear the air of all the issues that we have been having. 

I got to their house in DW's rental car, she was T-boned right before Christmas and got a concussion but not hurt otherwise, and JND asked ""who's car is that?"" so I explained to him and repeated the story to JNM when we got inside. JNM didn't ask if DW was hurt in the accident, didn't ask how bad it was, anything. She also was wearing a suit jacket in preparation for the ""family meeting"" which I thought was incredibly odd. 

The meeting started with JND reading aloud the entire email string that started the NC/LC and after that we had this exchange:

""Where do you stand with this? Do you want family counseling? Do you want to just not talk to us ever again? Or do you want your family back?""

""Well, as I have stated before, family counseling is not a good idea. As of right now, I would choose no contact with how you have been treating DW and I, that may change based on how this conversation goes""

JND then proceeded to read a list of all the things that I have done to offend them organized into a handful of themes such as ""disrespectful"" and ""JNB"" and ""Manners."" During this, JNM would cry-yell at me about how much each item hurt her and in turn hurt the family. During this, JNM repeatedly exclaimed ""WHERE IS MY SON WHO USED TO BE SO HAPPY AND HAD A HEART FULL OF LOVE?!?!?"" and how I ""used to be such a happy-go-lucky kid!"" (that's news to me, I was extremely depressed in my teens). JNM also repeatedly said how DW's family is the fucked-up family and DW and I are ""making them feel like the ugly-stepparents!"" JND also revealed that they had shown the email thread between me and him to all our family friends and extended family and ""not one took (my) side!"" (almost like they only had half the story because I don't talk to my parents' friends behind their back). JNM also ranted at me about how ""I wouldn't dance with her at my wedding!"" In reality, she asked to have a ""parents dance"" where JNM and JND would dance together and everyone would watch. We said no because 1, that's strange, and 2, DW's parents recently split up so that would be incredibly awkward. I sat through about as much of it as I could, because I really wanted to know what their issues were, before saying ""I'm an adult, I do not have to sit here and be yelled at"" and that's when I walked out.

Here is the real kicker, you might be wondering what DW and I could have done to make them risk their relationship with their son and DIL over, here are a couple of my favorites:
- You didn't offer JND a drink of water when he came to help you work on your house (we offered him beer and if he wanted water maybe he could be an adult and get himself some damn water)
- You ordered TWO ROUNDS of expensive drinks one time at a restaurant (that was over two years ago)
- Not introducing them to people at our wedding events properly (almost like we were busy and DW's mom introduced them to dozens of people)
- Whispering to each other at dinner (sorry we have inside jokes?)
- Not paying for a repair on JND's truck (we offered, they told us to not worry about it)


Those are the reasons that they are willing to go NC with DW and me. 

That brings us to this morning:

JND sent me a syrupy sweet email about how they really wish that I would have stayed so we could ""resolve our issues"" and how ""conversations end up with elevated voices and yelling when one  or both people get emotional"" and how they still ""definitely want to have a 'normal' family relationship."" They were also kind enough to include the entire list of reasons why DW and I suck at being part of their family and a list of what they would like to see in the future which were:

-Better manners towards our family in general. Be kind and compassionate. 
-Speak up and work towards solutions, not grudges.
-If you make a mistake? Apologize, learn from it and take responsibility for it and and move on.
-Speak to us with the same compassion and respect you show others, no threats.
-More phone calls to chat about current events in our lives. Electronic communication doesn’t cut it when it’s the ONLY communication.

It's interesting how they expect me to talk to them more even when I have had a new job for about 4ish months now and they have not asked once what it is I do, what project I'm working on, anything. They also have told family/family friends that DW is ""back at her internship"" when in reality she got hired on as an engineer level II which is a HUGE deal at our age and we HAVE explained to them the difference in titles and that she did in fact get the full time position. I find it really interesting how they expect us to inform them of major life events without them having to show any interest whatsoever. 

I just wanted to share this blinding array of gas-lighting that DW and I have had to endure over the last 24 hours in the hope that it will help someone get through their gas-lighting experience and hopefully get some support because this has been a hellish ordeal"
7r4l9k,2,2018-01-17,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7r4l9k/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

7r4nsg,12,2018-01-17,Interviewing for an Actuary Internship with Data Science Background. Need Advice,thebdup,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/7r4nsg/interviewing_for_an_actuary_internship_with_data/,"So I applied to an actuarial internship on a whim and I didn't really expect to be interviewed for it, but they must have liked my background because they agreed to an interview. 

I graduated with a BBA in Economics and Information systems and this last fall I enrolled in a Data Science Master's program. I've been working as an ""Associate Information Management Engineer"" for the past year and a half since graduation. 

After looking through this subreddit it seems that there's a bit of overlap in Data Science and Actuarial Science and I'll continue to look through the FAQs to learn more. 

There are a few things that I'm concerned about though, and I'd like some advice. Some are related to the actuarial profession and some are more general. 

1. How much overlap is there, really? It seems as if both careers deal with a lot of data, algorithms, and quantitative/creative problem solving. I'm guessing a lot of meetings and coordination between departments like my current job?

2. What will they be looking for? I can assume they'll be asking the regular PBI interview questions. ""Tell me a time when...what did you do...what was the result."" I also assume that if I'm offered this internship they'll expect me to take an exam or two? Is there a polite way to ask if just my master's would be sufficient? 

3. How to I communicate that the reason why I'm leaving my current salaried position for an internship? I've had trouble with this one for the last few interviews I've done. The job that I'm working now is unfulfilling and my current employer didn't come through on most of what they said during the interview process. No training for SAS, tons of projects that get cancelled, manager and coworkers leaving every few months, and the worst is that none of what I've done has seemed important or up to my level of education (some days I feel like a glorified secretary). How do I politely communicate during the interview my reasons for wanting to leave, but also at the same time try to communicate the value in my experience? 

I'll take any advice anyone is offering, thanks. "

7r5yy9,1,2018-01-17,"I need help with a student/teacher/parents problem, and I'm on a deadline",_Ardhan_,teaching,https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/7r5yy9/i_need_help_with_a_studentteacherparents_problem/,"Not so much bad parenting (since I can't confirm it), but rather what I consider *horrible* teaching practices in school that led to me being (lightly) stabbed.

I'm studying to become a teacher and am currently an ""intern"" at a school (don't know the proper English word for it, but we're a handful of students who are placed into a school for six weeks each year as part of our education). We're currently in a 2nd grade class.

Anyway, on our first day we are told by the teacher assigned to us that she has a student who must be handled... gently. He is completely uninterested in school, wanders around the classroom doing whatever he wants, including disturbing the other students, even having full conversations with them *while* we're trying to teach. He doesn't respond to requests, instructions or criticism, and if you try to stop him from being disruptive, he resists - often violently. And if you have the audacity to actually physically direct or restrain him - woooh, you're in for a treat.

When I ask what methods they've tried with him, ""our"" teacher makes it pretty obvious that their handling of this student was quickly boiled down to ""let's not piss him off, because he will cry for an hour if necessary"", and so they give us a standing ""order"" to simply leave him be and only intervene when he is actively disrupting others. Which is constantly. This ""soft"" approach is emulated by every teacher in the school, so he basically has free reign, and the other 2nd graders have made note of it, leading to other students acting similarly.

Anyways, this week I got to finally spend some proper time with him, after two weeks of only observing, and today he decided he wanted to go outside and play in the snow. During class. Something he announces to everyone around him. So off he goes, and I follow, after getting permission from my teacher to try to handle him. I've had my suspicions for a while about why he acts the way he does, so I'm happy to finally get the chance to test my theory.

I stop him as he's zipping up his jacket, telling him we need to finish class before we go outside. I've built up a really good rapport with him over the previous two days by incorporating the subject we're teaching (fairytales) into a simplified game of D&amp;D/Blades in the Dark, which he thought was awesome, while it also allowed me to ""sneak"" my teaching into the game so that he got most of what the rest of the class was getting in the other room (oh yeah, if you want to get ANYTHING done, he apparently has to have his own room to ""work"" in). This rapport meant nothing now, though, as I gently told him that no, he could not go outside because he ""was going to"".

This... annoyed him.

He started small by whining and moaning while pushing weakly at me to get away from the door leading outside. I told him we had to stay inside, but that if he just told me he was going to go back to class, I would even go in first, because I trusted him (this [the trust part] was a lie, I'll admit). He refuses to answer, instead ramping up his shitty behavior by now pushing me hard and trying to bend my fingers. I close my fist so that he lets go and tell him not to do that. He continues, so I firmly lift him three feet away from me, which pisses him off. He comes back swinging, and I meet his fist with a light open-hand slap (to his fist) that halts the punch, which makes him pause. I'm still completely calm, as this really is just an issue of correcting his behavior by calmly showing him the consequences of his actions, in my opinion, and I tell him that he is not allowed to do that, and if he does it, people will do the same to him, which I don't like or want to do, ""let's be friends again, please"".

He resumes pushing at me, but now also throws in a barrage of angry punches and begins pinching and scratching me, so I give him a light, but firm push away from me, so that he's at arm's length again. I give him what I hope is a sad, sympathetic smile and tell him I don't like what we're doing right now, and that no one should be pushing or pinching or punching, or shoving, for that matter, but that I am NOT going to let him just hurt me like that. All while concentrating on being completely calm, as I think aggression is what really harms a child the most, not necesarily the use of a certain amount of force. If you remain calm and don't allow yourself to get angry, or at least to *show it*, I think a child who doesn't ""get"" verbal instructions regarding their violent behavior, might understand the ""action--&gt;consequences"" part of it when you respond by, say, pushing them away if they try something violent. Not all kids, but some.

Anyway, at this point he takes a step closer and tells me he is going to bring a gun to school (""I have one at home"") that he will shoot me in the eye with, and that he'll stab me with a knife. I respond ""no"" and hold out my hand in a ""stop"" motion when he takes another step. He stops and regards me, unsure what to do. He's forgotten how angry he is, for the moment, but is quickly working that out in his head. I tell him I will move as soon as he confirms that he will return to class, because I trust him.

So he stabs me in the chest with a pencil.

It's a quick overhand stab that, thankfully, doesn't penetrate my skin, and I push him to the ground before he can get another one in, but I decided then that I was DONE with this shit. I tell him in my calmest furious tone that he will *not* do that again, and yank the pencil out of his hand and toss it in the trash before going down to one knee and grabbing him in what was basically a reverse bear hug. At this point he goes through an escalation of emotion similar to what I'd just seen over the past fifteen minutes, but within the span of seconds. He pushes, punches, pinches and scratches, before finally starting to howl, with tears and everything.

Thing is, *anyone* who has *ever* worked in a kindergarden knows this type of crying. It's the fakest, most forced howling I've ever heard. The only thing giving it such ""force"" is the intensity he puts into it. And it's at this point I realize that all of this shitty behavior of his is simply a tool he uses to get his way - confirming my suspicions. At least to the best of my limited knowledge, granted, but I'm confident of it. I've noticed him constantly monitoring us adults whenever he acts out, gauging for our reactions, and this is exactly the same, except it's his trump card. So, once I feel certain that I haven't actually hurt him (I was *really* careful - I believe in a limited, rare use of force in certin instances, never as punishment or something reactionary), I simply turn off my brain and ignore him, thinking of the D&amp;D campaign I'm planning nowadays, while telling him calmly that I will not let go until he tells me what we should do here. But he persists.

Then, suddenly, there's a hand on my shoulder, and another reaching for the boy. It's one of the assistants who often spends alone time with him. She smiles apologetically at me and mutters something about having to go, then grabs him and repeats herself, at which point I hear what she says, that she had offered to take him. Before I can object, she has already asked him if they should go to the play room, at which point he instantly calms down and comes with her without a fight. I was left dumbfounded and absolutely furious at myself for not speaking up and stopping her, but it was too late, and my whole effort was wasted. I was fucking *stabbed* for nothing.

At least I feel confident now as to what his problem is: adults. WE are the problem, not him. He's a pretty normal kid, and smart about the things that interest him. Our teacher has never seen him finish a full session of teaching (45 minutes), yet I kept him talking about fairytales (during D&amp;D), various ships (he LOVES ships, especially the *Titanic*, and wants to be a shipwright) and even god damn atoms and electrons for two whole hours without even moving from his seat. The kid *gets it*, but for now only when presented through a fun medium. So no, the problem is *us*, and what signals we're sending.

His problem is that no one sets any boundaries for him, or presents consequences to his shitty actions. I've asked our teacher about his parents, who claim that ""he's perfectly fine at home"", which indicates to me that he is allowed to do whatever he wants, despite his parents otherwise being good, seemingly responsible people. The way he talks himself also indicates this. This, of course, makes our job as teachers much harder (if true). But even if parents fail at boundaries, we must be consistent in enforcing them, so as to give the kids a predictable everyday life.

This is not what our school does, and I'm unsure how to handle it - to the degree that I should get further involved at all. Instead of uniting in correcting his behavior and sending him a clear message, the agreed upon strategy between ALL the 2nd grade teachers is to allow him to roam freely and do his own thing (not learning shit), even walk into *other* classrooms and wander around there as well. It's absolute mayhem, and even though they admit that he is WAY behind everyone else on the curriculum(?) and simply cannot be evaluated in several subjects due to his load of incomplete work/attendance, they still aren't changing *their own* behavior.

I've seen how smart he is, and how he *is* able to sit still for extended periods, but his wiring is such now that he's ""allergic"" to doing what he's supposed to do, and I think he's simply rejected school in general as something he just doesn't ""get"" or needs to participate in. I firmly believe that it's *our* fault, but I don't know how to broach this or how to propose a plan to change our strategy. Me and my group of fellow students are only here for three more weeks, so our influence is limited, but I *really* want there to be a change in how they deal with this kid. He deserves better.

7r5z4v,2,2018-01-17,M4F - Naughty Little Cousin,Neal_Caffrey1,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7r5z4v/m4f_naughty_little_cousin/,"It was my second year of college and already my parents were pressuring me to get an internship.  All of my friends were staying through the summer in our college town working random jobs, partying, and having fun, but I was being shipped off to work at some boring company where I would probably not to much more than fetch coffee and copy papers.  No matter how much I complained though it was clear I really didn't have a choice.  

""The good news"" as my parents put it was that I wouldn't have to pay rent and I got to stay with my aunt and uncle.  It wasn't the end of the world as they had a nice house, a pool,  hot tub, etc., but I also really learned to enjoy my personal space being at college now for a while so I wasn't sure how much I would like living in the guest bedroom of my aunts house, but things could be worse and I did clearly understand how much money it would save for my parents so I agreed.

The good news was my little cousin would be there.  She was still in high school, but we always got along pretty well.  I always teased her growing up that she was the family favorite and could do no wrong.  The rest of us cousins regularly got in trouble and disappointed constantly being told how they wished we could be more like you.  I wasn't bitter about it though because we always got along pretty well.

What I would come to find out though is you have grown up a lot since the last time I saw you.  No longer were you the nerdy freshman bookworm.  The glasses were gone, the body was filling in, the smile was.... really really nice, but thankfully that bubbly personality everyone loved was still there.

But it turns out a lot of your friends were away for the summer so you and I would end up spending a lot of time together and you were pretty anxious to show me how much growing up you had done....

(I see this going a few different ways depending on what you are into so I am very excited to hear your thoughts.  It could be a two-way flirting relationship that gets out of hand, it could be a situation where you tease me and I try to resist until I can't any more, it could be you being inquisitive and playing dumb not realizing how much you are teasing me and I take advantage of your innocence, or (my favorite) you decide to have fun with the fact that I'm attracted to you, but I am so fearful to show it because I didn't want anyone to find out or I would be so shamed because everyone would assume it was my fault.  This could lead to some very risky scenes with your parents in the house or close by.  We could be tempted to remove condoms as we run out (risky sex and creampies are a big turn on for me as well as cum play in general)  Honestly I am very open to anywhere you want to take this scene so please feel free to talk it through with me or just jump right in!  Either way is fine!)"

For those who do not want to read any of that:

The TL/DR, man from my gun club buys machinegun. Transfers to incompetent gun dealer A. A leaves town, leaves business to T. T is even more incompetent. Lawsuit from vendors filed against gun dealer, big dollar transferable MG potentially going to creditors to cover debts or ATF cuts it up because they are dissolving the LLC to dodge creditors. FC hired as head salvage master to deal with this shit. 

SO! If you didn't want to read everything, YOU ARE ALL CAUGHT UP!

Tim the shithole gun dealer moved from place A to place B to place C. ATF didn't even know he abandoned A so getting his licensed premises moved over took a while. The minute ATF had fresh data updated in their system, the license is back in play, valid and good to go.

Anyhow. Right after the info got updated with ATF, I called the local field office to make sure that we're clear to file new forms. The area supervisor says go ahead and file forms and we'll get it going on this end. 

NO THANKS TO SILENCERSHOP/DEADAIR/ET AL with their barcode form 4 system that will not let you do a form 4 from a dealer to a dealer - I did the forms by hand sans barcode. Note: I called silencer shop about this problem. I was told by one of the employees there that the system was not designed to do form 4's like that BECAUSE AN SOT IS REQUIRED TO SELL ANY CLASS 3 ITEM. I told them they were wrong and we argued about it on the phone. So much for them supposedly being the most technically savvy people in the business. Insert massive eye roll here. It was very disappointing they did not meet the needs of everyone in the NFA world with this software rollout, one of my many criticisms of the system, but I digress.

I print off fresh forms and they require Tim's signature. I drive over there around closing time and ask him to sign the forms. I roll up to his place and I notice a black 4x4 diesel F350, used but not abused one roll up door down. I walk back behind and see a vanity license plate that says GO LSU. I snort and chuckle a bit.

You see, gentle readers - just to put some whipped cream on top, Tim's neighbor in the complex is one of my dad's old poker buddies. When I graduated high school I actually used to do an unpaid internship at Jeff's pawn shop. That's how I started slinging guns. So I stuck my head in and said hi to Jeff, caught up with him and showed him pics of my newborn nephew and on the way out I told him to watch his new neighbor like a hawk for me and let me know if he smells anything fishy or the leasing agents start poking around looking for money. 

Thankfully because I know the listing agent of his place and the broker is a customer of mine (he may be repping a listing for some commercial real estate I own and wants to keep me happy) his office manager gave me all the details of his lease, including the fact that Tim can't pass a credit check and HIS OWN MOTHER HAD TO SIGN THE NEW LEASE TO COVER HIS ASS. 

Once more, the plot doesn't get thicker - just more pathetic. 

Now, I know what you're thinking. You know the leasing agent, people at ATF, Tims new neighbor - you've gotta be shitting us. No, I'm not shitting you. I've been in Baton Rouge MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE. My dad's friends are my friends. I've got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases my blues away. And it'll be okay.

I walk into Tim's shithole. The air compressor is running because he's bead blasting the herpes sore off his junk or something. Don't know, don't want to know.

He comes over and asks what I want. He's not vaping for once THANK THE LORD.

I hand him a sheaf of form 4's and tell him to sign. HE LOOKS CONFUSED and tells me he's already filed form 4's and gotten his class 3 sorted out.

Readers, one thing to be admired about pathological liars is just how far they're willing to go. Before I drove over there, I called ATF and they confirmed NO WORKING PAPER FOR THAT SERIAL NUMBER. I created a fake email address under his name and emailed Amy Freeman at ATF NFA Branch in West Virginia to check SOT status. NO WORKING SOT STATUS FOR CURRENT OR FORMER FFL OR ANY EIN under that company. NOTHING. And I got the screencaps to prove it. 

FC: Just sign the damn papers so I can get out of here.

Tim: Where?

The compressor hits the cut in and fires up. I can barely hear myself.

FC: THE BOX MARKED SIGNATURE! AND DATE!

He looks at me funny and I stare him down like a truck stop rapist. Just like Tom Petty - I won't back down. 

He signs them. I look them over, satisfied with the results and the signature I call the owner. He's on vacation in Tunica at the craps table. 

FC: Hey! I saw Tim and ATF updated the license so I got the form 4's signed and they are going out tomorrow.

Owner: Alright, do you need anything from me?

FC: If you want to have your accountant cut me a check so you can track the tax payment, you can otherwise I'm just gonna plug in my amex and when it gets here it gets here.

Owner: I trust you. Call me if you need anything.

FC: Alright. We'll get it going. Put $5 on the pass line for me, if the point hits 6 or 8 take full odds behind the line and let me know how it does.

Owner: You got it!

So, this is right after thanksgiving. 

A few days before Christmas, I get a call from the owner. Tim's mom has redone the form 4's and wants him to come down and do them. He wants to know what I think about it. I said WHY THE FUCK IS SHE DOING THE FORMS? She's barely qualified to be a cashier, much less a Form 4! I'm like WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING PAPERWORK NOW? They have been saying the paperwork has already been done! So, that's another fucking lie that I get to catch them in. So he asks me what to do. I tell him not to do a damn thing. I'm Winston Fucking Wolf and I've got this thing handled now because:

ONE: Paperwork is working at ATF, they charged my amex platinum card for the tax and I can show you the receipt for it if you want 

TWO: When I sent in the forms to ATF - I put in a letter with it explaining the nature of the situation with copies of the emails from the ATF local area supervisor with her business card attached.

THREE: When I sent the forms to ATF I enclosed a legibly drafted handwritten note with my business card attached asking them to forward the completed forms to ME instead of Tim, because lord knows they'll just trash it. They cannot be trusted at this point to do the right thing at all, and if the form gets destroyed - it's a lot of work for the non selling party to get a new one. 

He seems to understand and says he'll make an excuse or two and I told him I'd have an update when new information warrants it.

Last Tuesday - 9 January, the owner calls me again wanting an update. I explained to him that with the bomb cyclone and ATF - the office is shutdown and people are not working until the roads get cleared but I have phone calls and emails into the IOI and the NFA branch to check on the situation. A week before I had called a division chief and explained the situation and he seemed receptive to getting this resolved PROVIDED that the local area supervisors were on board with everything we're doing since a lot of this is outside standard protocol. 

That's when I get the bad news. The area supervisor we have been working with has retired effective 31 December. She's gone. Ruh roh. I make a call into the local field office and leave a message to get caught up. I call back the owner and he says that he paid a visit to shitheads place earlier in the day. We're not calling him by his name anymore. We're just calling him shithead now. For some strange reason, this brings me great pleasure and I laugh heartily. He's pissed because it has now been TWO FUCKING YEARS since he cut his first check. 

So the owner goes over to shithead's place and he says that Tim's mother is working there and when he walks in he says ""I swear to the lord, it was like I walked in and caught her having sex with someone, she turned white as a sheet"" - as it happens, the big man in the room was the NEW ATF Area Supervisor wondering WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE and he was taking the proverbial bull by the horns and he was not in the mood for their brand of handy dandy country bumpkin bullshit. He tells me that it did not look good and the ATF agent did not look pleased.

This brings a smile to my twisted face. He deserves every rogering that he gets. 

Fluffy on the show last week said that I've got an early morning taunting to do and he was right.

The next day I went over to shitheads to make sure that he was still in one place and not running from the landlord when his rent was due. I checked with ATF and still no good answers to the situation. I call the owner back and leave him a VM letting him know that I've got nothing on this side to work with and it's just wait for ATF to do their thing.

FAST FORWARD TO TODAY.

Larry my mailman stops by, hands me my monthly copy of Destinations from Amex, my electric bill and a HANDWRITTEN ADDRESSED ENVELOPE FROM THE BUREAU.

Hmmmm. What could this be? Could it?

I tear into it like a newly minted parolee tears into the most recent printing of Hustler. 

Lo and behold, an approved Form 4. Christmas came late for the owner. I drop everything, shove the form in the xerox machine and run off a copy and as the toner warms up I debate exactly how I want this to go down. 

I message the gunnit live crew.

FC: SON OF A BITCH HOLY MOTHERFUCKING SHIT I AM A GOD. Victory is mine. Victory is mine. I drink from the keg of glory. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land.

I GOTS TO GO GET ME A MACHINEGUN! I am driving to this motherfucking cock sucker’s place right now and I’m gonna rip them an asshole soon as I get that gun in the trunk of my car.
I’m almost tempted to recorded and uploaded the sound cloud later. It’s gonna be fucking epic. I’m ready to rip out his eyes and shit down his fucking skull

The gang does not believe me. One person says I will get gun and say later. I set my phone to record as I walk in their shithole gun business. 

The door is open. Mommy and shithead are standing around. Mom is wearing a mumu smoking a 305. Son is wearing a smock smoking a 305. I hand shithead the xerox form 4. 

Note, this is a rough draft. I have not listened to the recording of what happened although Omni did. We might upload it to soundcloud. 

""That's your copy. Can I get this machinegun now please?""

Everyone looks at me funny.

Mom: How'd you do that? We're done with this? Thank you!

Me: Just give me the gun please

Mom: Well I'm gonna call the owner he's gonna be pleased! (she gets the phone and starts dialing)

Me: I will call the owner when I get out of here, you don't have to do that. 

Mom: Well he's gonna be really happy.....

Me: I have the number, I can call him, just give me the stuff so I can get out of here and go home.

Mom: Well here's the phone you can call him - she dials the number and I press off on the phone. 

Editors note: I DON'T WANT TO BE ON THE PHONE I WANT TO BE CURSING SHITHEAD AND THE MAN THAT RAPED HIS MOTHER 35 YEARS AGO. 

They fish the gun out of the safe. I check the serial number. It checks out. Everything good. I bag it up.

Me: Tim, I don't know what you did with ATF but I checked everything you said and you're nothing but a liar and a....

Just as I'm ready to call him a no good four flushing shithole gun dealer worst human being I have ever met motherfucker to his face in front of his own mother......

His mom grabs her J frame 357 in one hand, cordless phone in the other to start calling 911 and starts telling me to get out of her store and starts walking towards me aggressively.

Editors note: since she's the principal on the lease, since her son can't pass a credit check I GUESS THAT WOULD MAKE IT HER STORE!

I yell some more as she's pushing me out the door - to her credit, she's managing to pack heat, dial 911 *AND* yell at the man who is calling her little boy names while keeping the 305 in her mouth firmlgy between her lips

FC: DON'T YOU EVER CALL ME AGAIN ASKING FOR ANYTHING 

On the way out, people are now staring at what's going on. I debate screaming one profanity laced tirade past the threshold but I decide that it's not worth it. I backed my car in to the neighbors spot, threw it in gear and hightailed it out of there.

Oh, and I recorded all this on tape for your listening pleasure. Because that's what I do.

I call the owner. No answer. I call his wife's cell.. Answer. She puts him on.

Owner: WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO? I just got a call from shithead and his mother telling me you went over there and painted the place blue.

FC: Sure did. And he deserved it. I got your gun. Wanna come look at it?

Owner: How's tomorrow at 9AM?

FC: I'll lock it up in the safe for you. See ya soon.

So guys, Victory is mine. I drink from the keg of glory. 

And he who laughs last, laughs best.

[When I gave them the form 4, they didn't check the back.](https://imgur.com/a/CBxv6)

I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion here but as someone who has dealt with excessively time consuming projects that it's not all fun and games when calculating the value of your labor. After taking into account the tax, the time and all the headaches I finally decided that a fair price would be something like nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.

7r77ie,1230,2018-01-17,Does every job have an anime dedicated to it?,GreenReversinator,anime,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7r77ie/does_every_job_have_an_anime_dedicated_to_it/,"Because I get bored easily, I wanted to see how many real occupations were covered in anime. As in, it's not just in the background of one episode, the entire anime focuses on it (whether or not it does a good job of accurately portraying it is another story). The two (loose) guidelines are that it's a job that can be found in real life and that the material doesn't immediately forget about it (i.e. no salarymen who get isekai'd in chapter 1). This list builds off of a [previous list](https://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/7qugl2) that I started on /r/manga, so there's a mix of both manga and anime. Chip in if you can think of any missing jobs (but make sure to use your search function; no need to repeat what's already here)!

7r7hrk,2,2018-01-18,Tips for a recent MSc graduate looking for an approximately one-year finance-oriented job in HK,SureCraft,HongKong,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/7r7hrk/tips_for_a_recent_msc_graduate_looking_for_an/,"Hi everybody. 

I'm an English/Spanish 22-year-old who has recently graduated from University College London (UCL) with a MSc in Financial Risk Management, and who prior to that, also completed a BSc in Mathematics at another UK university, who is particularly interested in living HK for about a year while working for a financial entity. I think this would be a great decision to make as I would be gaining a very similar work experience than the one I would gain if I were to instead work in London, but with an additional topping of ""adventure"" and other valuable life experiences.

To be more specific, given my previously mentioned academic background, I'm mainly looking for quantitative risk/data science/machine learning trainee roles that last for approximately 12 months (this of course means longer if necessary) in any financial firm (or startup) located in HK.

Therefore, I was wondering how easy (or difficult) and competitive is the process of applying to a role of this nature for an international applicant such as myself compared to the local HKers, of whom I imagine are equally as qualified as I am, or perhaps even more qualified. Because of this similar level of qualification among the locals I've heard that it can be quite a strenuous process to apply to a job in HK as a foreigner without having any prior work experience. However, I don't think that I'm at such a huge disadvantage in terms of academic qualifications. I've also completed two internships in the past (yes, I know internship work experience is not the same as the work experience of a full-time job), one of which was in Beijing, so this prior exposure to Asia also puts me in a more ""advantageous"" position compared to other international applicants who are fresh out of university (I guess).
 
In addition to this, does anybody here know if using a recruiter would increase my likelihood of finding a trainee position rather than searching for the roles on platforms such as LinkedIn or Glassdoor and applying to them ""manually"", and if so, what recruiters or websites should I use?

Any tips or anecdotes from someone who works in the HK financial sector, knows somebody who works in the HK financial sector, or simply somebody who has gone through this process before, would very much be appreciated and taken on board. Thanks a lot in advance!"
7r7vj1,100,2018-01-18,A story about a friend of a friend.,Vat1canCame0s,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/7r7vj1/a_story_about_a_friend_of_a_friend/,"So we have a board gaming group. It started out as D&amp;D during sophomore year of college and eventually we just kinda alternated between the campaign and different board games/couch co-op or party video games etc etc.

Every now and then we would have a guy come who's name is so hilarious that I hate that I can't actually give it to you for the sake of anonymity.  Let's just say it was two words that meant ""dust covered male genitals"". Yeah, I had to ask again my first time meeting him too just to be sure I had heard correctly.

Anyways ""Lysol-lacking richard"" was hella elitist about gaming. He was the power gamer, in it to win it every time. We all enjoyed the occasional moment of ""OMG that was amazing""  but for the most part we didn't think too hard. It was Saturdays.We saved the grey matter for school during the week. This guy however wasn't trying to win, he was trying to embarrass you.  More than once he would iterate, move-for-move, how he had beaten you so many turns before the game was over and explain the exact moment ""you had really lost"". Sounds lovely right? 

One week we decided what we were gonna play the next week and he admitted to having gone out and bought the game and playtested it to death just to be ready to whoop us.

His contributions to D&amp;D weren't fantastic either. Our whole party was supposed to be weird with not a lot of min-maxing and more just being goofy. And any time our characters by chance, ended up perfectly suited for the situation at hand, we took to the role-playing with a relish of humor. For instance, my Psion changeling with  high charisma stats didn't just infiltrate the town, he accidentally killed a guard and ended up having to replace him and go live his life with his family, them none the wiser, for a week instead of finding the info we needed immediately.

 But not ""neglected-shelf-in-the-sun Johnson. "" he rolled new characters every other week and they were precision calibrated to do things straight faced and with a mechanical efficiency I would actually applaud under other circumstances. 


(""Needs-a-swiffer Willy""  also claimed he was previously in the Navy, could kill you a dozen different ways with his pinkie, ""what did you just say to me you little shit?"" Copy pasta fodder Etc etc but he was also like 280 pounds and this claim was that it was a recent enlistment so not really sure how that all worked....)

During this time I met and started dating the woman I would come to marry. She's a walking D&amp;D encyclopedia. Knows her shit backwards and forwards. So naturally she would occasionally come play with us when she wasn't studying or hanging out with her girlfriends.  The one time she and this dude were both there it got weird. First he starts very actively hitting on her. It was hella awkward as he was the only one in the room not aware that we were dating and when I made it apparent with some light PDA he immediately switched gears. He was suddenly drilling her on D&amp;D stuff, asking her the level 17 perks of this class or the materials required for that spell etc etc as if he was out to prove she was a ""fake gamer girl"" or whatever.

The weirdest single moment was a during my internship.  I was back in town over the summer to get them credit hours and I crashed at the apartment of one of the newly graduated friends in the group. So a few of us were sitting around playing the Far Cry 3 multiplayer mode when another friend who didn't know ""undusted cocks"" that well joined us. For whatever reason we just got absolutely spanked by the game and my friend says ""damn that was brutal"" to which the dude replies ""that's nothing, trying playing ""Bionic Commando"". My friend, putting aside the weird elitism of the comment,  then said ""I've never heard of that one"" 

....


""Get out...""

""Yup, m'fraid I don't play that many ga-""

""No, I'm serious. Leave. Right now.""
No sarcasm,  no wit, nothing to indicate anything other that complete sincerity. 

He insisted on it for another minute before another guy in the group talked him inti something else entirely.


 All in all, a weird dude."
7r8r78,1,2018-01-18,Music production with imac 5k late 2015 and macbook pro 13 2016 / 2017 external boot,IHuz,Music_Producers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music_Producers/comments/7r8r78/music_production_with_imac_5k_late_2015_and/,"Hey Guys,

Im new here and have some questions about the workflow in music production with the devices in the topic.

Im currently using a imac 5k late 2015 and ist pretty satisfying my demands for music production. Well im currently have the problem to work on the road or in friendshouse, since i have au plugins and he is using vst plugins and his macbook 15 is quite hustling with 8 gb ram

So my solution is to get a samsung T5 1 tb SSD makes it bootable with my whole OS and boot it everytime on my my iMac and probably my new Macbook 13.( can use the intern storage later for study work, so It can have multiple functions)

So the Questions :

Is it a good idea to get the macbook 13 2016/2017 for semi-use for music production ? Or would it too weak for continue projects from my imac? ( i use alot of audio units and i dont want to clip/freeze tracks) so i can show my projects and edit them and work on on my imac later

Does it work properly to boot from an eSSD?

Or should I sell my iMac and get the 15 inch, but i dont want the touchbar and it needs to be 1 tb ssd and its costly...

Thanks"
7r8xc6,16,2018-01-18,Is Anyone Out There?,scarringthunder,cryosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryosleep/comments/7r8xc6/is_anyone_out_there/,"*Hello? Is anyone out there? My name is Draco Sullivan. I am a survivor. If anyone can hear me please respond. I have a place to stay with enough space and storage for two people but I'm sure more could fit. I don't know if anywhere is safe anymore but please, it's been so long since I've seen another person or heard another person. If you're out there, alone and scared, please respond. I can't do this alone, not anymore.* 

I sent out that message two days ago. I haven't received any distress signals or any response so far. The siren is ringing again. I groan as I shuffle back into the bunker. My gas mask is hard to remove because my fingers keep slipping over the buckles and straps. It's suffocating in here, I wonder how long I have to stay inside this time. The light overhead starts flickering again, I stare at the filament and then sigh. My hand switches the light off and I'm back in the darkness. I hate the darkness, it always seems to shift around me in waves.

*""We need to go right now!"" I yelled. Aiden sat crouched his fingers pressing into Janice's bleeding side. The siren blaring out as I tugged at his arm. ""Please Aiden. Please, not now. Not like this."" My pleading had no effect, I turned around and ran. I knew he was tired. I knew he couldn't do this anymore. My heart was pounding as I threw open the doors of the house and rushed to the basement. I worked fast as I covered up the windows and grabbed random things from the basement to place infront of the doors. The basement was full of old furniture. I curled up and sobbed softly as the cold started seeping into my bones. My thin body curled up under the stairs, a thick cloth wrapped around my mouth.*

I coughed again, the rattling cough pulled me out of my sleep. I slipped off the mask and grabbed a half eaten can of soup. My fingers reaching out for the light switch, it had stopped flickering now. I had to ration food even if it was just me now. The cold soup was disgusting, nearly frozen corn and hard pieces of meat that probably weren't even chicken. Even then I ate slowly savouring every bite, I never know which one would be my last meal. I waited in silence for the siren to ring again that meant it was safe to go out again. I wonder who rang the siren, what if it never rang again. The thought was unsettling as I leaned against the cold door. I never ventured far, it's what kept me safe. Maybe I should go look for the person behind the siren's. I do have enough place for one more person here. Maybe we could figure something out. 

My day went by with thought of the mysterious person who rang the siren. I hadn't given it much thought assuming it was just a few well placed sensors or something of the sort but with the frequent power outages I knew it couldn't have been a monitoring system. The siren itself was powered by the wind and there was no shortage of wind. 

The scientists had been wrong, Global Warming wasn't that big a threat. It was helping in maintaining the temperature on Earth and the CFCs they loved to complain about were not as efficient as believed. Lightning could actually cause reformation of Ozone. It was in January 2018 when the cold temperatures wouldn't dissipate. Then snow started falling at lower altitudes where snow fall shouldn't happen. The snow has been falling all year. The oceans receded and moisture increased allowing for the near constant snow storms. The sky was always covered in cloud and by April the sun hadn't been seen in months. It was the first time when the sun shone that people decided it was a brilliant idea to go out. The snow however seemed to reflect the light to an extent where skin started boiling off and the smell of charred flesh filled the air along with screams. These people could've returned with severe burns if the had actually bothered to wear proper protective gear. The sunlight burned their eyeballs out like laser beams focused on them. The screams and cries intensified for the first hour or so. And then we knew not to even stand in the rays if we planned on living. 

It only got worse after that. The sun faded into another blizzard as people scrambled out covered head to toe to retrieve their family members only to bury them into the snow. The ground was frozen solid and be snow was closer to three foot now. Children and old people succumbed to the severe cold. And the temperature was only dropping day by day. 

I used to live in a college dorm when all this stared. I had just finished my third semester for an Accounting degree and was on my way to secure an internship at a major firm. I was the guy you'd see in full sleeve sweaters and a coffee. Social to the point that people knew me but not to the point where I'd attend every party. I'd get drunk or high every now and then but that still didn't diffuse my nice guy reputation. I was dating a guy in his Third Year studying Economics. It was a good life. 

Then the world fell apart. At first it was bearable but when February ended, the University gave holidays due to the constant low temperature. My family was in a different country and with the weather no planes could take me home. We were alone in the dorms, twenty-eight college students that didn't belong to the US. No one bothered with us as they filtered out trying to get to their families when the blizzards started. My boyfriend Aiden shifted into my dorm room. We lay curled up under thick blankets our hands running across eachother's skin as we tried to get warm. The first month was great. We'd kiss eachother and have sex as an excuse to keep ourselves warm. Then the sun rays came out. We were happy, I kissed him sloppily grinning through the kiss as we stood on the first floor. Then the screaming started. I pulled back immediately and rushed to a window, I had only put my hand through the curtain when I screamed pulling my hand back and collapsing onto my knees. My skin had turned a bright ugly red, the skin cracking as I continued to scream. Aiden pulled me away from the window and tended to my hand in the infirmary. 

We sat there listening to the screams of our dormmates before they faded to nothing. Aiden roamed the halls calling out for anyone who was still alive. There was only five of us left. All shivering broken and aching. I lay there in pain as Aiden brought the rest of them up. Ella had a burn on her shoulder, Janice was whispering prayers in French and Hide was cursing in Japanese his eyes closed. Janice tended to Ella's shoulder and Hide gave us both coughsyrup to dull the pain. I lay there feeling feverish. My head was spinning from the codiene coursing through my veins. Someone turned the TV on and we sat in silence listening to the explainations and warnings. They all folded into each other as I fell asleep. 

When I woke up it was cold. Colder then I had expected as my breath left in streaks of white fog. I looked around and realized that I was completely alone. Even Ella wasn't in the room. I stood up confused and made my way downstairs. The main door had been thrown open, Aiden, Hide and Janice stood there in shock. I joined them shortly, my eyes following the carnage. It looked like their insides had exploded. The white snow was dyed red where ever someone had fallen. Their lips blue from the cold, their eyes empty sockets, their skin had turned shades of purple and black with blood frozen in the cracks. We walked back inside in silence unable to decide what we wanted to do. We locked the doors especially the ones that flew open with the wind. Aiden and Hide blocked all the windows while Janice and I searched through the halls for all sorts of items that could help us survive. We stock piled them in the infirmary because it was one of the few rooms without windows. 

Ella was missing by the time we went through the whole building and the door to the roof was wide open. I stared through the frame and Janice closed the door before I could make up my mind. Ella was hanging from one of the metal beams on the roof. Her lips tinged blue as she dangled from the thick rope in a tank top and shorts. Aiden took one look at our faces when Hide mentioned Ella and we never spoke of her again. The town was only a few miles away from (redacted) city. Thus when the siren system was placed we could hear the sound from the building. We avoided going out during the time when the siren rang, long wails like ambulance meant the sun rays were coming out. Short bursts meant they were fading. The authorities then started saying that the air was getting contaminated due to the burning. We started wearing makeshift masks. It worked for us until one day we got stuck outside when the wailing started. Hide turned around and shoved a knife into Janice's stomach screaming that it would be better then burning alive. His eyes were wide as he stabbed himself repeatedly. And then I lost Aiden. 

I didn't have it in me to actually make sure that he was gone. I could see three bodies curled up on the ground and I realized I was alone. I moved from house to house getting closer to the city because I had seen houses with bunkers there. Bomb shelters hidden in the back. I finally found one. I hoped desperately for it to be empty as I walked down the stairs to it. My fingers fumbling with the entrance as I cursed under my breath. The door was locked. I didn't have time to find another bunker which is why I shoved a screw driver into the keyhole and twisted it beyond recognition. The handle now broken opened easily as I walked in. A man was sitting in the middle of the bunker. I stood silently as he made no move to stop me. His back was relaxed as I walked with the wall making my way across the bunker. It was only when I reached the other side did I realize why he didn't stop me. 

His eyes were gone. Not burnt out by the sun but removed messily. Scratches lined the sockets as nerves hung from them. That's when he smiled. His eyes were in his mouth. I puked right on him and yet he never stopped smiling. That's what made it easy to wrap some rope around his neck and drag him outside. He barely struggled as I left him in the snow, his smile growing into laughter as I walked back inside forcing the door shut with whatever was left of it. The siren wailed and I could hear the man laughing till the end. 

""They'll never have my eyes,"" he cackled. Soon after he stopped. I found a gas mask there. It was easy enough to figure out as I stared at myself in the mirror. I liked that I looked less human now, less vulnerable. I tried contacting my family from the bunker but I got no response. This is when I taught myself to make radio broadcasts my phone. The flickering power made it harder to charge but it helped. 

Am I alone? Is someone out there thinking the same? I listened to short bursts, the sun was gone. I crawled out onto the stairs and watched the sky, it was snowing again.

The company I work for is splitting up into two companies. The new company doesn't have a name yet, so there is an intern competition to come up with a name for it. There is a small reward to be received (a bottle of whine or whatever), but it's primarily just for fun.

The new company is an IT company that sells white label solutions for crowdfunding, so the name should preferably be related to that.

Recommendations (but not requirements):

- Think broad: Although the company is focused on creating tailor-made crowdfunding platforms, it may venture into other areas at a later time.

- Think international: The name should be sensible and pronounceable in the main languages of the World - and should preferably not mean ""arse"" in Scottish.

- Think customers! People are more interested in what value our product contributes to them rather than what we think of our product. So try to see it from the customer's perspective.

7rahdg,11,2018-01-18,Two doctors almost killed me this week so yeah what,itsmegnotmegan,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7rahdg/two_doctors_almost_killed_me_this_week_so_yeah/,"This is long, but if you want a wild ride of 2 doctors almost killing me then //buckle in kids// 

After a week of being the most miserable/close to death I’ve ever felt (I wish I was exaggerating or being slightly morbid) I go to the Emergency Room yesterday because my throat had swollen so bad I couldn’t breathe and my fever really wouldn’t stop going up to 103.5, breaking, going up to 103.5, etc. 

When I get there (rather quickly into my 7.5 hour hospital trip) the nurses and doctors inform me that my previous urgent care doctor (who originally told me to wait it out, and then told me it was “pneumonia” - although I’ve had pneumonia before and was confused entirely) “unfortunately” misdiagnosed me (she was wrong and she lied) and gave me medicine that wasn’t working and was actually “causing an adverse reaction” (it was wrong and it was making me miserably sick in unfortunate ways and not helping at all.) 

A few more hours in and I’ve had some chest x-rays, some exams, some poking and prodding, for them to let me know that I have Bacterial Pharyngitis (yay) that stemmed from untreated Bronchitis (oh you know, when the doctor told me to wait it out and then later pneumonia) that stemmed from a bad unhandled cold (that one’s on me, I know.) So this is fine. I’m good. I’ll have them tell me what to do and when I a girl is given a name, she can put it on her list and kill it. (Allow me my GoT references, I need some amusement.)

A few more hours in and we’ve got it solved! A new prescription is being sent to my pharmacist, they’re giving me a giant horse pill antibiotic now, I get a steroid shot and another shot (one of these was to help my throat and another to help my excruciating pain) and the new antibiotic is for the BP. Good, right? No, the game is never over.

30 minutes later I’ve kind of dazed off and started slouching in my chair, my body feels like I’m baking from the inside (and oddly, for the first time in a week, I’m not sweating AT ALL,) and I feel extremely nauseous, and suddenly I hear the doctor saying my name - repeatedly. I look up and he’s standing there, his intern beside him (I think intern, it’s kind of a teaching hospital but I watch too much Gray’s,) and a slightly disheveled looking nurse 5 feet behind them, and he’s asking me if “I’m okay.” I’m confused (in a foggy way) “Why wouldn’t I be ok?”

Some back story here, for all we know about me, I have one allergy. One. Penicillin. Which, when I step foot in a doctors office or hospital (or go on a long car ride for that matter) I wear like a red flag. Penicillin is used for just about everything and, well, I have a hell of a lot I want to do before I die. I have a GIANT RED TAG BAND on my wrist with “PEN” written on it from the registration desk. I’d had the student intern, the doctor, and even the nurse ask me my allergies already, and reasonably - I think that’s all I had needed to do outside of take a tattoo gun and get it labeled across my forehead.

Back to the story, in the midst of my confusion, I am somewhat made aware that I was given Amoxicillin as my antibiotic (for those who don’t know or can’t guess: it’s a part of the Penicillin family - hence the cillin- and that’s ok if you don’t know that because you’re not my highly trained doctor in a hospital,) some things happen, I go and throw it up, am given a hell of a lot of fluids, am told to “rest, eat some ice chips,” “here let me check your 105 resting heart rate again,” “the steroid shot is helping” and I’m calming down and coming to conclusions like “damn, maybe the nurse just might a slight mistake,” “wow is this what it looks like in a mirror when you haven’t eaten in 5 days and have LITERALLY lost 10 lbs” and I’m just weak and wanting to go home and realizing “wow I can breathe now” “wow I can actually walk without wanting to pass out” and “WOW I’m hungry.”

And then, my doctor, my ER doctor who I trust, decides to make a joke and say, “Well, we’ll have that prescription I sent over changed right away.” 

Letting me know that he, the man who repeatedly asked my allergies, was originally going to send me home on a prescription that at this point, repeatedly taken, was going to kill me.

At this point, I had been in the hospital for over 6 1/2 hours. My 5 day empty stomach was making itself very aware. My sudden steroid shot was giving me the power of the Stallion That Will Mount The World. My fear of being around any doctor, ever again, was becoming a real fear. So I waited 45 minutes to be discharged, went home, bought a humidifier, and felt more alive than I had in quite some time. 

To summarize here: I’m down 11 lbs (this won’t last long, I’m desperately trying to feed this bottomless pit and all I want are peaches, peppers, and tacos.) I’m out a sickening amount of $$$ (this will last long, unfortunately, our healthcare system sucks,) and I now never want to trust another doctor again (2 basically tried to ruin my life - and I can have a flair for the dramatics but honestly I just don’t even have the energy to add any sparkly flair or drama to it anyways.) I still have a deep, disgusting cough (which the humidifier is helping,) but I feel human. The medicine will help, and for the first time in 8 days I have hope. Sickness rebellions are built on hope. 

**also to note: no, I haven’t given up on all doctors and nurses - you guys, along with first responders and teachers, are the backbone of what keeps this country alive and running and I respect you until my dying day - which just might be quicker than I want if I ever go back to that 1st urgent care or that 1st hospital again.**


EDIT: I don’t have health insurance currently. Mine kicks in February 1st. My last position was freelance for 4 months and then I went home for the holidays and things got busy and if you never have to go through NY Health Marketplace count your blessings.

EDIT: Sorry for the spelling mistakes and grammar, I’m tired."

Looking to get advice from web developers in the Boston area. 

I graduated a coding bootcamp in August 2017, and have been having a tough time finding my first position. We learned full stack JavaScript (React, Node, Angular, ES6, etc), and I previously had some freelance PHP experience. After finishing the bootcamp I decided to learn more of CS Fundementals - like DS, Algorithms, Time Complexity, Functional and Object Oriented Programming, and Design Patterns. 

I attend web development meetups, and make an effort to apply to new positions every day (through referrals and job boards). So far I've had 12 Phone Screens and 4 On Site Interviews. I've tweaked my resume based on the feedback I get. I've noticed that if I don't mention the bootcamp and remove my previous positions in IT Ops roles - employers take me more serious as a candidate.

Is there specific technologies (Rails or Wordpress?) in web development that would make it easier to break into the industry in Boston? 

Besides coding every day and applying to new roles, is there anything I could do to increase my chances landing a role?

I am considering going back to school for a CS Degree and just applying to internships. "
7rb18z,6,2018-01-18,Started a new life. Things didn't go my way. Having trouble letting go not letting a certain situation affect me and my mood.,LN2Worry,RedditForGrownups,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditForGrownups/comments/7rb18z/started_a_new_life_things_didnt_go_my_way_having/,"This may be long for backstory. Also, I'm not posting this in /r/relationships because I know I'll be told I'm in the wrong about some things and will just get people getting angry with me. 

tl;dr: social and romantic life down the shitter, job prospect shut down and is entwined in the former. Can't let it not affect my mood, and having a tough time letting it go. 

I've started a masters program this last fall. I moved a few states away for it and was really worried about making a network of people to relate with, especially since I hadn't had to make friends in 10 years. After the first few weeks of class, I suggested people in the masters program go out and get to know each other. We did, and around late September there were four of us (myself included) that were a 'group'.

Around this time one of the other people and I started to see each other romantically. She's the only woman in the group and I was feeling pretty good about my situation; I had made new friends and was seeing this woman I was really into. I felt on top of the world. 

We saw each other frequently throughout October. There seemed to be mutual interest in continuing but, after our third date she basically flipped a switch and said she didn't want to see me anymore because 1) she didn't want to change the group dynamic (apparently the other two were asking her if we were together) and 2) she had recently gotten out of a relationship before moving for this masters program. Despite being upset at the situation (I was very much into her), I 100% see her reasoning and am not mad or upset with her. I suggested we remain friends and we have actually hung out one-on-one without it being awkward, but I'm still uncertain how our relationship with each other will play out. 

Right before things ended between us, she informed me she was interviewing for an internship at one of the other guys' company (he is part of the 'group' mentioned above). Now, he had mentioned to me that this position was available for the summer if I was interested. I said I was. She interviewed for this position not 10 days later, and said that she got the job and that it starts in January. When she told be this I got pretty upset about it. I realize she took the initiative and sent her resume in before I did, but I can't help but wonder why this internship that was available in the summer was now open for this winter, not two weeks after I was told about. The other thing that pisses me off is that when I got upset, she said it was 'beneath me', since I'd worked a full time job in the industry before. She knew I was looking for work at the time, and now I'm delivering pizzas, so no, it's not beneath me. I'm glad she found an opportunity in the industry, as she's straight from undergrad, but it's still not sitting well. 

I should mention that both of them became fast friends, and have a rapport that I'm admittedly jealous about. They constantly joke and just have an overall good time with each other, which is something her and I had (I thought) while seeing each other. 

I was very depressed after all of this happened. I went from thinking I had both a group of people to relate to and a love interest to having neither. I soldiered through to the end of the fall semester and was glad to see winter break, where I wouldn't see this woman and the other guy she's now working with. 

But now with the start of the semester, I'm having to face both of them. Before class and during breaks they talk about what they did that day at work. I'm having a hard time dealing with all of this. The fact that our time together wasn't anything more than a casual encounter (she was extremely nonchalant about the whole matter), the fact I'm not really a part of the group anymore, and having to see how much I missed out with this internship. 

Every time I've had to encounter them, it puts me in a bad mood. I've tried so hard to let it go, but I'm coming up short. This causes me to act less than outgoing when I'm around them. I also feel like her and him don't want to include me in their conversations. I'm not sure if he knows of our previous involvement.  In any other circumstance, I'd have cut ties with these people, but it's impossible since I have to see them several times a week. I've looked into making new connections over break, but now that the semester has started I have very little time for other things. 

I've never been more depressed and never felt more alone. I left my old life, with my family and friends, behind and can't help but feel I've made a huge mistake. I wake up every morning with this sinking feeling, something I hadn't felt in a very long time. I very much want to get over this and let it go, but I'm have a really hard time. I try to concentrate my thoughts on other things, but that only works so well. "
7rb5h5,5,2018-01-18,Should I wait for a fully-funded program?,celt1299,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7rb5h5/should_i_wait_for_a_fullyfunded_program/,"I'm beginning to get decision emails from the (clinical/counseling psychology) programs I've applied to. 3 want to interview me, 3 have declined admission, and I'm still waiting to hear from 7 more. The problem is, the 3 programs that rejected me were fully funded, and the 3 programs that want to interview me are not fully funded (though at least two offer stipends and some tuition reduction).

I've seen nothing but emphatic ""Do not do it!"" replies to people asking if they should go for an unfunded Ph.D, and they've got me kind of rattled. I know the stipends offered would be able to cover monthly food and rent, but the tuition would have to be covered by loans. Granted, because I plan to work in a mental health delivery setting, there are a few ways to get my loans paid for/forgiven beyond paying for them myself.

I'm worried I'm just not good enough to land a fully-funded position, despite fairly good stats (3.9 GPA; 163 [93%] Verbal; 154 [55%] Quant [I lucked out—based on practice tests, it should have been *much lower*]; 4.5 [82%] writing; excellent recommendations; 5 semesters of clinical experience, including 2 internships; 2 years of research experience, including a senior thesis).

The crux of my indecision is that I have 3 interviews in hand, and I feel good about my chances for admission; but I've had 0% success with funded programs. I'm afraid I'll continue to have 0% success if I apply exclusively to that type of program next year, whereas I could already be starting my Ph.D. by choosing an unfunded program.

I still have 5 fully-funded programs to hear back from (and another with a stipend and tuition that would result in negligible debt), but if they all reject me, should I try my luck and reapply next year for only funded programs?"

So the dream holiday for my BF and me is to travel to Japan. We bonded partially over our shared love for anime, Japanese food and the beautiful scenery of the country. Every time we discuss an upcoming vacation, half that time goes to talking about Japan. At the moment I'm taking Japanese language classes and my parents even got me a Japanese cookbook this Christmas, so please note that this is important to me. He's actually been there before he met me with friends. The dream is to take a month or longer and see everything Japan has to offer together. So far we haven't been able to go, as spending a month in Japan including flying costs A LOT of money and we've opted on shorter, cheaper holidays nearby.

One of his close friends, one of the people he has been in Japan with before, has found a great deal for a flight and they want to go a week to Tokyo. Outside that week flights are going to be too expensive to go. I'm starting my internship at the hospital soon and there is just no way I can go with them. Now I know it's just a week in Tokyo and it's not the same as our planned month of traveling but somehow I just feel incredibly sad and honestly a bit betrayed that he is going to be there without me. 

My BF knows how I feel. Before he told me about the trip he said I have to tell you something and you are going to want to kill me. Now, I can absolutely tell him that I don't want him to go and then he wouldn't, but that would be wrong. However, I also can't just feel okay about this. I can't feel happy for him at this moment, I just feel sad. 

Reddit, I need some help coming to terms with this and being able to feel happy for my BF. Please give me some perspective.

If someone has any advice about meeting one’s abuser again in a social context, that would be very helpful.
The short version first :

TLDR version :
Former best friend, roommate, abuser, was jealous and that led me to depression, self harm and so much anxiety, for a bit more than a year. It’s been a year since and despite being in a much better place, I still have my hard moments.
In two weeks there will be a get together with old friends from university, a lot of people I love, plus said abuser. I just don’t know how I will hold up when it’s his voice I used to hear in my head, criticising me regularly.





the Long Story :
During my studies (engineering), I made two best friends, lets call them ""L"" and ""P"". We were living on campus, having classes together, had breakfast together with lots of people every morning, it was great.

""P"" I wasn't so sure about at first, until we travelled together for a month and hit it off, so we became friends after that.
2 years later, our group of friends wants to settle outside of campus, so ""L"" and I started searching for a place, and ""P"" wanted to tag along. I was a bit unsure about ""P"" despite our friendliness and similarities, but yeah, we all became roommates. ""P"" and ""L"" were not friends at the time, both knew me and liked me, so that was enough to get us together.

One thing about me is that I have a real passion for cooking, a knack for sports, and at the time, a relative success with people of the opposite sex. ""L"" was a beast in sports, and a really positive person, he never new when to give up and so he always appeared to shine in society. ""P"" was kind of the stereotypic, not confident, fatty nerd whose mother always criticized for his lack of athleticism, and for everything she could find the words for, truth be told. A great positive with him though is that he had a great, cultivated mind, and well, being a nerd myself, we hit it off on that side.
1 month after we moved in together, I started noticing that when we had friends over, ""P"" would making small mean jokes about me, that we would all laugh off, still managing to grind at me without me noticing.
2 months in, he invites an old friend of his from high school, who happens to be a girl, let's call her E. We ask him whether or not he's interested in her and he says she's a good friend, so no. (Cue: he's the kind of guy who's interested and will pursue any girl that looks at him for even a second, a Nice Guy tm).

The evening she's there is a delight. It was my turn, and my pleasure to cook, and he seems to be too shy or too absorbed to entertain his own guest, so ""L"" and I lead the conversation.
She was charming, with a keen mind, a dancer, and though not stereotypicaly beautiful, she had a real something. We hit it off really well, we talk about going dancing and as she is a student in psychology, we talk a lot about this.
Exchange of smiles, great conversation, it was kind of clear that we both liked each other, the night ends, she goes home, end of a great evening for all of us, except ""P"" is sulking, which I had absolutely not noticed.

After that evening, he got into the habit of criticising me more often, especially when I was cooking. I would blow it off with a laugh and a ""stop being mean"", or I would just ignore him and he would get angry. The thing is, I might be a little dumb, as I did not really realise what he was doing, I just brushed it off as ""fun jokes"", without paying attention to what it was doing to me.
""E"" and I started texting each other regularly, then daily, until, at her proposal, we both went to a dancing class she was going to regularly, without ""P"". Some people think friendships and love multiply with number, some people think of friends in terms of objects that you can steal.
His jealousy would become gradually more apparent as the year passed. I would go out with ""E"" regularly, first as friends.
He would complain to ""L"" about it every chance he got, but I would never hear about that, until ""L"" told me about it.
I was trying hard to maintain a good relationship with ""P"", despite his attitude, and fool me thought nothing of his constant attacks.
I even went to apologize to him, at the end of the year, told him that I did not mean to steal his friend, and that his attacks were hurtful. He told me he was telling me these things to ""make me a better human being"", and that there wasn't any stealing, though he would have liked to feel more included.
""Making me a better human being"", I should have jumped ship right there, oh stupid me.
After a year of being critized, belittled, told that I couldn't do it whenever I started studying (I was really struggling at the time, no wonder...), summer went as a respite, and we all went home, spending the summer in our respective hometown.

During this summer, E and I planned a week of vacation together, during which we finally got together as a couple.
That was the last straw for ""P"", who as a real mature human being, deleted us from facebook, and decided, despite us being roommate, that he would stop talking to me.
""L"" was in the middle of all this, and well, tried to salvage things wherever he could. His thinking was that since I had ""E"", he should be there for ""P"", and that it was just a story of fighting over a girl. He never realised the impact ""P"" belittling me and criticising me had for a year, and when told, he would always brush it off as a result of jealousy.
At the start of the 2nd year of us being roommate, ""P"" used ""L""'s support to pose a Veto on ""E"" coming to our place, forbidding her. During the end of last year and all summer, ""P"" had been trying his luck and succeeding in making ""E"" feel super guilty and super bad, so much that she did not want anything to do with him, and did not want conflict. So the year started in conflict, and most days after uni, I spent 40 minutes riding the bus to her place.

I don""t know how it came, and I realised it for what it was only later, but at the start of the year, I started being afraid. Afraid of leaving my room, afraid at every sudden noise in the appartment, (and ""P"" got into the habit of opening doors violently, laughing loudly to make himself noticed, imposing). I no longer felt safe in my own room and got a lock for it. I spent most of my time at my girlfriend's appartment.
I started having bad ideas, ideas about killing him, ideas about killing myself. I stared hurting myself sometimes.
Being raised by somewhat of a macho man, I could not bring myself to tell ""E"" about how I really felt. She knew I did not want to have anything to do with him, but she never suspected that from then on, I was only living thanks to her.

Then all this started to take a toll on our relationship. I moved to another city for uni, but ""E"" and I, after almost a year of what could be describe as the best relationship I thought possible, decided to stay together despite the distance. That was without counting on emotionnaly unavailable me, starting to talk and share with her less and less. 2 month into the new year and new town, I started staying in bed more, not doing much. I started hitting myself.
2 weeks of sporadic texting after that, and I phoned her to leave her. without real reason. Without sharing what was wrong.
2 weeks later, she came to my town with a friend to talk things through, to see if we could salvage anything and know what could have been done differently. I had not much to say but I held my position despite knowing I was making the biggest mistake of my life.

I realised that I was leaving her, my reason to live, because I was planning to die. 
I soon realised I was unable to leave my house out of fear. I would hear his laugh, his voice, randomly, telling me shit about myself. Whenever I doubted myself, criticised myself, it was in his voice.
I stayed in bed for 2 months after that. Taking burning showers, punching my own thighs, taking 2 hours to get out of my own appartment out of fear, to go grocery shopping.
I was merely sustaining this body for the pain, and out of cowardice not to end this.
This went on until I managed to tell my doctor about it, and he prescribed Xanax to me. This was a good thing as it helped me get back to work gradually, and get out of the house.
I started going to the gym, and getting my shit back together.
I started getting better.

This was last year.

Im still not totally all right, and I know I should see a psychologist to talk things through, but I’m definitely in a better place, I’m at the end of my studies and am about to get a great internship.
This year, my whole year is getting together to celebrate our degree, and “P” is gonna be there. We used to have the same friends, and I really don’t know how I’m going to hold up…

I really need some useful advice.,TragicXHero,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/7rclt0/how_to_redeem_a_low_gpa_i_really_need_some_useful/,"Hello, I just graduated from a university in Asia with gpa of 2.98. I heard that the chemical engineering job market is quite difficult nowadays and I feel sad knowing that I do not have the edge to compete for the job. I was really planning to go find opportunities in Australia as I was really want to get PR.I am hoping to find other ways in which I can redeem myself by doing tasks or activities that can help me. I have one internship experience, but it is not related to engineering. Have quite a lot of extracurricular activities but not sure if it gonna help me. Also did some AIChe certificate program, is it that helpful? 

Worst case, I was planning to just do masters somewhere maybe in Australia or German.My desire to immediately get into graduate school because I want to learn more and also as a mean to make up for my horrible undergraduate career. Is the gpa good enough to apply to any graduate schools? 

I am  interested in software and programming so I am studying up on programming language like Python can help me give a bit of an advantage. Will that help me?  
Should I try to find internship related chemical engineering?
Should I do FE?
    
At this point, I am open to any engineering or any programming related jobs. I don't care about money but exceptional experiences that will make myself better on resume and willing to relocate anywhere, but I don't see any reasons why company would hire me over more fresh college graduates with better experiences and gpa.
    

I am losing my confidence as well. Should I give up ChemE related jobs and just go for anything?"

7rdxdi,11,2018-01-18,Starting to wear hijab after starting a new job?,rmikati,Hijabis,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hijabis/comments/7rdxdi/starting_to_wear_hijab_after_starting_a_new_job/,"Hey everyone,
I've been considering starting to wear hijab for a while, and I really want to [I think!]. At this point there's only one thing holding me back: Transitioning to wearing hijab partway through the semester, and partway through an internship.

I am in all new classes, with almost no one I know; I don't know any of my new professors very well and wouldn't feel comfortable talking to them about my religion. Similarly, I JUST started a new job at an art firm- and while everyone is extremely nice and I like working there a lot, I'm not ""friends"" with any of them yet, and it would be hard for me to bring up the idea. I don't think they even know I'm Muslim yet! I don't know how they would react to me coming in one day wearing a hijab seemingly out of nowhere. I'm sure they would be courteous and respectful, with probably some silly questions, but I can feel this dark cloud of my anxiety disorder coming and giving me little panic attacks about how they probably are talking about me behind my back or something.
In any case, I'm worried that I will damage my relationship with these important people (especially coworkers) in my life simply because I don't know them well enough to talk openly about my personal life (therefore ""preparing"" them for a shift in the way I dress).
I also worry a little bit about how our company's clients will react upon seeing a hijabi working in our small office- or at least, I worry about my boss worrying about such a thing.

I've definitely seen some horror stories about coworkers or supervisors being ""caught off guard"" because their employee ""suddenly"" started wearing hijab.

I'm not worried really about my friends or people I've known longer than literally two weeks, it just feels very weird and poorly timed to start doing this after I've made a first impression and not much else, coming in and making basically a second first impression? I don't know if any of this makes sense; I'm sorry!

I KNOW this is sort of silly! But what could I do to make this transition easier and quash my anxiety about springing hijab on my coworkers? Or is it more realistic to wait a few more months until I graduate and the transition is more natural? The benefit of that is I would be home with my family and a bigger Muslim community if I wait, and therefore would have more support- even if I still have a situation like this happening.

OKAY SORRY THIS WAS REALLY LONG
THANKS IN ADVANCE EVERYONE!!!"

I’ve struggled on and off with depression since I was 13. I’ve been a lot better for the last three years (since I turned 17). There’s been times here and there that I’ve felt down, but they’ve been caused by something, like a break up or stress from college. But the last two weeks have been rough for me. A new semester started (junior in college) but I’m not going to school. I’m working an internship instead. I’m still living in my college town in my apartment, not far at all from my school and friends. I knew I’d miss seeing some of my friends in class everyday but I didn’t think it’d be too bad. But I feel incredibly sad. 
Work has been boring, I’ve had a lot of stress from parents trying to control me from 60 miles away, and some other conflicting feelings to deal with, but none of that is any different than if I were in school. 
Yet somehow I’m so sad. I spent two hours at work trying not to cry. As I was driving home I kept having very strong thoughts about how nice it would be to die, how I could just drive into a tree and not hurt anyone else. I haven’t had these kinds of thoughts since I was 15 and they scared the shit out of me. I got home two hours ago and can’t shake any of these feelings. I was excited to watch the premiere of American crime story but couldn’t get through 30 minutes without having to turn it off to cry. I couldn’t even watch my go-to sad movie. I feel like I’m being annoying whenever I share how I feel with anyone. I don’t know if I feel so down because of the transition from school to work or if it’s permanent. I can’t do it again. "

7rf150,1,2018-01-18,for give me I have sinned,racemixingisnotright,racemixing,https://www.reddit.com/r/racemixing/comments/7rf150/for_give_me_i_have_sinned/,"I saw someone made a confession about his degenerate life, got to say that’s pretty fucked up, but I also did the same things or maybe worse than him. So, I wanted to make a confession here about what I have done in the past. First of all, I’m just ordinary 25 yo asian guy with average looking. We all know most us here are degenerate person, but are you degenerate enough to call yourselves a degenerate? Have you ever done something very pervert/indecent/sinful things in your life? Im sure we all fap, peeps, watch porn, vanilla sex (at least for western) or doing something which pretty much common things for us guys. But I did very terrible things in my life, so here are my sins;

My first sin Back in the high school graduation we had a small party. Almost half of my classmates were coming. We were sleepover in our friend, with 7 girls and 6 guys. I drug them all. I put 3 strong sleeping pills in the syrup bowls, I got it from my degenerate pharmacist cousin, with a condition I have to video my act. And yes, around 10 pm they all got sleepy. Around 1 am I raped all the girls, took pictures of their pussies, asses, tits, lick and suck them etc. I noticed they all virgins so I fucked their asses instead. I came 5 times that night, what a bliss memory (Shit! I’m hard right now). Next morning only 1 girl feeling hurt in her ass. I didn’t video anything but still keeping all the pictures in my google drive, until now :D

Second sin I made a friend in my first day of collage, we were very close, every weekend I usually sleepover at his house, play games, watch porn, fap together, etc. He has a little sister, a 6th grader. She was so cute and so attached to me cause I can do a few magic tricks, that was how I awakened my lolicon fetish. One day she found us watching porn while jerking off together. I immediately noticed her and stopped my business and my friend just scram her out. The next day she asked me about that. I showed her a porn in my laptop, she wanted more. During the night when my friend already sleeping I always sneak out to her room. We watch porn together, every time I lost myself I just mount her and press my thing on her ass, and she don’t mind that. I teach her kissing thou I’m noob too (0 girlfriend). I lick her pussy every time, rub my dick on it but no sex, yet. Sometimes I think about what if we got found out? I definitely going to get beaten and going to jail, but I lost myself every time I saw her little cunt (Shit! I’m hard gain!).

Third sin During my second year, my friend got a girlfriend and so did I. Unfortunately, I lived in the country which the majority of the girls won’t have sex before married, ofc there are some easy girls willing to give their virginity for money/so called- true-love from trash guys, and my girlfriend was on the first side. One day we had double date and rented a villa, and again I drug them all just like what I did 2 years ago. At midnight I was about to rape my girlfriend, but I didn’t do it, I felt bad. But then I saw my friend’s girlfriend thigh, I got horny, so I touch her, play with her, then I noticed she’s not virgin anymore, “That fucked bastard already fucked her while I’m still whining to my girlfriend!”. So, I fucked her, this was my first time pussy, finally I lost my virginity, I came twice. 5 months later I broke up with my girlfriend.

Fourth sin This is the continuation of the second sin. We still doing our weekly basis. She’s on 2rd year junior now. I’m going out with her behind my friend, and finally I fucked her. For the first time in my life, I fell in love. I graduated from my collage, I was planning to tell my friend about our relationship and propose her after her graduation from high school. I got a job, then I told my friend about our relationship, I don’t know what was I thinking that time but I also told him that I took her virginity, and I’m ready to take full responsibilities and marry her. But things did not end well, he beat out of me pretty bad, while he punching my face he was crying babbling out about “traitor” and “karma”, can’t hear well, talking about karma I wonder if he also fucked his girlfriend’s sister, I remember she has one, 2 years younger. I’m lucky enough his parents are out, otherwise I may also get beaten by his dad and going to jail. The next day I went to his house for apology, I got beaten again. I called his sister but out of reach, apparently, he changed her number. For the first time in my life I got broken heart. I gotta say it was very painful feelings, sometimes I cried on my own. I quit my job and became a NEET for a year, spent most of my time surfing internet.

-I love everything about japan, so I took a full course Japanese lesson for a year so I can live there. -Now I live in Japan, most of my fellow otaku friends from collage work here as internship in some company. They helped me a lot, now I’m feeling better. -I made an acquaintance with AV director hahaha :lol: -I’ve been in soap land (amazing experience!) -I bought a virgin JK from a guy in Akihabara and fucked her (sooo expensive!) -I made a friend with handsome lolicon Japanese guy who like to buy a loli girl (a legal loli, at least that was he said). Told him about my past, he praised me and letting me see his collections. 32 videos, 11 different girls (in case you wanted to know :P). -I spoke with Toyosaki Aki once (it’s worth mentioning!) -I’m still NEET, but I have like $1,7 million (My currency to USD) in the bank account, before my grandpa passed away he gave me this ""rat-account"" (go watch wolf of wall street 10/10 funny degenerate movie) and I periodically transfer the money to my own account. Before retired, he was working in government, a powerful person. And Im 100% sure this is illegal money. He loved me very much, in fact he was the only one knew what kind of person I am. -Lastly, you might be thinking I live in a bliss, but no, sometimes I feel lonely. I always dreaming about if I could meet a woman that could change my life, I would stop doing this."
7rfg8x,8,2018-01-18,Should I quit my current job to focus on college?,Taydog21,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/7rfg8x/should_i_quit_my_current_job_to_focus_on_college/,"Currently I am a 19 year old sophomore computer science major and about I am scheduled to begin my spring semester next Monday. I work about 20-23 hours a week depending on how the workflow is going day by day. I make a pretty decent pay for a college student my age (15 an hour) and the work that I do isn’t too hard. This job can be very stressful go me because of many factors. One major factor is the 30-45 minute commute I make driving there back and forth 5 days out of the week(Sun-Thurs). Second the job is scheduled pretty late I work from 7:00 PM to about 11:05 PM every night and I make it back inside around 12 in the morning. The job has been stressful on account of how late I make it inside and drama that constantly takes place at the job. While working hasn’t interferes with my grades ( Overall GPA :3.06 Major GPA : 3.5), I feel that I can do a lot better if work did not take so much time out of my day. My schedule for the next semester begins at  11:00 and ends at 2:50 for most days but for two days out of the week I leave at 3:50 after leaving school I have to pick up my sister which takes about 20 minutes out of my commute going home so after that I would make it home around 3:30 or 4:30. For about 2 hours I would spend that time on homework, studying, etc and would head out to work around 6:20. Before I was able to manage my course work and and job but now my major is getting a lot  more intensive with my computer and mathematical studies and I fear that my two hour window will not be enough for all of the work I have to do. Right now I have about 3k saved up and I don’t pay any bills except for gas which is about 20 dollars a week for me. Also I have enrolled into a fellowship that gives lots of assistance to furthering my career and lots of other things but I have yet to be inducted because of my job interfering with their conferences. I am usually up out of bed by 9:30 because I usually have to do somethings for my family before I go to school. I have also recently starting producing and selling beats about a month ago and am building up a following and making a little bit of pocket money by leasing my beats, so I don’t think I’ll be too out of luck if I were to leave my job. While I’m in school and I am working I barely have any time I focus on my self like exercising or just relaxing with my available time.  And I barely have time to be with my girlfriend and family. My main concern just consists of financial security I don’t want to be at 0 dollars leaving my job (which I don’t honestly think will happen) . So I honestly need help should I leave my job to focus on college and my physical and mental health or should I stay at the job and just grind the semester out? 

P.S I am currently in the interview process for a good amount of internships for the summer. 

Also My job will not let me cut my hours any less before I used to work 25-30 hours so that option is out of the window. 

Thanks for all help!"

Not only am I suffering the pain of the breakup, it’s been digging up years worth of emotions I didn’t open up about and resulted in me being in a constant state of second guessing the past and unhealthy emotions. I think to move on requires me to find some closure in how I feel, but I haven’t been able to find that.

Can someone please help me process my emotions?

**Long Back story:**
I met my first ever girlfriend a few days into freshman year of college. We hooked up a few times and after a few more months started dating. I loved this girl and she loved me. She was intelligent, beautiful, and I just genuinely loved spending time with her.

Eventually doubts started to creep into my mind. Partially because she was my first girlfriend, I started to wonder about whether I was truly in love with her or whether I should try dating others. I also wondered if I was missing out on the college experience, hooking up with others, being single, etc. I still had strong feelings for her, but beginning of Junior year I broke up with her, telling her I was unsure if I loved her. It ended up being a terrible experience for me and I missed her like crazy every day we were apart. Two weeks later, I begged her to take me back, and she accepted. We went back to loving each other and were happy for the whole year.

A year later (now 2.5 years into relationship), a similar thing happened. We were apart for internships in separate cities for 3 months. Over the three months I began again to wonder whether I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her without being able to confidently know that she was the one. Being apart in the summer was tough, and this insecurity led me to once again break things off. Got back to school a week later, I said “fuck what have I done?” and begged her, again, to take me back. She accepted, and we went back to being happy together and senior year was mostly very happy. 

Fast-forward to the halfway through Senior year, when we accepted prestigious jobs in separate cities 500 miles apart. This took a toll on me and I began to dread leaving school and what we were going to do apart. I decided in my mind that I could not do long distance because I very much thrive on physical affection. A month and a half before the end of senior year, we finally had that talk, and I said I couldn’t go long distance. We were apart for two weeks, which were two of the most difficult weeks of my life. Again, I felt crushed by the thought of her being out of my life, and eventually I begged her to take me back and give it a try long distance. Somehow, she accepted and took me back. Cue happy ending to Senior year.

Distance was okay for a while. We could visit each other every 1 - 1½ months and these visits were always really fun. In between visits, not so much, there was some tension because she wanted to talk more frequently than I did, she wanted to text often and I did not. I think eventually we found a balance that worked for both of us. Eventually things got worse. I started prioritizing texting less and less and started to shut myself down from her. I was getting increasingly stressed about work and increasingly dissatisfied with my social life. All around I was also just unhappy with my life, which consisted of working long, stressful hours, coming home, cooking and then sleeping. Additionally, I was stressed because I didn’t know when distance was going to end and was just wasting my youth on a long distance relationship. As a result, I just continued to shut myself down, I tried to suppress these thoughts. We were still visiting occasionally and these visits were excellent, but bittersweet because it was only a few days a month. When we facetimed, I didn’t feel like sharing anything from my life, because I felt I had nothing worth sharing, so the quality of conversation declined. At the time, I didn’t really know why I was doing this, but my mind was fundamentally distracted.

Eventually (end of October) she broke up with me. She said she tried so hard to reach me couldn’t do it anymore. I barely said anything. Couldn’t even process it. About 10 difficult days later I asked if we could talk on account of the fact that I had barely said anything the night we broke up and she said sure. We talked a while about how happy we had been once upon a time and I told her how much it tore me up that I couldn’t make her happy. I wanted her back quite a bit, but vowed to myself that I would give it time to figure things out. 

It took me a little while to wrap my mind around what had caused me to shut myself down from her and that it was ultimately my own unhappiness. In Mid-December I asked her if we could talk again because I wanted to explain that I had been struggling for a while, but that I hadn’t just been ignoring here because I didn’t love her. She said she wasn’t ready to talk, and I said something like “maybe in a few weeks then"".

Eventually after more time, I opened up to myself and my family more because I genuinely started to figure out my problems wanted to solve them. The biggest problems were to mainly stop shutting myself down emotionally, figure out how to find happiness in every day life, and be proud of who I am and the good I’ve accomplished in life. 

But where do I go next? I can't really get my mind to stop going over a million scenarios of the past and future. The fact that I caused her so much pain kills me. The prospect that I permanently blew things with someone so important to me also kills me. Lastly I feel that I’m never going to find someone like her again. In the back of my mind I’m fantasizing about the prospect of eventually getting back together as an greatly improved person, but I don't think she'll ever take me back, as she gave me numerous chances, and I blew it every time. I genuinely feel like the worst person in the world.

**About me:**
A brief summary of some of my personal issues. I think a lot of these are apparent based on my long-winded story and were the root cause of our relationship issues.

* I’ve always had some insecurity and self worth issues. I was very successful throughout college, but it never felt like enough, and I constantly felt like I wasn’t smart enough. Now I’m working at a pretty lucrative job and seem to be on track for a solid career, yet I continue to feel like I’m not good enough. I think a lot of things in life have come kind of easily for me, but true happiness in the moment has always been a bit elusive.

* I have trouble opening up emotionally. When we could hang out every day in college, it was easy to be myself, let her be herself and just be happy together. But being apart required me to be able to make that next step in always being communicative and open about my life. 

* I’ve always had some trouble with indecisiveness. I second guess myself constantly and tend to overthink things (this should be apparent)."

The prospect that I permanently blew things with someone so important to me also kills me. Lastly I feel that I’m never going to find someone like her again. In the back of my mind I’m fantasizing about the prospect of eventually getting back together as an greatly improved person, but I don't think she'll ever take me back, as she gave me numerous chances, and I blew it every time. I genuinely feel like the worst person in the world.


**About me**: A brief summary of some of my personal issues. I think a lot of these are apparent based on my long-winded story and were the root cause of our relationship issues.

* I’ve always had some insecurity and self worth issues. I was very successful throughout college, but it never felt like enough, and I constantly felt like I wasn’t smart enough. Now I’m working at a pretty lucrative job and seem to be on track for a solid career, yet I continue to feel like I’m not good enough. I think a lot of things in life have come kind of easily for me, but true happiness in the moment has always been a bit elusive.

* I have trouble opening up emotionally. When we could hang out every day in college, it was easy to be myself, let her be herself and just be happy together. But being apart required me to be able to make that next step in always being communicative and open about my life.

* I’ve always had some trouble with indecisiveness. I second guess myself constantly and tend to overthink things (this should be apparent).

Going back to the most current events. I had an abusive relationship and I didn’t realize how abusing til after it ended. I have a wonderful partner now but that’s my only bright spot. Shortly after that my job cut my hours and things spiraled (currently unemployed but I might have a job soon... but I’ve been jumping from one part time job to another because the don’t work out for different reasons) from there causing me to have to file for bankruptcy and move back to my Mom’s home. I have a large family and they all live in close proximity so there’s practically someone at my moms everyday. Thing is my family, mom included, have always treated me like my feelings or desires didn’t matter so they do whatever they want regardless of how I feel about it.

I feel so trapped when all I want to do is leave. My partner also moved with me to my mom because he’s no better off as far as family is concerned. (Also suffers from depression and anxiety)

Really this depression has always been there it’s just coming to a head because I can’t handle the feelings anymore and I know they won’t take it or me seriously anyway.  I’m in school my last year and I’m hoping against hope I can get a job in my field. But it’s been hard juggling everything and I’m feeling pretty hopeless and trapped. Even though I am likely to get this next part time job I kind of don’t want it because I’m already about to break down and it’s food service (didn’t apply for that but all employees start in the cafe now). Logically I know I need the job just to pay bills and save money for internships but I’m already freaking out over the stress at home I’m not sure how I’m gonna deal with work stress too.

I just feel backed in to a corner and all my past gusto and resolve are just gone. I’m doing my best to just keep moving forward. I just wanted to share to get it off my chest and maybe if someone is feeling similar they’ll feel less alone."

I feel so deflated. I'm still processing what's been happening the last couple weeks and figuring out how to move forward. I know I'm not in the right head space to approach him, but at the same time I hate that he thinks its acceptable to do, even if its only in the meantime while I collect my thoughts. 

The long and short of it is that we both intern for a website, in vastly different roles. It seems that whenever I have an idea or project to put forward, its beneath him and waste of time, even though they aren't connected with his work. My project dealt with accessibility, and bringing our website up to the guidelines set by our university and other websites.

When I first proposed it, he dismissed it and said that issues of style were the least of his concerns. And yet 20 minutes later in the SAME meeting, he tries to sell the idea as his own. I spoke up for myself, and had the support of my boss too, saying point blank in front of the group that that was a great idea that I had had. Afterwards I assumed that would be the end of that and we could move on and start on our respective projects.

The next week, I find out that he and the new intern were 'discussing it', and they decided that the new intern would be taking my project over. I was floored. After everything that had happened the week before, I couldn't believe that THAT could happen.  

I'm torn, I know I should take the high road and employ my manager voice; but at the same time, I feel like he will only respond to authority, or rather, someone telling him to grow the butt up and learn to work with others. Its a systemic issue, and one that I don't want to deal with any longer. Interruptions, a dismissive attitude towards everyone, and a glory hog. He puts his name on everyone's work whether or not he is deserving, and at a larger font no less.

Im going to talk to the new intern, let him know its my project and that I would love to collaborate with him on it. The other one, I don't know. If it gets worse, I may quit. I have the letter or recommendation, I just got into my Masters program, and my boss loves me. I just dont know what to do.

Sorry for the rant. Thanks for reading if you made it this far.

Tldr: coworker is an ass and steals my projects and is extremely disrespectful. May quit, but not before I have a conversation with him about ""how to not be a peice of shit, and make friends."""

7rgny7,2,2018-01-19,Hopeless,BonelessTamago,bitcoinbegging,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinbegging/comments/7rgny7/hopeless/,"Good Day, people. I have just recently found about this and as low as I can get, I might as well try my luck here. So here is my story.

On the last semester of college as an Information Technology student, I've landed an internship in a startup that does accounting software (and also doesn't pay its interns) using Angular 2. I was really hopeful and enthusiastic back then because I thought my future in I.T. was already secured, but unexpectedly, things turned for the worse and that's when I saw my own life spiralling down. 

It was at the second month of my internship. I have unexpectedly checked in or uploaded a broken project to the whole network, overwriting everything my other co-workers did because they downloaded what I uploaded. There were NuGet package errors all over and the project would have been finished that day if I hadn't screwed up. Even my boss couldn't solve the problem.

You might know what happened next.

I got fired the very same day. My image as a stellar student was broken. No, my whole spirit was broken. It was a blow that's very hard to recover from. That was also the same day that I said ""fuck it"" and loitered around the streets during the day because I hid the fact from my parents that I got booted out. I also tried to contemplate suicide, but my parents soon found out about what happened and my father covered for me, which led to me graduating despite the fact that I actually screwed up in my internship.

But I realized that the problem is just beginning. I started to reap the rotten fruits of my failure. I was a really serious student who often aced a lot, but real life started to teach me that those things mean nothing to the eyes of employers. I am really having a hard time finding an I.T. related job despite my high GPA, and I am starting to lose all hope. It's been almost a year and I've been exhausting my parents' resources for fruitless battles. I even met my former classmate who did nothing but play all day in an interview, and I lost that job to him. I think that was the final blow that destroyed my self-esteem.

Today, I am trying to dissociate myself from I.T. and explore other fields. That does not mean that I'm going to leave it entirely, though. Today, I'm planning to land a call center job and from there, I'll try to get promoted to a in-house technical support (got to start from the bottom). I am sincerely asking for your help because my knowledge is going down the drain because I have nothing I.T. related resources to work with. I need a computer to get the knowledge going. You see, I am not giving up on I.T. just yet. My parents are heavy on debt and the salaries I will be getting if I ever get a job, will be going to the debt (which will take years to pay) In that kind of situation, it's impossible to get a computer now and the flames and hopes of getting into programming/networking jobs will just start to get extinguished and go down the gutter. The computer I have before in my internship days (a windows tablet) had seen better days and sadly, has become a brick (the internals were fried)

Thank you for hearing out my story. I hope you can help me turn my life around and any humble amount will be appreciated from the bottom of my heart. Here is my bitcoin address: 

1Kc6w3WNqJZjfzc8Ak7r2TLr54xbCaML3B

I might also forgo the computer idea and use your humble contributions to subtract the debts first (which amounts to $1000 dollars) in order to give my parents a breathing space.

Again, thank you and thank you for this topic board for giving people the chance to voice their problems out. I'm hoping to have my plan accomplished. "

Bernie would have won Eve.,leu2500,WayOfTheBern,https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/7ri427/this_that_11918_bernie_would_have_won_eve/,"DiFi already released Fusion GPS’s testimony before the Senate judiciary committee.  Yesterday the House Intelligence Committee released their Fusion GPS transcript.

A little context here before we go into the testimony.  [The Hill](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/369654-steele-dossier-firm-suspected-trump-russia-money-laundering) reports that Fusion was paid $50,000 per month, and Steele was paid $160,000 in total for an effort that originally was $20,000-$30,000.

Ok.  So what was worth this much? [nbc news](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-intelligence-committee-releases-glenn-simpson-trump-dossier-testimony-n838751)

&gt;It was the second release of Congressional testimony by Simpson, and it contained no Earth-shattering revelations, but Simpson went into much greater detail with the House committee than he did with the Senate judiciary committee about his research into Trump’s alleged business dealings with Russians and organized crime figures, in passages that at times read like a work of pulp fiction.

What else recently released reads like “a work of pulp fiction” but isn’t being treated with the same credibility by the MSM.  

&gt;As we pieced together the early years of his biography, it seemed as if during the early part of his career he had connections to a lot of Italian mafia figures, and then gradually during the 90s became associated with Russian mafia figures,” Simpson said at one point, under oath, about the 45th president of the United States.

&gt;At another point, he was asked by a Republican, Tom Rooney of Florida, whether he could “conclusively say as fact that the Russian government and the Trump campaign were colluding with each other to beat Hillary Clinton.""

&gt;Simpson replied, “I think that the evidence that has developed over the last year, since President Trump took office, is that there is a well-established pattern of surreptitious contacts ... ***that supports the broad allegation of some sort of an undisclosed political or financial relationship between the Trump Organization and people in Russia.”***

&gt;***However, Simpson said, he was not prepared to say whether that added up to a ""criminal conspiracy.”***

No, you just drop that there.

First, it is incredible that Hillary’s campaign paid $50,000 per month for this research.  They could have had an intern google.  Like I just did.  I’m not finding the older magazine article that goes into the rise &amp; fall of Trump’s casinos that also pointed out that his casinos were sloppy &amp; slow about filing anti-money laundering forms, but I did find where one of his casinos paid a $10,000,000 fine for [this practice](https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-fines-trump-taj-mahal-casino-resort-10-million-significant-and-long) back in Mar 2015.  Or back in 2007, The NY Times was reporting on the [sordid past](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/why-robert-mueller-has-trump-soho-in-his-sights) of one of Trump SoHos co-developers.  

2nd, shady financial connections are ***not*** the same as “the Russian government interfered in the election” which is the main claim that has been shouted from the roof tops by the Clinton campaign &amp; a compliant media.  The government was already looking into Trump’s finances.  Mueller linked up with the Manhattan District attorney on that. 

Snip

&gt;Simpson described in detail why he began relaying his findings to reporters in the fall of 2016, just before the November election. Steele had gone to the FBI in July with his findings, but he didn’t perceive that the bureau was doing very much.

&gt;Simpson said he was shocked and angry when FBI Director James Comey said publicly he was reopening the Clinton email investigation in October 2016, just weeks before the presidential election.

&gt;“I was sitting on this piece of knowledge, which was that, in fact, the FBI was investigating the Trump organization for possibly having illegal dealings with the Government of Russia,” Simpson said. ***“We decided that if James Corney wasn't going to tell people about this investigation that, you know, he had violated the rules, and we would only be fair if the world knew that both candidates were under FBI investigation.“***

And ***this*** is why the Clinton campaign paid Fusion GPS $50,000 per month.  They needed an insurance policy, some way to get negative news out on Trump if/when negative news came out on Clinton (we know that inside the campaign they feared Uranium One revelations more than the email server) but had the illusion that it didn’t come from the campaign.   Steele would feed the data to the FBI, so they could invoke “FBI” in what  Fusion GPS founder Simpson would feed to friends /colleagues from his reporter days, such as Dana Milbank of the WaPost.

Im new here and have some questions about the workflow in music production with the devices in the topic.

Im currently using a imac 5k late 2015 and ist pretty satisfying my demands for music production. Well im currently have the problem to work on the road or in friendshouse, since i have au plugins and he vst plugins and his macbook 15 is quite histling with 8 gb ram

So my solution is to get a samsung T5 1 tb SSD makes it bootable with my whole OS and boot it everytime on my my iMac and probably my new Macbook 13.( can use the intern storage later for study work, so It can have multiple functions)

So the Questions :

Is it a good idea to get the macbook 13 2016/2017 for semi-use for music production ? Or would it too weak for continue projects from my imac? ( i use alot of audio units and i dont want to clip/freeze tracks) so i can show my projects and edit them and work on on my imac later

Does it work properly to boot from an eSSD?

Or should I sell my iMac and get the 15 inch, but i dont want the touchbar and it needs to be 1 tb ssd and its costly...

Thanks"

I am medically well educated, and worked in the Paramedic field already. Took part in Operations as spectator, rescued my dad after his motorcycle crash and total strangers. I was close to loosing patients already, but next week is going to be something harder:

The ""Hausnotruf"" is a system implemented by my firm, that helps elderly and others in need of care. It's a small button you wear as a necklace that rings our Ambulance when pressed directly, for example if the elderly can't reach the phone... I will have my first shift there on Thursday next week, and today I was introduced to my partner (The shift is usually done by a single Medic, not two)

She is a nice lady... but only 1.5m tall, a bit obese and she can't run very quick. I do not think she is unable to help others, she still has a better education than me, but she won't be able to pick up someone or carry someone somwhere... so this will be my job next week.

Thing is, when we met, she started by warning me to do this shift, if someone calls latenight, he is most likley dead before we arrive, at least that happened in the last few weeks, it is nothing ""for small hearts of small people like you""


Now I am afraid that someone will die through my incompetence, or that I will have to help a so old person, that he is basically lost no matter what I do, but I still have to help him somehow...

What should I do?"

There are an unreal amount of things wrong with this code, but lets go over some of the more infuriating parts.

1. Absolutely no comments other than commented out code/magic numbers.

2. He hard coded in all of the file names that he tested the code on, so it only works for the specific files hes commented in (and he rewrites it for each spot in the code its used instead of just naming something at the top of the script that you can easily change.)

3. He does the same computation so many times in the code that it takes 13 minutes to run each time. So debugging at the star twas an absolute nightmare (i didnt know which parts were safe to comment out at first)

4. He imported pandas, but instead of storing data he reads from excel files in a dataframe he writes to a dataframe converts to a numpy array and iterates the numpy array to write the data to a .txt file with a randomly generated name.

5. **THE WORST FUCKING PART** He uses glob to find all files that end in .xlsx and even though he fucking hard coded the name of the file in all over the script already instead of just opening by calling pandas.read_excel(file_name) he fucking does a glob search and stores a list of all .xlsx files and saves them as a files_list (but he just called it 'n'). He then uses pandas.read_excel(files_list[7]). So the code only works for the right fucking file if you have the same number of excel files every time you run the code, and if you want to open a different excel file for your data you have to know which number in the alphabetical list it is.

6. (cont) The absolute cherry on top though is these excel files are so big that if you keep opening them a cached version of the file is made with a name like '~name.xlsx' and it changes the number of files in the directory and breaks your fucking code. It also doesn't even show up in the file GUI so if you arent iterating through the files with glob or something similar you can't figure out why its not opening the same goddamn file anymore.

7. The plotting of the data does like 10 calculations, and just constantly rewrites over the same .txt file without adding to it (so lots of data is lost). Then he uses a plotting function called seaborn.kdeplot() which does the kde calculation for him and plots it, so he never ever uses the .txt data that he is sort of storing.

8. in order to plot a movie he downloaded ffmpeg off the internet and is using a subprocess command to run 'ffplay + file_name', which only works if you have ffmpeg installed, but doesnt tell you that you need that anywhere.

8. he has files and files being imported with tons of functions defined that are never called and not even commented out.

9. he has variables in functions that arent initialized to any value or used in where in the script before the function is called, yet they have a consistent initial value (i still havent figured this one out).

10. he changes the current directory of the script every time he imports a file instead of just using the full path so it leaves the .txt and other ""temporary"" files saved all over every directory.

I manage to figure what the hell this man was trying to write and i got my own version of the script written. His code takes anywhere from 9minutes to 17 or so, and averages around 13 minutes/run. My code runs in 0.05 seconds on average. The only work i had to do to get it to work was download a better library someone had written based off some recent research.

If i make it through the day porting the rest of this code i'll be drinking an entire bottle of whiskey when i get home."
7rlfa9,0,2018-01-19,28yo with my MS degree budgeting for the next couple years + retirement,neddoge,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7rlfa9/28yo_with_my_ms_degree_budgeting_for_the_next/,"Hi all,

I've been picking through the Wiki as I can and have pretty much setup everything already but I just have a few points of contention to clarify as well as advice for retirement.

-----

* **Checkings**:  $8k; this is already earmarked for my Dietetic Internship fee that will take place from August '18 to June '19 roughly.  I have no other savings currently.

* **Income**:  $3500-$3800 monthly, post-tax 
* **Debt**:  $88k
 * $950 monthly minimum to $80k with most loans at $1k-$5k with 3-5% interest though I have one at $20k with 6.75%.  
 * $350 monthly to $8k PLUS loan @ 6.96% - this account is paid ahead through April of 2020 I believe (I attacked it while I could before some life changes forced me to cut back).  I'm still paying monthly to this.
* **After bills/budget**: About $1k leftover per month (conservative estimate)
 
----------------
* **No retirement or other savings** (first in family to pursue higher learning)
* **Current jobs** are not full time, and thus no benefits/retirement.  
* **Starting Fall '19**, I intend on having a full-time position as an RD, in addition to the current part-time positions I hold so I will have more financial ability from then on and will double my $45k-ish income if I can maintain the roles.

------------

With the $8k I have sitting in my Checkings, should I switch that over to a Savings for the next 7 months?  I'm trying to get into the program that has a significantly lower cost of attendance @ $2k, but the other programs are $6k-$9k.

.

Starting Feb1, my leftover funds will be going back into my checkings to serve as an emergency fund.  I hope that when I move (also Feb1) that I'll be able to better save money as I'll have my own kitchen and will be able to prepare 100% of my meals (saving $50+ at least a month).  

.

Once I put together a 1 month emergency fund (completed by May1), where should the rest of my savings go?  Build to a 3 or 6 month fund?  Should I even worry about a retirement account until I get my foot in the door next Fall with my RD position?  [note I'm 28 years old]

.

Regarding my loans, should I keep my payment structure as it is currently?  I could technically stop paying the $350 monthly and add that to my savings for the next couple years, but that's my highest % account and it's one that I can directly attack (whereas the $20k, 6.75% account I cannot unless I pay atop my monthly minimum).  I imagine my extra leftovers from May to August should go directly into this (6.75% x $8k is much more than the 1% interest in a savings)?  Additionally, I'm hopeful that I can add an Adjunct course to this summer session from a local university (likely +$3k over the summer or so).

.

Thanks so much for your help in all of this, PF.  I have a lot of work to do, and I know it.  I can add more background or information as needed.

7rm7q9,327,2018-01-19,My boy[f]riend's dad,throwaway0119201,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/7rm7q9/my_boyfriends_dad/,"As far as confessions go, this is the big kahuna. It happened over a year ago and this is the first time I've ever mentioned it. I feel like I need to get it off my chest. And honestly, it was the hottest thing that ever happened to me. I actually can't start thinking about it during my everyday life. It gets me so wet that I have to spook off and finger myself. Like, even in public. I can actually feel my panties soaking as I type.

So, my boyfriend and I have been together 4 years. He's the nicest person I've ever met. He's a good lay and generally keeps me satisfied. I've never cheated on him prior to this or since. About me: I'm petite, in my early 20s, C-cups, long black hair and a round shapely ass. I workout constantly and even though I'm kinda shy, I've always gotten a lot of attention from men.

I was looking for a summer internship after my first year of college and my boyfriend's dad, who's quiet, polite and nerdy, hooked me up. He's in his late 40s, decent shape for his age, with a little bit of a beer gut. He was balding, had glasses. I know this doesn't sound super appealing, but he was cute, had a dad bod, strong arms and legs, kinda tall. He's always been kind and accommodating, but never seemed like he was that interested in me, personally. It was more of a ""How are you doing?"", then going off to talk to someone else whenever I saw him. During my internship, he worked on a different floor and I rarely saw him. The majority of our interaction was just a smile if we ever crossed paths.

One night, while my boyfriend was out to his friend's, I went to a little fundraiser celebration that the company was holding at a local bar. It was a great night. MY coworker's band was playing, everyone was dancing and joking around and I got pretty tipsy. I knew my boyfriend's dad, Kevin, was there, but, again, I just smiled and waved while he was over with the more senior staff, chatting and acting pretty respectable and reserved. 

By around 1:30am, a lot of coworkers had cleared out. Most older people had gone home and Kev was at the bar squaring up his tab. I came over, with my drunken confidence and asked if he could add two more shots to the tab. He laughed and agreed and we both did a shot of whiskey together. I couldn't tell how drunk he was, but I was definitely feeling it. I asked him how he was getting home, and he said he planned on getting my boyfriend's mom to pick him up, but she had called an hour before saying she wasn't feeling up to the drive and asking him to take a cab. Then he asked me the same. I had no plans, but since my apartment was on the way to his house, he offered to split a cab.

We went outside the bar and tried to hail a cab. The summer night had cooled off and I was wearing a shorter, skin-tight dress. One that showed every curve of my ass and gave just a hint of cleavage. Needless to say, it took about 2 minutes of being outside before I had chattering teeth. Kev seemed to not notice and barely looked my way while trying to find a cab. The street had 2 other bars on it, so we were far from the only ones looking.

When we finally got a cab, we smooshed into the back seat. My teeth were chattering and Kevin took notice. He took put his hand across my back and onto my bare shoulder. It seemed fatherly and wholesome, but my pussy screamed otherwise. I was drunk and horny and Kevin's strong forearms felt firm and I could faintly smell what I figured was his deodorant. My pussy was throbbing all of a sudden and my nipples were already rock hard because of the cold. I could see them poking through the thin bra I had on. They hurt a little too. I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've been so turned on that it as borderline painful. This was one of those times. I never had thought of Kev in a sexual way before, but I would've let him do anything to me at that point. I started thinking about his dick. I wanted to suck his cock dry. I would've let him fuck any hole he wanted. I wanted to be his little slut. This man was twice my age, married, and the father of my boyfriend. All that floating around in my drunk mind made it even hotter.

I sidled a little closer until we were touching knee to hip. My hands were so cold that I started rubbing them together. Kevin took both of my hands and started rubbing the backs of them, removing his hand from my shoulder. In a total surreal moment, I grasped his hand and brought his middle finger to my lips. He as completely frozen. I wrapped my warm, wet lips over his finger and slid it to the back of my throat so the knuckles rested on my lips. I bobbed my head and let his finger slip in and out of my mouth, swirling my tongue around it, trying to show him what I'd do with his cock. He was deathly silent, but he didn't pull away. There was about 30 seconds of this is silence, with him looking straight ahead. I could hear his breathing deepen and I could see the erection forming under the zipper of his khakis. I reached over for it and began massaging it through his pants. He immediately let out a quiet groan. Thank god. I was getting to the point that his lack of action was making me think I was about to not only be embarrassed and rejected, but potentially ruin my entire life. He reached down the front of my dress and squeezed my nipple. I sharply exhaled. He started massaging my left breast while I desperately tried to undo his pants. I wanted to suck his cock dry. The cabbie, I have no idea if he had any idea of the debauchery in his backseat, asked ""this building here?"" and Kev and I quickly snapped out of what we were doing, and pulled our hands out of each other's clothes. ""Nope, the net one"" I replied. I sucked Kevin's earlobe gently and asked him to help me inside. He started to protest and I said ""Leave the cab out here, I just need some help in, you can go right back out"". He relayed that he'd be right back to the cabbie, then helped me out of the car. 

I consciously stumbled a bit and played up the drunkenness, in case I was about to be fully embarrassed. When we got inside the door, I brushed my hands off his crotch and felt he was still rock hard. I figured that was my cue. I dropped to my knees in the porch the second the door closed and licked the length of his cock through his khakis, leaving a wet streak. I looked up at him and pushed my tits together subtly and in my sexiest voice pleaded. ""Pllleeaaase let me suck it"". He groaned but took no action. I undid his zipper and slipped his cock out through the separation of his underwear. He was very hard. It was a decent cock, not super thick, and I'd say between 5 and 6 inches. It actually reminded me of my boyfriend's. I licked around the head of it, pulled back the foreskin a little and ran my tongue over the slit in his head. I could faintly taste cum, but he wasn't oozing at that point. I closed my lips around the tip and slowly pushed my head towards him. At this point, he groaned a lot louder and his breath was heavy. I took all of him in until my nose was against his pubes and started to make swallowing movements with my throat, trying to clench the muscles as an ex had told me to do. Kevin suddenly put his hand on the top of my head and subtly thrust his cock even more down my throat. I started massaging his balls while he really gently throat fucked me, holding my head steady with his hand. He pulled out all of a sudden and lines of spit trailed from my mouth to his cock. I took my dress and bra off and stood up, in my panties and heels. He bent over and put his really warm mouth on my nipple. Sucking it while he kneaded my other tit. I leaned back against the door frame and pressed my chest towards his mouth. He started sucking and biting my other nipple and moved one of his hands down into my panties to my pussy. I could hear how wet I was. I was throbbing and I've never had a jolt of pleasure go through my body like that before. You know that feeling when you're super turned on and someone touches you? It makes you jump, almost. Well, that's what I did. I jolted and moaned. He said ""fuuuuccck"" under his breath. Literally the first time I've heard him swear.

He massaged in small circles around my clit, then stuck two of his fingers in me. My first instinct was to buck towards them. I NEEDED to be fucked. But he withdrew them and stuck them in my already opened mouth. YYYYEEESSSSSS. I sucked them again just like I did in the cab, they were soaked and tasted like pussy. I sucked them clean. The submissive side of me basically came right then and there. He slid my panties fully off and picked me up, two hand on my ass. We started furiously making out and he walked the half dozen steps to my couch. Me, naked and grinding my wet pussy on him, him fully clothed with his cock out.

He sat down, holding me on top of him. I hauled his pants and underwear over him so his cock was no longer just through his underwear fly. He pulled my hips up and directly over his cock. He paused while I reached back and lined him up and he brought me down heavily and quickly. I've never been entered this rough before, usually dudes ease their way into me. I was so wet it didn't matter. I bounced up and down on his cock while we both grunted in time with the movement. He was gripping my waist and slamming me down on his crotch as hard as he could. I reached down and started stroking my clit. This was the most turned on I've ever been. It took me literally 2 minutes to cum. If you've never been roughly slammed with cock while cumming, GO DO THIS NOW. I clenched my pussy as hard as I could when I came, in hopes that he could feel me. And it definitely worked. He pushed in as hard as he could and just let me throb on his cock while we were both motionless and moaning. He pulled me off and pushed me further down onto the couch. I took the hint and got on my hands and knees, ass in the air. He knelt behind me on the couch. He entered me from behind, with the same hard exact push he'd used when I was riding him. He grabbed my hips and started furiously pounding me. He was grunting hard and borderline hurting me. After a couple minutes of furious pounding, he bent over and started fondling my boobs from behind, rougher than before, twisting my nipples. I needed to come again pronto and started rubbing my own clit. In another two minutes I was climaxing again. He went back upright and started pulling my hips into his cock again. I heard his grunting get louder, then he pulled out and came all over my naked back. In total, we had probably only been in the house for 15 minutes. He pulled back, stood up, pulled his pants up the rest of the way and immediately jetted. I lay kinda dizzy on my stomach with his cum still on my back. I was still half drunk and tried to reach behind me to scoop the cum with my fingers. I licked it off and started to get horny again. But I was on my own. No idea if the cab was still there, but I didn't see him again that night.

Since then, Kev has had a really good poker face. He doesn't go out of his way to talk to me, and he isn't really avoiding me. I fucked his son incessantly over the next few days. I think I've been horny ever since, honestly. I'm in love with my boyfriend and I think it was a huge mistake. But it was literally the best sex I've ever had. Kev is still with his wife. Between that relationship and the one I have with my boyfriend, I feel so guilty. And I'll never ask, but I'm dying to know what Kevin thinks after the fact.  Sometime I hate myself for letting my judgement be so clouded. But I still get dripping wet when I think about that night."

It's basically a time bomb situation, they'll ask or figure it out sooner or later, and I'd rather not be in that house once they do.

Today I spent all day looking at places, I went to the employment office and I'm starting a course next week, I hopefully graduate in February and I'm starting an internship on the radio in March, I spoke with my sister and my friends. I found a place that is cheap enought that It'll allow me to not burn through my savings as I look for a job, I sold an old instrument I don't use anymore and what they pay me monthly is enough to cover the rent, it's a room in a family home, an elderly man and his mother live there, everything I could find was 3x the price, so it's going to have to be okay by now.

As soon as February starts a place where we can rent a room for two people at an affordable price opens so I'm going there with a friend, and so it's also that it might be for just these last days of January so I don't want to splurge money that I'll need later on. I'm telling my family that I'm staying with a friend or that I'm looking over a friend's house who left on vacation or something, so I don't burn the bridges right now, and also I can come back to my house just because I'm not moving everything right away, just the things I'll need.

I can't believe it's happening so fast, I'd wish it wasn't so sudden but it'll have to be, this can't go on any longer, I was crying all day but I'm okay now, I think it's the right choice, it's not the best conditions but it's a. better than living at my parent's and b. enough for now."

7rmqer,1,2018-01-19,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7rmqer/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7rmraz,9,2018-01-19,"Huma, why she's a traitor",storm_fa_Q,CBTS_Stream,https://www.reddit.com/r/CBTS_Stream/comments/7rmraz/huma_why_shes_a_traitor/,"earlier I had some empathy for Huma, being raised to fill this position...a response worth reading for all I just received.

You made an interesting comment in saying that at one time she was once someone’s baby daughter, I think this is something we have to remember, given these people are evil but at one point they all belonged to someone and were innocent. I have watched numerous videos saying many of these people are born into this, and I do believe that, although not by choice were they brought up into this world. Moving onto Huma, I don’t hold the empathy for her as you do. I have done some research into her and her family are known terrorist supporters. I believe that is one of the reasons that Hillary adopted her as one of her own, for her families connections. Her mother, Saleha Abedin sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’Wa and Relief, and group chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi. They have a very prominent London based magazine that supports the Muslim brotherhood, the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. Huma herself wrote for the Journal while working as an intern for the Clinton White House in the mid 1990’s.Huma Ties to Muslim Brotherhood
Now looking back into all that happened with the Arab spring and knowing that Hillary and Obama had a lot to do with this, and we all know that Huma is Hillary’s right hand woman. It makes a lot of sense. Especially with the ouster of Egypts President at the time, and the new government being that of the Muslim Brotherhood. Thankfully Egypt is one of the few countries that has their military separate from the government and they were able to restore a leader who supports not only Christians, but combating terrorism. Here is one more piece by the NY post that was published on Huma and her ties, scary to think they ALMOST got into the White House. NY Post

I know a lot of people did not agree with what happened there, but I also think it’s because people didn’t fully understand that the military was separate from the government. I remember when we were supposed to give Egypt new fighter jets, and people were up in arms about this, at that time I was horrified at the thought of giving a new government who openly supported terrorism new fighter jets. But the more I learned about the Arab spring &amp; their military I was 100% for it, and thankfully for whatever reason Obama complied. Don’t get me wrong I think we need to stop giving so much aid and military weapons to foreign countries because we have come to see what the outcomes have been (them eventually using them against us), although Egypt has generally been our allie it seems many of those weapons end up in the hands of terrorists. Here is just ONE example of a report from CAR (Conflict Armament Research) that was published December 14, 2017 about weapons ending up in the hands of ISIS under Obama ISIS obtains weapons from US

I’m strongly for declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, along with CAIR, they support HAMAS and other terrorists organizations openly declaring Jihad against the United State. In fact Muslim Brotherhood in the operating in the United States has said “their work in America is a kind of Grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ it’s miserable house by their hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion is made victorious over all other religions.” This statement comes from a memorandum from Mohamed Akram aka Mohammad Akram Al-Adlouni, who is now the Secretary General of al-Quds International, the international think tank of the Muslim Brotherhood. Who is the Muslim Brotherhood

Sorry it took me a few days to answer, I have had the flu. I have MS &amp; Lupus so when I get sick it hits me a lot harder. I appreciate the conversation! Really enjoy coming back and seeing what everyone else thoughts are! Again sorry for delay! Happy Friday!!

7rmrvj,1,2018-01-19,Concern about upcoming Internship?,AManWithHalfAPlan,recruiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruiting/comments/7rmrvj/concern_about_upcoming_internship/,"So here's the situation.

I got offered an internship back in November for the upcoming summer. It's a pretty big deal for me and I'm very excited. After signing all the papers and NDAs, I was told they would reach out to me ""closer to my starting date"" with a background test/drug test. I don't start until May, but I am kind of worried that I haven't heard from the company since I signed and submitted all the papers. It was definitely a formal offer, as the hiring manager called me first, then emailed me and I filled out the necessary Paperwork. I recently emailed my hiring manager on Wednesday evening and haven't heard anything back. What do you think my next step should be? Is there any reason to be concerned about my job security? I think I'm going to call the hiring manager on Monday but now I have all weekend to fret, so any insight would be fantastic, thanks!"
7rmsf6,6,2018-01-19,How do I [21F] break up with him [29M] through text / phone call?,[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/7rmsf6/how_do_i_21f_break_up_with_him_29m_through_text/,"We're not really dating, just more talking. We met on Reddit as I'm a Gone Wild poster (ironic) and I posted something on r4r but he was really the first to talk to me like a normal human being. We like all the same things, he's an engineer at this rocket company in LA, and I'm currently an engineering student in the Bay Area that's currently on a break to focus on my startup. I've even considered moving down to LA for Spring Quarter to be closer to him before I go to the East Coast for my summer engineering internship. 

Everything is literally perfect, I feel like we're best friends first, and then everything seems all sweet and romantic. I told him that I would never get into to a relationship until I felt independent and mentally stable to handle one, and he's still stuck around. He's not even sexual at all....  But right now, I'm just stressed, with work and my family. My parents are now relying me to pay their rent as my dad got sick and my mom lost her job, which is fine, but they're also the most critical parents, which I think is cultural thing. All of this is rubbing onto him, like I keep getting frustrated and he understands very well what's going on, but I feel terrible right after and I say sorry profusely. No one deserves this kind of emotional abuse and I've been telling him we need to stop talking until I get myself mentally balanced and have most things under control. I have my first psych appointment next Monday and he's been really supportive about it. 

However, I've been instigated so many arguments lately I even feel exhausted. He doesn't show it and he just lets me talk and talk and he listens but I even feel exhausting of venting... There is literally nothing wrong with him, and he's just been very understanding. I found his ex girlfriend is really skinny, graduated top of her class, and they only broke up because of distance. He said he doesn't even think about her because when they did long distance she was very controlling and would threaten to break up with him if he went to sleep too early after work or if he didn't spend every free hour on her. I honestly am very jealous of her, and I kinda feel like I'm emulating her with the anxiety and neediness. 

I wish I could ghost him, but just leaving it open ended would give me anxiety, I need some kind of closure. What's the best thing to say? How do I end it? Preferably over text would be nice, but if it's better to call then I can do that as well... Just rather not."

It happened over a year ago and this is the first time I've ever mentioned it. I feel like I need to get it off my chest. And honestly, it was the hottest thing that ever happened to me. I actually can't start thinking about it during my everyday life. It gets me so wet that I have to spook off and finger myself. Like, even in public. I can actually feel my panties soaking as I type.

So, my boyfriend and I have been together 4 years. He's the nicest person I've ever met. He's a good lay and generally keeps me satisfied. I've never cheated on him prior to this or since. About me: I'm petite, in my early 20s, C-cups, long black hair and a round shapely ass. I workout constantly and even though I'm kinda shy, I've always gotten a lot of attention from men.

I was looking for a summer internship after my first year of college and my boyfriend's dad, who's quiet, polite and nerdy, hooked me up. He's in his late 40s, decent shape for his age, with a little bit of a beer gut. He was balding, had glasses. I know this doesn't sound super appealing, but he was cute, had a dad bod, strong arms and legs, kinda tall. He's always been kind and accommodating, but never seemed like he was that interested in me, personally. It was more of a ""How are you doing?"", then going off to talk to someone else whenever I saw him. During my internship, he worked on a different floor and I rarely saw him. The majority of our interaction was just a smile if we ever crossed paths.

One night, while my boyfriend was out to his friend's, I went to a little fundraiser celebration that the company was holding at a local bar. It was a great night. MY coworker's band was playing, everyone was dancing and joking around and I got pretty tipsy. I knew my boyfriend's dad, Kevin, was there, but, again, I just smiled and waved while he was over with the more senior staff, chatting and acting pretty respectable and reserved.

By around 1:30am, a lot of coworkers had cleared out. Most older people had gone home and Kev was at the bar squaring up his tab. I came over, with my drunken confidence and asked if he could add two more shots to the tab. He laughed and agreed and we both did a shot of whiskey together. I couldn't tell how drunk he was, but I was definitely feeling it. I asked him how he was getting home, and he said he planned on getting my boyfriend's mom to pick him up, but she had called an hour before saying she wasn't feeling up to the drive and asking him to take a cab. Then he asked me the same. I had no plans, but since my apartment was on the way to his house, he offered to split a cab.

We went outside the bar and tried to hail a cab. The summer night had cooled off and I was wearing a shorter, skin-tight dress. One that showed every curve of my ass and gave just a hint of cleavage. Needless to say, it took about 2 minutes of being outside before I had chattering teeth. Kev seemed to not notice and barely looked my way while trying to find a cab. The street had 2 other bars on it, so we were far from the only ones looking.

When we finally got a cab, we smooshed into the back seat. My teeth were chattering and Kevin took notice. He took put his hand across my back and onto my bare shoulder. It seemed fatherly and wholesome, but my pussy screamed otherwise. I was drunk and horny and Kevin's strong forearms felt firm and I could faintly smell what I figured was his deodorant. My pussy was throbbing all of a sudden and my nipples were already rock hard because of the cold. I could see them poking through the thin bra I had on. They hurt a little too. I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've been so turned on that it as borderline painful. This was one of those times. I never had thought of Kev in a sexual way before, but I would've let him do anything to me at that point. I started thinking about his dick. I wanted to suck his cock dry. I would've let him fuck any hole he wanted. I wanted to be his little slut. This man was twice my age, married, and the father of my boyfriend. All that floating around in my drunk mind made it even hotter.

I sidled a little closer until we were touching knee to hip. My hands were so cold that I started rubbing them together. Kevin took both of my hands and started rubbing the backs of them, removing his hand from my shoulder. In a total surreal moment, I grasped his hand and brought his middle finger to my lips. He as completely frozen. I wrapped my warm, wet lips over his finger and slid it to the back of my throat so the knuckles rested on my lips. I bobbed my head and let his finger slip in and out of my mouth, swirling my tongue around it, trying to show him what I'd do with his cock. He was deathly silent, but he didn't pull away. There was about 30 seconds of this is silence, with him looking straight ahead. I could hear his breathing deepen and I could see the erection forming under the zipper of his khakis. I reached over for it and began massaging it through his pants. He immediately let out a quiet groan. Thank god. I was getting to the point that his lack of action was making me think I was about to not only be embarrassed and rejected, but potentially ruin my entire life. He reached down the front of my dress and squeezed my nipple. I sharply exhaled. He started massaging my left breast while I desperately tried to undo his pants. I wanted to suck his cock dry. The cabbie, I have no idea if he had any idea of the debauchery in his backseat, asked ""this building here?"" and Kev and I quickly snapped out of what we were doing, and pulled our hands out of each other's clothes. ""Nope, the net one"" I replied. I sucked Kevin's earlobe gently and asked him to help me inside. He started to protest and I said ""Leave the cab out here, I just need some help in, you can go right back out"". He relayed that he'd be right back to the cabbie, then helped me out of the car.

I consciously stumbled a bit and played up the drunkenness, in case I was about to be fully embarrassed. When we got inside the door, I brushed my hands off his crotch and felt he was still rock hard. I figured that was my cue. I dropped to my knees in the porch the second the door closed and licked the length of his cock through his khakis, leaving a wet streak. I looked up at him and pushed my tits together subtly and in my sexiest voice pleaded. ""Pllleeaaase let me suck it"". He groaned but took no action. I undid his zipper and slipped his cock out through the separation of his underwear. He was very hard. It was a decent cock, not super thick, and I'd say between 5 and 6 inches. It actually reminded me of my boyfriend's. I licked around the head of it, pulled back the foreskin a little and ran my tongue over the slit in his head. I could faintly taste cum, but he wasn't oozing at that point. I closed my lips around the tip and slowly pushed my head towards him. At this point, he groaned a lot louder and his breath was heavy. I took all of him in until my nose was against his pubes and started to make swallowing movements with my throat, trying to clench the muscles as an ex had told me to do. Kevin suddenly put his hand on the top of my head and subtly thrust his cock even more down my throat. I started massaging his balls while he really gently throat fucked me, holding my head steady with his hand. He pulled out all of a sudden and lines of spit trailed from my mouth to his cock. I took my dress and bra off and stood up, in my panties and heels. He bent over and put his really warm mouth on my nipple. Sucking it while he kneaded my other tit. I leaned back against the door frame and pressed my chest towards his mouth. He started sucking and biting my other nipple and moved one of his hands down into my panties to my pussy. I could hear how wet I was. I was throbbing and I've never had a jolt of pleasure go through my body like that before. You know that feeling when you're super turned on and someone touches you? It makes you jump, almost. Well, that's what I did. I jolted and moaned. He said ""fuuuuccck"" under his breath. Literally the first time I've heard him swear.

He massaged in small circles around my clit, then stuck two of his fingers in me. My first instinct was to buck towards them. I NEEDED to be fucked. But he withdrew them and stuck them in my already opened mouth. YYYYEEESSSSSS. I sucked them again just like I did in the cab, they were soaked and tasted like pussy. I sucked them clean. The submissive side of me basically came right then and there. He slid my panties fully off and picked me up, two hand on my ass. We started furiously making out and he walked the half dozen steps to my couch. Me, naked and grinding my wet pussy on him, him fully clothed with his cock out.

He sat down, holding me on top of him. I hauled his pants and underwear over him so his cock was no longer just through his underwear fly. He pulled my hips up and directly over his cock. He paused while I reached back and lined him up and he brought me down heavily and quickly. I've never been entered this rough before, usually dudes ease their way into me. I was so wet it didn't matter. I bounced up and down on his cock while we both grunted in time with the movement. He was gripping my waist and slamming me down on his crotch as hard as he could. I reached down and started stroking my clit. This was the most turned on I've ever been. It took me literally 2 minutes to cum. If you've never been roughly slammed with cock while cumming, GO DO THIS NOW. I clenched my pussy as hard as I could when I came, in hopes that he could feel me. And it definitely worked. He pushed in as hard as he could and just let me throb on his cock while we were both motionless and moaning. He pulled me off and pushed me further down onto the couch. I took the hint and got on my hands and knees, ass in the air. He knelt behind me on the couch. He entered me from behind, with the same hard exact push he'd used when I was riding him. He grabbed my hips and started furiously pounding me. He was grunting hard and borderline hurting me. After a couple minutes of furious pounding, he bent over and started fondling my boobs from behind, rougher than before, twisting my nipples. I needed to come again pronto and started rubbing my own clit. In another two minutes I was climaxing again. He went back upright and started pulling my hips into his cock again. I heard his grunting get louder, then he pulled out and came all over my naked back. In total, we had probably only been in the house for 15 minutes. He pulled back, stood up, pulled his pants up the rest of the way and immediately jetted. I lay kinda dizzy on my stomach with his cum still on my back. I was still half drunk and tried to reach behind me to scoop the cum with my fingers. I licked it off and started to get horny again. But I was on my own. No idea if the cab was still there, but I didn't see him again that night.

Since then, Kev has had a really good poker face. He doesn't go out of his way to talk to me, and he isn't really avoiding me. I fucked his son incessantly over the next few days. I think I've been horny ever since, honestly. I'm in love with my boyfriend and I think it was a huge mistake. But it was literally the best sex I've ever had. Kev is still with his wife. Between that relationship and the one I have with my boyfriend, I feel so guilty. And I'll never ask, but I'm dying to know what Kevin thinks after the fact. Sometime I hate myself for letting my judgement be so clouded. But I still get dripping wet when I think about that night."

I got my first acceptance 4 days after making this post. don't be neurotic like me.

**edit:** thank you to everyone who reassured me i still had a very good chance, appreciate y'all for helping my neurotic ass feel better :') maybe i should re-phrase my question to be like ""is there anything I could/should be doing in the next few months to prepare, in the slight chance that I do have to reapply?"" 
--
Hey premedditors, 

I'm a current applicant to MD/PhD programs. I applied to ~20 programs, received 6 II (1 resulted in WL, the other 5 have not released decisions yet) and rejected from pretty much everywhere else. While I realize there's still hope for me this cycle, I'm also not super confident about my chances post-II and want to be proactive about improving my app in case I need to reapply. I'd appreciate y'alls advice on what area(s) would be most important to focus on improving. Here are the details of my app:


* **Graduated in 2017**, well-regarded public school, majored in bio and minored in studio art. 
* **Cumulative GPA: 3.80 / Science GPA: 3.83**. good upward trend on both
* **MCAT Scores: 518** (129 | 129 | 129 | 131) 
* **Research: ~1400 hrs** completed at time of primary. 400 hours at NIH summer internship, with one poster presentation. 1000 hours in undergrad lab, with one poster presentation. continued working here full time in gap year, so projected another ~1700 hours by May 2018.  
* **Volunteering (clinical) – 90 hours** in hospital, doing regular stuff like bringing blankets to patients. also started a new volunteer position in children's hospital, this wasn't on primary since I got the position in july, but I mentioned it in secondaries. 
* **Physician shadowing – 80 total**: 10 neurology, 10 PICU, 40 developmental peds, 20 private practice surgery. 
* **Non-clinical volunteering - 100 hrs** working with children with disabilities. 
* **Extracurricular activities** - **300 hrs** in student club. **75 hrs** leadership in said club. **500 hrs** yoga . 
* **Employment history - 700 hrs** in the service industry. 


My thoughts: 
1) I think my school list might have been too top-heavy? I used the MSAR and thought my stats were reasonable for everywhere I applied; however, I didn't really take into account that those numbers are just for MD-only, I don't really know how I stack up compared to their MD/PhD applicants.
 
2) my undergrad lab isn't super prestigious / we don't have that much funding. this didn't bother me since I'm super interested in the project and got to learn a lot from my PI, but it has been a little discouraging to go to interviews and have people question why I didn't go back to NIH / why I chose to stay in my lab for my gap year / why i have no pubs. 

3) I suppose my clinical and non-clinical volunteering hours are a little on the low side, but I have heard that this can be overlooked for MD/PhD. Maybe I should still try to add more? 

4) I didn't plan very well for a re-application. My MCAT is only good for one more cycle -- i.e. I'd have to reapply in June 2018, without many significant changes to my app. I'm not opposed to taking more gap years, I could join a different lab and try to get a paper out or something, but then that means I'd have to retake my MCAT .



so yeah, that's my dilemma. God bless if you read all the way through this wall of text and I would appreciate any and all feedback that you guys can give. "
7rn7dk,28,2018-01-19,Are Corporate Training Courses supposed to be b.s.?,Aerothermal,skeptic,https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/7rn7dk/are_corporate_training_courses_supposed_to_be_bs/,"Who has experience of corporate training courses? For context, I'm in the UK, and I've just this week completed another induction event, you know the kind where you enter a training room for perhaps a day or a week, and go through all sorts of models, discussions and games before everyone ticks 5 stars on the feedback form and goes home feeling like they might have learned something useful.

I've experience of these things at three major global companies in recent memory (all with somewhere between 45,000 and 100,000 employees), and I see a pattern of repeating threads:

- Left Brain/Right Brain 'diagram' with self-evaluation (for the apologists; it's always taught as if *fact*, never as 'metaphor'. It's never mentioned in the context of actual neuroscience, and the facilitators each time made no mention of words like 'synapse', 'prefrontal', 'temporal', 'parietal' or 'occipital').

- A one-dimensional scale/ladder/elevator of emotions

- Excessive use of the word 'energy' (""Are you a high energy person""/""Did you approach them with the right energy"", ""you have contracting energy"" etc).

- A breathing exercise

- Role play with a partner

- A quadrant of personality types (e.g. colour personalities Red Blue Green Yellow)

- A short personality test followed by very detailed analysis of your psyche (see [Barnum Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect))

- A quadrant of communication styles (e.g. Dominant Easy-going, Formal Informal) in which you exist at a point, at any given time in communication.

- Occasionally starting bold claims with ""researchers say that"" as if justifying their credence though **never** mentioning any specific researchers, studies, methods, or anything resembling quantified findings.

(I'd be interesting to see what others might add to this list)

Am I wrong thinking that millions of hours of productivity are lost every year, in every country, to *complete bullshit* courses? Or at the very best, these *millions* of annual man-hours are simply gambled on courses where their efficacy is unknown, and where no company has even attempted to measure. Not to mention the opportunity cost of pulling all these people out of their work, and the systematic transmission of basic misconceptions. We focus on lean culture and reducing waste, but if that was my company, I'd probably be pretty concerned about how we're all spending this time. And it's not something that goes on out of sight, when everybody from the intern to the CEO gets the privelage of finding out what colour they are. 

I'll walk out on a Friday with a list of take-aways like ""understand your shadow"", ""where are you on the Mood Lift?"" and ""manage your energy"", which is somehow supposed to boost my performance when I get back to my desk on the Monday. Even if it doesn't, at least I have a colourful booklet, will know I'm a ""red-blue personality"" and need to think with my ""left brain"". Totally worth it.

I'm very much involved in education myself, but in practice nobody's seriously talking about evidence-based training. Hell, most people even with their degrees and experience don't understand or appreciate the need for frivolous things like 'systematic controlled studies' and 'control groups'. Though it shouldn't be insurmountable to just come up with the experiment. Take this company with say 80,000 employees, there's always a stream of fresh starts; lets randomly assign a third of these new guys to the course, a maybe another third get to go on a new course of up-to-date methods informed by a little psychology, neuroscience and learning theory. Let the lucky final third be the control group, and just defer their invite. See what happens. Or carry out cohort studies. HR probably has the data. They could looking at when employees went on the training versus their improvements in manager appraisals, promotions or some other proxy for performance. There's already a lot of data to work with. If there's some statistically significant impact there should be a sign somewhere. And if there's not, why the hell are we even running these courses in the first place?

Ben Goldacre wrote an essay on the need for [evidence-based education], and [in 2013](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/building-evidence-into-education) submitting a paper to Government urging the need to take action. **tl;dr** We need evidence-based training in industry. I have seen corporate training at three major companies and see it as an overlooked pocket of irrationality that has gone unchallenged, and nobody's doing anything about it."

1) The Sissy Experiment [M4M/TF]: I'm a science geek, working on a serum that makes men more feminine. You're my brother, who I often use as a guinea pig in my experiments. [Kinks: incest, sissification, mtf transformation.]

2) The Intern [M4F]: I'm an intern working for on the set of a commercial/show/music video and you're the actress/musician/model starring in the show. When I'm assigned to be your personal assistant, you take full advantage of my willingness to do what I'm told. [Kinks: celebrity, slight femdom, public/risky sex]

3) Lesbian Conversion [M4F]: Your parents weren't happy when you came out to them. They sent you to me, a conversion therapist to make you straight. [Kinks: forced/dubcon, rough sex, name-calling]

4) Bear Hug [M4A]: A timid bear goes out to a bar for the first time ever, and goes home with more than just a drink or two. [Kinks: furry, size difference, musk]

5) The Insatiable Son [M4A]: I'm a healthy and virile young man, who is enthusiastically exploring his sexuality; unfortunately for the rest of my family, that means finding cum stains all around the house, my porn lying out in the open, and my constant masturbating at the worst possible times. Will you try to quell my urges? Or assist me in my pleasure? [Kinks: freeuse, incest, excessive cum]

7ro6hl,1,2018-01-19,Am I (20F) asking too much of my (24M) boyfriend of four months?,leastar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ro6hl/am_i_20f_asking_too_much_of_my_24m_boyfriend_of/,"I'll try to keep it short as possible, just need some advice on if I'm being irrational or asking too much.

I've been dating a male friend of mine for around four months after knowing him for almost two years. We are from the same hometown but I go to college 2 hours away and rarely return home, so we are long distance. We will call him H. Just for some background, before beginning to date him in the fall, I exited a tremendously emotionally abusive relationship with a male I met at my college. After leaving, I dealt with months of harassment, stalking and destruction or property. I have been diagnosed with PTSD from not only the aftermath of it, but additionally the mental toll the relationship had on me. For example, this boy never made time for me, would drop off the earth for days (or weeks) at a time, wouldn't talk to me on holidays/birthday, pretended to not know me in public, threaten me, etc. As well as myself, my now boyfriend left a (seemingly) healthy relationship a couple months before my situation with a girl of three years after she cheated on him and became engaged to another. He thought this woman was ""his soulmate"" and the one for him, so it devastated him for a long time.

Flash forward to September, H approaches me saying he's had feelings for me for a while but we were never single at the same time, and he thought this was our chance to finally leap. I realized I could really enjoy this, but was scared due to the ongoing trauma I was still experiencing due to filing protection orders as well as a student conduct case with 11 charges against my ex. I made this clear to him from the beginning and he told me it was nothing to worry about. The only stipulation, he chose to tell me 4 days before deploying to Puerto Rico for a month and a half for a navy mission. We decided to wait until he returned to become exclusive or serious. In this short time, I discovered he had been dating and sleeping with another girl the entirety of the summer. This made me take a step back and second guess, so he decided to ask me to be his girlfriend the night he left for his trip (seemingly out of panic of losing me.) I said we can try in the meantime and I wouldn't mind waiting. This kind of made me a bit unsure in my mind from the start due to this being the foundation of our relationship.

But while he was away, he treated me like gold. Giving me reassurance he wanted no one else, never ignoring me, especially for being in a different country and doing very important things. I never took any of these weeks for granted and was blown away by his efforts. I was extremely happy and we began the whole talk of the somewhat-in-the-future goals we had, of meeting each others families, long distance plans, etc.

When he returned, he was a completely different person. At first, I attributed this to lots of stress and fatigue of his mission. I couldn't imagine what he went through, so I tried to not take it personally. But after a while, I began to realize it was only me he was taking his stresses on. This began the fighting in our relationship (November-ish) and we've had the same repeated fights since. He told me he wasn't over his ex still, then took it back, then told me we weren't compatible, took that back. Then he told me I was asking too much. I was a bit confused, for in this time, I was just wanting the start of our relationship, and the things he had already given me, back. I wasn't ""asking"" for anything, only trying to figure out his change and the occasional reassurance.

My biggest problems are mostly the way he communicates and the lack of overall initiative he has. For example, he lives at home with his parents still, which is fine, but he has no sense of plan of moving out or moving forward with is life in this sense. His reasoning before was to save money for school, which he had began in fall but had to withdraw from classes due to his trip. Again, makes sense. But after returning from his mission, he made zero plans to re-enroll or pursue his dream of a business degree he already started. Since being home, he has not worked with army stuff, gone back to school (or made plans to), and has no intention of finding a job. He sleeps until around 3-4 PM everyday, and plays video games the rest of his time awake, repeat daily. This didn't bother me at first, but now I am realizing this might just be how he is. He doesn't communicate frequently or effectively when he does. Especially when we fight, he fights dirty and threatens to break up with me and will sometimes physically stand by the door as if he is going to leave. This all bothers me for we are long distance, so I think it is important to text some if he's not going to pick up the phone and call from time to time. It hurts to know he doesnt call or text much, but is playing video games and not particularly busy his time. When he does spend physical time with me, he sleeps MAJORITY of the time, and that's not an exaggeration. He has yet to meet my father, who plays a very important role in my life, especially after helping me through the situation with my ex boyfriend. He doesn't update me about anything happening in his life unless I specifically ask daily if anything is new, and he says he ""refuses"" to keep me updated on day-to-say activities that I want to know of purely because of caring about his life. All things I thought we not only agreed on, but stuff he would WANT to do. I didn't think I was asking for much.

It just seems everything I thought he'd give me, or I did have while he was away, fell flat when I came home. He has no drive or motivation, which contrasts very much so with my personal values and how I live my life. I live alone, I'm about to graduate with a scholars engineering degree, and I have an internship with a huge company. I have talked with him several times about all of these things in a non-attacking nor personal manner, just in terms of how it affects our relationship. I know I am not perfect either, but I feel I am trying to progress this relationship forward and make it healthy again but is impossible when he calls me crazy, needy, and literally laughs at me for wanting some motivation from his part in this relationship. I want to make it clear I do not think I am better than him in any way for the way we live our lives, just simply wish he would BEGIN the steps of caring about what he does with his. I do and will support whichever path in life he chooses, I only wish he'd at least try to figure out what that may be for him.

I apologize greatly for the length! I'm beginning to feel worried about the future of this relationship becoming serious if I can't see myself moving in with him, engaged to him someday, etc. already a few months in.

Any advice on if/how this can improve or if I should just cut my loses before I get too invested? Thanks everyone!

TL;DR boyfriend currently has no motivation to move his life or our relationship forward, should I stick around and keep trying or accept incompatibilities? Am I asking for too much?"

This is exactly what I want to study. However, searching online it seems that my fellow ChemE's are struggling to get job offers.

On the other hand, I am good at CS. I took a couple of electives and I aced all of them. And while I like the material, I am more passionate about ChemE. I also see CS graduates around here getting offers left and right, including internships. 

Should I switch majors? I am passionate about ChemE, but I also understand that my time in college and my student loans are an investment and that is my approach to college since day one, so if it isn't a financially sound decision to keep doing ChemE, I can switch while its not too late. I will only need to do a extra semester if I switch now.

Please give me your opinions."

It [was received well enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7fu44v/4_years_ago_i_decided_to_get_better_i_want_to/) for me to feel comfortable sharing a follow-up case study report.

###What gets measured gets managed

I'm a firm believer that the first step in controlling an aspect of your life is to measure it. This is true for finances, fitness, weight, career goals, you name it. 

What people don't often seem to track is **happiness**. [Happiness is arguably the most important thing in our lives](https://trackinghappiness.com/about/). So I decided that I wanted to learn more about it, and how I could better my life by knowing exactly where to find it.

I want to share my case-study report of everything that I tracked in 2016. Hopefully, this may inspire some of you guys to also start tracking happiness. 

###How happy was I in 2016?

My average happiness rating in 2015 was 7,54. This was a pretty significant decrease over the year before, which was fuelled by a terrible long distance period with my girlfriend and a pretty difficult period on a project abroad.

I’m happy to report that 2016 was my happiest year so far! My average happiness rating of the year was 7,91! An awesome increase! I will explain exactly what I think caused this sharp increase.

###What was 2016 like?

My year 2016 had quite a rough start. I was still in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend. She had started an internship on the other side of the planet in 2015, which quickly became a period I now refer to as relationship hell. Our relationship suffered greatly from this long distance period, and it nearly ended what we had on multiple occasions. It was really hard to deal with this situation, for the both of us.

Her internship ended at the end of January, which meant the end of our long distance relationship. However, this did not mean it was a happy ever after fairy-tale ending. Not in the slightest. We had several arguments after reuniting, which only damaged our relationship further. We both had quite a tough time dealing with the challenging period we had just survived.

Our relationship fully recovered somewhere in March. Which was just in time, because we were about to enter yet another long distance relationship period! What the hell? 

Luckily, this period would only last a couple of weeks. I was flying out to Costa Rica again, to work on a project. Despite the challenging workload and working 7 days a week, I was able to maintain my happiness. I knew exactly what to do – and what NOT to do – in order to not burn out. It was something I had learned from tracking my happiness.

The next couple of months were just great. I really enjoyed my quiet and happy life in the Netherlands. I was able to spend a lot of time doing the things I love. My girlfriend and I both enjoyed spending time together, and we were happy to have survived the shitty period we entered in 2015. I also continued running a lot, in preparation for my third marathon in September.

The second half of 2016 was exceptionally great. I spent a fantastic week with my brother and father hiking through the mountains of Austria. The rest of 2016 was really nothing but happiness. My girlfriend and I went on a PERFECT holiday to Macedonia, which resulted in the happiest days of the year for me. Shortly after, my sister and I drove to England to participate in the Nottingham Marathon. It was another highlight of the year, because I finally beat my goal time of &lt;4:00:00 on a marathon! It was another fantastic trip.

I spent the last two months of 2016 really enjoying my happy and uneventful life. Despite the fact that nothing excited happened at the time, I really enjoyed all my passions. I knew exactly what I needed to do in order to maximise my happiness!

###What made me the happiest in 2016?

After analysing all the factors that have influenced my happiness in 2016, I have found 2 factors that have made the biggest positive impact.

#### My relationship

After our period in relationship hell, my girlfriend and I really reconnected again as 2016 went on. Except for my short period in Costa Rica, we did not face any significant time away from each other. This allowed us to spent a lot of quality time together. We went on great dates, visited a couple of fantastic countries together and had an overall blast.

Out of 366 days (2016 was a leap year), my girlfriend positively influenced my happiness on 149 days. In other words: my girlfriend positively influenced 41% of my days! I truly feel lucky to be in a relationship with her.

####Running

2016 was also a fantastic year for running. At the end of 2015, I set another three sub-targets for myself. In 2016, I wanted to:

* Finish two marathons

* Finish a marathon within 4 hours

* Run more than 1.000 kilometers in total

Well, I am thrilled to say that I accomplished all three targets.

I finished two marathons in Rotterdam and in Nottingham. I crossed the finish line in Nottingham in JUST under 4 hours. And finally, I finished the year with a total running distance of 1.496 kilometers. HELL YEAH.

Running was a fantastic source of happiness in 2016, and I definitely wanted to continue with it.

###What made me the unhappiest in 2016?

There was one factor that negatively influenced my happiness the most, and that was tiredness.

####Being tired

My tiredness negatively influenced my happiness on 50 days in 2016. Quite a lot, if you ask me.

But I am not really sure how to feel about this. Is this bad? Should I try my best to never be tired anymore? Would I have been happier if I had decided to sleep more often?

You might see where I am headed.

I want to be as happy as possible. We all do, right? Well, in order to become and stay happy, we need to be AWAKE. Our happiness doesn’t generally increase while we are asleep (there are probably some exceptions). [We need to be awake in order to become happier, by doing the things we enjoy doing](https://www.trackinghappiness.com/effect-sleep-happiness/). Feeling well rested will only make it easier for us to enjoy the things we enjoy doing.

So there is a certain dilemma here.

You see, I have sacrificed my sleep many times in 2016. But I have always tried to do fun stuff in the extra time that I’m awake. I might watch a cool series before going to bed, or spend a nice night with my girlfriend. If the feeling of tiredness is the result of that decision, if does not necessarily mean that it was a bad decision.

The happiness I gain from doing the things that I like may outweigh the unhappiness I gain from being tired

###What did I learn and what goals did I have for 2017?

####1. Continue spending quality time with my girlfriend

Seeing [the positive effect of my relationship on my happiness](https://www.trackinghappiness.com/happy-in-love-happiness-through-love-part-1/), I wanted this trend to continue! No more long distance relationships, and no more big arguments!

We both wanted to make sure we’d spend as much quality time together as possible. This would include great holiday plans together, but also weekends and day trips, and frequent date nights. We wanted to grow our relationship into something even better. 🙂

####2. Run even more?

2016 was already a great running year for me. I ran a shitload of kilometers, and managed to hit all my targets. So I asked myself: why not aim for more? How much happiness can I gain from running? When will I hit my limit, if there even is one?

So in 2017, I wanted to run 1.500 kilometers, finish 2 marathons under 4 hours, and finally I wanted to finish a 5K race under 20 minutes.

These were obviously pretty sharp targets, but I was going to give it my best anyway. Running had always been a great happiness factor for me, so I only wanted to become better at it. At the end of 2016, I had already signed up for my fourth marathon in Paris. 

I was focused on making 2017 an even better year than 2016!

You can find the complete analysis of my personal happinessin 2016 on my website about [tracking happiness](https://www.trackinghappiness.com/yearly-happiness-statistics-2016/).

Please do let me know what you think of this idea. I would appreciate any input from this community. Do you like this idea? Do you hate it? I would love to fiind out!

7rqeqw,2,2018-01-20,More Discussion Regarding Aoyama,duongnd1998hcm,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/7rqeqw/more_discussion_regarding_aoyama/,"It's my first post here and I hope this post is useful for you guys. From what I see, there are currently 2 main hypotheses regarding Aoyama:
1) He's the traitor who works with The Villain Alliance all this time
2) He's being his odd-ball self and he has some personal issues that he believes only Midoriya could help him with
3) The figure is Toga in disguise

Personally, I lean more toward the first two. 
Regarding 1), I mean Horikoshi couldn't possibly showed Shinsou at the beginning of the hero internship arc when it was clear that he had been doing plenty of training for no reason. There's a chance he is implying that someone from class A will have to be out for Shinsou to be in, and it would have to be the traitor no matter who it is. In this chapter, it's heavily hinted that he might be the traitor (maybe too heavily lol). In a sense quite similar to the Kaminari traitor theory, you may think that his extra-sparkling nature may be just an act and Horikoshi is going the Blue Exorcist route. Horikoshi's storytelling skill is something that shouldn't be taken lightly. The man has displayed great capability to make unknown characters sympathizable/lovable in no more than 3 chapters (Shinsou, Asido, Camie) and Aoyama can be his next target. Most importantly, how the heck is Aoyama peeping in Midoriya's room from the OUTSIDE??? Can he fly cause it's the second floor and the building is kinda high lol.

On the other hand, 2) also has its own merit. Truth be told Aoyama is not that noticeable in the fandom. I mean it would be more exhilarating if somebody who is more emotionally attached to the class as well as fans to be the traitor (Kaminari). If Aoyama were to be a traitor and have to go away, I think there won't be that much of a reaction from the readers. Maybe Aoyama is just stalking Midoriya because of some personal reasons. I mean it seems Aoyama has a defected quirk and he couldn't do anything without his belt (or maybe he's just faking if he were to be the traitor lol). Maybe he's impressed with Midoriya's growth and accomplishment recently and just want to know how he did it. If it really is about personal reasons, there are plenty to speculate.

About 3), I think it might not be the case this time. UA converted to a boarding school after the log camp incident and nobody is allowed to go out or in without permission, with the hope of smoking out the traitor. How could Toga even manage to get her hand on Aoyama to begin with if he never leaves school?

What do you guys think? Feel free to add more if you discover new possibilities!"
7rr85i,2,2018-01-20,Using File Input / Output in a .jar file,ihavesalad,javahelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/7rr85i/using_file_input_output_in_a_jar_file/,"So I've created just a simple application which I'm using to apply for a highschool internship. It was built using Eclipse. 

I initially exported into a runnable .jar file, but the location I initially saved files, (""src/fileDirectories"") didn't work on export.I then set the location to ""./fileDirectories"") which works and the app can actually run, however the .jar file creates the folder directory in the same folder as the .jar file. 

This isn't too bad, as I can create a folder with the .jar and the saved files in it, which is fine, but similar to images, I'm wondering if there is a way to save .txt files in a directory to the .jar file so everything works with just the .jar application."

Self employed s corp on Texas. She owns half on paper. Mortgage 200k on house worth 290. Credit card debt about 50k between personal and biz. Two car loans at 400 each.  Company is barely keeping up right now. I take about 6-8k per month in draws.

She is starting a massage therapy internship and will start that career after she gets license. I would be very surprised if she get 20 bucks an hr starting out.

Two kids 4-8

My idea of proposal-

She takes her 2014 car that i pay off, i take everythi g else including house, she signs off as owner of business. 

Driving factors- our house is walking distance of school, all kids friends are here and i office out of house.

Basically she walks with zero debt and a paid off car


Does this sound fair realizing it is skewed in her favor? If she says no then its sell everythi g and split it all, we each walk with about 15k maybe and she has a 20k car note"
7rsm6j,5,2018-01-20,I Guess This is Day One. This is Me.,containment_unit,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/7rsm6j/i_guess_this_is_day_one_this_is_me/,"Hello all,

I've been on reddit for about seven years now, but created this account particularly to use for this sub.  I've been lurking for a few months, reading many of your posts, and trying to build up the strength to put the drinks down.

I never thought this would happen to me, but it has.  Drinking became a thing for me in my late 30's, primarily as a way to escape and ""cope"" with the difficulty of graduate school, which I started in my mid-30s.  Now I am about six months away from getting my doctoral degree.  I've struggled quite a bit in life, which is why I started school so late.  Getting this far has been the defining accomplishment of my life, but the drinking has become a real problem.  It's like I told a therapist: I feel as if I've spent nearly four decades trying to find a doorway to a meaningful, rewarding life, but the alcohol is making it hard for me to reach up and open that door, now that I've found it.  It's like I'm right outside the gate.  I want so badly to see what's inside.

Part of my problem was that I couldn't believe that I'd developed a real problem.  In my mind I kept batting it away.  ""That's silly!  No one gets a drinking problem at like age 37.""  It was a really great way to deny the reality of what I'm doing to myself.  ""Yeah, I need to stop this.  I'll do that tomorrow.""  And then it was tomorrow after tomorrow after tomorrow.  I've decided that I can't do this alone.  I fear that if I do this alone, tomorrow will never come.  And so here I am, talking to you.

I had quite a lot last night, by myself, with the TV on and the lights off on a Friday night, after a grueling day of being an intern.  I'm sober now.  My head hurts a bit.  My stomach hurts a bit more.  I am tired and tired of being tired.

One of the things that I am most embarrassed about is that I'm months away from being a psychologist.  I treat patients for many things, including PTSD, substance use, depression, anxiety, and even obesity.  I know a ton of things when it comes to mental health.  I diagnose people with things all the time!  I've even helped other people stop drinking!  This makes me feel pretty bad about myself.  It makes me feel like I should know better.  I know what problem drinking is, what it looks like, what it can do to the mind, brain, and body, and which strategies to stop drinking have been shown in the research to be the most effective, but I've had so much difficulty applying all that to help myself.  It makes me feel guilty.  I'm tired of feeling guilty, of feeling bad, stuck, dumb.  Given that the only people I know where I live are psychologists, I can't really talk to any of them about it.  And so here I am, talking to you.

Today promises to be quiet.  Tonight I can easily find the motivation not to drink, particularly because my body hurts.  Knowing myself, I know that tomorrow will be harder.  Nevertheless, I'm strapping in and buckling up.  

Thank you for listening and for helping me to do this.  It means a lot just to write this stuff down.  The idea that people might be listening gives me real comfort.  Thank you.  "
7rsz64,20,2018-01-20,How do I convince my parents to march drum corps?,sunduh,drumcorps,https://www.reddit.com/r/drumcorps/comments/7rsz64/how_do_i_convince_my_parents_to_march_drum_corps/,"This post is going to be fairly long!



I am a 17 y/o senior in high school that is desperately trying to march this season. The problem is that my parents are refusing to let me march. I am an Asian-American with stereotypical parents. They make me study a lot and despise me playing music, so they took me out of the band program at school (I played a woodwind instrument). However, I continued to follow my dream, secretly got a concert euph from a friend, and started practicing in the gym parking lot (I take the euph with me and after my workout I practice in the parking lot). 

I have talked to my parents about doing drum corps. I told them about Open-Class (since its cheaper and a more viable option for a beginner in my eyes) and they outright just said no. I fear that this may be my only chance to march. Since I'm going to college next year, they're going to make me do internships over the summer, prohibiting me from marching.

So for people in my situation or have been in my situation, what can be done to convince them to let me march? 



Again, sorry for the long post and thank you for your time.

7rt3yh,2,2018-01-20,I [21F] don't know if I love my boyfriend [23M] anymore or if there's something wrong with me.,lostgeog,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7rt3yh/i_21f_dont_know_if_i_love_my_boyfriend_23m/,"Hello,

We've been together a 1.5 years and about 4 hrs LDR. He works and I'm in my last year of uni, we've been talking about him moving down to my area after his contract is up, a little after my graduation. His best  ""ride or die"" friends all live together in a city 2 hours away from me and 5 away from him. He lives at home with his parents and his brother in an expensive city to save money while he works but he is lonely since me and his friends live away.

There's some things that have happened that have really worn me down. The first is dealing with friends. When we first dated he told me that whenever we're in his friends' area that we have to visit them (they live in a large city that people in my area go to for concerts/events). We planned a week off (he only gets 2 weeks off a year) to go abroad, it was fun but he told me the last few days when we returned he would be going to see his friends for a birthday. He didn't tell me until after we bought our non-refundable tickets and I was upset because I would have rathered rescheduled the time to spend a full week. I was looking forward to relaxing after the flight but he left and I felt alone. 

He told his friends he would spend New Years with them without asking me what my plans were (I was upset because I wanted to go to a concert). I then told him I wanted to spend New Years with  my friends and he got really sulky and asked why I didn't want to spend New Years with him and his friends and thought about getting a hotel. I thought that was manipulative since he never mentioned beforehand and expected me to go. My friends wanted to party far away so I spent it with him. There was no hotel. We had an arguement about New Years and he told me that we see each other more often than he sees him so he always wants to reserve their birthday weekends and traditions with them (total would be 3 months of reserved weekends) so we had to plan around that (ex: that trip). I felt like I wasn't a priority, why couldn't he see them another time if there was event we wanted to go to (not even counting his family birthdays/mothers day etc). We eventually talked it out and he admitted he was being selfish and he said hed only make sure his best friend's birthday would count.

The second is communication. He's not very good at communicating, I'm very up front. Sometimes he'll just be silent and say nothing. I feel like I'm talking to a wall when we're trying to discuss something that bothers me. He will go back on things (ex: i ask if we can have sex in the evening. He agrees. Then at night he will just say he is going to sleep... and I get upset). Or when I ask is something bothers him he says ""i dont know"" and then brings it up out of nowhere during a casual conversation that he actually hates when I touch his butt (which I've been doing the entire time we've been together! Now I feel like a creep) or we are clingy. It shocks me and I feel bad and insecure.

I also am concerned about his priority for me. I was cheated and badly hurt (we were friends so he saw the fallout) and my ex was a good friend of his (they are not friends anymore). His brother asked us if you could be friends with someone who does shitty things to other people (we said no) but my boyfriend says if his friend cheats on someone he wouldn't cut ties because he could see it as just a mistake. That cut, deeply. We were friends before we were dating and he admitted he would be still friends with my ex after knowing he cheated on me if we didn't date. I left the room.

And I think the worst thing is when we said ""I love you"". I accidentally almost said it and he kept egging me on. It didn't feel romantic, I felt pressured. But eventually he egged it out of me then said he wasn't there yet. I felt so defeated and used. I wasn't ready to say it only for him to force it out of me and reject me. One week later he gives me a card that says ""I love you!"" He didn't say it, I read it in a card. He said he ""thought about it and changed his mind"". It wasn't cute or romantic. I didn't feel very loved. I felt very hurt. I think I still carry that resentment with me.

We've worked on a lot of these things. He says he was selfish with his friends and that he will do better. He recognizes the ""I love you"" thing was cruel. But I feel different now. I feel more detached. I don't feel it when he says he loves me and I don't feel much when I say it to him. I feel numb. I've had other things happening - lack of direction in life, nervousness about getting a job, feeling lonely by neglecting friends to do work and internships. I don't know if I don't love him anymore. I don't know if I can get past my resentment. I don't know. 

**Tl'dr: I feel numb to my boyfriend after a series of arguments/events that have left me not feeling loved or like a priority to my boyfriend. I don't feel like he's in love with me and I question my feelings for him. I don't know if I'm being clingy or he was being cruel and I'm overreacting. I don't know if my numbness is caused by other stress in my life. What do I do.**"

I'm hoping that maybe some of you could share some insight about what to do in my last years of college.

I'm currently a junior doing a double major in Accounting and Information Systems. I was able to get an audit internship with PwC this upcoming summer that I'm looking forward to and I'm also currently interning at a small tax firm. I'm grateful for these opportunities and also the direction I'm moving in towards my own professional development.

However, I'm stuck at crossroads right now of feeling like I'm putting too much effort/time in school and not really enjoying my social experience of college as I did the past two years. I'm sitting at ~3.6 GPA and I feel at this point my GPA doesn't even really matter to me anymore considering the experience I'm acquiring and will acquire through the internships. Apart from wanting to be more social, I also want to keep moving in the direction of focusing on my own professional development to set me up for the best possible career track which could include doing things like joining another club/organization, spending time doing my own personal projects like learning how to code (which I'm currently enjoying doing in my IS class), etc.  I know I want to make a a change but I feel like I don't really know what I want and could use some guidance.

So overall, the question I have is: How do I make the best out of my remaining 2 years in college? Are there things you guys wish you did more/less of, or things you would have done differently that you can't now being in your careers? Should I stop focusing so much on school for now and focus on experiences?

This could be a general question to any subreddit, but having all gone through the same schooling, I feel like I will definitely relate better here. "

Meme is changing the narrative of her breakup. She is completely pushing the blame off of herself 100% at least on social media. 

She's been posting these cringey survivor attitude strong woman don't need no man (with a few depression/mental health posts which I would actually feel sympathy for if she was actively doing something to seek help, which you all know how that's going) all over her feeds. 

Guys. Guys. I just can't with this whiney toddler bitch. If I could i would link the posts but that would be revealing and I am not bothering to make an imgur account just to share this garbage of hers because I can't scrounge up the effort.

I don't know much about the relationship because it was none of my business but I can tell you what I physically saw. 

Now this guy she was dating for 2 years was a generally good decent man. Had a job, was going to school, but had a demanding justno family and because of that his spine was a wet noodle which was perfect for Meme. She walked ALL over him you might as well call him Door Mat. 

He lived a good hour away from us so whenever he came by he's either picking her up for week long excursions at his family's house or staying with us for a few days. Whenever he was here she made him pick up fast food for her, help clean her room, do her laundry, and cook for her.

Thats right. She made her full time student boyfriend, who was working 2 jobs and an internship, cook for her in her own home. And when she was over there she stayed in his room waiting for him to come home from work or classes or actually tagging along to his classes. (His parents got real sick of her hanging out there so much for some reason so she started feeling *unwelcome*) and I highly doubted she cooked a damn thing for him while he was gone trying to make his life better. 

And she would throw an absolute fit any time he couldn't drop everything and go to her or had to leave. Let's not forget that everything was paid out of his pocket since Meme was unemployed and that she couldn't take the vehicles because of mom and my boyfriend's work situations so he was forced to come pick her ass up every time, not the other way around. And she constantly complained about the distance and the fact they didn't go out on dates much because he's paying for his own schooling and car by himself. She never figured out herself that maybe getting a job and buying her own car might help the situation. She was more content to bitch and moan. 

Also, when he wasn't with her she forced him to call her and talk on the phone any spare moment he got, even forcing him to call after getting off late shifts or late night classes and she would give him shit if he forgot or fell asleep. 

One day I heard screaming and crashes coming from her bedroom. Turns out Door Mat had to leave because he had an important meeting at school and of course Meme wasn't happy that her slave was leaving so she started tossing shit at him, clothes and fast food cups and her depression meds (which she took at the time, don't know if she does anymore.)

Mom had to actually intervene and tore Meme a new one for acting like a child. I texted Door Mat after Meme had calmed down and told him that next time she pulled that shit to get one of us because that was unacceptable for her to be throwing things at him. 

You know what he said? ""Please be gentle with her, she's feeling unloved in the house.""

Guys. Guys. She has been grooming this poor boy into accepting this abuse. And you know what he did? He gave her an engagement ring after a year and a half of dating, even though the entire relationship had been unstable from the start. 

They broke the engagement off a few months later, claiming that they had been a little hasty and maybe a little ""too young"" for that kind of commitment but Door Mat stayed with her till nearly Christmas when he finally wised up. 

Of what I gathered he had a flat tire and since his family doesn't help him with anything he had to get it fixed himself. So he tells Meme he can't make it that day so instead of being a decent understanding caring girlfriend she blows up on him, nagging and screaming and pushing and she finally broke him. This poor boy was so tired of her bull shit and her impossible demands that he finally said ""I'm done.""

When Meme came down from her room screaming that Door Mat was no longer content to be stepped on all I could feel was relief that the boy got out. She threw herself on the floor, scream crying that she needed the car to drive over and fix it, that if she made this grand gesture she could convince him to stay (which was something she managed to do twice before). 

I pried her off the floor, plunked her on the couch and told her that the only thing she could do was stay home and leave poor Door Mat alone. I couldn't even hug her because I had zero sympathy for her. After I made her promise not to do anything stupid like take the car or self harm I left her to mom to deal with. 

They broke up a few weeks before Christmas and apparently there was a talk that they would remain friends, still talk to each other and have ""benefits"". He still took her to his family Christmas party so she could receive her gifts from his grandma. But apparently Door Mat must have shined up his spine cuz he is definitely not at her beck and call anymore. I don't know if he went NC or VVVLC but I haven't heard anything about him in the new year. 

Meme doesn't know what to do now that her man servant and punching bag is gone, so now she's convincing herself she didn't need him in the first place and that she shouldn't have to ""chase after him"" or ""keep a man that won't fight for her.""

Just wow, these mental gymnastics "

I'm starting to be really bored and tired of my current job and im thinking on moving on to the next one, but I don't know if my current experience is enough to move. What do you think? I'm going to summarize it:

* **1st Job | Desktop Support Internship | 4 Months** -
My roles here were basically to help with IT issues to a small number of employees (around 25 people). Basic stuff such as checking performance, outlook and office issues/configuration, Windows installation and desktop computers repairing. I also wrote some documentation for the users of how to use a CRM Environment, which was developed by my senior.

* **Current Job | Helpdesk Support | 6 Months at the moment** -
In this company we have lots of small companies who we do give remote L1 support and I attend issues such as Outlook account configuration through **IMAP/POP3** protocols, **Exchange** account configuration, **Backup** daily revision and maintenance(Cobian Backup, Backup Exec...), Account and group management in **Active Directory**, Password reset in different software, Mail account management of those domains we host, Network printers configuration and whatever issue that comes related to any kind of software, Windows  systems and servers, backup problems, etc... I'm not afraid to fight anything and if I cant solve it, ask for assistance to L2 Support before sending the ticket to them.

However, in this job our biggest client is a Cinema brand that has 45 Cinemas in Spain, and we give L0 support to all the customers of the cinema. This is 90% of our work and its basically issues about online tickets, money returns, questions regarding movies, schedules, promotions, complaints... It's really boring and i'm starting to feel tired about it. 

Do you guys think that 1 year is enough time to jump to a different helpdesk role where i do more IT related stuff? I could even get a recomendation letter from my boss since he told me he's happy with me. &gt;&lt;

Thanks a lot for your answers in advance!

can someone look at this and see if this an obvious scam and I'm missing something? it's a GPU that's worth £400-£500 normally, but they are selling it for £100. it looks legit from what I can tell, and might just be some intern having made a mistake. It's listed as new, has a 2 week return policy too.


It looks way too good to be true, but also there seems to be a bunch of people buying it at the moment. should I just go for it and worst case scenario get a refund?

A week has passed since the last and numbers are starting to slowly dwindle as the meta begins to calcify ever so slowly into a pattern we have seen for many months in a row. Still, there will be surprises ahead as things are  still shifting even if less so than before. 

---

**Runecraft**

Isabellas Runic Reign of Terror and burning rats continues as Runecraft hits 24.6% in playrate, now making up almost a quarter of all the decks played with a growing winrate as well at 52.3%, the highest out of all the 8 classes. Defiant and Unyielding she strikes down all before her as the most played deck.

[Burn Rune](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.3.6HkyA.6HkyA.6HkyA.6LZ5A.6LZ5A.6LZ5A.68_dc.68_dc.6A8t6.6A8t6.6A8t6.6Dz06.6Dz06.6Dz06.6PPgQ.6PPgQ.6PPgQ.6DwZs.6DwZs.6LbI6.6LbI6.6LbI6.6Dwa0.6Dwa0.6Dwa0.6A9bg.6A9bg.6A9bg.6Hs1I.6Hs1I.6Hs1I.6PNja.6PNja.6HpbC.6HpbC.6HpbC.6E0Aw.6E0Aw.6PSc4.6PSc4)

As always it is Burn Rune that controls all as this de facto Aggro deck tears through most decks with only Aegis and Ramp Dragon being amongst the few that can contain it's alchemical madness, because while it does struggle with some of the more control oriented matchups, it burns it's way through the rest with ease. Leading to a 53.3% winrate.

[Daria Rune](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.3.5-gkQ.5-gkQ.5-gkQ.6PQ9g.6PQ9g.6PQ9g.6A6Qs.6A6Qs.6LYrs.6LYrs.6LYrs.5-gka.5-gka.5-gka.5-gkk.5-gkk.6Cp_w.6Cp_w.6A8tG.6A8tG.6A8tG.6Lc0g.6Lc0g.6A9bg.6A9bg.6A9bg.6A6RA.6A6RA.6A6RA.6A6RK.6A6RK.6A6RK.6ADlI.6ADlI.6ADlI.6Dz0G.6Dz0G.6Dz0G.6E0Aw.6E0Aw)

This Sorcerous deck is making a comeback after months in the cold as Earth Rite took charge, but this spellboosted deck is able to make an impact in the current meta with a 50.4% winrate it is the 5th most played deck in the meta . Cheating out large followers via spellboost it can surprise many a deck and overwhelm them with it's magical hordes.

[Neutral Rune](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.3.6HkiY.6HkiY.6HkiY.6Hpb2.6Hpb2.6Hpb2.68_dc.68_dc.68_dc.6GdvI.6GdvI.6GdvI.6ODlM.6ODlM.6ODlM.68zBg.68zBg.68zBg.6CsCi.6CsCi.6CsCi.6KS2S.6KS2S.6Cpmm.6Cpmm.6Cpmm.6GgLs.6GgLs.6GgLs.6Cueo.6Cueo.694Vo.694Vo.694Vo.6Cuey.6Cuey.6Cuey.694Vy.694Vy.694Vy)

The least played of the 3, but seemingly even Neutral Rune is making an appearance relying on neutral synergies and really large finishers to blast it's way through the opposition with an almost 54% winrate. Thusly leaving Runecraft with 3 succesful archetypes in the meta, with varying degrees of popularity.

---

**Dragoncraft**

His eyes gleam with fire and madness as Rowen has seen the other side, being the only class that has a higher winrate going second ! With a 20.2% playrate and an overall winrate of 51.2%, Dragoncraft stands once more almost at the peak of the meta.

[Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.5_394.5_394.6I772.6I772.6I772.6PqHY.6PqHY.5_38w.5_38w.5_38w.6AaSQ.6AaSQ.6AaSQ.6KS2S.6KS2S.6EI-M.6EI-M.6EI-M.6EQIo.6EQIo.6EQIo.6AY0A.6AY0A.6AY0A.694Vy.694Vy.694Vy.6L-BY.6L-BY.6EQIy.6Cuey.6Cuey.6Cuey.694Vo.694Vo.694Vo.6Cueo.6Cueo.6Psjy.6L-BY)

The Second most played deck in the meta, almost as played as Burn Rune. With a 50% winrate, the deck is still pretty strong as it boils down to having a few poor matchups but plenty of good ones. But also being one of the few decks that benefits from going second which is down to Aiela, in fact there has been an increase in decks running goblin mage to increase their chances of pulling Aeila in time. Highlighting how vital to Ramp Dragon ramping actually is. In fact the mirror matchup has an almost 20% difference between going first and second, favouring second! Also importantly is that Ramp Dragon is also reported as storm Ramp, despite the two largely being the same at this point, which probably means actual ramp dragon has a higher winrate. In particular since Storm Ramp is shown as having next to no bad matchups if any atm. Meaning on the surface Ramp Dragon appears neat, but in reality is a psychopathic monster, like Rowen.

PDK Dragon in the meanwhile has been run out and has a less than 50% winrate.

---
**Shadowcraft**

The Skull throne of Luna looks less polished than before as fighting has only gotten harder, leading to a drop to 3rd place with a 15.6% playrate and a 48.9% winrate, technically lower than Swordcraft's class winrate. But She, Mordecai and the new Intern Cerberus are facing harsher odds than ever before in the current meta.

[Midrange Shadow](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.5.5zWm2.5zWm2.68_dc.68_dc.6Avi6.6Avi6.6Avi6.6EmHC.6EmHC.6IVXY.6IVXY.6IVXY.6MJgs.6MJgs.6MJgs.6MOZC.6MOZC.6MOZC.6Ei7Q.6Ei7Q.6Ei7Q.6Q8Io.6Q8Io.6Q8Io.6Avhy.6Avhy.6Ejr6.6Ejr6.6Ejr6.6QF8I.6QF8I.6IaQ2.6EmHM.6EmHM.6EmHM.6EojS.6EojS.6EojS.6Avhy.68_dm)

Midrange Shadow continues to be the one archetype Shadowcraft currently really has going on atm, same procedure as last year, throwing hordes of undead at the enemy and hoping to survive long enough to crush them, but with an ever increasing array of enemies targeting it and no other reported midrange shadow decks, it's 50.3% winrate is a lot more truthful, it to an extent relies on going first as it's winrate going second is in many cases poor. With an over 20% difference vs Midrange Sword. Midrange shadow is holding the line, but that is about it. No real experimentation has happened with the deck except some seem to try and sneak in Dark followers for the liches in again.

---
**Havencraft**

The Heavens and the Birdmen continue to strike down all those who oppose them, though it is not leading to amazing results for Eris or Garuda in the current circumstances as they in a 4th spot with a 51.8% winrate, but still solid results with their 12.7% playrate 

[Aegis Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.6N9tI.6N9tI.6N9tI.6Be5A.6Be5A.6JNhI.6JNhI.6JNhI.60COa.60COa.60COa.6Qv7o.6Qv7o.6Qv7o.6CsCi.6CsCi.6Q_zI.6Q_zI.6Q_zI.60E5y.60E5y.60E5y.6BjSI.6BjSI.6BjSI.6BgWy.6BgWy.6FX6M.6FX6M.6FX6M.6FZYI.6FZYI.60Bfi.60Bfi.6FZYS.6FZYS.694Vo.6KS2S.6KS2S.6Be5A)

The 4th Most played deck with a 53.8% winrate, Aegis Haven is laying down the law, with a really big immortal fist, able to beat the top 3 decks consistently albeit struggling with less played decks, Aegis haven is a formiddable contender in the current meta.

[Summit Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.6N9tI.6N9tI.6N9tI.6Qzmg.6Qzmg.6Qzmg.6JNhI.6JNhI.6JNhI.60COa.60COa.60COa.6Qv7o.6Qv7o.6Qv7o.6CsCi.6CsCi.6Q_zI.6Q_zI.6Q_zI.60E5y.60E5y.60E5y.6BjSI.6BjSI.6BjSI.6Qxpg.6NBqI.6NBqI.6NBqI.6Q_zS.6Q_zS.6Q_zS.6FZYS.6Be5A.6JJI2.6JJI2.6Be5A.6Be5A.6CsCi)

Not quite nearly as played as Aegis and with only a 50.6 Winrate, the more midrange oriented haven deck is proving to be a solid contender in the meta, dealing with the top 3 decks, but struggling vs some midrange decks, including Daria, Sword and Vengeance Blood. Relying on the summit to make it's durable followers hit hard, it's not looking to be going anywhere anytime soon.

---
**Forestcraft**

Stalking her prey in the deep woods Arisa is a relentless hunter alongside the experienced ranger Selwyn, Carving out their own little niche in the meta at 5th with a 8.1% playrate and a 50.1% winrate. They may not be as popular, but they can still hit their arrows with expert precision. Most of the time.

[White Wolf Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.fsMZQ.fsMZQ.fsMZQ.5zvAi.5zvAi.5zvAi.69O26.69O26.69O26.6OjUS.6OjUS.6OjUS.5zvvQ.5zvvQ.5zvvQ.6H0p2.6H0p2.6H0p2.6Ko0i.6Ko0i.6DEdM.6DEdM.6Ksv2.6Ksv2.6Ksv2.6DEdC.6DEdC.6DEdC.6KvLI.6KvLI.6KvLI.6DH3I.69SwI.69SwI.6KvLS.6KvLS.6KS2S.6KS2S.6KWwo.6KWwo) 

This control deck focused on stalling for as long as possible before tossing an elephant at the enemy (What's next, a cow ? A wooden rabbit ?) Is the most played Forestcraft deck with a 52.7% winrate. This control/combo deck is able to deal with a lot of the slower decks, but suffers to Burn Rune and Midrange Shadow but can deal with plenty of other decks.

[Neutral Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.6Gzts.6Gzts.6DEdM.6DEdM.6DEdC.6DEdC.6H5CI.6H5CI.6H5CI.6ODlM.6ODlM.6ODlM.68_dc.68_dc.68_dc.6GdvI.6GdvI.68_dm.68_dm.6KS2S.6KS2S.6KS2S.6Cpmm.6Cpmm.6Cpmm.6GgLs.6GgLs.6GgLs.694Vo.694Vo.6Cuey.6Cuey.694Vy.694Vy.694Vy.6KUzo.6KUzo.6H3Uw.6H3Uw.6H3Uw)

Barely hanging on at 50.6% Neutral forest remains a contender for Forestcraft  Relying on Neutral Synergies and the power of Forbidden love the deck relies largely on it's ability to beat Burn Rune atm as it struggles with most other decks.

---

**Swordcraft**

Step by Step, Inch by Inch, Swordcraft moves ever slowly towards a positive winrate, but this week is not it. With a 7.2% Playrate and a 49.3%  Winrate, Erika, Latham and Albert continue their quest for a positive winrate for the class with no accolades (playable anyways) in sight.
[Midrange Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.6LFJi.6LFJi.6LFJi.6HOkc.6HOkc.6HOkc.6LCtI.6LCtI.6LCtI.6LFJY.6LFJY.6LFJY.6P10S.6P10S.6P10S.6LCtS.6LCtS.6LHlo.6LHlo.6LHlo.6P3SY.6P3SY.6P3SY.69mSm.69mSm.69mSm.6P10I.6P10I.69rKo.69rKo.69rKo.6DabS.6DabS.6LG2Q.6LG2Q.6P5uy.6P5uy.6P5uy.69ous.69ous)
Midrange Sword continues to be the Prime Swordcraft deck with a 50.1% winrate, Able to beat the undead hordes of Midrange Shadow but getting devestated by Burn Rune and Ramp Dragon (though having an almost 50% winrate going second vs Ramp) Nothing has really changed since last week in the deck, some people continue to experiment, other use Agni's list. 

Aggro Sword it seems has finally been beaten and now has a less than 50% winrate all in all and is barely played. Control Sword on the other hand has somehow managed one, seemingly having a 60% winrate when it goes second vs Ramp Dragon, probably a fluke though.

---

**Portalcraft**

Yuwan and Nexus are not entirely sure what is going on as they continue to plummet towards the bottom, now the 7th most played deck and even that is by a miniscule margin and with a 39.3% winrate, probably not going to stick.

Midrange Portal can at most muster a 40% winrate. It's not looking good for Portalcraft. To say the least and the rest of the decks are not faring better.

---
**Bloodcraft**

With also a 5.8% playrate, Urias, Vania and Exella might soon have reason to feel a bit more pleased about themselves  even if they only have a 46.5% winrate, but things seem to slightly improve as Urias is sobering up, and probably not just because they will at least soon be better than portalcraft 

[Neutral Aggro](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.6.5zWm2.5zWm2.5zWm2.6CnKM.6CnKM.68_dc.68_dc.68_dc.6GdvI.6GdvI.6GdvI.6KS2I.6KS2I.6KS2I.6BFgM.6BFgM.6BFgM.5_p-4.5_p-4.5_p-4.6BIrA.6BIrA.6BIrA.68zBM.68zBM.68zBM.68zBg.68zBg.68zBg.6KS2S.6KS2S.6QWEC.6QWEC.6QWEC.6GgLs.6GgLs.6GgLs.6Iyqi.6Iyqi.6Iyqi) 

With an almost 50% winrate Neutral Aggro is almost a positive playrate deck for bloodcraft, relying on Neutral synergies in an offensive manner it pushes ahead relying largely on going first in the current meta.

[Midrange Vengance blood](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.6.6BFgM.6BFgM.6BFgM.6F3pC.6F3pC.6F3pC.6F6FS.6F6FS.6Ity2.6Ity2.6Ity2.5_pFg.5_pFg.5_pFg.6FB7o.6FB7o.6FB7o.6F6Fm.6F6Fm.6F6Fm.6IwOI.6IwOI.6IyqY.6IyqY.6IyqY.6QWyw.6QWyw.6QWyw.6BIrA.6BIrA.6BIrA.5_p-4.5_p-4.5_p-4.6KS2S.6KS2S.6KS2S.68zBg.68zBg.68zBg)

Vengeance seems to be returning.. WITH A VENGEANCE ! And a 52% winrate, not the most played deck, but it seems able to catch a lot of decks in the current meta by surprise with it's high amount of storm and agressive tendencies. Largely unchanged since the rotation with a few card changes here and there. Vengeance blood seems to be the go to deck for Bloodcraft.

---

Overall it's going to be interesting to see what numbers Cygames reports tomorrow when they post their card changes and reasoning for doing them. But also interesting to see how Ramp Dragon is suddenly benefitting a lot from going second. So while in some ways the meta is getting a bit stale, it is also still full of surprises as Vengeance blood is making a comeback. 

So hopefully there should be some exciting things to report post nerf.

7ryxba,3,2018-01-21,Looking for advice on getting a summer internship in something physics related.,gravat,PhysicsStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/7ryxba/looking_for_advice_on_getting_a_summer_internship/,"I am a 3rd student studying theoretical physics and I am looking into getting an internship for the coming summer. From speaking to my classmates, the majority of them who are applying for internships seem to be going for positions related to the financial sector. I am not very interested in finance and would prefer to do something more directly related to the work I do in university or something more programming related. In my search for an internship the majority of the opportunities seem to be in finance or the ones which involve programming seem to be geared towards computer science students (I don't feel that I would have enough of the prerequisite knowledge that they are looking for to be considered for the position). 


Does anyone know of types of internships that would relate closer to the work I would be doing in university? Or any good resources that you have used to find internship opportunities? 

I would also love to hear any general advice about obtaining an internship or your experience of doing one (Do you think it was a benefit to you? Did you learn much?)

Thank you in advance. "

7rznpc,8,2018-01-21,How to break into clinical dietetics?,ljt53,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/7rznpc/how_to_break_into_clinical_dietetics/,"I graduated from my DI in May 2017 with a Master's in Nutrition Diagnostics and over 1400 hours of clinical experience in a hospital. I have been job searching for over 6 months, and I am having no luck getting into the acute care side of dietetics where I really feel like my knowledge and skills are applicable. I live in Seattle, WA which I know is a very competitive market, but I just feel like it shouldn't be this difficult. The main problem, as I'm sure most new dietitians have face is that almost every clinically- oriented job that I have looked at or applied for requires between 1-2 years of clinical experience. I did start working in a nursing home on the skilled side but this position only lasted a few months due to the facility deciding to close down that service. I do have those few months on my resume though so I hope it will help as I continue to apply. I have applied to all of the major hospitals in the Seattle area. 

Like many entry-level job applicants, this seems like an infinite loop: no experience-no job, no job-no experience. If you are a clinical dietitian, I would like to hear how you got into your position. Did you score it right after your internship or did you have to start somewhere else? Did you have to know someone to get the job or were you just good at networking?

I'm starting to feel like all of my training in clinical dietetics is worthless and that I'm never going to get that break that will allow me to really start growing my career as a dietitian. 

Any advice is welcome! Thank you!"
7rzt0z,2,2018-01-21,[Review Video] Mr. Hitman - a mockumentary about a hitman.,SinJinQLB,youtubers,https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/7rzt0z/review_video_mr_hitman_a_mockumentary_about_a/,"I would like to hear all of your comments/critiques on this web series called Mr. Hitman. This is the first episode of the season, so we tried to set up the ""story"". Basically it's a mockumentary about a clueless hitman. Think the Michael Scott (from The Office) of hitmen.

Self review: I know the sound and lighting aren't the best. On one hand, it's suppose to look simple and low budget - basically as if the hitman hired a cameraman on his own dime. BUT, I also don't want anything too distracting. The quick paced editing is obviously on purpose, as I personally though it added to the hitman's erratic behavior.

The stories for each episode are extremely loose. The other episodes will have another character for Mr. Hitman to interact with (one episode has him hiring a ninja as an intern). BUT, it's basically all just a vehicle for Mr. Hitman and whatever character to just improv goofy stuff.

Since the episode it already shot, and reshooting isn't possible, I'm not looking for critique on picture quality (unless something is REALLY off). The sound I can still mess with, to a point. I am looking more for comments/critiques on the content, substance, editing style, and humor.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this!

7s0off,1,2018-01-21,I'm going to be 24 soon and I feel so stressed that I don't know what I want to do with my life,tobeornottobe_throw,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7s0off/im_going_to_be_24_soon_and_i_feel_so_stressed/,"So title yeah.

Basically, I do have a job working with special needs kids. I love my kids but it's not something I see myself doing forever. I've been at the job for over a year now, making money, but still living at home. I had all these dreams and I just feel like...I don't know....like I'm too old to start over? Even my younger sibling knows what she wants to do after graduation and I'm still at the same job I've been at since I graduated college because I needed to find a job.

Today my mom asked me what I wanted to do and I said I don't know and she was like well I need to put pressure on you to know now and we got into an argument and I am just so STRESSED OUT.

When I was little, I wanted to be a doctor. I mean, I guess I still do?
 It'd be nice because you'd make money and help people but idk...? I think I have the personality to be a doctor but passion? Not sure. My whole life I've been excellent in school - science and math - but there was always an inner artistic side that I feel like has never been allowed to come out. My younger sibling is the artist - always drawing and actually going to art school for it - and I was the academic of the family. And now I'm like...is it too late? I'm not into drawing but more into performance/acting/theatre and I adore museums and art history.

In high school, I got really into movies/tv/theatre (I got really into the behind the scenes, reading about costumes, music, sets, cinematography, etc) and was always too shy to do anything about it. Forward to college and I told myself I would take a theatre elective at least once. Just to try and check it off saying I did it. NOPE DIDN'T. Part of me is like....people of my culture/ethnicity don't see acting/theatre/entertainment work as successful and I don't want to get into more arguments with my parents about why I want to do it. I don't know....

Maybe I'll just take some acting classes? But can you just take acting classes willy nilly? I just feel really...unfulfilled right now. I get into these slumps of ""what if!"" and then I shoot myself down. 

I'm a curious person naturally - hell, I emailed my university's museum director asking for an internship because I was curious about museum behind-the-scenes conversation/exhibit setup/etc. But I don't know... I work now and I feel like it'd be weird for a 24 year old to be like ""Hey! I want to try acting!"" and just sign up for random classes with a teacher or whatever. Like I always daydream about what acting is like - not the glam or anything, but being someone else, scrutinizing the words on the page and putting into life words on a page... I don't know. I don't know.

Thanks for letting me word vomit."
7s10g2,5,2018-01-21,How to fix long-form Game Grumps,imperfectluckk,gamegrumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamegrumps/comments/7s10g2/how_to_fix_longform_game_grumps/,"It’s no secret that the Game Grumps are not exactly good at games. If they aren’t playing a game they’ve played all their lives or one that is mindnumbling simple to understand, then the typical session of gameplay usually ends with a classic “WHERE DO I GO?” or frustration with a games mechanics. This isn’t necessarily always a bad thing- many of the best moments of the channel have come from failing to play the game properly. There is also an argument to be made that one watches Game Grumps not for the gameplay, but for the comedic commentary. 

However, I’d argue that oftentimes the quality of the gameplay goes hand in hand with the quality of the commentary, particularly when the game in question is one that is beloved by many fans, as is the case with Paper Mario:TTYD. When it comes to games that are well known you have to remember that the Lets Play essentially becomes a reaction video. 

People enjoyed the Paper Mario series because they liked seeing Dan react to the game in the same positive way they had. People enjoy the Sonic series because it’s fun to see people shit on something that is legitimately awful. So when people are watching and they see them hate on something not because the game is bad, but out of ignorance, it gets people angry. 

It’s understandable that people find it funny sometimes when the Grumps struggle with basic game mechanics. However, when they play a game as long as Paper Mario that the fans expect them to finish, it is both in the interest of the Grumps and the fans for the general level of gameplay competence to rise so that A) they don’t get stuck in one location forever and get frustrated and B) you don’t get stuck with one game taking up a slot for 130 episodes. 

**Solutions**

So how do you solve this problem? One of the biggest things that causes the issue to begin with is not just being bad at games, but taking long breaks in between playing them. With games like Paper Mario it’s clear that oftentimes they go for weeks to months without playing it at all. This means that when they come back in they completely forget how to play the game and end up struggling mightily, having to pull out the(often useless) walkthrough to make progress in what are fairly simple games otherwise. 

The solution is this: **Have an intern or dedicated fan(paid or otherwise) create a primer for the longer games they play**. [I made a crappy mockup of what one could look like for the current playthrough of Paper Mario.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bV1UWA-L2hwR0Pv69sCN3ZG50qn7HNbFovvzgbL_ig/edit?usp=sharing)(This isn't even all of what I could or should include, but its representative of the kind of information that would be helpful). It’s fairly simple: before the Grumps start a new session of a longform game they’ve been playing, they would give the primer a read for about 2-5 minutes to catch them up to speed on what they were doing and what small things they could be doing better.

This isn’t meant to be for min-maxing: it’s meant to communicate to them as succinctly as possible game mechanics they might have misunderstood that the fans want them to know about. It would also contain information that would not only be useful where they are currently, but also for later in the game. It’s not meant to be a walkthrough- simply a way to get back to speed on how to play the game well. 

If this primer were correctly made and used, current longform series could probably be shortened by 10-20 episodes and also alleviate the common issue of the Grumps blaming the game rather than themselves. It would also hopefully reduce the amount of times the walkthrough gets brought out, which essentially invites them to turn off their brains and thus slow progress in the long term.

Other small solutions I’d like to see happen: when the Grumps do puzzles, they shouldn’t just immediately give up and get a walkthrough. This should be the one time where they do some editing and simply cut up the thinking process. Seeing them work through problems in this way would be a lot more satisfying watching them look at a walkthrough or flounder about for 10 minutes. It’s fun to see people think through a problem, so long as the uninteresting bits where no progress is being made is cut out. 

I think if there were a way for the Grumps to have someone make these Primers for them and if they would actually listen to them, a lot of the fan frustrations with gameplay would go down, and with less gameplay frustrations the quality of the commentary goes up!

**Tl,DR: Make a mini guide(primer) for the Grumps and have them read it before every new session of a game starts so they quickly get back up to speed on a game they might not have played in 3 months.**"

Well... Not recently. 2017 was the worst year of my life. I got out of my 2nd depression of the year in October, or at least was out of it and on the edge. Still picking up the pieces I fell back under on Christmas and now it's terrible. My pdoc increased my Latuda dosage this past tuesday and i allowed it as a last resort even though I eventually want to be med free. Now I got akathesia setting in.

I literally can't stop fidgeting and moving. At my internship if I'm not moving my legs all day, I'm rotating back and forth in my computer chair. I'm so restless. Even when I'm calm it messes me up. I tried to go back to doing art because despite being a big artist, I fell out of it while depressed and just do it for my job to pay the bills. Even with a brush stabilizer in Photoshop I could NOT move the pen smoothly no matter how hard I tried. I legitimately broke down because the one time I push myself to get back into it, I can't do it. That and constant dizzy spells that the pharmacy said would probably go away, are messing me up.

Like honestly, I don't know what to do. I can't even do art if I wanted to, which used to be a big outlet for me. Like I'm seriously fine with killing myself. I still have my note and plan, but now this is happening and I don't even know if it's worth it. Be miserable with akathesia forever and unable to do art (which is also my JOB right now) or be suicidal. It's freaking unbearable.

If I go off Latuda altogether, the next option is Seroquel which generally is guaranteed to cause weight gain. I'm already overweight and recovering from bulimia. If I take Seroquel, I'll most definitely go back to square one. Like I may not be bulimic anymore but I still have it in my mind that once I reach the 180 mark, I'm done. I'm struggling at 150 right now so that's not far away.

I just don't know what to do. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of depression. I don't want to try anymore because it either backfires or I just fall back into depression right away. I don't know what I'm asking here, to be honest. Maybe I just want to vent. I don't know. Sorry."

Upgrading RAM is not an option since it is a MAC mini, and thus not consumer friendly to upgrades.

What is your guys' strategies to testing out while you're programming? Do you just use your phone plugged in for 8 hours a day? What are the options?"

 * $950 monthly minimum to $80k with most loans at $1k-$5k with 3-5% interest though I have one at $20k with 6.75%.  
 * $350 monthly to $8k PLUS loan @ 6.96% - this account is paid ahead through April of 2020 I believe (I attacked it while I could before some life changes forced me to cut back).  I'm still paying monthly to this.
* **After bills/budget**: About $1k leftover per month (conservative estimate)
 
----------------
* **No retirement or other savings** (first in family to pursue higher learning)
* **Current jobs** are not full time, and thus no benefits/retirement.  
* **Starting Fall '19**, I intend on having a full-time position as an RD, in addition to the current part-time positions I hold so I will have more financial ability from then on and will double my $45k-ish income if I can maintain the roles.

------------

With the $8k I have sitting in my Checkings, should I switch that over to a Savings for the next 7 months?  I'm trying to get into the program that has a significantly lower cost of attendance @ $2k, but the other programs are $6k-$9k.

.

Starting Feb1, my leftover funds will be going back into my checkings to serve as an emergency fund.  I hope that when I move (also Feb1) that I'll be able to better save money as I'll have my own kitchen and will be able to prepare 100% of my meals (saving $50+ at least a month).  

.

Once I put together a 1 month emergency fund (completed by May1), where should the rest of my savings go?  Build to a 3 or 6 month fund?  Should I even worry about a retirement account until I get my foot in the door next Fall with my RD position?  [note I'm 28 years old]

.

Regarding my loans, should I keep my payment structure as it is currently?  I could technically stop paying the $350 monthly and add that to my savings for the next couple years, but that's my highest % account and it's one that I can directly attack (whereas the $20k, 6.75% account I cannot unless I pay atop my monthly minimum).  I imagine my extra leftovers from May to August should go directly into this (6.75% x $8k is much more than the 1% interest in a savings)?  Additionally, I'm hopeful that I can add an Adjunct course to this summer session from a local university (likely +$3k over the summer or so).

.

Thanks so much for your help in all of this, PF.  I have a lot of work to do, and I know it.  I can add more background or information as needed.

7s1xn8,0,2018-01-21,What does “I’ll let you know” mean?,Mintberry_Krunch,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/7s1xn8/what_does_ill_let_you_know_mean/,"There’s this girl that I’ve been hanging out with a bit and studying with recently. We met in a college bar last semester and danced and made out. We studied during finals week and it went great- we were smiling and laughing the whole time. 

We went back out after finals and we’re holding hands and dancing again, but I couldn’t take her home because her friend got into a fight with her boyfriend.

Since the semester started we have hungout twice, once at my place once at hers. All the signs are positive whenever we hangout: lots of eye contact and laughing/smiling, she seems receptive to my touch, and she even made me tea and let me try her smoothie she made when I was at her place. 

Note: I am a 21 y/o senior and she is an 18 y/o freshman.

The last time we hung-out I was planning on asking her out but her roommate was there as I was leaving and I didn’t want to ask her in front of her roommate. So today I grew a pair and called her and asked if she wanted to go get açaí bowls (she’s been fasting for her church and I thought she could still probably eat there). I called her and asked what she was up to tonight and she said something along the lines of:

“ I have a club meeting at 5:30 and I have class at 7:30 am so I’ll probably go to bed pretty early”

Me: “alright that’s fine but if you wanna hangout after chapter I’m down, we don’t even need to get food.”

Her: “alright I will let you know.”

I can’t help after all the signs she’s given me to think that she has some form of attraction to me. She knows I am a smart guy who has done pretty well for myself who also has different interests (i.e engineering major, internship, was on exec. of my fraternity, and I also love to hunt and fish). I’m not sure if we’re just at different stages in our lives but I don’t take her to be the girl who sleeps around a lot- we discussed religion briefly last time we hungout. 

So regarding the “let [me] know” line, I was gonna just not talk to her because the ball is in her court now. But is it naive to assume she’s just busy and might not have time. It’s been 3 hours and she hasn’t said anything. 

So wtf does “let you know” mean (from a girls perspective)? And does anyone have any advice on what to do with this girl?"

I have 4 years of serving experience(3 years in a privately owned restaurant that was extremely busy and understaff, 1 year at Olive Garden). I have done all roles in the FOH except managerial ones. I quit Olive Garden a few months ago because I am a junior Computer Science major at UC Irvine, so I had a ton of difficult courses and I was doing research with a professor which is essentially a job in its own.

I finished working with that professor and I have a lighter load for the rest of my time here. I decided to apply to places like BJ's, Cheesecake Factory, etc. as not only a server, but even as takeout. I have a lot more free time and I kind of need money, because I am tired of leeching off my parents.

I am filling out applications and applying to multiple locations of the above restaurants, but I can't even get a single response back. Not even a denial email or anything. What gives? I feel I am qualified enough. My availability is great. I am educated. I left my previous jobs on good terms. 

This seriously sucks. Since I am only a junior, I'd stay at whatever restaurant that hired me for AT LEAST a year, maybe two. (Yes I am going to intern in the summer with a technical job, but I am willing to work 2 jobs over the summer)

My resume is decent, because I had to create a resume for an upper division course and tailor it to a hypothetical job I'd want(I did it on some super fancy restaurant).


I just don't know what else to do. Any tips?"

(This post has a happy ending),cgoopz,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7s28ge/im_free_this_post_has_a_happy_ending/,"This is my first time posting in this sub so before I post the events of this weekend here is a little back story: 

I have no other way to describe my childhood other than it was absolute hell due to my Nparents. I have been LC with them for the past year. I was emotionally abused every single day of my life until I left home for college. This post would be entirely too long if I went into all the details but my parents are both Ns. Growing up they were constantly fighting and manipulating each other. My father used to throw dishes at my mother and strike both my brother and I. My older brother is the ""golden child"" and he is also an N. My brother often had his friends bully me on his behalf and teamed up with my parents to humiliate me. Since I was in middle school my parents and brother have always made comments about my weight and intelligence. I grew up being called fat and stupid every single day. (I am actually very healthy and I go to the gym 6 days a week, so now I know this is obviously a lie)  I was not allowed to have friends or leave the house except to go to school. As you can imagine all of this kept me from forming real friendships and social relationships. My mother is an alcoholic/ addict as well but she does not see an issue with her habits or lifestyle. My brother also has her addictive personality, so I was always their caretaker. The summer before I left for college I was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward. I've attempted suicide twice and battled disordered eating. My sophomore year of college, my depression/ PTSD got so bad I was only sleeping two hours a night while I was expected to take care of my mother and bother, as my mom had separated from my dad and was living in the same city as my bother and I at that time. Both Nparents are apparently ""happily married"" now and living two hours away from me, they were separated for two years and got back together. The main point of this post is that my parents used money to express control over my brother and I. They always used to tell me that I could never support myself on my own, budget money or pay my own bills. I am going to come back to this later. 

Over the course of the last 4 years, I joined a sorority at my college, met some of the most amazing (and not so amazing) people, worked an awesome internship, met my s/o and created the most beautiful, kick ass family I could ever ask for. I also graduated college with a solid degree and landed a great, well-paying job this past May. As of today I have been in therapy 5+ years. I haven't been suicidal in a very long time and my therapist is proud of the progress I have made. ( shes amazing and specializes in working with ACoNS) I am able to manage my emotions and mental illness and I feel very in control of my life, it only took tons of therapy, but hey I'm here. My s/o's family has taken me in as one of their own, they are aware of my family situation and they support me fully. I have a close relationship with his parents as they are just very sweet people. My s/o has also accompanied me to therapy and is overall just the most understanding, empathetic partner I could ever ask for. You know it's real when your therapist gives your s/o the seal of approval. I also have someone who I've met through my college who has become a mother figure to me in every single way. 

As I mentioned before, my parents used to use paying my bills/ expenses as a means to control and manipulate me. Well, after graduating I May, I took over all of my expenses except for one thing, I was still driving my parents car. However, yesterday, after saving up for six months, I bought my own car and started my own insurance policy!! I also gave my Nparents back their car today. I feel like a new person, I'm living my own life on my terms. I absolutely couldn't of done this without support from my little family I've created here in my city. I have dreamed of this day ever since I was a little kid. I am free and can go NC if I decide to. This has just been a beautiful day (: "
7s2ce2,9,2018-01-21,My mum is abusing my grandmother to get me back home.,notnuclear,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7s2ce2/my_mum_is_abusing_my_grandmother_to_get_me_back/,"Background:
I'm a 17 y/o Australian who recently moved to America to pursue my career in IT! In Melbourne the IT industry is pretty much dead so my dad pitched the idea to come. My mother and father are divorced so of course this leaves my mum out of the picture. She's not happy with this.


Now:
My mum is verbally abusing my grandmother (my dads mum), taking away her phone that I set up for her to contact us here. My gma called my dad crying saying she wants to go back to Sri Lanka (where she is from), but my dad can't pay for 3 houses at once, after all my mum doesn't support herself, she's completely dependant on my dad despite being divorce. So my dad does pay her expenses aswell. This is ruining this opportunity in America for me because I'm getting a software engineering internship at 17 and going to a community college before I finish my last year of high school here. 


If my grandma keeps getting abused, my dad will have to come home, which means I will have to go home, and to be honest with you, I would rather die than go back in that house. My mum is controlling, doesn't give me space, treats me like her property, and thinks I'm a loser. She has all my friends and me on social media, I tried blocking her once and she called me out. I feel like I'm trapped even though she is half way across the world. She's dragging me down even when she's not here. It's suffocating.


Not to mention I'm an only child (makes it a whole lot better lol). I don't want to go back, she's ruining everything. She's like an obsessive stalker, but she's my mother and I can never get away from her. Things are going so good for me here, better than ever staying in Australia, and my own mother is keeping me away from this opportunity. I understand she's hurt being away from me, but abusing my grandmother, telling all her friends I'm being stolen by my dad (even when he's the one paying for EVERYTHING for her) even though it was my choice to move.


Someone please help

I was with his family his afternoon. His poor mother found him dead on the bathroom floor. They knew it had to be drug related. They just didn’t know what. I was with them when the ME called to give his cause of death. He snorted some oxy and it was laced with fentanyl. They explained to his parents, he was essentially poisoned. 

The police are going to conduct an investigation and I’m hoping they catch and prosecute the sick son of a bitches who did this to him. They don’t know what they took from us. We are absolutely destroyed.

“Tensions continue to heighten after a statement this afternoon by high general Webster,”  Spoke the newscaster, her cherry red lipstick two inches above the microphone and concern pushing through the thick layer of powder on her face, her voice with a hard and forced edge.  The wind plucked at her otherwise perfectly brushed hair, threatening to pick apart the careful flow and pull the stands in its own direction, despite a near army of clips forcing it into place.

“General Webster,” She continued, her eyes flicking towards a still scene of political buildings that formed the backdrop behind her, “Has assured congress that we have entered an immediate state of distress.  The should war break out across the Atlantic, home forces are not seasoned or powerful enough to adequately answer the call.  He calls for more troops, for stronger individual to enlist, even for a draft.  Inaction, he claims, exposes our nation in a way that can only be described as a direct threat to our populace’s well being-”

“Oh can’t we ever watch something more entertaining?”  Exclaimed an exasperated Lucio, cutting off the reporter, and drawing my gaze away from the screen, “Like an actual movie for once?  If we’re all cooped up down here we might as well get some *culture* out of it!  I can feel myself starting to get boring.”

It was our fifth week in the subway station, and I drummed my fingers on my leg from where I sat on the garage sale purchased couch.  Lucio perched across from me on another garage sale couch, horridly mismatched with my own, as we watched a television that had gone out of style roughly ten years prior.  The subway itself had changed drastically since we first arrived, or at least the section we inhabited- tents were strewn across the concrete floor for each of us, pushed far enough apart to form small territories like rooms, each with a small collection of belongings to declare its perimeter along with hanging sheets for privacy.   The small kitchen had expanded after Slugger had found a small electric stove in an abandoned house and carried it back, his Momentive powers making it as light as a feather when he maneuvered it through the tunnel.  A few space heaters supplied warmth, their extension cords cris-crossing the area to a plug that Lucio discovered had miraculously still worked, and since we paid no power bill they were kept on high.  At its base, the plugs clustered like tree branches to a trunk, stacked on top of each other in precisely the manner fire safety presentations instructed *not* to do.

Slugger held a wet tennis ball a few strides away and was busy tossing it against the wall, whipping it as hard as he could so it spattered against the concrete.  He squinted, launching the ball to hit the same mark each time, and so far had only missed twice.  And with each contact, the ball made a slightly different sound as its weight was modulated, the mass fluctuating between a bowling ball and a marble, the distance of the droplets of water and violence of their shape from the impact region testifying the change.

“We have to see what they’re up to,”  I said, continuing to watch the screen though I’d lost focus, “We’ve effectively cut off any clues we have to what Siri’s and Peregrine’s people might do next.  I don’t even know where to look.”

“Yes, because they’re going to spill it out to you over the television as guests to a talk show,”  Lucio drawled, waving his hand that was filled with fluff he had been absent mindedly pulling out of the degraded cushion, “*Erm yes, I’m glad you asked!  World domination does happen to be a hobby of mine, stop on by on each Tuesday and we’ll have a chat over tea!  Positions open for interns and text the number below for live voting on your method of national destruction!*”


*Whap!* Sounded Slugger’s tennis ball, a particularly massive one, that splashed hard enough to throw flecks of water across my wrinkled brow.

“Well what do you suggest we do?”  I sighed, raising my hands.

“Not watch tv, *unless* it’s for movies!  Maybe we do another recon mission like the other night.  Spook the police a bit.”

*Whap*.

“We don’t want them to know they’re being watched, or else we’ll lose that advantage,”  I countered, “Besides, we can only learn so much from sending them false flags.  We need to know what they’re really after.”

*Whap*.

“Would you cut it out?”  Shouted Lucio at Slugger as he was sprayed with water, “Baseball’s not even in season, and that’s not even a baseball.  I swear you’re just doing it to annoy us!”

“Aye, and it’s working,”  Slugger responded, *Whap*, before walking over.  He dropped the tennis ball in Lucios lap and the boy doubled over as he sank into the cushions, the particularly heavy object pinning him down, “But maybe the two of you could learn a bit of something from some Baseball.”

“Like how to be a jackass?” Interjected Lucio, managing to squirm out from underneath the ball as it slammed onto the floor.

“Nah, I’ve learned that form other places and so have you, rawny as you are.  Reason I joined the team, remember?”  Retorted Slugger, then faced me, “There are nine players on the field in a game, but only one ball.  What do the rest of the players do when they don’t have the ball?”

“They wait,”  I said, turning away from the television, “Until it comes their way.”

“Right you are, lad.  They wait, but they’re ready.  I’m thinking you’re a bit eager- you’ve just hit a homerun, and yer ready for another pitch, but it’s the other team’s turn to bat.  But you’ve got to wait, or you’ll break the rules of the game, and that only helps the other team.  It’s time for patience.”

“Well you can’t expect us to sit here and do nothing,”  I protested, gesturing above, “Not while *who knows what* is going on up there!”

“I didn’t suggest that,”  He said, picking the tennis ball back up from the ground now that it had returned to normal weight, “But I do think it’s their turn to bat now.  And it’s time for us to start securing some outs so we can step back up to the plate.  Yer right SC, we need to listen, and do so carefully.  But Lucio has a grand point, as much as it pains me to admit it- the television will tell you nothing.”

“So what we need then is more listeners.”

“Aye.  More importantly, we need them in the right places.  When they hit a fly ball there needs to be someone there to catch it.  But remember, we’re fielding now.   With a power like yours lad, it’s easy to be cocky- but don’t fool yerself into thinking yer not defeatable.  The encounter with Peregrine sounded more like luck that skill.”

“Fine,”  I said, ignoring his last statement but knowing the validity behind the words, “We’ll need to start tailing them.  But which ones?”

“Old instructors, police,”  Commented Lucio, ticking off his fingers, “Maybe play Blake a visit.  Come on, Sc, let’s get creative.  Let’s have some fun.”

“Plenty of that still to be had,”  Said Slugger, rubbing his hands together, “When we escaped the facility, we thought it was the bottom of the ninth, and that the game was about to be over.  But really it was the bottom of the first.  And the game’s just begun.”

There isn't enough school work in the world that can keep me busy from 930am to 4pm with only two classes.

Mom, I just realized, I'm lonely. I thought moving back home after four years away would be good. I would get to see you and our family again and friends from high school only to realize that I'm not close to any family members and all my high school friends moved away for jobs. 

I like my program that I'm in for school. The professors are encouraging and helpful, the classes are challenging and include a wide variety of subjects I'm interested in, but the majority of my classmates are in their 40s and those that are closer to my age of 22 are established, married, and live too far. Even at work, I'm closer in age to the students I occasionally work with than my co-workers you went to school with. 

Is it selfish to consider moving back to where I got my undergrad because I know I'd have the friend support system that I'm lacking here? You and dad are so happy I'm back home, too, but I need friends. And I know you think it's to be closer to my boyfriend who I'm doing long distance with, but most of my good friends stayed there after graduation. 

I'm just realizing how truly alone I feel a few days ago and I don't know if I'm jumping into something because of that. Can you give me some advice mom?

7s3nb8,59,2018-01-22,Whiny Hoarder and the Extended Stay,sardonkey,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7s3nb8/whiny_hoarder_and_the_extended_stay/,"I wish I had a happy update. But right now I'm panicking and just need to get this out before putting on a happy face for FH and going to my internship and school tomorrow. 

FH is having some kidney problems again, (same reason he was on a strict low protein diet) and they're putting him back in the hospital for a couple days and on dialysis. 

He's going to miss his next neurology appointment, which was what he was waiting for before he moved. The appointment is being pushed back and they're saying since his neurologist is a specialist, and he's not considered high priority with her right now, the earliest she can get him in is the 13th. 

Whiny is PISSED. When she left the hospital to get him clothes she was texting him all kinds of horrible things, basically saying she hated him, he was messing everything up, and that he's just like his father and is always making things hard for her. Then she texted FAIL saying she can't stand FH, why doesn't FAIL let him live with her, and why can't they airlift FH to a hospital in his new city, no one helps her, FH abuses her, etc. 

She's usually on her best behavior at hospitals, but with FH in the hospital that means FFIL is going to be coming, and that's gonna be a whole other shitshow. She told FH if FH doesn't get FFIL and FSMIL banned from coming into the room, when he gets out of the hospital all his shit will be in the yard. UGH. FH doesn't want them there anyway, but he's on FFIL's insurance, and FFIL is insisting he goes to see FH. 

This is gonna be my week, guys! No idea how long FH will be in the hospital, not long, hopefully. Whiny will also be working this week so maybe it won't be so horrible. 

Apologies for complaining, just needed to calm myself down. 

Hope everyone had a restful weekend. &lt;3"
7s3qzs,56,2018-01-22,(Story) how a nice girl made me come out of the closet,Ak47Delta,Nicegirls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nicegirls/comments/7s3qzs/story_how_a_nice_girl_made_me_come_out_of_the/,"So once upon a time when I was 17(19 now)  I went to the local pool. I met this girl, let’s call her Michelle. Michelle and I hit it off almost immediately, we talked for a couple hours about everything, she was smart, funny, a little cute (5/10 but that’s not the point of this) and she was recently single. We exchanged numbers and we went on our separate ways. A few days later I asked her out to lunch (first dating expirence) and she said yes, we ate, walked and talked some more, and everything was wonderful. This was my first date with a girl, and I was super stoked! And then the texts started, I received 30 texts from her that night, and if I didn’t IMMEDIATLY reply, she would send another, and then another. I was thinking “ok so she’s a little neurotic, but I can be too” and I thought nothing of it (mistake 1). The next day is worse, and so is the next, and the one after that, she would always text thing like “hi” “we should talk more” and “what are u doing” although her most memorable text was a gif that said “I love you” and had a bunch of fruity hearts and shit, she said it was from her friend who stole her phone, I believed her (mistake 2). Finally I was having to set my phone in my room while I did anything because it was constantly ringing and buzzing from incessant texts. I muted her, the phone still lagged down from alerts, I blocked her, the phone crashed because it was shit. Finally I had had enough, and told her to stop, and she did, aaaand I was dumb enough to take her on a second date (mistake 3), where we kissed (mistake 4) that pushed her over the edge and the true insanity started, we met one final time and I took her on a long drive, where I told her everything about how I felt, and how she was a little overboard, but I still wanted to give her a chance. 
(All of this was over the span of maybe a year)

Now fast forward Six months, we haven’t really talked much because of school, and I thought she got the picture that we were done, I had seen her a few days before at a car show I was supposed to be covering (I got a job as a reporter intern at a local newspaper), and that’s when I saw her, I tried to scurry out of her way but she zeroed in on me and ran giddily over, I greeted her normally and we spoke for ten minutes, and then I had to get back to work, and I figured she would be sane and not text me like she had, she didn’t (do I hear mistake six, oh baby you know it)  but this time I had an iPhone that blocked her, and that was the end of that, until I got a text one night “hey, when are we going camping &lt;3” innocent enough right? No. I asked her why and she responds “well I drove by your house and I saw your camper.” She was trying to be cute, but we live on opposite sides of town, and I live at the end of a dead end road that is the last turn on a dead end road, she drove across town, turned onto a dead end street that has nothing important on it, and onto another dead end street that has nothing on it, to see my house. She tried to pass it off as cute but that was it, she kept on and finally I told her that I was gay, I figured that she was never going to stop until I told her it would be impossible to be with me, she responded with a sad “oh.... ok” and we haven’t spoken since, thank god.

So that is my story, what do you guys think? Was it good? Bad? Am I a terrible person?

Honestly she was also my last dating expirence, and I know this girl who really likes me... but I’m too scared to date her after this mess, any advice?? "

This is a work in progress, but here are some links to the original posts that ended up becoming AaM memes or just fodder for ridicule here on r/blogsnark:


**Placeholder Names:**

I did some custom searches and these seem to be the first appearances of the most-used names:

[Wakeen](http://www.askamanager.org/2013/01/what-was-your-most-cringe-worthy-career-mistake.html#comment-151163) / [Fergus](http://www.askamanager.org/2014/08/does-it-look-immature-to-ask-what-time-to-show-up-on-my-first-day-inviting-coworkers-to-a-wedding-and-more.html)

Pretty sure the *Game of Thrones* name/location references started with [this post](http://www.askamanager.org/2013/11/this-is-a-resume-and-cover-letter-that-work.html) where she changed a sample résumé to be all Throney. One commenter said, *Can I just say, I love how you change everything to a Game of Thrones reference. Kills me* ***every time!***...but I've searched all the common names and places from the show and nothing comes up prior to that day.

**Glossary**

**[Chocolate Teapot Design](http://www.askamanager.org/2009/12/great-question-to-ask-your-interviewer.html)\*, Rice Sculptures, and All Things Llama:** I'm still working on finding the Ur examples, but basically generic jobs letter-writers, commenters, and Alison herself use as placeholders when they want to obfuscate the details of their actual jobs.

\*This is the earliest searchable instance of ""chocolate teapots,"" yet it's in a comment that says, *I would have been so tempted to try to ferret out if they were an AAM reader. Give them the side eye and oh so casually drop the phrase ""chocolate teapots"" into the conversation and see if they react.* Yet I went post by post through the eight months prior to this and found nothing. I really think these people just make shit up for lulz.

**Primo/Sly/Doris:** Husband, late father-in-law, and late mother-in-law (respectively) of regular commenter [the gold digger](http://diaryofagolddigger.blogspot.com/) and frequently referenced by same. Very frequently. As in, almost every letter sparks a memory about the dead in-laws which we then get to hear about in minute detail.

**""Oof"":** Alison's oft-used expression for a tricky situation.

**Misophonia:** [A condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) with no DSM classification or diagnostic criteria which creates in the patient an intense hatred of sound and those who make sound. Every third commenter appears to suffer from it.

**""Could we not [verb]? Thanks."":** Frequently used admonishment by backseat mods in the comments section.

***The Gift of Fear*** and ***The Sociopath Next Door:*** Two books which get recommended any time the situation described by a letter-writer involves fear, loathing, general discomfort, or the possibility of anyone involved being a big meanie.

**Attractive female in a male-dominated field:** Every third letter-writer, apparently. May coincide with being the youngest in the office.

**[Borderline Personality Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml):** ""Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness marked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior. These symptoms often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships."" All the villains in the letter-writers' and commenters' lives have this.

**Cultural differences:** Every workplace interpersonal issue, from constant sniffling to unwanted sexual advances, could possibly be explained by this, so tread carefully.

___

**Things to remember:**

* [Ask a Manager bingo.](http://mfbc.us/m/vukbka) (Click ""New Card"" for more options).

* Every commenter self-identifies as an introvert, but many seem to be conflating introversion with [hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori). They prefer email and eschew telephone and in-person communication, but [even email can get too stressful](http://www.askamanager.org/2018/01/i-delay-writing-back-to-people-and-then-never-do-it-can-i-fix-this.html). Then it's ""breathe into a paper bag"" o'clock.

* Don't ever, EVER tap one of these people on the shoulder. They'll lose their absolute shit and possibly spill hot tea on themselves.

* It is always tea. There are no other beverages. [This](http://www.askamanager.org/2009/07/things-i-like.html) might possibly be the origin. Or they just want to sound all Austentatious and shit and tea fits that.

* Said tea is frequently prone to a Danny Thomas [spit take](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake) in response to the regular commenters' dad jokes. The alarming frequency with which this occurs indicates that many readers perpetually hold a swallow of tea in readiness.

* Every AaM commenter is woke as all fuck and don't you forget it.

* Every commenter is either a stick-thin waif who needs to shop in the children's clothing section and [can't get half a sandwich down without throwing up](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/11/my-manager-wont-stop-talking-about-her-romantic-problems-not-eating-at-the-office-christmas-lunch-and-more.html) (letter #2), or they're a size 40W and can't find clothes at all. There doesn't appear to be anything in between.

* Princess Consuela Banana Hammock remembers each of her 837 past lives and has a relevant personal anecdote for every situation.

* Everyone is allergic to something. It could be dogs, it could be peanuts, it could be semen. And these aren't ""my head hurts"" or ""I'm sick to my stomach"" allergies; these are ""anaphylactic shock and instant death if someone so much as *mentions* peanuts"" allergies. You never know, so be careful when you pack your lunch. Someone might [steal it and get his HR fuckbuddy to threaten your job](http://www.askamanager.org/2016/07/a-coworker-stole-my-spicy-food-got-sick-and-is-blaming-me.html). But then again, [this awesome update](http://www.askamanager.org/2016/10/update-a-coworker-stole-my-spicy-food-got-sick-and-is-blaming-me.html) could happen to you! Or...not, since there's no way that happened. Never mind.

* These people can't just have an aversion to something or strongly dislike it. Everything they don't like is a full-blown bug-the-fuck-out-the-end-of-days-is-nigh phobia. [All phobias](http://www.askamanager.org/2014/06/employee-is-terrified-of-balloons-wife-is-hitchhiking-to-work-and-more.html) (letter #1) must [be accommodated](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/04/employee-wont-come-back-unless-her-coworker-is-fired-i-dont-want-to-work-in-the-office-sick-bay-and-more.html). Except [this guy](http://www.askamanager.org/2014/04/my-coworker-blew-up-over-a-photo-employee-keeps-bugging-me-to-interview-someone-and-more.html) (letter #4), because fuck him.

* Alison very frequently deletes comments that are critical of her or her regular commenters. At least two of us have personally had her accuse us of sockpuppeting just because we happened to agree with a critical comment. If you think the comments section sounds like an echo chamber, it's good to keep in mind that she does this. (And it's pretty hilarious considering [this post](http://www.askamanager.org/2009/04/burn-your-bridges-girl-digs-herself-in.html) from 2009 where she criticized another blogger with *Personally, I think deleting comments is off-limits, unless they’re spam. If you're going to put ideas out there, deal with the response like a grown-up. Otherwise, why have a blog?*)

* In May 2017, Alison posted [A Decade of Ask a Manager](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/05/a-decade-of-ask-a-manager.html), and it links to some of the most-referenced letters.

**Enabling a Sexual Harasser**

Prior to, and for the first few years of Alison starting her blog, she was Chief of Staff at the Marijuana Policy Project. It did not end well:

[*The Breast Massage Will Happen: Inside the Culture of Sexual Harassment at the Marijuana Policy Project*](https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/the-sexist/blog/13118659/the-breast-massage-will-happen-inside-the-culture-of-sexual-harassment-at-the-marijuana-policy-project), an article about Alison's handling of sexual harassment complaints against Rob Kampia, then executive director.

I can't ever seem to get on GOMI, but apparently [Alison made this comment on her own thread there ""explaining"" what had really happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drlhki1).

[My reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drlj4hg) to that, since it just sounded *so* familiar.

Alison's [recent explanation](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/12/something-personal.html) of what happened at the Marijuana Policy Project, which (a) she admitted she posted because she was contacted by a reporter (most likely prompted by the recent spotlight on these problems due to \#metoo), and (b) differs quite a bit from her old explanation on GOMI. Comments were quickly locked.

And the comment chains where we here at the weekly thread discussed her post, the comments, the locking, and so on.

1. [OOOH! Alison is addressing her history defending a workplace sexual harasser. I know this is a totally GOMI comment, but... I wonder if she reads here? Brb, popping popcorn.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drh5br3)

2. [Alison addressed the elephant in the room: her sexual harasser boss at the MPP. It's really interesting to hear her take on the whole situation. I'm glad she wrote this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drh5f02)

3. [Also, from the personal post regarding Alison’s former workplace, Alison had closed comments ""temporarily,"" then added this, closing them indefinitely: ""Just a note that I'm going to leave comments turned off on this post for now. This is a post where if they're open, I want to be able to engage in a meaningful way, with real time to think and respond properly. I hope that makes sense. There's been a lot of very helpful discussion and I want to take some time to reflect, but anyone with questions about this is welcome to email me directly.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drkjvao)"

7s5ova,34,2018-01-22,GDS3 Essay Questions,GoldenSandslash15,magicTCG,https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/7s5ova/gds3_essay_questions/,"So, I know a lot of you non-GDS3 people have been wondering what the essay questions for GDS3 were. Unfortunately, the terms and conditions did not allow for discussion of them until the deadline to submit them had passed.

Well, now that the deadline has passed, we can share them.

On January 16 2018, GDS3 participants received the following email from Wizards Customer Support:

&gt; Hello,

&gt; Let me be the first to officially welcome you to The Great Designer Search 3 (GDS3). Here's what going to happen: contestants will compete in three initial trials to become one of the top eight finalists. The top eight will then participate in five design challenges, from which we will chose the top three finalists who will travel to Wizards to compete in the Live Challenge.

&gt; The first trial will be a series of essays (more on this in a second). The second trial will be a multiple-choice test. The third trial will be a design test. Not every participant will advance from one trial to the next. You will be informed at each stage whether you have advanced to the next trial or whether you've been chosen as a contestant.

7s5ywn,5,2018-01-22,[23/F] Boyfriend [24/M] used the word faggot in a hurtful way which doesn't align with my views at all,ThrowIt2DaLeft,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7s5ywn/23f_boyfriend_24m_used_the_word_faggot_in_a/,"Throw away account and on my mobile. 

So, basically I've been dating this awesome guy for almost 3 years. Everything is going well. Met in college and fell in love. He is so loving and always seemed accepting of others. 

In middle school, I went to a school where a white kid who was 13-14 shot another student in class because he was openly gay cross dressing minority who was also 13-14. The shooter was basically a white supremacists in the making and his family weren't the best people in the neighborhood. The gay kid was in foster care. Both students didn't even have a family unit to rely on which hurts because kids, regardless of sexuality, need a support system that accepts them and are willing to talk about these subject to help relieve the tension that arises around this issue.

In college, I was openly bi and was a representative on a cabinet for an LGBTQ- recreational campus organization. I loved that club. I probably would have dropped out or felt unwanted if I didn't have that organization to support me and keep me focused on the bigger picture. My senior year, I got a job as a LGBTQ+ initiative intern. Basically I just advocated, hosted groups/events and basically acted as a support resource for a student who seeked other student's support. I loved my job and I was very open about it 

My boyfriend has always been there for me and my ambitions. He attended my events, helped step up for a local drag show that brought in over 2k people and raised funds for scholarships for LGBTQ+ students. He seemed VERY willing to support the community. 

Now, jumping to today (1.5 years later), and he said to me, ""I just feel that Gays are Gays and Faggots are Faggots"" 

...yea, I was pissed. When he said it, I immediately stared at him and he got mad that I was mad at that comment. He then justified his comment by saying that our mutual friend who was gay would say that. As if that made the comment ok. The reason why it hurts so much is because he knows how I feel about that word, he would never tell that any to our male openly gay feminine friend and this word is used as a weapon to oppress men to act and behavior is 'acceptable' 

We got into a short argument but then dropped it. It's just truly upsetting that he would say something like that. I don't even know what he meant by that. He seemed to actually enjoys Pride Festivals and Drag Shows but now I'm questioning if he was just tolerating it so he could be with me and now that I'm less involved in the community, he feels he can say those things. 

And what if he does legitly think this way? It's kind of a big deal to me that he is accepting of all LGBTQ+ without judgemental stereotypes blurring his vision from realizing that this is a human being with the same emotions we do and they walks in fear because they know they are not welcomed, they are in danger of attack and will always get side glances. I'm not sure if im overthinking this and this is just a comment that was said but I just wanted to know how do you accept your partner's views when it completely insults your belief 

Thank you in advance."

7s6juj,2,2018-01-22,I'm 19 and my parents are still very overprotective,beautifullungs,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7s6juj/im_19_and_my_parents_are_still_very_overprotective/,"I'm a woman btw. I'm from South America, it's very uncommon here to move out when you start college. My parents pay for my college and my income is very low because I only work as an intern (it's important to consolidate my career in a science field). My parents, mostly my mom, have always been very overprotective of me, I didn't get the same teenage experience as my friends and don't go out as often as them. I was raised very strictly, I didn't start going out and making the friends I have to this day until I was 16, and after years of stuff like monitoring my social media and cutting off all of my contact from friends they didn't like I have some sense of privacy now. Growing up in this household, I turned out to be very shy and anxious, to the point that I struggle &gt;a lot&lt; to even lie to my parents, which makes everything way more difficult. I also have been depressed since I was around 12, I'm medicated but I don't go to therapy anymore. 
All of this really sucks, because I think that I'm a really prudent person. I study and worry a lot about my academic and professional future, always get good grades, never been clubbing or anything like that, don't drink or use drugs that often... and yet they mistrust me so much. I really don't know what to do.
Something that makes this all of this weirder is that I study in a different city (the capital), while living at a 40 min drive away from it. All of my friends live there, so all my social life is all basically there, and my parents worry too much when I go out, even when I'm doing stuff like watching movies at my friends' houses, so I don't exactly have a curfew but they always expect me to get home at like 11pm, and will be aggressive and forbid me from going out or something like that if I disobey. They usually won't let me sleep at friends' houses and ask their phone numbers before I go out, because they want to be able to contact them if there's an emergency. As I'm financially dependent of them, I always follow their rules – if I confronted them and they stopped paying all my expenses, I'd probably have to drop out of college and have a full-time job commuting by bus, which would take more than 4 hours of my day, and I wouldn't be able to work doing what I love. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I really want to succeed professionally and academically, so I always abide by their rules. It's just a very suffocating situation. I don't want to move out or anything like that, I don't want to live alone, I don't want to be more depressed.
This affects me on many levels; classes end in December here, and start again in February. Most of my friends don't even ask me to go out with them anymore.
It was a little easier for a little while last year, when I had a boyfriend in that city and spent a lot of time there – my parents knew him, he'd spend some weekends at my house too, and I even got to sleep over at his house a few times, after insisting &gt;a lot&lt; with my mom. We broke up months ago, and dating's been hard now because I barely get asked out and know my parents won't let me go to guys' houses. And I really don't want to lie to them, I'd worry about it all day, in fear that they would find out. But this guy that I really like and I have gone on a few dates, and he's very sweet and polite and is excited about me coming over but it's been 2 weeks since he asked me and I've literally frozen in fear of even asking my parents (if it's not clear, yes, I basically have to ask them to go everywhere)... And he's older than me and has a normal relationship with his parents so I don't wanna be weird and tell him about how my parents are yet. I feel pathetic, all of this makes me so anxious.
To top it off, we don't really have a good relationship. They never say they love me or are proud of me, I feel like a burden all the time for worrying them and them having to spend money on me, even though it's what's normal, culturally speaking. We pretend mental illnesses don't exist as well, and my mom has had depression and panic syndrome, so I guess you can't imagine how that goes. We can't talk about anything serious and, honestly, I want to do it less and less each day. I don't tell them anything in fear of it becoming a fight, I don't ask them to pay for therapy because I feel like a burden, I haven't gone out in weeks because I don't want to hear a negative response that could turn into a stress-induced fight. And the weird thing is that I can't even do what I want when I tell them I'll pay for it. I told them I wanted to buy Radiohead tickets and I'd pay for them (the concert is in another state, I'd travel with my friends) and they flipped on me at the littlest sign that I wanted to do something with my own money. I didn't even look up the tickets again because I'm so tired. 
Sorry for the really long vent, I just don't talk to anyone about this at all, even though I stress about it all day. I hate being anxious about everything like this. Please don't be mean and say that I'm stupid or tell me to ""just move out"" or ""not tell them where I'm going and spend a weekend wherever I'd like"" or whatever. I know it's a pretty shallow problem but I really want to become independent and have a good relationship with them, even though I don't see how that could ever happen."
7s7ads,3,2018-01-22,"Huge mood swings, confused and desperate. Can anyone relate?",CorruptHawq,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7s7ads/huge_mood_swings_confused_and_desperate_can/,"Sorry for the long post or if I'm rambling, my head is feeling heavy and I'm tired.

Friday 2 weeks back I felt worse than I have in a long time. I got extremely nervous, anxious and scared after coming home from school. After that weekend I suddenly had a burst of energy and I felt like nothing could stop me. I was talking to girls, making them laugh and left a party contently after a few drinks (I usually get completely wasted looking for some sort of relief), I felt like I was gonna fight my way through anything that opposed me and have a blast while doing so! But yesterday evening (sunday) I was back on the bottom again... 

This is what my life has been like all 19 years of it. Whenever I find mental stability, get to know people, make friends and get into rhythm something comes along and overthrows it. This time it's a 16 week long internship during which I won't interact with any friends or peers at all. Other people seem to view these sort of things (internships, new schools, moving etc.) as interesting challenges from which they can gain something, but I never managed to get that perspective. 

I'm 19, never had a girlfriend, balding and not very attractive overall. I used to weigh over 225 pounds but I managed to lose that weight 2 summers ago. The insecurities that my weight gave me didn't disappear however. They were just replaced by other worries.

Can anyone relate to this? People always say life as a teenager is supposed to be tough and that life will bring you to your knees if you let it etc. but that doesn't exactly change the way I feel. Should I feel like this? Sometimes I feel so low that I get very scary thoughts... I hate having thoughts like that because I sincerely love life. I love music, nature, science, learning, laughing and having fun with friends, you name it. But my life seems to exist on a foundation of anxiety and desperation with occasional bursts of happiness and enjoyment rather than the other way around..."
7s7n4f,1,2018-01-22,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7s7n4f/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door."

7s8eab,6,2018-01-22,Is COOP for Computer Science worth it?,throwaway120394323,CarletonU,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarletonU/comments/7s8eab/is_coop_for_computer_science_worth_it/,"Any COOP Comp Sci students here who can tell me if COOP is worth it? What do you get for all the admin fees and work term fees? Do you get access to job boards that are exclusive to coop students? Is it easier to find an industry job if you're in coop?

Provided, I have really high grades, can I just as easily get an internship if I have completed several side projects or made contributions to open source projects, without having to be in coop?

Sorry for the rant but it seems like it costs a lot of money, some of which apparently subsidizes career services for non-coop students. In addition, I can't stand COOP 1000, having to sit through common-sense, obvious, platitudes about job search. Here I am wasting an hour / week going through these online presentations, being talked to like a 5 year old. Seems like a total bullshit course.

Would I be just as good or even better off if I drop out of COOP and focus on putting together a good github profile?"
7s8tpg,1,2018-01-22,Desperately need help with lower back pain..,lonelystowner,AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/7s8tpg/desperately_need_help_with_lower_back_pain/,"Hello everyone,

I am not sure if I can post this here, and if it is not allowed please let me know and I will remove this post. I am looking for advice or some help with lower back pain, as I’ve exhausted many of my options with no success, and I don’t know what to do next. I am truly desperate.

**Backstory:**

I am a relatively healthy 23 year old male. I’ve been athletic all my life but only began really caring about my fitness when I was 21 and in college. I went from about 110 lbs to 140 lbs and was in the best shape of my life. About 20 months ago, I was doing legs at the gym and hit a PR on the leg press. No pain and no problems. I wake up the next morning with the worst back pain I have ever experienced. I can barely bend and I can’t get to my classes for the day. The pain does not go away for weeks so I go to my family 

**Treatments:**

Fast forward a few months later, and I’ve been to my family doctor (prescribed painkillers and muscle relaxers), which did not help. I was then referred to get an MRI and it turns out I have two bulging discs in my lumbar spine. Pretty much any bending of the back causes me pain. I was then sent to physical therapy where I worked with a therapist and some interns and after 8 weeks of core strengthening exercises and lots of stretching, I am referred back to my doctor as I am seeing no results and no reduction of pain. Doctor then refers me to do PT at a new location, since I was moving to a new state. I complete 4 weeks of PT at the new location, doing mostly the same exercises. After week 4, the PT requested I get a new prescription, and do a few weeks of PT in water instead of on land, and then do more land PT after. I did this, and 12 weeks later I see no reduction in pain. PT then sends me back to the doctor to seek a different treatment, as my core strength improved and so has flexibility, but still no reduction in pain. All of my PT was stretching of the legs and back, and core strengthening exercises. Again my strength and flexibility improved, but there was zero reduction in pain. After countless weeks of PT, my doctor sent me to a chiropractor to help. I did several sessions and the chiropractor told me he did not believe my issue would be fixed by what he could do. I am now being sent back to my doctor.

**Current Situation:**

My back still hurts, pretty much 24/7. This is now 20 months later of pain, and quite frankly, it is driving me crazy. I am 23 years old and I spend most of my time not able to do anything too physical with friends, family, or my S/O. As someone who used to be very into the outdoors, sports, and getting into shape, it absolutely sucks not being able to participate without lots of pain right now. I really want to get back in the gym, but even doing lightweight exercises can cause lots of pain during the exercise, or just after. I have spent several months not working out and quite frankly it makes me feel super lazy. During those months I did my PT, and my at-home PT stretches. The only other thing I do is the stationary bike, as that doesn’t affect my back nearly as much as running or elliptical, and I also do some beginners yoga. At this point I am willing to do absolutely anything to help my back. I have been passed back and forth between doctors to no avail, and I just have no idea what to do next. I feel like ive been passed around so many times, being told the same stuff every time, and I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try to get to my doctor again, with how hard it is with my work schedule. Until I can change over my insurance next time there is open enrollment at my work, it will remain very difficult to get to the doctor.

I am looking for advice on what to do next. Do I go back to my doctor? Do I wait until I can get proper insurance and try a spine specialist? Are there exercises that I can do while I have an injury like this? I would do anything I need to, to make my back better. I just don’t know what to do next. I’ve never been so frustrated by something in my life. I feel like I am being robbed of my 20’s, as I can’t do many of the things I love to do. Any advice?

**TLDR:**

I hurt my back 20 months ago, presumably from not having perfect form on leg day. I have 2 bulging discs in my lumbar spine. I have done months of physical therapy, I have been to a chiropractor, and I have been given pain killers and muscle relaxers. Nothing has helped my back and I have pain from any bend I do, along with sitting or standing for too long. It is incredibly difficult for me to get to my doctor, until I get new insurance, hopefully in the next few months. I don’t know what to do and I need help. I will do literally anything to help my back, I just don’t know what I need to do. I feel like I have done so much and have made zero progress, and it is the most frustrating thing I have ever been through.

Any advice is welcomed. Thank you. AMA"

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I have nothing to market myself with. I wasn't part of any clubs on campus, never applied for internships (knowing deep down that on paper, I'm not really an appealing candidate) and I regret it all so much.

I hate how competitive life is. I wish I could go back to when I would naively spend all my time reading books and studying subjects I enjoyed, without worrying about having to take care of myself or my family.

7sb6b6,2,2018-01-22,Advisory from private accounting difficulty,Jtr90,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7sb6b6/advisory_from_private_accounting_difficulty/,"So I wanted to know how possible it is to get a job in advisory with a private accounting background and how much different advisory is from audit.

A little background, I did an internship and worked with one of the big 4 for 6 months and worked through their busy season. I ultimately decided not to do audit because I just found the work to be soul crushingly boring.  

I decided to go into private accounting because I really do like accounting but the thing is I find that private accounting gets very repetitive after a few months because essentially every month is like the last one after improvements to processes are made. I am currently sitting for the CPA and think that the next thing I want to do is some sort of advisory services. The dilemma is a lot of the job postings I see for advisory say they prefer audit experience and I want to know if I would still be seen is a qualified candidate with my CPA and private experience only. Also, if they want audit experience does that mean that advisory is a lot like audit or do they just like the skills that ex-auditors can bring to the table (detail oriented, being able to coordinate with a team, meet pressing deadlines, etc.)

TLDR: Is advisory more interesting than audit work? Would it be difficult to get a job in advisory with a CPA and a couple of years experience in private accounting at a large company? 

Thanks in advance for any insights/ advice you may have!"
7sbqgy,1,2018-01-22,Back to counseling (#21),MilkThyPeg,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/7sbqgy/back_to_counseling_21/,"Last semester was a really dark time for me. All the stress from the previous semester, non-stop working over the summer, trying to balance my classes and cross country season, worrying about my senior capstone, slightly freaking out about graduation and getting a real job after, and dealing with my second rejection in a year just destroyed me mentally. Doesn't help that I usually have a perfectionist attitude and I compare myself to my friends who are handling themselves pretty well with their classes, jobs, internships, extracurricular activities, and social lives. My self-esteem was basically non-existent and I had a mental block that prevented me from doing school work and other things I enjoyed. After I met with the director of the Honors Program and broke into tears, we decided the best thing for me would be to go to the free counseling services at my college. It took about a month and a half for me to finally get assigned to a counselor but once I did I made sure to go to my weekly meetings with her. Even though I do have a good support network of friends, family, teammates/coaches, and advisors in both athletics and the honors program, I felt I needed this because each of those groups can only help me in one way or another whereas my counselor was a completely separate third party who knew nothing about me and got to learn as we went on and she is trained to help people instead of my friends/everyone else I listed who would try to give me advice but aren't qualified for it.

I opened up to my counselor and I felt like I could be 100% honest with her because she isn't there to judge me in anyway. I think it helped going to counseling because each week I was determined to bring her at least one piece of good news that I managed in the time from the previous session. There were still days where I felt the pit of darkness in my stomach and nothing would motivate me, but I would tell her about those to and we would just talk about how I can do better moving forward.

When the semester was finished and the break started we didn't meet. Today was my first time seeing her in probably exactly a month so I had a lot to catch her up on, both good and bad. We talked about my grades (especially the fact that I got an F in one class), my plans moving forward in my final semester, the stress I'm feeling from my dad about finding a job when he doesn't know about me wanting to be a dog trainer, the holidays and seeing my brother for ten days while he was on leave, and about my confusion about whether or not the guy I like has mutual feelings. I didn't even notice before my session that I was feeling tense but after talking to her I was able to just relax and leave school feeling good. I'm going to continue meeting with her through this semester and I hope to rebuild my self-esteem and confidence since I'll actually be able to see her for the entirety of the semester and not just a handful of times like last.

I know the PSA is redundant, but honestly if you feel down or like you have nothing going for you, try to find someone to talk to. It really helps so much and you are 10000000% worth it. Let someone help you.

Have you ever felt the need to go to any type of therapy/counseling services?

How have you gotten over a really dark patch in your life? (If you have; if not, are you working on it?)

Is there anyone you feel 100% comfortable talking to about anything and everything?

7sbtr5,3,2018-01-22,Graduating engineering: To live with my parents (home) or go out of state?,Algorithmism,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7sbtr5/graduating_engineering_to_live_with_my_parents/,"Hello All,
To live with my parents or live alone*:

For the past few months I have pondered on this decision for a while. I have never asked anyone about it, so I'm banking on the reddit community to help me out.


Some background: My brother and I always aim high and are high performers in every aspect in our lives. Being first-gen Americans, we don't necessarily live in an area where the society respects talent and growth, but rather glorify drug dealers and rappers to an extent (suburb). We've internally decided to avoid being a statistic over the years, and by the grace of God we avoided the life sucking trap of our city.


My mother and father have helped me to get to where I am today financially. They have helped pay for my college with the intent that I would pay them back. Same goes for my brother. My father works as a supervisor and my mother as a medical assistant. They do not come from an educational background. My father, however, has lived a very tough life when compared to US standards of what a tough life is defined as by society.


My brother has recently graduated and accepted a phenomenal job outside of the state, and declined a very good job offer near the area where we live. When this happened, some details about the thought process of my parents were indirectly revealed to us. My brother was verbally attacked for not wanting to live with them and accept a nearby job after graduation. My mother used guilt traps and said things like ""don't you feel bad for your dad who worked hard to get you where you need to be?"", ""didn't we get this house for you guys?"". I felt bad, but didn't understand at first. They don't outright communicating their needs and expect individuals to understand what they need, indirectly. Like solving a riddle. If someone doesn't solve the riddle, they blame the person not themselves (in some cases).


Later, these verbal attacks finished and my brother went out with friends. My mother then tried to persuade me to stay when I graduate. She said things to me like, ""don't you feel bad for your dad..."" etc. etc. She now is extra nice to me when I come home.

Now, the key here is this- I have no problem helping my father out financially in the future, but I do not think I can live with my parents for a long period of time. Since I've attended university (in-state) and lived outside of the house for two years, I've become my own person. I've grown substantially to become the person I am today. I've built habits which make the quality of my life better. Every time I come home, I love my family and treat everyone well, but I feel a negative vibe as if something is draining my energy because I feel very misunderstood. Also, it was never told to my brother or myself that when we went to college the intent was for us to stay home and help my dad out. He always said he was doing well and the deal is we would just have to pay him back for college. We never thought he was only doing this for us to stay home.


To put the lifestyle thing more simply, examine this scenario:


Everyday, I wake up to a list of things I need to do and the exact timeframe in which to do them. Say, for example, I decide to read between 1-2pm. When I get to my apartment and read, I have no distractions- no noises, no unnecessary requests, nothing. I read, learn, and do just that. I want a life of continual learning and I am actively seeking it.


At home, when I decide to do something like this, my time is never respected. Apparently, reading is not something people are supposed to do in my household. It isn't a glorified quality. I personally do not watch TV anymore unless it is for sports, and TV is a huge thing with my parents. A lot of loud arguments happen at times where I need it to be quiet. Family members come in and out at unexpected times. I am asked to go to family gatherings on the DAY OF the gathering, no further notice, and am bashed when I refuse. I can't really say anything about it because if I do, I am never respected and the same thing continues. If I wake up at a certain time, my mother, a light sleeper, will wake up to see what I'm up to as if she's trying to investigate a crime scene... If I wake up at 8am or 9am on a weekend, they ask why I'm up ""so early"". I take care of myself in all ways except for tuition costs at the university, which I express utmost gratitude for. In the summers, I intern for very good companies to try and pay my tuition.


A very key thing here is my entrepreneurial spirit. I truly want to take some time to get to know myself more in my 20s. I want to explore, try new ventures, and perform to my highest ability. The home is TOO comfortable for these things, and the city it is located in lacks growth.


I've always highly respected my parents, but it just seems that my lifestyle is completely different than their lifestyle now. Again, I have no problem helping my family financially in the future. I would love to visit my parents once a week or so, but I don't think I would want to live with my parents because they have a completely different lifestyle than me. Even if I had a job in the same city, I would live in a condo/apartment for this reason. I am also currently in a relationship, so I don't know how date nights would work.


Am I being absurd, or should I live with them? Please critique my character wherever you see flaws or anywhere you think my thoughts are wrong. I hope I articulated the message well enough for everyone to understand. I might edit it in the near future. These were just my most critical concerns of living at home. Other things are tl to explain. This is just the surface. tldr is a necessary abbreviation to summarize the post so I will use it in this way.


P.S. I very confident that I already have 2 in-state jobs lined up for software engineering and software development.


TLDR: Should I live with parents who impose their lifestyle on me, or should I live alone for my own personal growth in my 20s? 

Please give me honest answers even if their brutal. 


Sincerely,

Algorithmism"

I will try to keep my story shorter than I normally do.  I broke up with my ex girlfriend on November 20th for various reasons, mostly having to do with me.  For awhile, I was borderline depressed due to being in school stuck in a major that I wasn't a huge fan of.  I decided to stick it out because I only had a year and a half left.  Fast forward to this fall and I just didn't feel like myself.  My ex was super super sweet, always showed compassion to me, and just generally cared about me in every way.  However, during my spiral of sadness, I had this gut feeling that I had to find myself again and let go of some things that I had.  I knew I was moving when I graduated in December and in a way, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to really figure out what I wanted from life.  

It killed me to break up with her.  I broke down in front of her, knowing that I was breaking her heart.  At first I felt free and confident with my decision.  Keep in mind, I had really thought this through and sought help from my sister and close friends.  However, after time has gone on, I find myself missing what we had together.  Not just the physical connection, but how we got along daily with each other.  I took a risk by giving that up I know.  

Fast forward 2 months to now...I feel much better with myself.  I successfully landed a 6 month paying internship, I've lost weight, and I feel much better now that I am out of school.  Now that I have really fixed some things in live, I really wish I stuck it out with her and had just been more honest about where I was at with my self.  I needed self care...it worked, but I am seriously missing her.  

I've been writing down my thoughts every day, trying to pick apart my emotional thoughts from my ACTUAL thoughts.  At the end of the day, I really want to try and rekindle things with her.  I know it won't be easy and she can easily deny me now.  

My question for you all...is it okay to contact her now?  We have been 1 month NC and it's been 2 months since the BU.  I'm worried if I wait to long, she will move on and I will have thrown any chance I have away.  However, I do have a really strong feeling that she won't want to get together again.  Not sure why, I just do.  

Dumpees, would you find it appropriate for me to contact her with clear intentions and genuine thoughts about how I feel about her?  

TL;DR - I broke up with my girlfriend 2 months ago.  After fixing some things in my life, I want her back.  Should I contact her now with genuine intentions about rekindling our relationship?"

I'm a 20 year old male, I've dated a bit here and there, but nothing recently. I'd really like to date more and have downloaded/used tinder and gone on one date and get a reasonable number of matches. 

That said, I haven't dated for the past year. Partially out of being busy (engineering student, etc) and partially out of not really having the confidence to pursue people in real life. But, here's the thing.

It's always been somewhat of a preference of mine to like curvier girls. I don't mean like fat fetish or anything, I mean, just, curvy/thick. That's all fine, but what I've noticed is that I don't think I can get turned on by thinner girls at this point. I still find them ""cute,"" but I'd be honestly worried that anything in bed with them wouldn't work for me. And currently, working at an internship with more free time and tinder-usage than usual, that's limiting my options so much that I still match with a good number of cute girls, but don't have any desire to message the majority of them. 


Is feeling this was just discovering my ""type"" in a normal way, or should I, well, stop getting off to curvy girls at night and hope I can find attraction in more of the population?

I've just been thinking about it the past few days and wanted to get it off my chest. Thanks guys."

7sdpyi,1,2018-01-23,How do I [22M] stop living in my previous relationship's shadow?,SomeBuggyCode,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7sdpyi/how_do_i_22m_stop_living_in_my_previous/,"Hi all, I just wanted to preface this by - I've very rarely posted on reddit and this is coming from the app too so I apologize for any mistakes.

So, I'll start from the beginning and work chronologically.


About back in 2014, I met this girl at a job of mine we both happened to work at. She was a year older and in college, I was still in high school and a senior. We both came from different backgrounds but at beginning in the relationship we seemed to have similar views. She was Asian and had a fairly ""Asian"" upbringing (not trying to stereotype, that just the only way I know how to communicate it) and always was pushed in academics/extra curriculars. I on the other had had a fairly ""Average"" white Christian boy upbringing, parents weren't super involved unless I got in trouble (and somehow I got into it a lot at school in elementary). Regardless, a pretty easy childhood especially because once I entered middle school my mom left and all that I had was a dad whom was pretty checked out until this day. He's much more involved now but I now looking back didn't get as much support to push me to strive in school. 

---

Back to early 2015: during the fall we got to know each other a bit better and hung out most weekends. I knew somewhere that I liked this girl and we eventually moved onto being an exclusive couple. We were pretty much in the honeymoon period during the spring and summer so there wasn't much to report in regards to negatives. So starting in the fall she took quite a load of classes at school and we still hung out most weekends and video called each other almost daily. Not much to report either except we somewhat started to probe deeper as to what each other thought and were like as people and I'm guessing at this point we both slowly started to get a picture. In the spring and summer we went on plenty of dates mostly within the city and I worked full time and overtime but we both made time to hang out. 

---

In the fall is when things became a bit more difficult. So I came to find out that during her time of the month and before sometimes too is that she got very volitile in regards to her emotions. Not volitile in the sense they were up and down, they just always seemed down. I found out that she had doubts about our relationship for a variety of reasons and not many of them seemed rational (not a bad thing or that they have to be). Such as she ""just didn't know if it would last"", very general statements such as that. There was one times that she broke up with me during the fall and then we subsequently got back together. During Christmas she cut contact completely and we went on a break from talking or anything. (I know it wasn't just because she wanted to have fun with guys or something, she's an extremely loyal and earnest person). A week after Christmas she said she ""thought it through"" and thought it'd be okay to go back to dating. I'm not sure as to what her factors were at this point. So we had the New years together and that went fine,we both loved having each other as company as well. More so in general too that when we weren't arguing about something stupid (which was maybe 2% of our time spent together) we were literally each other's best friends and loved hanging out.

---

So going on from the New Years, I feel like I could briefly summarize the spring. We broke up and got back together 2-3 more times until mid summer when we were supposed to be going 'no-contact'. I think it was just a random message from her but that snowballed into me seeing her (in another state) during an internship of hers and then again. We got back together. I would say that the middle to end of our entire relationship was wavering from excellent highs to lows and separation (all on her end). Much of her breaking up was a myriad of reasons in which I'm sure I don't know them all to this day. Some of them were: her parents disapproving because I didn't go to the same prestigious university she did, her small circle of friends she lived with questioned as to ""why"" she was dating me, a lot other reasons were more general such as whether we would make it until after graduation, or another was - because I didn't go to such a prestigious university as she did, my chances of getting into a grad school the same as her were lower. I could list maybe a hundred more reasons but I don't even know which are real because at the end of our relationship she said some she just made up so we could stop.

---

I'll be honest, I wasn't the best boyfriend. I was quite an immature child at times in regards to social awareness and painfully acted in ways my father did to me (acutely narcissistic and controlling). I at times was very controlling as to not what she could do but that I wanted to know what she was doing all the time. I'm sure there were a few more things than that but those were my biggest personal problems.


So, with that picture of what our relationship was like I'm sure you're wondering what my point is.


My point is this: ever since our last break ups I have had the issue of feeling that I'm not achieving enough in life and I always am disappointed in myself for not doing better and getting more. Only from Meditating on my own have I seen that I've been living in the shadow of our relationship. I feel like my biggest mistake in life is not being good enough to have made the relationship work out because of my status in regards to my school, or job. More recently I've been extremely stressed because I recently got an offer for a *really* really good research internship but even with that I internalize that I'm not doing good enough because I'm not researching at the top universities of the nation (shouldn't receive offers from them until April). 

Edit: **tl;dr** - I never feel like I'm doing good enough in life because of my past relationship's expectations. 

That's why I'm making this post, I hope someone can give insight as to how to move forward. If you feel like you're missing a detail feel free to ask or PM me."

7sen56,2,2018-01-23,Met a girl,theepicstoner,OnlineDating,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/7sen56/met_a_girl/,"Hi guys looking for some opinions on the matter. 

So far in 1 year have never had luck with online dating. I've had girls ghost me, lead me on, date me once then say they have other plans for future dates, troll me, not show up to first dates, etc. Left me feeling pretty unsatisfied with the whole online dating thing. 

Move along till recently. Met a girl online that is doing a internship abroad. We seem to be kicking it off, I was cautious at first being playful/funny but it turns out she is looking for something serious, which I am also looking for. We seem to click and share similar interests/values. However after having talked a little online she started sending me hearts, using affectionate terms for me and saying how shes been looking for someone like me for a while. Now given my past online dating experiences I take this with caution as I'm not sure if I am going to be catfish Ed or trolled, or smthg. 

But we have been exchanging multiple pictures and she seems genuine. 

In my experience hearts and deep conversations come after a first date when you have had a chance to meet the person etc. Has anyone else had experiences where a relationship starts with some sort of deep online connection before even having a first date? Did you have anything left to talk about on the fist date after this? Was it slightly weird? Did the first date feel like you were just continuing the ""relationship"" you started online? Or did you go about retaking about all the stuff you talked about online and like confirming it if that makes sense? 

Please give me your thoughts and experiences on this :)

7sfjam,13,2018-01-23,My [24F] long term boyfriend [25 M] and I broke up because he needs space after a long history of him cheating,sidneymae,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7sfjam/my_24f_long_term_boyfriend_25_m_and_i_broke_up/,"I've never posted here but I've been reading reddit for months lurking and have found a lot of comfort in reading all of your stories and responses and I figured it was about time I posted my own. 


Background: I had a relationship from age 15-19. We broke up and two months later I met this new guy - I was in a rough state. I was going through my first heartbreak and wanted attention from anyone who would give it to me. 

It was junior year of college, and it was halloween. We met out and it's a typical college story where we meet and hookup on an off for the remainder of junior year. I find out in May just as we are leaving he was hooking up with other girls the whole time too and I had also hooked up with someone else, and that's how our relationship began. We had a talk about if that was okay or not, and what we wanted and we decided to start dating. 

That summer we both intern and live in NYC but my life has always been relatively easy. I'm smart, come from a family with enough money to be able to provide what I need to be successful and have always made friends easily. He comes from a very broken and distressed family and had no financial support in his life except himself. He grew up with a single mother, who did everything she could for him growing up, but he never saw what a solid relationship would look like. 

Fast forward to be 2.5 years out of college and still both living in NYC trying to make it work. We're now both in great jobs and live nearby each other, both with friends from college. We both have progressed successfully in our professional lives. I found out last January he had a long term hookup going on behind my back, but he begged and wanted to make it work so I stayed. I did not hold it over his head although it did lead to mistrust on my end. I would avoid plans where he wouldn't be able to come because I started to feel like if he wasn't with me on a Friday/Sat night then he must have been cheating on me.

I let him get away with it, I didn't cause too much stress on him and basically took him right back. I rarely would fight back and would be super submissive to his anger because I was always afraid of making him more angry. 

Problem: We broke up six weeks ago (December 10th). We got in a fight because he wanted to go out with his friends and ditch our plans, and I wouldn't be allowed to go. He broke up with me over it, next morning he calls thinking it's fine and just a ""hiccup"" and I hold my ground saying no, I deserve better. We have been through a lot together, some details I feel are too personal to put out to strangers on the internet even, but he has always been there for me. He broke up with me because he says he is not good enough for me, that he loves me but knows I deserve better. We have a connection that I find difficult to replicate with other people. I go on dates and find it difficult to connect with a person in the same way I do with him. 

He reaches out quite often and tells me he misses me - I've seen him twice since the breakup and both times led to spending the night together and it making me so happy when I'm with him but angry at myself when he leaves. 

I'm not worried about finding another person to be with or being alone, but I'm worried about finding the same type of connection we had right off the bat because I often find it difficult to connect past surface level with the men I date and with him I have never felt so in love with someone and the desire to be around them so much. I also want to note - that since we broke up, I have felt okay and I go out with friends and do my thing and I do feel moments of happiness. Sometimes I feel like I should be sadder then I am, but part of me still wants to give the relationship a try. Some days I feel so relieved to not have to worry about him as much as I used to and the days where we don't talk are the ones where I feel most as peace. But the second we talk, it's like I can't imagine my life without him.  

I guess my question is - am I completely insane if I want to give this relationship another shot down the line? Or should I start the process of complete NC and move on for good?

TL;DR: Relationship of 4.5 years ended 6 weeks ago, rocky relationship with infidelity, do I let go?"

I have a lot of trouble with painting small details too.  I imagine it won't survive the kiln, so you'd have to do the detailing pass afterward, but using a set of colored Sharpies or Micron pens has been really helpful to me.


100% with /u/GipsyJoe on blocking sections during glazing, too.  Painters tape can also be a real sanity saver.


Keep it up!:D  Minis are fun! ^(Sooo fun!)

&gt;I’m busy prepping lighting gear for the upcoming Kenny Chesney tour, super excited since it’s my first year-long national tour! :)

:D  That's awesome!  What're your duties on the tour - is light prep such a big part of the show that that's your whole role, or are you general prep pre-show or running lighting support through all stages of the show?  How did you get into a job like that?

&gt;I’m a dimmer tech for the Stadium shows, so me and the other stadium lighting techs are going to be building/getting power + FOH control to the lighting fixtures that go all the way around the bowls of the stadiums.  Last time I counted we’re using ~36 Robe BMFLs  and 40 VL3500Wash (both super cool powerful moving lights) for our stuff :)

&gt;During college I tried to get an internship as an *audio* tech at the production company I work for, but lighting was all they had open at the time. So I said screw it, I need an internship for this class I signed up for (lol). Cut my teeth hard starting from scratch but they’re finally sending me out :D

&gt;

Hahaha I've made a whole career out of ""Hell, why not?"", so I guess we're screw-it buddies.  Congrats on finally being released out into the wild!:D


How big are those lights?  I tried googling them and mostly got product shots that don't really show scale, but it looked like some of them are twice the size of someone's head? o__o


What's the cadence like for a tour like the one you're on - is it generally a show every day or two?  How much of the lighting is pre-installed in each venue vs. things you have to shlep from place to place and set back up each time?  How much of the light show is pre-programmed and how much of it are you guys controlling on the fly during the show?  It seems like it must be a super packed schedule.\^^

&gt;Thank you :)

&gt;They’re pretty big  dudes, [this is a BMFL compared to me working on it](https://imgur.com/a/mHc8R). 

&gt;A lot of the show is programmed during rehearsals, where the LD and the console operator will build looks and cue lists to use for the various songs. They’ll have the songs in a list something like this (varies for each LD):

&gt;1. Blackout
2. Intro
2.1 Intro Big Hits
3. Prechorus
4. Chorus
4.1 BIG CHORUS

&gt;Etc...

&gt;But there are executor buttons and faders you can map on the console if you want to manually add movement or strobe or color, whatever you feel in the moment. 

&gt;Every venue is different, so when the rig is up and built the LD usually has a night or two to go through cues and make adjustments to their show. When I did Kenny’s 2 Stadium dates last year in Foxboro we’d stay up until 2-3AM watching the FOH guys program and drink in the stands haha.

&gt;It looks like most of the dates on the schedule are going to have 2 or 3 days to load in. Hopefully we get it down to a science after a few weeks and can crank it out in 1-2 days.

&gt;Everything we use for the show comes with us so there’s no discrepancies between venues, we’ll have probably 6-7 semis full of Staging, Lighting, Audio, Backline, and Merch.

&gt;Woooooooooo

Man that's so interesting, thanks for taking the time to answer all of that!  Sorry for peppering you with so many questions.\^^


And I just realized... please tell me BMFL is short for Big Mother-Fuckin' Light.&lt;3

&gt;Oh it absolutely is known as that for sure :D

&gt;But when the Robe representative came to our shop in Nashville he called them the Buy My Fuckin Lights hahaha

Both of those make me tremendously happy. XD

On Saturday, I got the heartbreaking phone call that one of my best friends, the person I was dating off and on for 5 years and the man I loved passed away. 

I texted my boss last night telling her I’m not going to be myself, I want to come in and I want a normal day. I gave her this warning because some of his family members know people in the department. I was afraid I was going to walk into 50+ people knowing I’m a grieving girlfriend. 

I put my big girl pants on and I went to my internship today. The moment I saw my boss she gave me a look, I bawled. She gave me the biggest hug. She shut the door. She made me sit, she sat there until I spoke. She asked about my support system. She asked how I’m doing. She told me how strong I am. She was amazed I had enough in me to make it here today and still do what I needed to do. It was a full blown therapy session. 

Who would have known, a woman who has known me for a week would open up and let me pour my heart out. I am SO thankful for everyone IRL and on reddit right now ❤️❤️ they’ve made these past 4 days just a little easier. "
7sgljr,2,2018-01-23,John Gill,adam46a,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/7sgljr/john_gill/,"Hello, for my 9th grade English class I had to do a research project of my choice. So I decided to research John Gill and what his effect on christianity was. John Gill was a calvinist theologian who was also a baptist pastor. John Gill was born the 23 of November 1697 in Kettering Northamptonshire and attended Kettering grammar school. There he learned Greek and Latin at a young age.  John Gill became an intern at age 21 and then started his profession as a pastor which lasted 51 years. In his time he was the first baptist theologian to write as much as he did and his texts are still relevant today. I think that John Gill was an important theologian because he influenced many people. As a pastor he had contact with people in preaching his calvinistic views and in his excerpts from the bible he highlights that we are saved by god's grace alone which I think a lot of people agree with. So I was wondering what you guys thought about him being an influential theologian. And also do you think John Gill was a hyper-calvanist?"

As Camila Cabello's highly-anticipated debut album is released, several of her songs debut on the chart this week. Too bad our gay twunk Troye Sivan has blocked Camila from getting her new #1 as 'My My My!' increases two spots on its second week. 

On the topic of Camila, the highest charting song of hers 'She Loves Control' debuts at #2, making the song this week's highest debut. Other debuts include 'Into It', 'All These Years, 'In The Dark' and 'Inside Out', charting at #4, #6, #7 and #8 respectively. 'Never Be The Same' charts at #3 on its sixth week while 'Havana' returns to the top 10 on its 24th week at #5. Also returning to the top 10 is 'Real Friends', which increased 26 spots to #10, making the song having this week's biggest gain.

BØRNS has the highest re-entry song this week as 'God Save Our Young Blood' featuring Lana Del Rey re-enters the chart at #26. Unfortunately for Cardi B, 'Bartier Cardi' is this week's biggest decline, losing 34 spots to #46. Gladly, she has last week's #1 song that is the remix of 'Finesse' by Bruno Mars charting at #9 on its second week.

* **Highest Debut of the Week:** #2. Camila Cabello - She Loves Control	
* **Highest Re-Entry of the Week:** #26. BØRNS - God Save Our Young Blood (feat. Lana Del Rey)
* **Biggest Gain of the Week:** #10. Camila Cabello - Real Friends (+26)
* **Biggest Decline of the Week:** #46. Cardi B - Bartier Cardi (ft. 21 Savage) (-34)

##Other Noteworthy Charting Songs:

'Consequences' and 'Something's Gotta Give', the remaining songs from Camila's self-titled album that were left out of the top 10 debuts at #12 and #13.

Aided by the release of their music videos, 'End Game' almost made its way to return to the top 10, charting at #11 while 'IDGAF' charts at #14. Will the songs still have a chance at having a new peak once the Camila hype dies down?

Speaking of Dua, 'New Rules' still remains strong despite not charting at the top 10 anymore as it increases 24 spots to #17.

The new song from Lesbian Jesus AKA Hayley Kiyoko 'Curious' debuts at #15.

Camila is not the only artist to release their new album as BØRNS has songs charting this week from his new album 'Blue Madonna'. Aside from 'God Save Our Young Blood', 'Second Night Of Summer' 'Sweet Dreams' and 'Faded Heart' debuts at #27, #45 and #49.

~~Twenty One Pilots~~ The Chainsmokers' surprisingly conscious song 'Sick Boy' debuts at #28. Will we see the song increase next week?

Lastly, the national anthem of /r/popheads made its return to the Hot 50 as 'Run Away with Me' re-enters at the bottom of the chart.

7shl0r,1,2018-01-23,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A compendium of prompts to entertain your free time,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7shl0r/mas_a4fas_a_a_compendium_of_prompts_to_entertain/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
────────
Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

So I decided to research John Gill and what his effect on Christianity was. John Gill was a Calvinist theologian who was also a baptist pastor who was born the 23 of November 1697 in Kettering Northampton shire and attended Kettering grammar school. There he learned Greek and Latin at a young age. John Gill became an intern at age 21 and then started his profession as a pastor which lasted 51 years. In his time he was the first baptist theologian to write as much as he did and his texts are still relevant today. I think that John Gill was an important theologian because he influenced many people. As a pastor he had contact with people in preaching his Calvinistic views and in his excerpts from the bible he highlights that we are saved by god's grace alone which I think a lot of people agree with. So I was wondering what you guys thought about him being an influential theologian. And also do you think John Gill was a hyper-Calvinist?

***
Lilacs and sunflowers waved at the edges of my sight, framing a perfect, cheerful sky. I pushed up onto my elbows. I was on a slight rise, and the gorgeous expanse of purple and yellow stretched deep to the horizon.

“Welcome to hell,” said someone.

I swiveled on my butt. A great, crinkled boulder blinked back me. A pair of vines flopped at its side, one appeared wrapped around a book. The eyes were uneven and bulbous, and a gaping crack along the base seemed to be a mouth.

“Pardon me?” I said.

“Welcome to hell,” it repeated. “Mister Louie Tant, yes?”

“Yes? Hell? What?” The last thing I remembered a squishy leather couch, the TV playing infomercials on mute, Robin and Garth making out in the love seat, and big empty bowl of chips on my belly.

“Hell!” said the rock-monster. “You know it right? Oh, don’t tell me they don’t do hell in your planar reality.”

“Am I dead?” I better not be dead. I had finals in two weeks.

“You’re Louie Tant.”

“I… okay this is all very confusing.” I got up and looked at my hands, squeezed them into fists. It all felt real, then I remembered dreams. This was a dream! Usually that realization snapped me right out of it. I waited, but nothing happened. The monster regarded me.

“Confusion is common, I believe. It’s supposed to be disorienting,” it said.

“This doesn’t seem like hell,” I said, now wondering if Garth had spiked my joint with anything. It wasn’t his style, but sometimes you could buy a bad batch.

“It doesn’t? Why not? I followed specifications to the T.” The monster raised the book up with its vine and wiggled it at me.

“I’d always heard there was a lot more fire, and suffering, and you know… uh,” I said. A gentle breeze wafted in, and some butterflies danced with it.

“Fire?” The boulder now rifled through the book, its eyes darting, brow wrinkling. Little crumbling landslides of dirt crunched off it.

“Yeah, what’re you, new?” I said, pinching at that tender spot on the backside of my bicep. It hurt. I did not wake up. Could I legitimately be dead?

“Listen Mr. Tant, I may be an intern here but I will be treated with respect. I’m sure there’s a reasonable explanation here somewhere.” The pages flapped and fluttered.

“Intern? What are you an intern at?”

“Department of Human Trafficking, Third Circle of Hell, Tower of the Freezing Mists,” it said.

“Human trafficking… look man, I don’t— I never participated in any shit like that, alright? I’m a freakin’ freshman at UNC, studying chemistry. Like, where would I, there’s gotta be some kind of mistake.”

“Now you’re confusing me, Mr. Tant. Why would you be participating in human trafficking? That’s my job.”

“What? I… look, can I uh, maybe speak to a supervisor? There’s been a serious mix up, I feel.”

The monster open its mouth to reply, but at that moment there was a great purple flash, followed by the smell of sulphur, like someone lit a match then blew it out.

“What is the meaning of this?” cried a new voice.

“Oh, oh dear,” said the rock.

A host of green floating orbs emerged from a tall gathering of sunflowers. They dripped something evil and toxic. I backed up a step, looking between the monsters.

“Well?” said the orbs. They pulsed as one as they spoke.

“Hy’Tqluuui-nok, s-sir. I was just processing this human,” said the rock.

“Processing? On what authority?” said the orbs, whom I presumed were Hy’Tqluuui-nok.

“I, thought… I thought you could—”

“Silence! Had you bothered to attend orientation instead of futzing around, you might’ve actually learned something. What do you suppose human trafficking even means?”

The rock blinked, its mouth hung open.

I ventured a tiny step forward. “It, uh, isn’t it like slavery and like, literally trading people?” I said.

“You see? Even this inconsequential speck of a soul knows what’s what,” cried the orbs.

“It’s huge issue,” I continued. “Really terrible, evil stuff. The things they do are just…”

“Thank you,” said the orbs. “We run a tight ship of misery and horror. Usually.”

The rock shrank back, perhaps trying to make itself seem smaller, which was tough because it was a rock.

“So can I like, maybe head back? Leave you two to it? Or…?” I said.

“Right. Yes. Of course,” said the orbs. “What mortal sins are you checked in for?”

“Well, none I hope. I don’t think I’m even dead. He… it said this was hell?”

The orbs sighed, deflating a little. “Technically correct. Not all the right presentation, obviously. Look at this place.”

“Yeah,” I said.

“And you’ve not even crossed the mortal sheen?” The orbs spun, pivoting towards the hapless intern. “Do you understand how much paperwork this is going to be? The Department of Nightmares is going to be chirping us for weeks.”

“I-I’m sorry,” said the rock monster.

“We shall return you, Mister…?” said the orbs, now ignoring the rock, which was now quivering.

“Louie. Louie Tant,” I said.

“Mister Tant. My deepest apologies. This was a terrible error on our part and I will work to correct it immediately. Unfortunately, you will have to run a level seven nightmare in order to fully scramble your memory of any of this having happened, you understand. I expect minimal to moderate psychological torment upon your eventual return.”

“Sure, yeah, thanks. Uh, what’s that again about moderate psychological torment?”

But the orbs were gone. There was nothing, not even flowers, no breeze… nothing. I turned, blinking, making sure my eyes were open. They felt open. Where was I? Where were Garth and Robin? I stuck my hands out, trying to feel for something, anything.

Then, in the distance, a tiny yellow light. I ran for it, and it grew. I soon realized what it was. A single sunflower, hanging there in the gloom.

As I reached for it, two fiery eyes opened to my left. And then a dripping, sinister voice.

“Welcome to hell.”

7skv2o,3,2018-01-24,Should I cold-email Big 4? Internship -- Shanghai,NicksLife,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7skv2o/should_i_coldemail_big_4_internship_shanghai/,"Hey guys! I am currently a junior (with 2 full years left) at a large big 4 target school in the States. I am an MIS and Accounting double major, looking to go into IT Audit. I have been looking at internships, and settled on a program that my school has, which is study abroad + unpaid internship (I'm getting 12 credit hours and living in Shanghai for two months).

I was hoping that Big 4 would be a part of the program network, but unfortunately I found out that they do not work with the company that my university is going through. Instead, the company representatives said they would try to place me within a smaller accounting firm, or in the worst case are guaranteeing me a position in the accounting/IT department of a ""global"" firm (so I'm hoping for a big name?)

I am allowed to take an internship that I find on my own, so would you guys recommend that I reach out to the Big 4 offices in Shanghai on my own? I feel like I've got a pretty decent resume with good credentials, a good GPA, and a sought-after major combination by the firms.

In the worst case, would an experience, through for example the accounting dept of a large firm, or a small accounting firm, look good on a resume for big 4 recruitment upon graduation? I also have the summer after for an internship, which I hope could be with big 4 in my home state. What would you guys do in this situation?"

a few days ago i was on the floor, crying my eyes out and thinking sad thoughts after getting into a bad conversation with someone

before that day, i had a load of energy, passion, and caffeine. i wrote 50 pages of my story and read a few chapters in my interview book. i even believed i wasnt sad anymore and that my depression had gone away for good. until a few days ago.

i think about my life and believe there's nothing really that wrong with it. only major thing is that my family is very disconnected and they don't really talk about feelings. and i feel guilty for being sad. no one knows about my feelings and i know if i try to bring it up, they would outcast me for being weak. 

i don't think i want to die but i don't like where i'm at. the reason is is because people look at me and think i've something going. i graduated with a really good degree for the job market, good grades, good internship. i got to travel by myself for a few weeks. i'm not terrible to look at when i put on makeup so dating isn't hard for me. 

but none of these things matter when you are sad and insecure because the sadness and insecurity starts becoming obvious. when you are afraid of never being ""good enough"" and pushing out people in your life for fear of being awkward or them rejecting you. when you are unemployed but scared to apply for jobs because you don't think you're ready yet. when you think everyone's judging you because you do not meet their expectations...

sometimes i just wish i could run away, sit on a beach somewhere and just be happy with what i have. i hate putting on makeup alll the time, i hate trying to be ""the best person i can be"", i hate having to pretend i'm so smart just because i picked a good major, and i just hate having to feel perfect. 

i think if i said exactly what was on my mind, a lot of people wouldn't like me anymore. 

the things im complaining about are such a first-world problem. there are so many people out there who are actually suffering in a much more painful way. i just feel so stupid, embarrassed and spoiled right now.  i sometimes think i don't deserve any good that's given to me. often times, i question it. i wonder if something bad will come out of it because i didn't deserve it. i've always been like that -- i hate buying things new if i can get it secondhand. when my dad got me my car brand new, i was scared because i didn't think i desrved a car that wasn't something i bought with my own money and was afraid i would mess it up. i gave the car back to him after graduating college. i hate the amount of dopamine i get from my smartphone, so i never use it anymore. i hate how fast time goes by nowadays.  

i just want a simple life.

7smcwk,34,2018-01-24,"Me [29F] with my BF [28M] of 8 yrs, his low self esteem / career trouble, financial burden wearing me down",beebop_throw,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7smcwk/me_29f_with_my_bf_28m_of_8_yrs_his_low_self/,"Me with my boyfriend Tom. We've been together 8 years, lived together for 6. I feel very lucky to be with him as he is the kindest, funniest person I know. For the most part our relationship is great, we rarely argue, are usually great at communication and so on. 


He also does an awful lot around the house and cooks most of the time, which started as a way for him to balance out the financial inequality I'm going to describe. We live in a fairly expensive city, but moving / downsizing to another place is another problem on top of the ones below so not sure it's a solution ir the first solution. 


This issue about careers/finances is a difficult one to solve, and when we end up talking about anything that he might feel shame about, he sort of just clams up and gets quietly angry. He never really takes it out on me, (or anything else), but it's worrying. He was raised by a pretty critical narcissistic mother and he's a quiet, sensitive soul, so his survival mechanism is to keep the peace and hide his feelings. We've been working to try and change that, but whenever anything comes up where he's been the bad guy in anything, he becomes angry and depressed rather than finding any motivation to work on it. I believe this is common for people raised by narcissists? There's definitely a recurring situation where he'll feel sorry for himself about something before he ever sees the effect it's having on me, so I often have to communicate this to him. For example, if he is stressed from work and snaps at me, and I get upset or tell him about how it made me feel, he'll focus more on getting bothered by the fact that he's 'a bad person' than he will on making me feel better, if that makes sense. 


I want to point out that I go out of my way to be understanding, for example I'll say ""it's totally understandable if you're stressed, it just hurt my feelings a bit"". So while there may be things I can learn about how to deal with our conflicts, I don't think this stems from me making him feel guilty or being overly critical. 


For most of our relationship, my career has been the driving force for where we live, our lifestyle etc. I've been ok with this because I don't subscribe to the idea that a man should be the breadwinner, plus I'm older so a tiny bit ahead in life anyway. It has occasionally caused problems / arguments, there have been times where he hasn't worked much or worked unpaid internships and I felt like he wasn't trying hard enough to help get the burden off of me, especially at times where I've been in a really stressful job. But like I said, one time we moved states because of my job, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and time to get on his feet because he's moved for me.


The other factor is that his education isn't as good as mine. Don't get me wrong, he's really intelligent and has some amazing skills, but he didn't get on well in school and pursued an arts qualification that doesn't really lead to much in the real world, whereas I've been able to find jobs a bit easier, which has led to me also having more work experience. 


He has been working in almost full time positions for the last couple of years, but the most money he's ever brought in is about 40% of our outgoings, and that's only for the last year or so. So I've covered most of our lifestyle, most of the time. He doesn't really have much direction in life, he has things that he loves to do, but spends most of his time distracting himself from these problems on social media or with music, which I can understand because I've done the same in the past. 


In order to avoid any sort of resentment building up, I occasionally bring it up, or it comes out in arguments, the idea of him advancing in his career or earning more money (I'm in an unstable contract work situation at the moment, so I can no longer be the reliable source of our income that I once was and we're jut having to be frugal / live off my own savings unsustainably). And he tends to just clam up and get quietly angry about it. I get upset because it feels like the burden of our survival is always on me, and at the moment it's my personal savings that's covering 2/3s of our expenses. For example in a recent argument, he mentioned that he would find another job soon that paid $Xk and wasn't even aware that it wouldn't be enough to cover our outgoings. So then we argued because all this time, I've been the only one who even knows how much it costs for us to live. 


When I think about how much money I've earned over the years that has gone out the door to cover both of us, it stings a little because although I'm committed to taking care of us both if need be, it sometimes feels like he's getting the easier end of the deal. So when he doesn't try as hard as I would to better his situation, I feel a little taken advantage of. I also often find myself researching his options or job opportunities because it's on my mind so much, and I don't feel like he does it enough, but bringing it up doesn't end well. He does do a bit, but I guess I'm just more proactive about that sort of thing. He definitely feels terrible about it, but that's the problem, he just feels terrible about himself and that just doesn't help him to get anywhere when it comes to deciding on a career and working towards it.


So I've got several problems here really, 1. he doesn't know what he wants to do and doesn't have great qualifications to get a good career going, 2. The financial burden (both earning and worrying) seems to fall on me, 3. If I suggest otherwise he doesn't deal with it well and goes back to escapism / not thinking about it, 4. He has low self esteem and a history of being made to feel bad about himself.


I started attending counselling recently (despite not having much money) because life is getting too much for me lately, and I think it would be great if he would go - BUT this can't be another thing I do for him, he has to go and pay for it himself (even though in theory it's still coming out of our joint money). And like everything else, I think he'd rather not think about it than face it and get it sorted. We were supposed to be doing an online mindfulness course together, but he's not bothered or usually busy with hobbies so I've just been doing it alone. 

---------------
TL:DR: Long term boyfriend struggles with bettering his situation / feeling bad about himself - it's putting strain on our (my) finances and the relationship.

I don't know exactly when my drinking became an addiction. In high school, and up until my 21st birthday, I hated alcohol... I would proudly tell my then-boyfriend that I didn't understand how people could drink so much, and ""I'll never be that sort of person."" Blah. 

I'm not sure if it's because I drank to get through my escorting appointments, being shunned by my family, peer pressure from transferring to a new uni big on Thirsty Everyday's and trying to make friends, or being in an abusive relationship that did it... but all of a sudden I wanted vodka when I woke up, then I wanted just a shot or two before class, then I'd disguise rum and coke in a Coca Cola bottle to take to my internship, spending at least $100 a month on liquor. 

Empty bottles filled my dresser. Empty bottles hidden in McDonald's bags so no one would see them in my car. A totaled car (don't worry, I hate myself everyday for doing that... and have enough regret, forethought and mild ptsd from the severity of my solo crash to never drive drunk again). 

Anyway. It's been about 4 years, two therapists more concerned with my sporadic bulimia, and a horrible psychiatrist later and I still have a problem. Do I go through multiple hard liquor bottles a week like I did until last year? No. Did I finish a liter of vodka in three days last week, two bottles of rosè on a six hour road trip the week before, and a full bottle of cab last night? Yes. 

I convinced myself that I was doing better. And now I'm here in bed, worried about the black poo I might see later - trying to gauge when it'll return to normal - when my hands will stop shaking, how much water I'll need to drink to make myself feel better, and how I'll need to apologize to my FH for strong-arming him into buying me a bottle. 

This got long. Soooo I'll wrap it up. Going to see a new doctor today. Going to be honest about my habits. Going to see what happens. I'm desperately looking forward to it. "

I am trying to get in gear to start studying for the June test but I need some advice.

I am heavily involved on my undergraduate campus in running the Model UN, UNA and I help the administration at my school with club development.

I spend 2 days a week on campus where I take two classes, the other three days are spent at the Governor’s office where I am a senior intern. I worked there during the legislative session last year and they wanted me to come back for this one. 

It should be said that I want to go into public service on the other side of Law school. 

I feel that I don’t have enough time to study earnestly for the LSAT. 

Would it be worth cutting down my involvement in these clubs and at the Internship in order to spend 6-10 hours a week studying? Maybe do two days at the office instead of three?  Delegate more to my executive staff for Model UN? 

I realize this is a time management problem but I’m having a hard time trying to approach it.

Thank You."

7snem0,1,2018-01-24,Having a hard time finding an Internship.,kutzco,Philippines,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/7snem0/having_a_hard_time_finding_an_internship/,"Ine-expect ko na talaga na mahirap mag-hanap ng company kung saan pwede mag-OJT. Pero yung feeling na desperado ka na talaga kase may deadline. Late na late yung OJT Orientation namin (Which is last week lang) and kakabigay lang ng list of companies. Pwede din naman kahit wala dun sa list basta pasok sa practicum (IT btw).

I've sent about 20+ emails plus yung mga pinapasahan ko sa Jobstreet. Nagwo-walk-in na din ako pero ang hirap talaga. It's either full na yung slots ng company or walang openings. Average level naman yung programming skills ko and such. Ngayon ko lang na-realize na maganda nga 'tong course ko kaso napakahirap maghanap.

Solo na nga akong naghahanap ng Internship and sinubukan kong sumama sa mga peers ko kaso binabackstab ako. Parang ayaw din ako kasama kase they think I'm a threat pag sumama ako. Threat in terms na ako lang maa-accept or something.

So... Any advice /r/philippines?"
7snhrq,0,2018-01-24,[M(as A)4F(as A)] A compendium of prompts to entertain your free time,freddiemercurious,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7snhrq/mas_a4fas_a_a_compendium_of_prompts_to_entertain/,"Hello there! I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
———————————————————
Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

7so3jc,1,2018-01-24,Should i (M22) get to know the girl (22) through phone conversations before the actual date?(please read the description),BlacburnResnov,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7so3jc/should_i_m22_get_to_know_the_girl_22_through/,"I asked a girl from my class out a while back through text and she said yes. She's doing an internship in some other town and she had to leave before we could go on the date. I confirmed couple of weeks later again if she was still interested, she said yes and that she would let me know when she gets back. Now neither of us text much with anyone so there is very little contact, only occasional hi, wyd etc. Her last active sometimes shows 20 hours, or even more than a  day etc. She is busy with her internship.
I'll be going out of town for a while as well. So should I ask her if we can get to know each other through phone call first and then have proper date when we're both back? And would that even be a good thing to do?( Is it too weird?) I've asked twice already(and she said yes both times) before I got to know that I'll be out of town so would this last ditch effort come of as being desperate?
Am I right in assuming that keeping contact with her through phone conversations will keep her interested in going out with me when we're both back in town?

He is looking for an internship in his field of computer science, and once he graduates, we will be moving to Oregon for good.  For now, we are looking for a place to live for around $1000 a month for the dates mentioned above.  It doesn't have to be anything fancy or big (we prefer something only a tad bigger than a studio), just as long as it has a functional kitchen, is within a commutable radius to downtown, and is okay with the respectful use of marijuana.  

We've found plenty of options that fit what we're looking for, but they're already booked for a solid percentage of the summer because they are listed on vacation websites.  

We are looking for any suggestions as to any reputable property management companies that have monthly rentals, any landlords looking to fill a summer rental, tiny house ideas, etc.!  

Thanks in advance!"

7sp0me,2,2018-01-24,Co-workers [28F &amp; 33F] are gossiping about me and ostracizing me [25F],glassballerina,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7sp0me/coworkers_28f_33f_are_gossiping_about_me_and/,"I posted about this a week or two ago, but my two co-workers (we’re on a small team of four plus one student intern) have been consistently treating me poorly for the last few months to a year. They gossip about me to each other and other people around the office, they are rude to me, exclude me from lunch outings, etc. Lately they’ve both been going out of their way to be nasty to me (snide comments, taking credit for my work, blatantly saying negative things about me within earshot of me), etc. I sit right next to them so it’s difficult to just disregard them, even with my headphones on.

It’s really affecting me as I’m already kind of a sensitive person, and I feel totally miserable and isolated at my job. They’ve recently recruited our college intern, who I was very friendly with and kind of a mentor to, to join them in their behavior towards me. I should mention that my supervisor really seems to like me despite all this. I legitimately have no idea what I did to these women to deserve this, as I’m pretty well-liked by seemingly everyone else here in my office and I’m doing well career-wise.

I’ve done my best to stay above the negativity by ignoring it and still acting nicely towards them, but their nastiness is really getting to me. I already struggle with depression and anxiety, and this is making it a million times worse. Is there anything more I could do other than just ignoring them? Im at the end of my rope here.

Tl;dr: Two of my co-workers are treating me very poorly and it’s contributing to my depression and anxiety. I need some advice on how to handle the situation

7sp5vy,4,2018-01-24,[PI] The Aeternum,willfulpool,WritingPrompts,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7sp5vy/pi_the_aeternum/,"Story inspired by u/Karlosmdq prompt, original post [link here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/7r1pfy/wp_since_you_are_the_only_known_immortal_nasa_has/?st=JCTDVUFH&amp;sh=321969a2)
 
 
I turned from the viewing glass to pour myself another glass of wine. As the red liquid filled my glass, I looked around the room, coated in a blue glow with the lights off. Once my glass had filled, I turned back to the window to bask in the heavenly blue radiance of Neptune from Triton’s orbit. It’s dark blue spot swirling in eternal, roaring storms in the cold reaches of our solar system. I sat down, staring in awe at the slow movement of the clouds on Neptune’s surface; hypnotized by the shades of blue continuously waving in and around each other. Before I knew it, I had finished my glass. Again. I decided not to have another glass and left the viewing port to head to my room.
 
I had been selected by NASA almost 25 years ago to be sent into space to explore our solar system. An accident during a scientific experiment to examine cell-transdifferentiation in jellyfish caused my cells to begin continuous healing and increased response to regions exposed to extremely severe trauma. In laymen’s terms, I became immortal. And it was soon discovered that not even the vacuum of space could kill me. Within a fortnight I had gained international fame as the “Forever Man” and science communities from around the world sought to replicate the experiment. An international treaty was signed to focus only on using the research findings for medical and research use only, and not for immortality goals. Since I was already a prime example ready for the needles, they performed all the tests regarding my condition on me. Surprisingly, the tests regarding my immortality took much less time than expected, so they taped me to a rocket and gave me instructions to explore our solar system.
 
After five years of preparation and stocking my spacecraft, I was sent into space to explore every planet and their moons and not return until my mission was complete. I arrived at the Kuiper belt after 24 Earth years in space, yet I hadn’t aged a day. I spend another three and a half years to reach Pluto and Charon. After taking my steps across the small rock flying through space, I turned and looked as the small bright spot that was our Sun, and I was finally tasked with returning home.
 
I walked down the long, central hallway aboard the *Aeternum* to my two-story loft above the bridge. I walked over to my computer station in front of my port window and booted it up to see my messages. I scrolled through my inbox to see what came in.
 
*15 new messages from NATHA*. Typical.
*2 new messages from Clara Brunswick*. My heart skipped a little just seeing her name.
 
I decided to start with the messages from NASA; well I was required to. Besides, it gave me more time to get excited about my messages from Clara. I opened the first message NASA and was greeted by the face of my chair, Nathan Craig.
 
“Hello again Preston. We have more questions from some schools that we would like you to answer.” The camera showed the broad shouldered, brown hair, and blue eyes hiding behind glasses. His hair shaved on the sides and longer on top, a few small moles scattered on his cheeks. A quick look at Nathan Craig, one might think that he was 23 or 24, you would never guess that he’s 40. I changed my messages from “NASA” to “NATHA” because he is the one who always sends me questions from around the world. He’s my chair, well that’s what I call it, which is the person who is charge of communication with me as well as any orders from NASA about where I should position the Aeternum. “This video comes from Jacob Richmond and his class from Raleigh, North Carolina. Here’s their question for you.”
 
The video suddenly cut to a shot of a classroom and a boy with a mohawk wearing a baggy shirt standing in front of the camera.
 
“Hi Mr. Wallbot” it’s Wallcot but whatever. “I was wondering, since there’s water on other planets. Do you, like, do-did you ever tried surfing on the water for fun?”
 
I fixed my hair then fixed my hair before hitting record. “Hi Jacob! That’s a really interesting question! There is water that I’ve found other planets, but all the water is frozen. So instead of surfing I would instead snowboard. And to answer your question, yes, I have snowboarded on them. And my recommendation is to go to the poles of Mars. A lot of snow there!”
 
I hit end and rewound the footage to make sure it looked alright. And- oh god! I looked like I was shitfaced, and my eyes had huge bags underneath them. Well I haven’t slept as well as I wanted to the past few days. And they say the higher in altitude you are, the harder alcohol affects you. Same works for outer solar system distance I guess. I planned to put on some makeup and re-film the clip tomorrow, in the meantime, I opened the other video files from Nathan. Nine more files were footage of kids in classrooms asking about what life in space is like, four more were Nathan giving me instructions on where they want me to stop or swing by on my return journey to Earth, and the final message was the same old “don’t do fun shit” order I had been given since my stunt on Mars and the video I made on Titan.
 
I had gotten a lot of flak for some stuff I did just out of curiosity. Upon arriving at Mars, after my first three landings, sample collecting, and selfie with Curiosity and Viking, I decided to have some fun before I leave. I took a lift pad from my lander and rose to the upper atmosphere to go skydiving. I recorded my jump, which I also streamed live back to Earth from the camera on my suit, of the first Martian atmospheric jump. I thought it was going to be a moment of triumph, another image of mankind conquering the boundaries of our celestial neighbors. What instead happened was I messed up my math while preparing my parachute and didn’t correctly calculate the Martian atmosphere. Which led to nine billion people watching as I slammed headfirst into boulders at Martian terminal velocity when my parachute failed. When I realigned my spine, I returned to the *Aeternum* to find nearly five-hundred messages from NASA regarding my stunt. I had to swear I would never pull such a stunt again, but then NASA and I began to receive sponsorship offers from both GoPro and RedBull asking for more extreme stunts like the one just witnessed worldwide. NASA was about to reject the sponsorship until they learned how much was being offered. The amount from both combined would be able to fund three probes with the rockets to launch them. So now I wear a RedBull helmet for certain EVA activities such as scaling methane mountains and photographing frozen geysers.
 
As for Titan, I decided on my first day there I would replace my EVA suit for a tuxedo and dance the Charleston in front of the camera. I got a message from Nathan in which he simply wrote “not only are you not wearing proper attire, but even though you’re immune to suffering the effects of Titan’s atmosphere, they still have an effect on your face.” I watched the recording later and at first I mistook my eyes for my nostrils.
 
I re-watched my last order from Nathan, “go back to Saturn, why are you at Neptune?”, and made my way to the bridge to set the coordinates. I took my seat in pilot chair, facing a large circular window gazing out into endless abyss and stars and entered my previous coordinates situated near Enceladus. I set the interstellar pace in the light drive to a speed that have me at Saturn by the time I woke up. I returned to my room and once again sat at my computer to open my messages from Clara. The two messages read “6 More Months!” and “Back to Neptune???”. I clicked the first one and Clara’s wide toothy smile behind matte maroon lips greeted me, making my heart jump a little.
 
“Hi Preston! I hope you’re having a great day! I showed everyone in the physiology department your videos of your orbit around Titan and through Saturn’s rings. We were all completely blown away by the rings! I was blown away the shadows the rings made on Saturn. I watched them going to sleep last night, they were so calming to watch. I can only imagine what it must be like to be able to be out there and do space walks next to such a beautiful planet. So… I heard that there’s only six months left in your mission then you come home. I can’t wait to be with you in person. I miss you even though I’ve never been with you. Anyway, I’ll talk to you whenever you get the chance! Bye, I love you! Be safe! Like you actually face any danger.” She then blew a kiss and waved goodbye as the video ended.
 
I met Clara four years ago when she was a starry eyed nineteen-year-old part of the new employees tasked with researching and cataloging the experiments I carried out regarding the effects of interplanetary atmospheres on the human body. She started as an intern documenting the conversations between me and the head of the physiological effects department, Dr. Stephen Yu. Eventually her position was made full-time and instead of listening to the relays between the Dr. Yu and I for them to be cataloged and studied later, I would converse directly with her while she sent the information to Dr. Yu who would work in the lab. We started with everything being professional, but when the doctor would ask us to wait while he studied my information, up to several hours sometimes, we ended up talking and grew close. We had mock dates over video feed and would try to watch movies together. After some time, things started to get serious. And more risqué. We tried to have fun over video feed but when our schedules didn’t line up, we would rely on pre-sent messages. But we needed to be careful, because I did send something personal to Nathan once on accident. That was awkward to explain to him. Even though Clara and I were millions, and sometimes billions, of miles apart, I’ve never felt so close to her.
 
I opened Clara’s second message.
 
“Hey! I don’t know if you saw my last message, but I’m so excited for you to return in six months!” she was still wearing the matte lipstick. “Also, we saw that you went back to Neptune. I know that you tend to do things your own way because, well, how would we stop you? But Nathan wanted me to remind you that you are carrying thousands of kilograms of priceless soil, mineral and ice samples that the scientists here are dying to cut into. Plus, every day that you’re out there, you’re not here with me.” She said with a sweet smile. “I wish I could be out there with you. To see Neptune with my own eyes. I can only imagine what that kind of blue looks like. Anyway, there’s something else that you’ll be excited to learn about. It has to do with you, but I don’t know all the details yet. I’ll stay in touch. Love you!” then her message ended.
 
I stared at her smile for a few more moments before closing my computer and climbing the central stairs to my bed. As I pulled the covers over myself, I wondered what they’re talking about on Earth that concerns me and why would I be excited for it? Maybe Clara will find out more tomorrow. I turned over on my right side to gaze out the large window positioned next to my bed and stared at Neptune, it’s blue glow casting a pale but warm light through my room. My eyes grew heavy as the blue giant slowly started to move in my vision as the *Aeternum* accelerated out of Triton’s orbit back towards Saturn.
 
I woke up to the shine of Enceladus’ pale, cracked, icy surface filling my vision from the window. Icy geysers blowing frozen water out of the moon’s crust and its atmosphere. I climbed out of bed and rubbed my eyes, gazing across my room which was bathed in the moon’s pale glow with a slight hint of gold from Saturn. I walked over to my computer and sat down to find four more messages from NATHA. Three of them were more video questions from classrooms, the other one being an order from NASA. I opened that one first.
 
“Hello Preston” Nathan’s young face appeared. “We want you to return to the surface of Enceladus to take 50 samples of the ice set one kilometer down each with a separation radius of at least three kilometers between each sample site. These samples are to be placed in separate sampling tubes to be placed in the same container marking the location coordinates for each site. Um other than that, take a few more fly-bys around Saturn and Enceladus for photographs of the rings and the moons surface. After that, we’ll let you know what we want you to do next. Good luck Preston”.
 
After his message I decided to answer all the classroom questions. But I made sure to look in the mirror before filming another clip. After some cover up and some eye drops, I was ready to go. I spent the next few hours filming my responses to these kids, following my usual routine of answering their questions-
 
“Yeah Pluto is actually super cold!...The ice from there is NOT good to drink with…Well I walked from the shadows into the sunlight and instantly burst into flames…Yes, the air was literally acid…Imagine having your entire school and your sister’s school on your chest…It’s an old legend but no, it’s not made of cheese…No, it didn’t smell like farts”.
 
After turning the camera around a few times to send footage of the planets I orbited, I then checked my messages again to see if there was anything from Clara. Nothing. I turned on my camera to send her a reply for her messages from yesterday.
 
“Hey! Sorry I haven’t responded yet! Nathan has had me running around doing last minute collections and experiments before I prepare to return to Earth. It’s hard to believe that I’ve been out here for almost thirty years. I wonder how much Earth has changed since I left. And I can’t believe I only have six months left too! I can’t wait to finally see you in person. Don’t tell NASA, but there are a few things that I grabbed while out here to give you. Don’t worry, I made sure to clean them completely after collecting them. And you said that there was something that NASA was talking about that concerned me, any idea what it is? If you find out anything, let me know. Hopefully I’ll get to see you again soon. Love you”. Then I ended the message.
 
After taking a shower, I walked to my space suit storage. Looking over the fifteen different suits, I once again went with the Mercury style suit. It’s always been easier to move around in. But it was a close call between that and the plastic, clear suit, which I usually use for retro style photographs. I made sure to put on the protective undercoating for the cold, and climbed aboard the Kronos 2 lander already equipped with all the equipment I needed, and headed to the Kronos 5 landing site. After spending fourteen hours drilling to the requested depth and another 3 hours prepping the sample, I decided I was going to stay on the surface until I had completed my collections at each site. After carefully moving to each drilling location and placing the samples in their separate storage containers, I returned to the *Aeternum* 149 hours after I had landed on the surface.
 
I placed the specimens in cold storage, took off my Mercury suit, and took a shower before sitting down in front of my computer.
 
*5 New Messages from NATHA.*
*1 New Message from Clara Brunswick.*
 
That’s different. A lot less than I usually would get. Especially after that long on an EVA. I started with the messages from Nathan. Four of them were even more messages from classrooms.
 
“I have a room where I can grow fresh vegetables…It tastes like a mix of spearmint and copper…They can be broken loose, but I mean they’re really in there…It took me a few months to climb it, but the view was totally worth it!”.
 
The last message from Nathan was titled “Next Mission”. I opened it.
 
“Preston, we watched your progress on Enceladus and we have your next mission for you. You are to travel to Callisto in Jupiter’s orbit to collect extra rock and ice samples. Some of the data you sent back didn’t come through clearly so some of the scientists want some new samples to work with. The work shouldn’t be as extensive as what you did on Enceladus, so you can relax on that. This should be one of the last missions we have for you, then you’ll be on your way back here to Earth. I look forward to meeting you in person. I’ll stay in touch.”
  
One of my last missions? I didn’t hesitate for one second and instantly went to the bridge to set my course for Callisto. I set the *Aeternum’s* thrusters to full to get to the moon as fast as I could. The trip was estimated to arrive in about eleven hours. The images of the dark, icy moon flashed through my mind’s eye from my previous visit. I had been wanting to go back there but forgot how badly I wanted to until just now. Without even realizing it, I could barely stand from my chair I was so exhausted. I managed to stumble back to my room and glanced at my computer. I still haven’t seen the message from Clara, but I knew the second I sat down, I would fall asleep. I knew her message wasn’t going anywhere, and I would be able to understand it fully after a full night sleep. I crashed onto my bed and watched as the yellow body and bright rings of Saturn floated past as I pushed on towards Jupiter. 
 
When I awoke, it was like arriving at Enceladus. The pale brown and red stripes of swirling storms on Jupiter’s atmosphere loomed in my window while the dark surface dotted with bright white spots resembling great cities on the surface of Callisto hovered nearby. I climbed out of bed and wandered to my computer to finally watch Clara’s message. Before I opened her message, I received a new message from Nathan. The Title read, “Mission Update”. I opened it, but a warning message popped up, *VIDEO MESSAGE NOT FULLY RECEIVED. WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN RECEIVED?* I clicked “Yes” and turned my attention to Clara’s message. The title said, “Big Surprise!!!”, I opened it and curiously leaned closer.
 
“Hi Preston! Listen I learned what the scientists were talking about regarding you and they wanted to keep this a secret, but I convinced them otherwise. Are you ready to hear it? Okay- they figured out how to reverse your immortality.” My heart sank. A cure to my immortality? I kept listening. “They kept working on the experiment that made you immortal those decades ago, and they recently figured out how to reverse it! And even though you’re in your late 50s, your body has stayed in your 20s. So, if they cure your immortality, you’ll begin to age normally from where you are now! I know we’ve talked about your immortality in the past and how things would work between us, but with this opportunity, we could be together without age difference being a problem. But I’m just speaking my thoughts. I don’t know how you feel about all of this, and I’ll support you with whatever you choose. I hope to see you soon. Love you!”
 
I sat there in silence. A cure. I never thought it was possible. I slowly rose from my chair and walked to the window staring out at Jupiter. I stared at the immense gas giant floating before me. When I first passed the asteroid belt, I felt like I was alone on Earth. I know there were those who cared for me and I cared for them likewise, but I had to come to terms with the fact that they would all die. Everyone would. And I was truly alone in that sense. But upon seeing the gas giants, these gods residing in quiet slumber in the reaches of our solar system, I felt welcome, like I was at peace. I was among fellow immortals, in the endless beauty of the Void. With this sudden news about an end to my immortality, I no longer felt alone. Almost as if my contact with these celestial gods was a direct prayer to their ears, which they graciously answered. I watched Jupiter’s great red spot, a swirling hurricane which I knew from experience was a true example of never ending might and fury. Yet from so far away, without the roaring winds and burning skies, in the cold quiet separation of space, I find myself quietly meditating to the situation before me. With immortality there is a roaring storm, forever raging for as long as time continues to exist. With a limited existence, there is quiet and peace, gazing into the forever trying to understand where it might end. My concentration was suddenly cut short as Nathan’s video finally loaded and began playing.
 
“Hello Preston, I have some good news for you. Turns out the eggheads actually did receive the data regarding your samples on Callisto. The data was decoded incorrectly and so it seemed that only a small fraction of the information came through. So there is no need for you to go down to the Callisto. And for the really good news, your mission is over. Based on what you’ve collected and what you’ve already sent back, there should be more than enough samples and data to go through, and so you’ve received orders to return to Earth. You can take your time coming back, like you’re in any hurry, but you have been ordered to stay within the solar system boundaries of Jupiter. So you can explore it’s moons some more if you want, but no going back to Neptune. We do ask that you try to return at a reasonable date, because keep in mind, you are carrying hundreds of thousands of pounds of priceless information that a lot of us are excited to break into. In our lifetimes preferably. I want to tell you I and happy that I have had the opportunity to work with you on your endeavors. I hope I will have the chance to meet you in person. Be safe on your return journey. Godspeed Preston”.
 
The message finished and I stood in silence for a moment, still staring out into the void. I scanned the stars, having memorized them from my years crossing our solar system, until my eyes landed on a bright little dot, slightly larger than the other stars and slightly blue. Earth. My eyes lingered on it for a moment before I turned and plotted a course straight for home. I sat in the cockpit as the computer automatically turned the *Aeternum* towards the blue marble and began to accelerate towards it.
 
I set the thrusters to full and didn’t touch them again.

7sp78u,3,2018-01-24,I dated a sketchy pastor.,shiasurprize,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/7sp78u/i_dated_a_sketchy_pastor/,"I went on a couple dates with a guy I went to high school with when we both came home from college. We reconnected on Facebook, went out for drinks, and he invited me to the church he preaches at. He isn't a full time staff member, he is more of a resident or intern. But he stills preaches in front of the entire congregation at least once a month, leads worship, and does a lot with the youth group. 

I'm going to make this easy to read and list out the sketchy things he did. 

...He invited me back to his apartment one night. He knew that he couldn't come back to mine because I live alone and don't have guys over by myself. He has 2 roommates and we would stay in the living room/common area, so we had much more accountability at his place. I found out the next morning that his roommates were not there and that we were alone the whole time. 
...That night at his apartment, he insisted that I have another glass of wine even though we shared a bottle at dinner and I didn't want anymore. He'd had 2 glasses of wine and 3 cocktails, then poured himself more wine at home... he was tipsy at the very least. 
...He leaned in to kiss me on the couch. I turned and he got my cheek, then I decided it was time to leave. He was embarrassed or upset or whatever, he didn't walk me to the door or even check to make sure I made it home safe. (I had to walk 8 blocks at night by myself). 

At this point I had pretty much determined that I was not going to continue seeing him. The next day I went to brunch with a girl in my small group and told her all about our bad date, and she told me that his roommates went to a soccer match and spent the night with a friend who lives closer to the stadium-that's how I found out we were alone. That made me very upset. I would never be alone at home with a guy, especially not after we've been drinking... I'm just glad I left when I did.

...Later that night he texted me for the first time since I left his apartment. He wanted me to go out with some friends. I told him no thanks, hoping he would ask why not or acknowledge his behavior the night before but I didn't hear from him until I woke up the next morning. 
...This was Sunday morning. I woke up in time to get ready for church, and I had a dozen texts from him. He had definitely been drunk texting me and left me a hot mess of a voicemail-slurring, mumbling, whining, the works.
...And there was a dick pic. Not the first time a guy has sent me nudes but it's the first time a pastor has done it. I was shocked. I had done nothing to suggest that I would be interested in seeing his nudes. I guess he was drunk and hoping I would see it and send one back?
...He led worship and prayed over communion. I wasn't at his church but my small group friend was and she told me everything. He didn't seem drunk or hungover, just a little sleepy. But the fact that he was running around town getting hammered, bothering me with voicemails and nudes, then coming to church to lead worship and pray over communion like nothing happened is absurd. 

This all happened last weekend. I definitely decided that I'm not seeing him anymore. I blocked his number and Facebook. His roommate messaged me on Facebook today asking why I ""ghosted"" him. I haven't responded. I don't even know what to say, and I don't feel like I owe him an explanation. This guy knows what he did, and I'm nice to only ""ghost"" him. He obviously hasn't told his roommate that he lied to me to get me in his apartment alone, made me walk home by myself, then send me an unsolicited dick pic. My friend knows everything and she wants to me to talk to the executive pastor's assistant, and she would tell the elders. I guess they are considering bringing this guy on as a staff member...

I don't want talk to anyone at his church. I've been praying and I don't feel led to do so, either. I understand where my friend is coming from and why she wants the elders to know, but I really don't want to get involved. This a very traditional church and the elders are extremely ""old school"", I think they will just judge me for drinking with him and somehow make me feel like all this is my fault. I don't believe he is a predator, and if he keeps acting like this it will come back to bite him. 

Right now I feel dumb and I'm being hard on myself. I hate that I let my guard down and he almost got to me. I guess I just trusted him because he's a pastor? I'm thankful that I stayed safe. I hope he doesn't hurt anyone else, but I don't think it's my place to get involved. 

So after all this I just want to ask... Should I tell his church about him? I have all the texts and voicemails saved. I could just just forward that to the assistant and get it over with. 


UPDATE: My friend is going to tell on him if I don't. He is going to a conference with the youth group next month and she's right-the church should know about this. I'm starting to come to my senses a little more since I posted this. I still haven't responded to his roommate, he is the youth minister at the church. I would be more comfortable talking to the lady who works in the office, anyway. My hope is that I can schedule a time to talk to her this week, tell her what happened, show her the proof on my phone, then let them deal with it and be done. 

And in response to anyone who suggests that can't repent or talk to me because I blocked him, I didn't block him until late Sunday night. He had almost 24 hours to contact me directly. We still follow each on Instagram, he has posted since this happened and he can DM me there. He also could have done better than ask his friend to say ""why are you ghosting him?"" He clearly has not been honest with his roomie because I know his roommate will not be okay with when he finds out. "

I've been battling severe cystic acne for the last 5 years and really thought this was going to be the cure. I've lost 3 years of my life to this disease and just want to have a normal fucking face 

The good news is that new active acne is rare.

The bad news it that my face looks probably the worst it ever has. I have rolling pitted scars that I never saw or felt before. My entire face is covered in blotchy red skin from where old acne is. 

The weird thing is that I think new red blotches are appearing, and they are not fading at all. There has been no improvement in the red spots in the last 4 months. 

It just looks so fucking bad. 

I used to be so confident and everyone seemed to like me, but now everyone starts off with a bad impression of me because of my skin. When I'm walking to class girls used to smile at me, but honestly now I can't even remember the last time that happened. It's like I'm a fucking monster. And my skin was definitely a factor in my relationship falling apart.

I'm just at my wits end. I have to get an internship or a job soon and my confidence is completely shot. "

We're both seniors with a semester left. We've been through a lot together and dated for a year and a half. 

About 3-4 months ago, we broke up due to both of us having depression and being unhappy in our relationship. Also, both of us having internships and living apart as well as the pressures of college ending and wanting to ""experience it all""  played a role. After rebounds, we started basically dating again but without titles. We call it friends with benefits but we see each other multiple times a week, are exclusive, and only have a rule of not saying we love each other (so it's not as emotionally confusing). 

We both love each other and have slipped up and said it since this odd arrangement started. 

She means the world to me. I want to spend my life with her. We have so much in common and we communicate so damn well and we have a great sex life and we understand each other completely. The only reason we're not dating now is basically because she is moving in 4-6 months to go to grad school and wants to ""focus on her career."" She's also a strong feminist and I think the idea of settling down with me is scary to her. 

Idk what to do. I want to figure it out now before I'm absolutely destroyed when she leaves. I also don't want her to leave and then us try some long term relationship which neither of us are going to enjoy. 

I'd love to move with her and find a job wherever she goes, I'll have my degree and I want to leave the city as well. 

Idk how to tell someone that because it feels like an engagement which she isn't going to go for (I don't think). I'm really at a loss here. I don't want her to be the one that got away. We have such an amazing and healthy thing going right now. What do I do? "

I am also going to Physical Therapy school next fall so I will not be starting a year round job after I get my bachelor's degree.

Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
———————————————————
Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid."

[*Screencap of my notes and resources this season*](https://imgur.com/a/8KTfk)

---

###***Initial Disclaimer/TL;DR/Summary:*** 

I don’t hold Diamond 5 in extremely high regard. Rather, because I had set the goal for D5 2 years ago (yeah yeah), this milestone is me overcoming a LOT of mental health issues. I was able to get past a lot of self-hatred, fixed-mindset beliefs, and pushing past a lot of emotional trauma since my senior year of high school. This accomplishment represents faith in myself, that my work is not meaningless, and that I can (eventually lol) accomplish goals I set out to achieve. On top of everything though, I’ve finally directly experienced life without abusive and punishing self-evaluation.  

&amp;nbsp;

###***Background (2000-2014)***  

At the time I started League, I was just finishing up failing multiple long-term goals I had. My senior recital fell far below my expectations despite months of preparation. I had spent four years dreaming of being student body president (since I saw Valley’s student body officers for the first time in kindergarten), and it was the one election I lost. I wanted to get into an Ivy League-tier college since I was in kindergarten, and got waitlisted then denied everywhere I applied. Finally, for those of you who know the underwear story, I ended up not getting a scholarship I really, really wanted at SCU. I grew up thinking that if I got into an Ivy college, my life was set, and alternatively I was fubar. Seriously.

I came into college much different than I was in high school. I was significantly less involved, and I avoided any process involving applications or significant work to accomplish. I was too afraid that I was incapable of generating any results from my work, because I spent a year failing at things I had dedicated significant amounts of time working on. It felt like caring about accomplishing something became a death sentence for the dream of accomplishing that goal. So I floated through most things trying to not get worked up over grades or internships or achievements. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay in bed even if I had other obligations; why show up or put in extra effort if it ultimately didn’t matter? I’m lucky that I had great mentors and friends during this time so I didn’t completely go off the deep end, but it was (and often still is hard) to want to work on any long term goal.

&amp;nbsp;
###***“Why do you care so much about League/Diamond? It's just a game, d5 isn't even good.”***  

At the risk of sounding arrogant, my answer is that I’m lucky enough to have had many things in my life handed to me. Either I was lucky enough to have a good education (which set me up for success in writing, math, etc.), I was lucky to be born with some talent (music), and I was lucky to have connections that set me up for the few odd jobs I worked.

I straight up sucked at League. It was my first mouse-and-keyboard game, and my first team-based strategy game. My expertise is in 1-on-1 games like fighters. Anyways, I started in Silver and stayed there for a whole year while trying to hit Gold.
 
Partially due to great mentorship and additionally some remnant embers of an old inner fire, I wanted to find a goal, of any size, that I could push myself to accomplish. I wanted it to not be innately easy (due to the task being simple or my talent being ample), and I wanted a time deadline. I wanted to simulate the past situations I had been in where I failed, and I wanted to redeem myself.

&amp;nbsp;
###***The really hard times (2015-2018)***  

As the first and second year went by, I realized that I feel very emotionally stable in everything except league, it pokes at all my weaknesses as a person. In every competitive game I recommend focusing on micro improvements and not game results (Smash, Tekken). Even in school, I would take a poor grade on a midterm as long as I walked away understanding the concept. In League, even when I became aware of this pattern and the “optimal” way of learning and growth, I couldn’t emotionally remove myself from losses. If I played well but my teammates messed it up, I couldn’t say “that’s fine, you did what you could.” Instead, I only thought “put a better player in your shoes and he never loses here.” 

On top of that, tiny tiny issues would make me angry for the rest of the day. One summer, my mouse broke and cost me the game. Once I fixed my mouse, my internet became really unreliable, and my ping would jump from 60ms to 150-400ms, which made playing and reacting so difficult (I was working on my laning and mechanics the most). In essence, even though I was learning so much about growth mindset, proper learning practices, etc, I couldn’t apply it to myself. This had to be the most painful experience I’ve had to date, where no matter what I tried I couldn’t “fix” myself. 

I thought I needed more willpower. I would start choking up at corny facebook motivational videos or speeches. Really, there were a couple nights where after being demoted and losing 15 games straight in a day, I went to bed looking up “motivational videos” on Youtube. I read so much as well: the Inner Game of Tennis, the Will to Keep Winning, and Mindset being a couple of them that focused on how champions learn and think.

I paid for three different coaches because I believed that if coaching would reduce my mental pain and save my time, it was a high value investment. My first two coaches failed to offer anything I didn’t know, and my third coach (who I still work with) put me on a program that I had faith in. It was a 5-step program (lol) that focused on one fundamental skill at a time. It was so difficult tanking rating and losing games because I had to deconstruct my existing way of playing the game to learn proper fundamentals. 

Imagine having the wrong golf swing for 3 years; now imagine going to the range and hitting the ball so poorly it drops three feet in front of you. You spend 2-3 hours at the range experiencing this, then go back the next day to try again, only driven by the faith that the methodology you’re adopting is supposed to help you play like a professional. 

Even though I had faith in the program, I didn’t have faith in myself because I wasn’t getting the results I was looking for (wins/rating). 

As each season started to wrap up, I was very tempted to pay for boosting. “Just get me to my promos, I’m good enough to get there but the bad variance is just slowing me down. I'll play my promos on my own.” I didn’t do it, but as each season went by I was reminded of my long history of failure and my inability to meet any goal I set. From 2015-2017, I kept faiingl to meet my deadline, and relive the entire process of failing my 14+ year goal of getting into a top college.

At the peak of my mental strain, I would blank out in games. My coach eventually said, “don’t pay me anymore, go see a professional.” Any time I asked him a question, he knew I knew the answer. Any time I proposed a situation, his answer reflected my belief. I had already consumed enough educational content at the top level that I knew how to execute what needed to be done. Through this, we realized that once I’m in game, everything turns off. The accumulation of stress and anxiety removed my agency from the game, and I became an observer, just watching myself make mindless mistake after mistake. This mindless diving into games took me to 1500+ games in Platinum. A game is on average 20-40 minutes long. I’ll let you do the math on how much time I’ve committed to trying to make myself feel better.

&amp;nbsp;
###***Diamond (2018)***  
So what changed? A mix of therapy, medicine, and some cognitive gymnastics helped me turn my stubbornness on its head. Any time I could feel my neurotic tendencies coming on, I would insist to myself “You’ve been on this path before, you know exactly where it leads and it’s not going to work.” I’m not trying to say that you can just will away mental health issues, but I got lucky that this worked for me. Also, sidebar, I related a lot to Kousei from *Your Lie In April* because his trauma caused him to blank out during performances. Little bits of all of this led to enough healing that I was able to move forward again. The 2018 Season started last week, but my motto for the past month has been “I’m a mountain of peace.” 

I heavily regimented my practice routine: Wake up 2 hours early before class to get in 2 games, and never exceed 2 games per session. My experience taught me that my stamina mentally and emotionally lies around there. It took countless trial and error (read: loss streaks) to develop the commitment to limit my games. So many times I think I’m fine, and then suddenly I’ve lost 10 games and can’t remember what happened in any of them. 

Most importantly though, my top priority for training was staying emotionally stable. I had developed all the hard skills to working proficiency. My instincts were emotionally-driven, reckless decisions that usually threw away any lead I had gained early on. If I could stay stable and in my frontal brain, I could rely on my knowledge to make the right decisions. It’s slower than instinct, but it’s all I had. And once I was able to recognize when I was being analytical and stable, I was able to let go of losses because I could truly recognize them as out of my control (in terms of my current skill level).

Over the past 2 seasons, I played 1000+ games at a 50% winrate throughout, sitting at the upper end of Platinum. Once I gave myself a break from the relentless punishment I used to give myself, my winrates skyrocketed.  I had been in promotions to Diamond five times, and each time I would tilt from my teammates’ mistakes and go on a 10+ game losing streak after dropping the 3 out of 5 series. In this first week of Season 8 (after about a month of starting to implement my improved mindset in the offseason), I had a 76% winrate and got to Diamond in 29 games. I 3-0'd my promos. 

&amp;nbsp;
###***Now what?***  
I could talk about this for ages (“but /u/PhiDX, you already are”), but I learned that shoving myself into this emotional canyon was part of the reason I was unable to achieve what I wanted. Because I idolized Diamond, it became an unreachable goal. Every loss became devastating, every win intoxicating. In either case, I wasn’t focused on the game. Life isn’t always full of anime moments or big cinderella stories. I’m a little jealous of people who can enjoy that big emotional payoff. For me, emotional stability and consistency is indispensable for working through difficult growth. And honestly, this reflects a lot of my character most people know. I’ll sacrifice high highs if it means I don’t have to experience super low lows.

On top of everything though, I learned to be nice to myself. I’m gonna avoid bashing Asian parenting too hard because I credit my parents with trying their best always with limited information, but I do believe the culture is flawed in its belief that more pressure = more success. I don’t operate well under stress, so in the future if I want to accomplish something that’s career-related or life-changing, I am way more confident in attacking problems in ways that I know best how to solve. Removing emotion and keeping it low-stress are two huge tickets to improvement for me. And ultimately, that was my goal. I wanted to find a way for me to succeed at something I was (and still am) total hot garbage at. I can’t say I’ve found the perfect formula for success, but it’s a motivating start. 

As for League-related goals, I’ve always wanted to be a popular figure in some community. I want to push my skills until I’m able to be a player that people want to watch, and then I’ll stream and provide content that’s educational and entertaining. Maybe I can help people who struggle like I do.

Thanks for reading.

7srohb,4,2018-01-24,I need some advice with my credit cards and debt affecting my credit score please!,bunniesandcats,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7srohb/i_need_some_advice_with_my_credit_cards_and_debt/,"Hello all! I was looking for some help regarding how my debt and credit cards will affect my credit score. 

Currently, I have a 715 credit score. My parents have horrible debt and horrible scores, so as I become a real adult I want to make sure I keep my score up so I can someday hopefully get a house (22 right now and still living at home to manage debt and school). I have three open accounts:

- Capital One Journey card, opened 5/15, currently has $2306 on it at a 20.8% APR (about $28 interest per month). 

- Chase credit card opened 2/2017 with $1006, no interest charges until 5/2018 (and at that point it will be 21% APR). The entire balance on this is a balance transfer from the Capital one card, I was trying to lower interest payments. 

- local bank car loan opened in 7/2017 with $4630, I make $125 monthly payments right now, about $30 interest per month at 7.49% interest. Once I get a job in my field I hope to raise the amount I pay per month to pay this off much faster. 

I can't file my taxes yet, but it is estimated that I should get between $1000 and $1300 back, plus I am getting $200 back from my school for textbook charges. So lets say I will at least be getting $1300 to pay off some debt within the next two months. My plan was to put all of this towards the capital one debt as that has the highest interest rate. 

I am currently a full time student, I graduate in May and I will then have a six week full time internship, so in the summer I will basically not have a paying job, and at the moment I do not make enough at my part time job to make any dent at all in the debt besides minimum payments. My plan was that once I get a real job in my degree (hopefully) next fall, to really hit the remaining debt. I know it's only $1000 on the Chase card and that doesn't seem like much to pay off between now and the summer, but I barely make enough money now to eat anything else but Ramen for each meal, so I doubt I'll make a dent by the summer, and I know during my internship I'll have to use my credit cards. 

So I am mainly wondering this: in May when the Chase card starts gathering interest, would it hurt my credit score to close this card and transfer any remaining balance (will probably be $1000 I'm guessing) to a new credit card with a new no interest period? Or would closing the account hurt my score more than the interest  would hurt me? A friend told me that it's possible the card may charge interest on the total balance transfer if I don't pay it off by May, but I'm not sure if that's true or not. 

I know this isn't a ton of debt for people my age, I am thankful to have a tuition scholarship. But this debt gives me constant anxiety. Thanks for any advice!"

I'm looking to do a Divemaster Internship in Tenerife in the summer. I was looking at doing one with The Tenerife Diving Academy, but have just seen a bad review about it made by someone who switched to Excel Scuba Centre, also in Tenerife.

Wondering if anyone has done a Divemaster internship in Tenerife and what Dive School they would suggest doing it with?"
7srv3r,3,2018-01-24,Soon to be fresh graduate. Need advice with my near future life.,eberharden,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/7srv3r/soon_to_be_fresh_graduate_need_advice_with_my/,"Hi.

I'm a university student, about to finish my final year this spring. I'm studying in the UK but I am from a Central European country.

I am looking for some advice regarding my career and the steps I should take as I am worried and wondering whether I'm making the right plans/choices.

My degree is a niche in industrial design. The industry is very competitive and there aren't many new job openings at all compared to most other industries.

However, I'm at one of the best courses in the world in the subject and the amount of students that are employed in a design field after 6 months is 70%.

My plan as of right now, is to start applying to jobs/internships early, starting in February.

Unless I somehow get a job before June, I'm planning to go back to my home country and work as a delivery driver (a job I have done for 4 months last summer and can count on 100%) while continuing looking for graduate design jobs, elsewhere in Europe.

This is my first problem. I'm worried that by relocating home, where I'm sure I won't be able to get internships or a job with my degree, and working a shitty delivery job will make my chances of finding a job worse.

At the same time though, staying in the city where I studied would mean that I would be jobless (much more difficult to find even a shitty job), depending on my parents for money and for most jobs and interviews, I would still have to travel. Maybe less.

Am I planning to do the right thing there?

The second problem that I have is that I wasn't able to get an internship in my industry during my studies. This is mostly because I did a 3 year course instead of 4 year, in which the university allows students to leave and do a placement.

Most entry level jobs ask for experience in the industry.

Now, my portfolio of work is overall between average and strong, and I know that I have the ability to get hired by someone. Some of my skills are certainly above average.

But I have no official experience in my field apart from a work experience/internship in a small company when I was 18 - I'm 21 now.

I'm planning to apply to pretty much any position that I think I would be competent at - not limit myself just to my niche, and maybe ignore some of the ""experience required"" lines.

What would your advice to me be? What would you plan differently? What should I focus on?

My main worry is not failing to get my dream job straight out of university. I know that's something that almost never happens to people.

I'm just worried that my lack of experience and backup plan of working as a delivery driver in a country where no one cares about my degree will bite me in the ass and I'll have problems getting a job in anything related to my field...

Thank you very much for advice. Appreciate it."
7ss7hb,24,2018-01-24,"I (30F) have started to date a guy (29M) at my job. I have slowly begun to realize that he has had sex with about half the people who work here, and they resent me because of it. Is this just a blatant red flag?",maxdeduct123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ss7hb/i_30f_have_started_to_date_a_guy_29m_at_my_job_i/,"Got a new job 4 months ago, really enjoy it. About 35 people work here, mostly young people. 

I met this guy, Greg, who is a level higher than me position wise, and we kicked it off very quickly and started dating. He is, for lack of a better term, out of my league looks wise. He is just extremely attractive, and obviously this gets him attention from outsiders occasionally. 

As time has gone on, I've come to realize... he has slept with a huge, huge amount of girls, and guys actually, at our office. And because I have started dating him, a lot of the people here are beginning to resent me I think. If you have ever seen mad men, where don and megan are in an elevator separate from each other, and a girl comes in a openly flirts with don in front of megan not realizing they're dating? That literally happened to me last week, a girl came in and basically felt up Greg and said ""hello there"" and he said ""whoaa, I am not single anymore, this is my girlfriend"". She looked really awkward then and said ""I literally cant believe YOU of all people have a girlfriend"" in a joking tone. 

This isn't the first time this has happened. From what I understand, Greg has been having sex with basically everyone in the office, all the time. I've tried to talk to him about it but he seems to feel weird about it, he has mentioned before that he 'was sort of a s l u t' (sorry post will get blocked if I type that  i think lol) around the office but mentioned that he doesn't like talking about it. 

I talked to this one girl who is sort of my friend at the office, and we got drinks together one time and she sort of told me a lot of his history at the office. He was often very flirty with girls there, and because he was very good looking, girls would flirt back. He often would have days where girls would just sort of come in and out of the office for sex. Him and another guy, Ahmed, who's another attractive guy, would have threesomes or foursomes with workers and interns in his office. I asked if this was the type of thing where they would exchange sex for favors or anything like that, but she said absolutely not. 

First of all, I knew the office was a bit... on the youthful side. There was an office party where people smoked pot out the window and nobody seemed to care. But what the fuck? I honestly had no idea this type of stuff was going on. I knew he was fucking people at the office, but not like, girls coming in and out, threesomes and foursomes etc. What kind of wolf of wall street type mess have I gotten myself into?? 

I talked to Greg about it and he basically just said 'well... yeah' to everything. I didn't try to be accusatory or anything but it was obviously a weird conversation. He then sat me down and told me, honestly, that this might be causing problems at the office because girls there who he used to sleep with are jealous of me now that they cant sleep with him. 

I am just really confused. At this entire situation. I actually really do like greg a lot but I just didn't know what I was getting myself into, or the history he has with all of the women who work there. I sensed a sort of resentment towards me when we started dating but I didn't know it was because Greg had been fucking them all before. 

Is this just... one big major red flag? Should I just end this?

###***Initial Disclaimer/TL;DR/Summary:*** 

I don’t hold Diamond 5 in extremely high regard. Rather, because I had set the goal for D5 2 years ago (yeah yeah), this milestone is me overcoming a LOT of mental health issues. I was able to get past a lot of self-hatred, fixed-mindset beliefs, and pushing past a lot of emotional trauma since my senior year of high school. This accomplishment represents faith in myself, that my work is not meaningless, and that I can (eventually lol) accomplish goals I set out to achieve. On top of everything though, I’ve finally directly experienced life without abusive and punishing self-evaluation.  

&amp;nbsp;

###***Background (2000-2014)***  

At the time I started League, I was just finishing up failing multiple long-term goals I had. My senior recital fell far below my expectations despite months of preparation. I had spent four years dreaming of being student body president (since I saw Valley’s student body officers for the first time in kindergarten), and it was the one election I lost. I wanted to get into an Ivy League-tier college since I was in kindergarten, and got waitlisted then denied everywhere I applied. Finally, for those of you who know the underwear story, I ended up not getting a scholarship I really, really wanted at SCU. I grew up thinking that if I got into an Ivy college, my life was set, and alternatively I was fubar. Seriously.

I came into college much different than I was in high school. I was significantly less involved, and I avoided any process involving applications or significant work to accomplish. I was too afraid that I was incapable of generating any results from my work, because I spent a year failing at things I had dedicated significant amounts of time working on. It felt like caring about accomplishing something became a death sentence for the dream of accomplishing that goal. So I floated through most things trying to not get worked up over grades or internships or achievements. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay in bed even if I had other obligations; why show up or put in extra effort if it ultimately didn’t matter? I’m lucky that I had great mentors and friends during this time so I didn’t completely go off the deep end, but it was (and often still is hard) to want to work on any long term goal.

&amp;nbsp;
###***“Why do you care so much about League/Diamond? It's just a game, d5 isn't even good.”***  

At the risk of sounding arrogant, my answer is that I’m lucky enough to have had many things in my life handed to me. Either I was lucky enough to have a good education (which set me up for success in writing, math, etc.), I was lucky to be born with some talent (music), and I was lucky to have connections that set me up for the few odd jobs I worked.

I straight up sucked at League. It was my first mouse-and-keyboard game, and my first team-based strategy game. My expertise is in 1-on-1 games like fighters. Anyways, I started in Silver and stayed there for a whole year while trying to hit Gold.
 
Partially due to great mentorship and additionally some remnant embers of an old inner fire, I wanted to find a goal, of any size, that I could push myself to accomplish. I wanted it to not be innately easy (due to the task being simple or my talent being ample), and I wanted a time deadline. I wanted to simulate the past situations I had been in where I failed, and I wanted to redeem myself.

&amp;nbsp;
###***The really hard times (2015-2018)***  

As the first and second year went by, I realized that I feel very emotionally stable in everything except league, it pokes at all my weaknesses as a person. In every competitive game I recommend focusing on micro improvements and not game results (Smash, Tekken). Even in school, I would take a poor grade on a midterm as long as I walked away understanding the concept. In League, even when I became aware of this pattern and the “optimal” way of learning and growth, I couldn’t emotionally remove myself from losses. If I played well but my teammates messed it up, I couldn’t say “that’s fine, you did what you could.” Instead, I only thought “put a better player in your shoes and he never loses here.” 

On top of that, tiny tiny issues would make me angry for the rest of the day. One summer, my mouse broke and cost me the game. Once I fixed my mouse, my internet became really unreliable, and my ping would jump from 60ms to 150-400ms, which made playing and reacting so difficult (I was working on my laning and mechanics the most). In essence, even though I was learning so much about growth mindset, proper learning practices, etc, I couldn’t apply it to myself. This had to be the most painful experience I’ve had to date, where no matter what I tried I couldn’t “fix” myself. 

I thought I needed more willpower. I would start choking up at corny facebook motivational videos or speeches. Really, there were a couple nights where after being demoted and losing 15 games straight in a day, I went to bed looking up “motivational videos” on Youtube. I read so much as well: the Inner Game of Tennis, the Will to Keep Winning, and Mindset being a couple of them that focused on how champions learn and think.

I paid for three different coaches because I believed that if coaching would reduce my mental pain and save my time, it was a high value investment. My first two coaches failed to offer anything I didn’t know, and my third coach (who I still work with) put me on a program that I had faith in. It was a 5-step program (lol) that focused on one fundamental skill at a time. It was so difficult tanking rating and losing games because I had to deconstruct my existing way of playing the game to learn proper fundamentals. 

Imagine having the wrong golf swing for 3 years; now imagine going to the range and hitting the ball so poorly it drops three feet in front of you.

Even though I had faith in the program, I didn’t have faith in myself because I wasn’t getting the results I was looking for (wins/rating). 

As each season started to wrap up, I was very tempted to pay for boosting. “Just get me to my promos, I’m good enough to get there but the bad variance is just slowing me down. I'll play my promos on my own.” I didn’t do it, but as each season went by I was reminded of my long history of failure and my inability to meet any goal I set. From 2015-2017, I kept faiingl to meet my deadline, and relive the entire process of failing my 14+ year goal of getting into a top college.

I'm a full-time student that got an internship in Jan of 2017. Sometime in April I started getting paid for my internship, but it was a really small business and all of the employees were 1099 (so he could avoid giving benefits smh.)

I left the internship for another one, at a larger company where taxes are taken out of my paychecks so I also have a regular W2 this year. I've always filed these from my other jobs, so this is my first time filing 1099.

I'm confused on what I'm supposed to do. My 1099 is for roughly $2900. I typically file through HR Block but I'm not sure what to use this year because this 1099 makes things so weird. 

I just don't want to get audited. I can't afford to screw up because every penny goes towards rent and utilities, but I can't afford to hire an accountant either. A little guidance would be amazing. I checked out the links in the pinned post and those went right over my head."

the last time I posted a msg here was 9 months ago , I wrote what seemed to be a suicide note , and did attemp suicide but survived .

 A lot has changed since then , I took off my scarf the moment I gained a little bit of consciousness in the ER and I never put it back , my parents thought it was all a show just to take my scarf off to 'seduce men'..even at my lowest , they couldn't have the heart to admit that suffocating me (forcing me into the school they chose for me and forcing me to pray and  to wear a scarf , criticising every single thing that I do ) had caused me severe depression and the feeling that being dead was a better option than living as someone I'm not .
 
2 months after the incident , I had the chance to travel abroad ( I had a friend covering for me ) to meet my foriegn bf , it was amazing , got to check a lot of  the haram things off my list and came back home with plans and dreams .

Fastforward to last month when my parents find a paper with his name and mine (he sent me money so I can start preparing my dossier to study in his country ) ,questions were asked , the only thing that's believable I could come up with was I met him  there and he was landing me money beacause I'm having financial problems . 
There was a huge fuss , my mother trying to beat me , saying she will take me to a gynecologist to check if I'm still virgin , ended up with them saying they will return the money and I should never contact him again , I agreed .

One week of only being able to msg him when I'm in the bathroom , I had an internship a bit far from where I live so they let me get a room in a dorm ( my first time moving out after 23 years ) 
 They seemed to believe I really stopped talking to him  and that I was on the right path again until my stupid brother pretended my father was  using a spy app to track all my msgs and moves , he scared the shit out of me and asked me to tell him what am I really doing so he can help me , me being so naive , I trusted him (we didn't talk in years , he only started becoming closer 
after my suicide attempt ) , I told him I'm still talking to my bf, that he may come to visit , that I'm planing to leave one day and never come back .
 
The nxt day , a shitstorm was awaiting  for me in my house as it turns out he told them so many things , he told my father I traveled abroad to see my bf ( that I didn't just meet him randomly , which makes them think I must have gotten intimate with him , alone in a foriegn country with no rules against sex) that my bf also came and that he's planing to come again .. the worst 
part is this jerk has been  pretending to be innocent in a very assholish convaincing way (like I wonder what app they are using  to track ur msgs , don't talk to me using this phone it's tracked ) and my parents participating in this play with him , all thinking they are uniting their powers to find a way  to fix naive crazy me and do damage controle . ( my mother , being the most fanatic one in the family still only knows the version where I met my bf only one day during my entire travel where we only exchanged numbers , and that I only went steady with him when I came back home , she still has huge doubts and been telling everyone if this turnt out to be wrong she will either kill me or cut me off the family - I'm rooting for the latter )

I can only blame myself for trusting him enough before knowing he was the head behind everything ,enough to tell him I quit islam couple of years ago ..

he didn't tell them that part yet , as they still sound rather ' cool' (cool as didn't kill me yet )
but I'm pretty sure he'll tell them any time soon . ( he has been giving hints ' oh , they must already know, I think they ll talk to u soon about it )
He has been trying to convaince me I'm wrong and I'm going to hell and even offered to pay me  atrip to Mecca to restore my faith (yh sure :p) ( I didn't tell him I know it's him giving them all the informations , so now I can tell him whatever I want them to know )
 the stress I have been through is huge , the lies , the  mind games everyone is playing with me ..I'm already taking pills for anxiety , I can't deal with this , I feel like I can't play these games anymore , with everyone in the family looking at me like I'm the sluttiest ungreatful daughter , I'm really done with the lies , I lost track of all the story versions I told each one,  I just want to tell them everything : Im  not muslim anymore , I will stay with my bf and yes I already lost my precious hymen ..


a part of me doesn't care about the consequences and wants to get done with this at any cost  , another part of me is afraid they are gonna torture me or kill me ( I lost the opportunity of applying to the this year session of studying abroad and I kinda still wanna stay in my country till I get my diploma or at least be able to leave to somewhere in a legal way , I live in a third world country btw )

please help me ..what should I do?

Most of my recent experience is with JavaScript and C#. Right now I don't have a job but would like to at least move away from the mundane. I typically work for early startups and small web agencies. Think the guys who build a e-commerce website for a local shoe business. We're not doing super challenging stuff here. It just got more interesting with my very last job, which I'll get to in a moment.

Although I understand many programming topics I never got a formal education in Computer Science and no internships. Instead I got my degree in something called New Media, which goes on the promise to include everything creative that you use computer to make with.

I am looking to move my career in the space industry as I have held a long interest in space travel and exploration. Since I cannot do the internship or co-op thing anymore, as my window for that has closed a long time ago, so I need another way to set myself up to be a good candidate for that industry. 

Other interests I have are graphics programming and made projects based on it which proved useful in landing my last job, a short stint in game development. They needed someone with an understanding of shader languages and programming without the need for pre-made engines. I helped optimize the performance of their C# code in a few key areas. That felt like the odd man out in my otherwise web-heavy career but I'm still at a crossroads. Another company reached out to me, to work on their medial imaging code library, so I am at least getting more feedback from my graphics experience, but they mysteriously stopped replying. So what else can I do to make the push to do more interesting professional work, and for the space industry? I applied for a web developer position (to be on the safe side) for JPL last week, and am just looking to see what else I can do to improve my chances to work at JPL or NASA."

(I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Mr. Trump said last year he would be willing to speak with Mr. Mueller, but has more recently suggested that should not be necessary because the allegations being examined were baseless.

&gt; Ty Cobb, the White House lawyer leading the response to the investigation, said Mr. Trump was speaking hurriedly and intended only to say that he was willing to meet.

&gt; Mr. Cobb said the president was not trying to volunteer to testify before a grand jury, which is how prosecutors speak to witnesses under oath, but was merely speaking off the cuff.

&gt; Pressed on whether he would be willing to answer questions under oath, Mr. Trump first asked a reporter whether Hillary Clinton, his 2016 campaign rival, had spoken under oath to the F.B.I. in the investigation into her use of a private email server while she served as secretary of state.

&gt; President Bill Clinton testified under oath in 1998 about his relationship with a White House intern.

&gt; Added Mr. Trump: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t remember asking him the question.&amp;quot; The two met after the president fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, as the president was deciding that he would name Mr. McCabe the acting director of the bureau.

7stneu,5,2018-01-24,Considering divorce. Husband is a successful lawyer and I don't know what to do.,Sudoughnym,Divorce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/7stneu/considering_divorce_husband_is_a_successful/,"Hey. My husband and I have been married 6.5 years. No kids. 2 car loans in both our names and a house in both our names. I am not comfortable posting more details at this time (you'll see why below).

He's a practicing attorney in a big law firm, so he makes 3x what I do and works really long hours (he works 70+ hours a week to my 50-55). Things have been rough since he started a very stressful job in a big law firm. He's like a completely different person than the man I married. He's downright mean, especially when we fight. After the last big fight, he said he'd go to counseling with me, but of course he never has time to actually go. The last fight he said and did some things that I don't think our relationship will recover from without professional help, if it's even repairable at all. He refuses to get therapy for himself as it would affect his ability to practice law.

I'm starting to feel like nothing is going to change and maybe it'd be smart to at least consult with an attorney about divorce so I have options if he won't put any effort into fixing our marriage. Problem is he works for the largest, most prestigious law firm in our area. Like, everyone knows this firm and that name carries a lot of weight. 

I'm afraid that I can't afford the same ""quality"" attorney he can and that by virtue of what he does and who he works for, I'm not going to get unbiased counsel. I don't want alimony or anything of the sort, but he has strongly implied that he will fight me hard if we were to divorce because he can afford to. Even though I supported him through the entirety of law school (aside from 2 paid summer internships), I'm good with a 50/50 split of joint assets just so I'm not homeless after we split. We have no other joint debt. He has no student loans, I have my own which I'm aware I'm solely on the hook for, which is my only other debt.

So...how do I find an attorney? Should I find a high $$ aggressive lawyer and assume the worst? Or find one I can afford on my salary alone and hope for the best? How do I even start navigating this process when I already feel outgunned?

I'm heartbroken over this, but trying to be logical and keep emotions out of it. I just don't want to rack up debt when I could be starting over. I don't want to divorce, but I can't stay married to this angry, stressed out, mean person anymore.

Thanks in advance for your help."

7suapq,1,2018-01-25,Letting a long friendship go.,mkat2018,FriendshipAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/7suapq/letting_a_long_friendship_go/,"The question: Is it a good decision to completely remove her from my life, instead of leaving this open-ended neglectful friendship? 

Background: Needing advice. I have a friend, with whom I've been friends with for over a decade. We have matching tattoos (probably not the brightest) and have been really close. She goes to a different college about 45 minutes away, but we've maintained a really close friendship despite attending different universities. This school year though, we've barely spoken or have hung out. It was her last semester, so I chalked it off to being busy. We hung out a bit, but only if initiated by me. 

We started not talking at all, and being who I am, I called her out for ignoring me, and not giving me an explanation. She apologized and admitted that if she didn't have time to hang out, or speak, she should text back, instead of ignore me. I accepted it, and apologized too for being angry. 

The silence pretty much continued, and eventually thinking that I had maybe done something wrong, I apologized if I did something to make her angry, and that I missed her. She sent me a lengthy text message saying that she was sorry for making me feel like I had done something wrong, and that she was just busy with school. She offered to meet up for lunch and exchange Christmas gifts, which I was so happy to do.

Fast forward past the holidays. She's graduated, not working full time, and is instead finishing her internship. She's in my town EVERY weekend to play dnd, both Saturday and Sunday, and I haven't heard even a word to stop by, meet up, even though I believe she's less than a mile away from my home. I haven't even had a text message or a phone call to say hey.

This has been going on for almost 8+ months, and it really hurts. I'm to a point where I'm wondering if she wants to phase me out of her life. If so I wish she would be straightforward, but that's not really her character to be so direct. It hurts so much to think I'm losing a person I considered being friends with for a lifetime. I have plenty of friends, but I've never had a friend to the same degree as her, which leaves me terribly lonely. 

I've blocked her and some mutual friends between us on facebook. I'm sick of stalking her posts in passing and wondering what she's up to. I'm hoping she'll assume that I've just deleted my social media so it doesn't seem petty. I'm at the last point now, where I could completely remove her from my life, which is blocking her number. I just don't want to sit anymore hoping that she'll contact me. If I block her number, it takes the speculation out, and I feel more at peace.

I understand that friendships grow close and then apart sometimes. And normally this wouldn't hurt as bad. But I regard my friend so highly, that it's borderline devastating for these ridiculously long periods of silence to ensue. I feel as though I've put myself out there enough and given her multiple opportunities to tell me something's wrong, so I don't feel like I can reach out any more than I have. I think about it frequently, and its borderline obsessive how fixated and sad the subject can make me when I'm alone with my thoughts. I just don't want to be sad anymore, but the prolonged silence has only made it worse.

7sv07l,2,2018-01-25,M4A - TV Comedies (and other Rule 34),GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7sv07l/m4a_tv_comedies_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development*, and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them. With the first two, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be had with the unique structures, recurring gags, and one-off characters. 

----

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

I've decided to put as many prompt ideas here as possible, to form one superpost that holds all of my prompts. And as always, if none of mine are suitable, feel free to suggest your own! Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
———————————————————
Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid."

Looking for some feedback on our future plans and brainstorm on different options. 

Questions
1. How good are our chances in London jobwise? 
2. What is a realistic salary to expect for recent grads with 2-3 years of work experience?
3. What is the best way to get in touch with recruiters/companies and set up a meeting? We have been thinking about LinkedIn, calling and email with a personalized and straight forward message attached.  
4. How long does it usually take to find a job in London?
5. Best neighborhoods to find affordable accommodation in London?
6. Are there any good alternatives besides London in the UK/Switzerland we are missing?


Our situation
Me and my GF have got the dilemma that we want to live in the UK/Switzerland. But are not sure which city works best for our situation (London is high on our list). We are also looking for a place with the right mix of jobs/lifestyle/language/society. This means a big international community, availability of English speaking jobs, Restaurants/ cafes and some nature. We are in our mid-twenties and Dutch/German. Both worked for fortune 500 companies and have pretty standard resumes (internships, bar/hotel work and volunteering).

Me: 
degree in Bachelor of Business Administration with a focus on policy research/development/evaluation, EU-law, project management, Specialization in innovation management, development and evaluation. Fluent in Dutch and English and good German.
I'm mainly looking for a big start-up scene and lots of traineeship possibilities for example in finance, project management, council work and IT. 

GF: 
Bachelor of Arts degree, studies focused on Project/event management, concept development and customer experience management. Specialization in visitor/tourist attractions and themed experiences. Fluent in English and German. Looking to work in a tourist attraction or supplier/consultant for a tourist attraction. The job could be event management, project management or more operational. She is also looking into guest service consultancy agencies.

We also had the idea to go 4-5 days to London and visit several networking events to get in touch with recruiters and get a feel for the city. Also planning to set up meetings with HR managers and locals to get their take on our resumes and chances in London.

Thanks in advance for helping us out 

Anyways, yesterday I finally found something and stayed there, it's not ideal and it's not that cheap but it'll have to do for now, these days I was just crying that I didn't want to do this anymore (wander through the streets all day in look for something) so when the opportunity came I had to take it, at least for this month I take it as previsional.
I just took some clothes and other stuff for my personal hygiene for now, but I'll take my university books and more clothes now that I got back knowing that my mother isn't here.

The first day I was a nervous wreck, today I'm better, I'm trying to keep my mind occupied and calm down, it's not easy but the sole fact that I don't have to live how others want me to live anymore (even though I'm paying and I have to find a way to make income preferably sooner rather than later) is relieving.

It's a shame that it's come to this, but it's been necessary for a while now, it's been some time since I've wanted to leave, because I'm treated like shit but this just adds on top of that another dimension of how much this is needed.

I just want things to be okay, before this month's rent is over I will have had my last exam at university and so I might have graduated, in february I start a course in the employment office, in march I start some internships on the radio and on a studio, a friend of my sister who she told with my permission also told me to send her my curriculum so she can leave it in her workplace and she told me that there's a high probability they'll call me.

I'm scared about the future, but I'm secure about what I'm doing, it's important that I stopped hating myself so much that I'm not a carpet for people to step over anymore. I'm glad I took this risk.

I haven't told my mother yet, but when I do I'll tell her that I'm staying at a friend's house just so that she doesn't freak out so much, I still expect her to react immature because in her mind I'm her object and she doesn't conceive of any reason why I wouldn't want to belong to her, but it'll be just a little bit better that way.

I wish my sister was here, but it's okay, I'll have to do without her until she comes back. 

I think that's it, this post is a bit of a mess, I apologize about that, I find it hard to pinpoint exact things about this situation, I'm still not sure how to feel about it myself, so this is more of just a general grasp on everything going on in my life right now. 

Usually I respond to most of the comments I get but since I won't have internet for a while (I'm writing this on my laptop that I left on my mother's house, and I'll leave before she gets here) that won't be possible, so thank you all for the time and the support, much love and I hope and wish nothing but the best to all of you."

She's an excellent dog, but a lot of energy.

My husband currently works 11am-8pm, and I work 9-5, so our dog is only home alone about 6 hours a day. She is crated during that time, because we just don't trust her quite yet. I don't think she minds, our neighbors say they don't hear her bark at all. This is about to change, however... he will likely start a 10am to 7pm shift. So she'll be home alone 7 hours per day.

Once a week, we are pretty much gone from 9am to 9pm, so we've been taking her to doggy daycare for that day each week. The ladies there say she's been displaying some stress from any time being crated there while other dogs are playing - she basically barks until they will let her out. We are probably going to come up with an alternative for this day each week, I'll go home and walk her at lunch instead of taking her to daycare.

In the fall, I'll be starting a two year long online masters program. I'll be working 3 days a week, and then internship 2 days a week, with online classes.

I'm already panicking about our dog being left at home so much. I worry about losing some of the flexibility in my schedule and trying to balance so many things.

We love our dog, she's a great addition to our little family. But is it fair for her? Can we make this work?"

•	Class 1-A Birthdays have been added. Note: The birthdates are from the volume extras. Due to the sheer amount of characters, for this timeline I have only chosen to do Class 1-A. (Plus one extra character because he shares a birthday with someone…) Future timeline iterations might include other major characters such as teachers, but I’m slightly opposed to it due to the fact that it might clog up the timeline with useless birthdays. The birthdays follow the assumption that all students are 15 at the start of the school year and turn 16 during the story. 

•	Formatting and minor text fixes. Introduction texts and analysis texts have been modified to be clearer and more accessible.

•	Timeline is now accurate up to chapter 167. 

**Update Schedule:** 

I’ve created [a poll](http://www.strawpoll.me/14925759) to see when people would like updates! I have a few options: Update at the end of every arc, update only when significant time has passed in universe, or update only at significant events/dates in universe. A final option would be to have a running timeline in a google doc that I can update when I have time, with version update posts with extra commentary and analysis being posted on the subreddit. Please let me know what you’d prefer!

**Introduction and Methodology**

Hello, I’m back again with an update for the timeline. For those of you who are familiar with my methodology, you can skip this section. For those who aren’t, I’ll briefly introduce how this works. 

Generally speaking, Japanese high schools follow a trimester system. It is possible that UA might be using a semester system, but so far the dates have aligned with the trimester systems, so we will assume as such. We will adjust accordingly if it proves to be a different case. 
	
Term 1 starts in April, usually the second week, and runs to mid-late July. Students usually have August and sometimes parts of surrounding months off. 
	
Term 2 starts in September and runs to late December. Winter break is usually the last week or December and first week of January. 
	
Term 3 runs from January to late March, when we have a break before the school year starts. 
There are a few ways we can tell where events in the story take place. First, in relation to each other. Horikoshi will usually tell us how far apart events in the story happen to each other. The second is through known events in the Japanese school schedules. For example, the dates when students change uniforms is a set time. While we can’t pinpoint the exact dates of the story events, we can still narrow down events to the week or so. 

**How accurate is this timeline?** 

Shortly after I posted this, I was linked to a timeline from the official guidebook, [here.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/250678661064294411/362031037745856513/image.jpg?width=1552&amp;height=1164) The guidebook timeline is very vague, and only goes up to the beginning of summer break, but it does confirm that everything I had written up to that point was completely accurate. The only difference is where it places the training camp during summer break. I’m not sure if they’re suggesting it takes place in July (which is mathematically impossible due to the information Horikoshi gives us in the manga) or by putting it in the arrow as opposed to the actual main part of the month where all other events are placed that they’re trying to say that it takes place during summer break but not necessarily in July. (I’m still going with my timeline because the math fits. YMMV)

**Why does this matter?**

Using a timeline, we have a way of figuring out how much time had passed, and how much time could pass in the rest of the series. We also can use it to guess events that might happen using our knowledge of the school system, or how long the series might be. 

**Timeline:** 
Prologue

* Early April, Year 0: Chapter 1. Izuku meets All Might, Sludge Villain Incident. 

* February 26, Year 1: Chapter 2-3. Izuku receives One for All, Entrance Exam Occurs. 

* 1 Week later, Early- March: Chapter 4. Izuku is accepted into UA.

**Term 1 Begins**

* Second Week of April: Chapter 5-7. U.A academic year begins.  Immediately after, the Quirk Apprehension Test begins. (Note: This probably isn’t an actual day of classes, but the day of their Opening Ceremony. Counting backwards from chapter 13, this was actually on the Sunday before classes actually started.)  

* 1 day later, Second Week of April: Chapters 7-11. Battle Trial occurs. 

* 1 day later, Second week of April: Chapter 12. Emergency Exit Iida. Villains steal the class schedule during the distraction, allowing USJ to happen.

* 1 day later, Wednesday, Second week of April: Chapter 13-21. USJ occurs. 

* 1 day later, Thursday, second week of April: Chapter 21. School is cancelled after USJ. 

* 1 day later, Friday, second week of April: Chapter 21-23. Ochako’s backstory is revealed, Aizawa announces sports festival. All Might and Izuku talk. Bakugou makes enemies with the other classes. 

* April 20: Bakugo Katsuki turns 16.

* Two weeks later, Early May: Chapter 23-44. Sports Festival occurs.  Iida Tensei is attacked and paralyzed. 

* 1 day later, Early May: Chapter 44. Day off. Todoroki visits his mother for the first time. The next day is off as well. 

* 2 days after Sports festival, Early May: Chapter 45-6. Hero names are chosen, Internships are announced. 

* By the end of this week (in 2 days), Early May: Internship applications are due. 

* Some unknown time later, Presumably still May: Chapter 46-48. Internships begin.  They will last one week. Izuku meets and trains with Gran Torino. (Note: We can easily assume it’s still May because in 46, students are still shown wearing their winter uniforms. Traditionally, students change into summer uniforms on June 1.)

* Internships, Day 2, May: Chapter 48-49. Izuku develops Full Cowl. Stain and Shigaraki meet. 

* Internships, Day 3, May: Chapter 50- 56. Everyone converges in Hosu. The fight with Stain occurs. 

* Internships, Day 4, May: Chapter 56. Izuku, Todoroki, and Iida are hospitalized. Conversation with the police occurs. 

* Internships, Day 5, May: Chapter 57. All for One is first mentioned, other internships are shown. Iida reveals the extent of his injuries.

* Internships, Day 7 May: Chapter 57-58. Stain goes viral.

* End of Internships, either Day 7 or the day after, May: Chapter 58. Izuku and Gran Torino part ways. 

* 1 day later, May: Chapter 58-59. Class begins. All Might tells Izuku about the origin of One for All and All for One.  First mentions of End of Term Test. (Note: Students are still wearing winter uniforms, but without jackets, so it’s most likely the very end of May.) 

* May 28: Ojiro Mashirao turns 16.

* May 30: Aoyama Yuuga turns 16. 

* June 16: Tooru Hagakure turns 16. 

* June 19: Sato Rikido turns 16.

* Final Week of June: Chapter 60. 1 week until test. Students prepare for the test

* June 29: Kaminari Denki turns 16. 

* I week later, early July: Chapter 60-67. Tests. Written Exams probably last the entire week test exercise is after. Probably the same week. Toga and Dabi join the villain alliance. 

* Day after the practical exam, Early July: Chapter 68-70. Mall encounter occurs. 

* Day after encounter: Chapter 70. Class occurs.   

**END OF TERM 1: Early to Mid July.** 

Notes: 

Term 1 takes up about 65 chapters. At some point between this point (chap 70) and chap 80, Horikoshi proclaimed that the series was around 20% done. We are unsure of the exact date the interview took place, but I’d guess in between chapter 70 and chapter 80 as a rather loose estimate. 
Season 2 ends here. 

**Anime only watchers, beware of spoilers past this point!**

**Summer Break begins.**

* July 15: Midoriya Izuku turns 16. Mirio Togata turns 18. 

* July 28: Sero Hanta turns 16.

* 1 day later, August: Chapter 83. teachers have a meeting, the idea of a traitor is brought up. 

* I day later, 2 days since kidnapping: Chapter 83- 94. Izuku is released from the hospital. Kamino Arc occurs. 

* 1 day after Kamino, Mid August: Chapter 95. All for One is incarcerated, Izuku and All Might meet on the beach. The end of the age of All Might. 

* In the week after Kamino, Mid August: 96-97. Home visits occur. Students enter the dorms. 

* August 22: Iida Tenya turns 16.

* 10 days before Term 2: 100-101. Students begin to develop special moves for the license exam.

* 5 days before Term 2: 101-102. Izuku develops shoot style. 

* 1 Day before Term 2, Early September: Chapters 102-121. License Exam occurs. Twice’s backstory is revealed, Overhaul is introduced. All Might meets with All for One. At night, Bakugou vs Izuku occurs. (Note: This occurs roughly 2 weeks after Kamino, placing AFO vs All Might in Mid-August. Generally, Term 2 starts the first week of September.)

**END OF SUMMER BREAK- First week of September.**

Notes: Summer break runs for 50 chapters. Calculating when the arcs take place is difficult, and I was forced to count backwards from the end of break in order to measure thing. I’ve already brought up the issue of the accuracy of the School Trip Arc’s placement, but license exam and all the arcs relative to each other should be accurate. 

**Beginning of Term 2: First week of September**

* 1st day of term 2, early September: Chapters 121-122. Opening Ceremony occurs, Izuku and Bakugou are under house arrest. Izuku meets Mirio. 

* 3 days later, early September: Chapter 122-125. Izuku’s house arrest ends. Mirio vs Class 1-A. Overhaul and Shigaraki meet face to face.

* 1 day later, early September: Chapter 126. Bakugou’s house arrest ends, All Might asks Mirio to introduce Izuku to Nighteye. 

* That weekend: Chapters 126-128. Izuku becomes an intern under Nighteye.

* The next day: Chapters 128-130. Mirio and Izuku encounter Overhaul and Eri. Overhaul and Shigaraki decide to make a deal. 

* Beginning of the school week, early September: Chapters 130-134. Izuku finds out the truth about All Might and Nighteye. Ochako and Tsuyu begin their internships. Overhaul and Shigaraki meet. Around this time, Kirishima begins his internship. 

* 1 day later: Chapter 134. Red Riot, Uravity, and Froppy make the news.

* A few days later, presumably early-Mid September: Chapters 134-136. The hero meeting occurs, to plan Eri’s rescue. Izuku, Ochako, Kirishima, and Tsuyu are to remain on standby.

* Late September: Chapter 137. Todoroki, Izuku, and Iida have a conversation in the cafeteria. Students have switched to winter uniforms. Lockrock appears to discover the villain’s hideout. (Note: Usually students switch to winter uniforms in October, however here they seem to be switching in late September.)

* 2 days later, final week of September: Chapter 137-162. The heroes infiltrate the hideout of the Eightfold Cleansers. Mirio loses his quirk. Overhaul is defeated, then permanently disarmed. Nighteye dies. Gran Torino and Tsukauchi face Kurogiri and Gigantomachia.

* 1 day after infiltration, September: Chapter 162. Izuku and Mirio have a conversation in the hospital.

* 1 day later, Late September: Chapter 162-167. Bakugou and Todoroki attend their provisional license course.  

* September 28: Yaoyorozu Momo turns 16. 

* A few days later, October: Chapter 167. Interns attend Nighteye's funeral, Eri Wakes up. Current arc begins. 

**Conclusion:**

Now that chapter 167 has given us a more precise date, I’ve been able to reconfigure the timeline to be more accurate. The internships only take place over a span of three weeks or so. (Long internship, huh, Deku.)

 Some fun facts. It’s now been six months since the school year started! We’re roughly half way through the school year, and we still have a long way to go. We also have almost three months left until winter break. We have no real way of knowing how long it will be until we reach it though. For reference, the first term was about three months as well, and was 65 chapters. We should be coming up on a cultural festival, assuming UA has one, since those usually take place in the fall, and we’ve hinted at a few more school activities that should be coming up. 

Going purely by chapter numbers, we should be over 40% done if Horikoshi’s estimate around chapter 80 is accurate. I highly doubt it is. Chapter numbers is the worst way to measure completion, since stories always seem to take longer than you thought it would be to fit everything in. Either way, we’re probably comfortably still in the first half of the series, and will be here for a while. 

As always, if you spot any typos or errors, or if you have any questions, please let me know. I have a few more things on my To-Do list before this timeline is where I want it, such as going back and adding events that happened before the series officially started, and so on. Also, if you would like to be in on this, please let me know! There’s always room for another helper on this, as I’ll be very busy this coming semester.

My problem is that I have a lot on my plate and I feel it wearing me down. But I hold myself to a high standard and I feel like if I quit one of these 3 things I'm lazy and failing somehow. I know it's common for INFJs to do this and hold ourselves accountable for everything. How do I stop? How do I balance this out without feeling guilty and like a failure? "

We have two AMA's coming up next week. This is an announcement post and the real AMAs will be posted on the Morning of or the Night before the actual AMA. If you feel that you won't be available and are dying to ask questions, please ping one of the moderators or send us something in to modmail and we will try to ask your question on your behalf.

A panel of guests from the Toronto Star will be answering questions from you on Tuesday Jan 30 from 12 onwards. More information can be found below. 

On Thursday Feb 1, [CBC's Matt Galloway](http://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/bio/matt-galloway) will be making appearance as well. Matt will answer questions from 11AM.

-------------------

The Toronto Star will be debuting their own official account that will be used to interact with r/Toronto users via u/toronto_star


Star reporters new and old, members of the Trust Committee, someone from the social media team and senior editors will be present to answer your questions.

 

Here's who they've got so far:

* Public editor **Kathy English**. Kathy serves as intermediary between the Star and its many readers, responding to complaints and correcting wrong information. After a decade of this she remains relatively sane. She's also a member of the Star's trust initiative.

* Managing editor **Irene Gentle**. Irene has overall oversight of the news team, working with talented editors on everything from story and subject direction to placement. Journalistic and ethical conversations are a daily occurrence. Rarely seen without coffee. 

* Columnist **Ed Keenan**. Ed's lived in Toronto all his life, and has made its people, politics and culture the subject of his writing for more than a decade.

* Social media editor **Evy Kwong**, a self-proclaimed child of the internet (a millennial) who loves food, wandering around the city and singing Mariah Carey at karaoke. @evystadium

* Photographer **Steve Russell**, who never made it to the Olympics as an athlete but will be off to cover his sixth Olympics for the Star. (If he's taking your photo it's either one of the best days of your life or the worst.)

* One-year intern **Fatima Syed**. Fatima has spent the past few months reporting on the Shermans, the hijab hoax and now the missing men from Toronto's Gay Village. She was carpool karaoke-ing before James Corden made it viral. @fatimabsyed 

* Investigative reporter **Diana Zlomislic**. She's been working on a big data project related to healthcare (stay tuned!). She has a weakness for Devon Rex cats and cooking shows on TLN.


The Toronto Star has also asked if you have anyone specific that you'd like to hear from. They will try to see if that individual can be available for this AMA or a future one. They have many people available to answer questions so general and specific questions can be addressed. If you'd like to pose your question to a specific member, please keep that in mind when you write your comment in the AMA.


------------

*At 11AM on February 1st, we’ll be welcoming the host of CBC Radio One’s Metro Morning and co-host of Podcast Playlist, Matt Galloway.*

*On Metro Morning, Matt keeps listeners informed about what's going on in Toronto and offers listeners an optimistic, sometimes humorous view of the world, together with the day's more serious news.*

*Having worked for CBC for over 10 years, he has anchored CBC’s radio coverage of numerous Olympics and the 2010 FIFA World Cup.*

*He has been recognized multiple times as the Top Radio Personality, and given the Excellence in Community Service, and Diversity and Social Inclusion awards by institutions.

7sypwm,0,2018-01-25,"Need some advice, nobody to go to.",idontwantursalad,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7sypwm/need_some_advice_nobody_to_go_to/,"Hello pre-meds,

I am usually a lurker but I am on a throwaway for privacy reasons but I will cut right to the chase. 
Year: Sophomore
Major: Biology, Computer Science Minor
GPA: 2.95
Extracirriculars: Pre-med club, triathlon club
Research Experience: None, currently searching
Background: I came into college knowing that I wanted to be a doctor at some point, but I guess lacked the passion and drive that most pre-meds have. However, I did not realize that. My school is on the quarter system so currently it is Winter term. I have no real trend in my grades, other than the fact that they have been fine from just a graduation standpoint, but not acceptable for medical school. I am well aware, and have been well aware of my low GPA but I have never done anything about it. All the way through fall term of my sophomore year my grades have just been average. Over winter break I decided to address some mental health issues (ADHD-PI) that had been causing depressive episodes/lack in confidence. After going through some therapy sessions and making a conscious effort to take care of myself I finally believe that I have developed the passion and drive necessary to go to medical school.

Now that my sob story is out of the way I will describe the issue at hand. Currently I am on track to get straight A's this term. However my neighbor's father is one of the most well respected oncologists in the state that I currently live in. I have never met this man, but my neighbor has told me that I can be an intern in his lab for the summer whenever I want because my neighbor knows that I would like to attend medical school. The problem here is that I have been sent all of the information about the internship and it is exactly what I need on my resume. The internship is a 10 week program where you get to perform research under someone else and you present your findings to the entire department at the end of the program. The oncologist I was speaking about has been made aware that I will be applying however I am facing a moral dillema. 

The requirements for this internship are a 3.0 GPA (mine is 2.95), an LOR from a professor or research leader (do not know any of my professors well enough but am working on it as of this term). A cover letter, and resume (my employment history is actually really good). 

With all of this being said, I do not feel that I am anywhere near enough qualified for this internship, but the fact that I will basically be receiving priority is what worries me. If I did not know these people personally, I would have no problem. But the fact that I do know them and they are offering me such a great opportunity makes me feel really bad. I know that if I get this internship I will be the best, hardest worker that they have, however my current application does not demonstrate that. I feel that I need to meet them half way if they are going to offer me such an important opportunity. I do not want them to think I am simply a bad student trying to take advantage of them.

My current plan of action right now is 1 of two options:

A. Tell them that I really appreciate the opportunity but do not feel that I am qualified enough, and will get my application ready for next summer.

B. Tell them that I completely understand if they choose not to select me because I am well aware of my poor application, but will get ready for next summer.

It is worth noting that this application is due before my academic term is over, so I would have to email an updated transcript after I have already sent in my current one if I want to demonstrate an upward trend. I also will most likely not have an academic LOR and I do not have any research experience. Reddit help me!

7t040s,0,2018-01-25,Interview with Arena Rank 1: SuperSamSwagSolo,TheGrindKing,AlchemistCodeGL,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemistCodeGL/comments/7t040s/interview_with_arena_rank_1_supersamswagsolo/,"#Whats your attack team and defense team?


I have nearly every relevant unit at J3, really depends the enemy's comp. Then just manage your slots 1,2,3 correctly and WIN EVERY TIME. My 1-2-3 strategy, 1.) know map 2.) know comp 3.) manage the slots and win!

For my defense team, I use my two near-maxed holy brawlers yomi and lucian, because maxed caris and magnus are very popular right now. Along with my favorite waifu caris because she has better single target dmg and range than Magnus which is very strong in arena. I would love to use my maxed shayna right now, but VETTELS at the VET HAHAHA.


#What do you think about pulling for 500 gem banners and possibly the 300 gem gear banners?


If your casual go for it! If you a whale like me, not even a SWALLOW. If your F2P somewhat competitive, have aspirations for top 300ish in arena someday, I would think twice about that. 

IMO, only units that are worth any gems are Suzuka, Yomi, Lucian, Zangetsu, and Shayna. AND to obtain these units via 500 draws without boosted chance for them is not cost effective, unless you do not own them. Then just buy the shards from BEST GIRL LOUISE, she'll get you that J3 you deserve.


#Any advice for new players? 

Look deep down in your soul. Are you ash ketchup? wanna be the best? DO U HAVE THE KETCHUP!? your going to have to relive those 8 gym battles via re-rolling!

Re-roll for one of the 5 units mentioned above. Lucian and Zangetsu are 4 stars, so a 5-star yomi/shayna/suzuka and one of those bad boys is a MONSTER START.  Save those gems for the shards from LOUISE. And get your J3 SUPER UNIT in less than a month, F2P-proof. LUCIANO and ZANGETSU are real bad boys and cheap via shards, I recommend getting Job 3 for your BEST BOY. I personally prefer a Suzuka start with Zangetsu. Yall experienced players know that Suzuka has tasted Zangetsu's sword once and her loins are aching for round 2. Also fun fact Zangetsu's sword is 6 feet long. Ideally 9 copies of Suzuka and a Zangetsu on your first reroll, you'll be in cloud 9. BUT some people prefer the holy trinity 7 yomis, 1 shayna, 1 lucaino, and your best boy freed. Luciano is indeed the prettiest swag sand man I've seen. 

After you've got your bodyguard, its time to decorate your favorite waifu. IF you get Shayna, she doesn't need makeup. Yomi and Suzuka need that plastic for J3 to really shine.


Do all the Daily quests for gems. Spend all your energy. Farm up Logi. You can only get 60 gems a day + additional peanuts via attendance &amp; events. 



The most efficient way to spend your energy is via multi-player for double coins. Use these coins to get your Curious Doll and max it to 5 star. Slap it on every one of your characters with these and they'll be UN-KILLABLE! Getting the doll from gear summon is usually not a good idea with the current rates. It costs 45,000 Multi-Coins to get a teddy bear maxed out! Lemme break down 2nd BEST GIRL MR. MultiMaxMan herself. 900 for a 5 teddy pieces. So 45,000 DUH! So do 1,500 a day and get yoself a maxed teddy at the end of the month. That's 50 multi-advance runs a day, 25 if yo smart. But some people be like a maxed teddy a month!?! DATS SLOW!

# SO WORK TWICE AT HARD --&gt; 15 day a teddy. 3 TIMES HARD --&gt; 10 day teddy. 10 TIMES HARD AS MOFO --&gt; 3 DAY. 

#SUPERSAMSWAGSOLO's DAILLY CHALLENGE: 1 MAXED TEDDY EVERY DAY FOR 365 DAYS! Even got a Teddy for scumbag Dias.
#""Because every child deserves a Teddy"" @gumigimmeurgems

SUPERSAMSWAGSOLO's WEEKLY CHALLENGE: Along with the MAXED TEDDY get yo self 7 CRIMSON ARMORS cuz they the best atm and wat u need to succeed. Since most players even whales like meself can't obtain lv85, these 2 gears are enough for the current arena. BUY KNIGHT GAUNTLETs IF U PREFER FISTING SHAYNA, YOMI, OR LUCIANO!


TOO MUCH WORK FOR MULTIPLAYER? JUST AFK XD!

#RANK 1 ARENA SECURED ! EZ



The smartest, but least enjoyable way is to save up all the gems for the OP limited banner heroes like Zain. Save ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTAL AND RAINBOW SHARDS AND SHOCK THE ARENA! You can play this game without any gems, its 100% DOABLE! While all the scrubs are pulling for TRASH waifus like ShenekAZZ and CITrash, your PERSEVERING and keeping your base human desires at bay TO BECOME THE BEST CONCEIVABLE! You'll be a vegan for a while, but ONE day you'll be eating that yummy meat and it'll taste better than ShenekAZZ and CITrash, I GUARANTEE IT! You'll be a PSEUDO WHALE with all those pent up gems going KABLOOM, you'll see a rainbow!


#PRO TIP FOR THE HARDCORE: Saving Gems can be boring and you'll soon be asking yourself ""why am I still playing this game"". Most of my failed apprentices ask themselves this question 1 month into my rigorous training session. So make use of the free Blue Stacks 3 for multiple instances or additional devices you own. Got yourself a shayna waifu? Good for you! TIRED OF SHAYNA? DITCH HER and Use those piggy bank extras!
60 GEMS A DAY EZ PZ! This is also helpful for your rerolls.



#As a full-time whale, what is your spending habit?


Buy Unit Shards, NEVER ROLL UNLESS LIMITED COLLABORATION!

Here are the Gem Thresholds you want to reach for your favorite unit.

SuperSamSwagSolo Meticulous Mathematics:

4,500 Gems for Basic Limited Time Unit

8,500 Gems for  Solo Limited Time Unit 

11,200 Gems for Solo Limited Time Unit WITH SWORD!

16,200 Gems for SwagSolo Limited Time Unit WITH SWORD!

21,000 Gems for SwagSolo Limited Time Unit WITH SUPER SWORD!

43,500 Gems for SuperSwagSolo Limited Time Unit WITH SUPER SWORD! 

GREATER THAN 43,500 Gems? for Super [INSERT NAME] SwagSolo's Limited Time Unit WITH SUPER SWAG SWORD! 

NO! I DID NOT PULL THESE OUT OF MY BUTTHOLE! I USED BRAIN ... So you don't have to xD!

If you obtain the Super [INSERT NAME] SwagSolo's Limited Time Unit WITH SUPER SWAG SWORD! I AM PROUD OF YOU, U HAZ MASTERED DAE WAE!

#A HUNGRY WHALE WITH NO GEMS OR ELEMENTAL SHARDS DURING ZAIN'S BANNER MAY NEED TO CASH OUT OVER 2K USD TO GET HIM MAX LV ON DAY 1.

#YOU CAN DO THAT FOR FREE BY SAVING NOW!


Or fall into temptation and become a whale like me XD! P.S. I also fully utilized every single one of those 5,000 Gems

I'm a S.M.A.R.T whale hence #1! I DESTROYED ANNA's SHOP!


#Would you consider writing a more detailed guide or even a tier list in the near-future? Many players and myself find the ones on this Reddit page to be rather lackluster.

I would love to post some of my super detailed, outlined, COLORED, crisp tier lists/charts fully utilizing my associates degree from the NY school of fine arts but unfortunately my debut on this Reddit page was met with a SWIFT BAN! Because of this I will no longer post any links, as a swagbucks referral link resulted in my permanent ban just yesterday. However, you may help me HELP THE COMMUNITY! THINK ABOUT THE COMMUNITY!!!!!!!! I may plan to start a Alchemist Code Reddit page myself. 

WORK-IN-PROGRESS PROJECT: CONCEPT IDEA: GUMI GIMME YOUR GEMS T-SHIRT VIA teespring.com


Thank you for sharing with us your wisdom and its been an honor talking to you. I'll be sure to save all my Gems for my favorite unit Zain and post my results in the future. After following your guide I have a lv 75 Suzuka and a lv 85 Tyrfing, hopefully Zain will complete my ARENA RANK 1 BUILD.

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Other teases are around using things I say and twisting it so it seems bad and then using it to jokingly make fun of it.

Once they learned that I am dating someone, they started to ask more questions about her so they can look her up on facebook, and when I start dodging it, they asked me to show them a picture of her. I tried dodging it, and then are making fun of why I am not doing it.. boyish stuff like that,

Usually, I dont give a fuck if it is with people my equals, but these are my mentors and I cant blow them off. I dont want to keep it like that because I know they are losing respect for me everytime they tease me. I was thinking of standing up for myself and tell them directly but calmly that I think sharing this kind of things is unprofessional and I am just trying to keep things professional. I have a fear that may piss them off, and break LOP law #1.

Since classes have started I haven't moved at all in my place on the wait list. I looked into subbing out for a different Math 150 class but the only way I could make it work with ROTC would involve me completely re-arranging my class schedule. I talked to my academic adviser about this and he said that I could only really hope for people to drop. He also recommended taking Math 150 at a community college during the summer. I am hesitant to do that because it would limit my summer jobs and internships. Is it possible to take 2 humanities classes this semester and to take Math 150 and 151 at the same time next year? "

*****
&gt; Fox News&amp;#039;s Chris Wallace on Thursday said the Trump administration is trying to &amp;quot;Undercut&amp;quot; the credibility of the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election.

&gt; &amp;quot;Obviously that&amp;#039;s part of what you&amp;#039;re seeing going on now; the White House is doing everything they can to undercut the credibility of the Mueller investigation so that if they come up with any conclusions that are hostile to the president they can say, &amp;#039;well, we told you so,&amp;#039;&amp;quot; Wallace said on &amp;quot;Outnumbered Overtime.""

&gt; White House spokesman Raj Shah said earlier that special counsel Robert Mueller has found no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.

&gt; Wallace cited that as an example of the White House trying to discredit the probe.

&gt; Wallace said that such comments are &amp;quot;Special Counsel 101,&amp;quot; and that the same behavior occurred between the Clinton White House and special counsel Ken Starr, who was investigating whether former President Clinton covered up an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

&gt; &amp;quot;One of the things that a White House does when they&amp;#039;re under fire is they do everything they can to discredit a special counsel&amp;#039;s investigation so if and when the special counsel decides to bring charges against a sitting president, they try to have undercut their credibility,&amp;quot; he said.

7t1j5m,1,2018-01-25,M4A - TV comedy and other Rule 34,GRDerek,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7t1j5m/m4a_tv_comedy_and_other_rule_34/,"Hi everyone!

So as always I'm excited to do some Rule 34 roleplaying - today my particular craving is something from the world of TV comedy. Looking for a long-term partnership, with detailed stories, and with OOC chatter and fun. Either plot or smut focused, preferably with some of both (though I will admit my current cravings are on the smuttier side). I have some ideas in mind, but open to hearing yours. 

So, first up, *Community*. With *Community*, what I would love is having some fun with the show's unique setting. Sure, there's a lot of fun that can be had with throwing the show's hot characters at each other in various scenarios, but I'd be tempted to explore a kind of more conceptual roleplay based on one of their trademark concept RPs. Part of what I love about *Community* are its hilarious sendups of TV and film staples such as clip shows, bottle episodes, dream sequences, and documentaries. There's definitely room for some fun smut roleplays there. And that's not even to mention the potential for an RP based on the highstake drama that ensues in one of Greendale's paintball battles, or an R-rated twist on Remedial Chaos Theory - perhaps with gloryholes instead of pizza deliveries? 

Also, Alison Brie in a sexy Santa outfit. That's a thing. 

Secondly, *Parks and Rec*. Ann, April, Andy, and Ben are probably my favourite characters for smutty Parks and Rec scenarios, but open to others - Leslie, Tammy 2, Chris, April's gay boyfriend and his boyfriend, Orin for novelty's sake. Wouldn't mind doing a series of shorter smuttier stories that follow from scenes in the show (April disciplining an intern, Ann in her nursing duties, Ben having to adjust to sharing a roof with April and Andy), or a larger story, maybe based around some kind of big new civic project Leslie's spearheading that accidentally creates lots of smutty potential. 

Thirdly, *Archer*. Lots of options here, again, but my mind is thinking of a 'slice of life' sort of roleplay, with various smutty escapades - Sterling with Lana or Cheryl, most likely. 

Fourthly, *Red vs Blue*. May be cheating a bit here, as it's not really a TV comedy. But it's on UK Netflix, so screw it, I'm including it. I'm rather far behind - only just finished the Blood Gulch Chronicles, but hey, plenty of smutty potential there. Inter-team romances, intra-team romances, something with Tex. Big craving for Donut.

There are some other sitcoms I'd be interested in. *Peep Show*, *Arrested Development*, and *Futurama* come to mind, but no ideas for them. With the first two, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be had with the unique structures, recurring gags, and one-off characters.

Stuff about me as a writer: 

My F-list is [here](https://www.f-list.net/c/grderek). There's a list of other fandoms I enjoy - from Voltron to Mortal Kombat, from Nintendo to Game of Thrones - included within my F-list. Writing samples are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SHljurQw7a8VR3P76Skk_RBo9mVczLCEVeUdr00L6zQ/edit?usp=sharing). Generally I don't write as long a post as the samples contained in that list, but like, I hope it gives a good idea of what I'm like as a writer! 

I'm not a fast writer. The quick back and forths some people prefer generally don't work for me. I'll make the occasional exception, but it is rare. Generally I post a few times a week, entirely dependent on RL circumstances and the writing rhythm we establish. I don't have minimum or maximum post lengths, but routinely write a few paragraphs and would appreciate the same. There are always exceptions. 

We can have one long continuous story, or a series of quicker, varied one-stop scenes, or anything in between. I write M/M, M/F, any multi-character combination imaginable. Willing to play opposite trans and genderqueer characters. I usually like RPs with a lot of smut in them, but smut mixed with lots of nice character moments and plot points. More plot-heavy RPs are also an option. I really enjoy using the unique features of a universe (such as, say, the polyjuice potion in Harry Potter or green dreams and face changing in ASoIaF). I enjoy dreamplay, fantasyplay, breaking the fourth wall between actors and characters (have a couple of ideas on this front for GoT, Community, Parks and Rec, and Harry Potter too), lots of little structural things like that.

Bestiality, gore, snuff, underage characters (18+ only please), heavy violence, and scat are no-gos. Other 'taboo' kinks are ones I'd do only on a case-by-case basis. Ask, but yeah, the line between what I'm comfortable writing and what I'm not can be hard to place. The general rule is, respectful treatment, fantastical settings, and good humour and writing mean I'm willing to do more.

7t30s4,1,2018-01-26,"The current educational system, and how much I currently hate it.",TheEchoEffect,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/7t30s4/the_current_educational_system_and_how_much_i/,"God, and how much of a mess I feel like it is. It sucks watching your close friends go off to nice universities, while I stay behind to a community college. Before I start my rant, I’m currently a Senior in High school, and college is definitely on my mind. But to pick up where I left off, I really dislike the education system. I hate just everything about it. I’m going to create some backstory, so you can get a better understanding of where my perspective is. 

So, my Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior year, I can agree that I fucked up pretty damn bad. I fucked around a lot, and really didn’t care about it back then. But now being a senior, I realize how much it matters. I currently have a 2.1 GPA average (maybe lower tbh) and ranked 560 out of 584 people. Firstly, I really dislike the grading system. Especially on certain subjects that really wont apply to you. I’ve completely bombed my Science classes, and most of my Mathematics. I’ve only really excelled in English, and my major subject, which is Architecture. Secondly, why should it reflect my social status based on where I’m at because of my GPA / SAT scores? (got 1230 on the SAT) I feel as if my peers and local friends knew that I wasn’t as “intelligent” as I portrayed myself to be, I’d get shit on by 3/4ths of them. And lastly, test and homework should not be instruments to test your “understanding of the lesson” or “ability to follow along”. I’ve worked about 2 jobs, one as an unpaid intern, and one I’m currently doing. I’ve been critiqued as a good, honest, and a hard worker, given my task. I say this out of opinion, and not to brag. So, why would these things determine my outcome?

To further elaborate, I’m currently planning to major in Architecture, and I’d say it’s the prefect path for me. I’ve been really interested in it from freshman year, and I’m determined now to make it my major. Back at the end of my junior year, I participated in a statewide competition for Architectural Design, and got placed 3rd. Man, it was such a turning point for myself, because I finally realized how much of my high school life I wasted. I do wish I could tell myself “Wake up! Just get through with B’s and you’ll be fine!”, and not have this internal conflict I have now. 

I think I’m just mainly worried, about how much time I wasted, and the looks I get when I tell people who ask “I’m going to a community college”. Honestly, it’s not a bad idea, and I much would prefer this route nonetheless. 2 years, and hopefully transfer. Costs less too. Plus, I can transfer over some college units I’ve articulated with my architecture classes for free. However, everyone starts to look down at you, and I do feel left out when everyone around me plans to apply for top notch uni’s or privates.  

I wish some people would notice some of us, who want to develop their skills on certain fields that they’re GOOD at, and serious about doing what they want to do. That’s why I think the current school system is so messy. They focus a lot on kids who can memorize things from a book, take tests, get straight A’s, and be obedient “role models”. I honestly would like to see a system where kids are able to choose from the beginning, what courses they’d like to expand their knowledge on. I’m honestly fine with English and most Math to be mandatory (except common core, fuck whoever made it btw), but give students a choice. Don’t dump them out to Unis where some of them don’t know where to go, or what they want to do. That’s all I have to get off my chest."

7t3a0z,1,2018-01-26,A rollercoaster of post-grief depression.,throwaway238573475,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/7t3a0z/a_rollercoaster_of_postgrief_depression/,"I scheduled a dentist appointment today.  It sounds gross but I haven't been to the dentist in 3 years.

I was 18 when my mom died almost 3 years ago.  She was the only person who was rooting for me and after she died I felt like I had less than nothing.  I had just finished my first semester of college at a major university, and it was pretty lonely for me. I was very shy growing up and found myself isolated 85% of the time in college.
  
She had cancer that swooped in an took her on a random day during the summer. I didn't see it coming. I don't remember the last thing I said to her, but I know that it wasn't very nice. I  don't feel guilty about that anymore but I definitely lost my will to do anything after that. Daily self care became a challenge, I lost a lot of friends and the new people I met didn't understand how to empathize. I didn't expect them to, but I needed people who were willing to put in effort. 

I have had toothaches for a while now, and a broken tooth in the back of my mouth. My dentist is a family friend and loved my mom. It's hard for him too, to lose a friend, and every time I have seen him or talked to him since she died, I haven't been able to handle it. But I'm 21 and my gums are swollen. I cried and cried as I flossed for the first time in I don't know how long, and my gums bled. I am sure I'll need some type of surgery to fix them.

I haven't been able to handle anything with 100% effort. I have an internship which I absolutely hate. I'm sitting at a desk doing nothing all day and stressing over when someone will come over and ask to see what I'm doing. Honestly the only reason I got this internship is because I lied about my grades. I needed a job and work experience and now it's a bad situation because if they choose to hire me when I graduate (which it looks like they will), I am pretty sure they'll ask to see transcripts.

I have tried to be honest about my situation with my professors, but I have this daily anxiety that builds up as the day progresses: I wake up with the full intention of going to class. Some days I follow through with that, some days I let the time run out and just stare at the clock. When I am in class I am engaged and focused, but when I am not there I have no will to do anything. 

I got an F in a class last semester and have let two incomplete grades expire. I am otherwise getting Bs without really doing much or showing up.

I began going on dates with someone who is a bit older, and actually the most amazing person I have ever met, but it is still new and I am not ready to share an estranged-abusive-dad/depression story with them yet. They know that my mom died from cancer and that it still affects me deeply, but not about my personal struggles with everything else. 

I felt the need to vent because I feel like nothing has gone my way and it's my fault. I have never felt thoughts of suicide. I think life can be beautiful if we find the right way to look at it and I have no intention of doing anything intentionally harmful to myself or anyone else. I am not impulsive. I have never taken drugs and I don't want to. I don't drink or smoke at all either. I have never had an interest in any of those, and since I 

I really just feel like I need to be able to release this weight that hangs over me. I feel heavy, and not because I have gained 50 pounds in 3 years. I feel exhausted. I feel like I just need to run until my legs give out or until I'm in some new place.

I want to be able to do well in school and have enough money to feed myself and not have to worry about what I am going to do with a 2.4 GPA.  I want to fall in love. I want to be loved. I want to be able to reach milestones and just, be.

I don't want my teeth to fall out. I don't want to be lonely. I don't want to feel like I am doing this alone. I don't want to be crying hard once every few days. I don't want to have to choose between allotting my energy to schoolwork or my job or my relationships.

I met a girl whose dad died two months ago and saw how differently she is handling the situation. She is keeping up with her schoolwork perfectly, she is sad but driven.

I want to be driven but I don't know where I can start. I have tried small daily milestones, I can't afford therapy. I have tried stretching and yoga. I have tried waking up early and going to bed early. I have tried veganism. 

Sorry so choppy, if anyone even reads this at all. I am just exhausted. Emotionally drained in every way. And I don't know how it's been 3 years since I had dental work done. And I don't know how to get out of this. 

Self care has been hard for me, as has everything else that I have tried and failed to do right. I don't know where to turn, man. "

I am a UIC senior who has yet to land an internship. I will have enough credits to sit for the CPA immediately after graduation but if I cant get some kind of experience then it wont really matter. My cumulative gpa is trash, a 2.7 to be exact. My major gpa is a 3.5. I have worked many different jobs and am currently/always have been working during school. only one previous job is slightly related to accounting, but more so programming (government). My career counselor asked if i was intersted in big 4 (which I am) but my cumulative prevents me from applying. I have a feeling that in the future accounting (the bookwork) will mostly be automated. In an attempt to stay ahead of the game i picked up programming and enjoy using it to make tasks more efficient. In fact my accomplishments from my last job include automating the entire risk assessment process via JavaScript.

So, with all this being said im having real issues just getting an interview... The only one i did get they pushed the possibility of me getting it back to 2019 spring because i wont take auditing until fall 2018. My question is, how can i secure a (preferably paid) internship at any firm ASAP? I really want to avoid any gap between graduation and the CPA i can so that the information is still relatively secured.

Thanks for reading guys and gals, Advice would be much appreciated!"

7t5ezy,98,2018-01-26,Couldn't hold back at the Christmas party [MF],Whatilovebutshouldnt,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/7t5ezy/couldnt_hold_back_at_the_christmas_party_mf/,"I've gotten good feedback on my old stories, so here's a recent one. 

---

This here happened just a few weeks ago, at our annual company Christmas party. I work in a creative/agency type job, which means company parties tend to be quite wild. And there are a lot of young, smart and talented people passing through, including many very good looking girls. But I'm in a senior/management role, so relations at work are not OK. It's quite frustrating, because I'm lucky to be a dude that gets attention from many girls, especially the younger ones. I think it's because I've always had quite the boyish look to me, but I have lots of experience in my field, and speak with confidence and authority, while also knowing how to make people laugh. I've also stayed fit because I love climbing, and I have a full head of blonde hair. And finally, I'm quite big, with a bulge that I notice gets noticed. 

So at this party, with about 100 or so people sitting down for dinner, I was seated opposite a girl I hadn't seen before. She was pretty as hell, with flowing blonde hair, big bright blue eyes, and full lips with a dark purple lipstick, that completed her rocker girl look. This might sound strange as choice of style for the occasion, but the general culture in this company isn't exactly focused on tradition, and especially parties are really ""come however you feel like"". We chatted as one does, and I was focused on keeping my reserve, seeing as she was a temp researcher brought in from a college, 20 years old and from a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. Her incredibly cute country girl accent made that hard though. There were a couple other interns next to her so I steered the conversation toward them, trying to stay clear of the interest she was showing by leaning over the table and following everything I said with questions and opinions of her own. The guy next to her was her age, and clearly he had his sights set on this girl, so I asked him about his interests, and it turned out he was interested in my field so I fell into a passionate rave about what I do, thinking that would put the girl off. Of course the opposite happened, and suddenly the dinner was nearing its end with us having spent at least an hour just talking to each other, with this girl who I still didn't know the name of almost fawning - I think the ample booze helped with that as well.

I was buzzed and was feeling the old cartoon cliche of a devil and an angel on my shoulders, this time though the angel won and I stood up, and joined the mingle, talking to people my age. The party was really heating up, like our Christmas parties always do (December is always a crazy intense month in our business, so there was lots of pent up energy to spend). Noise levels went up, lights turned off, a live band did a really fun quiz, and then kick-started the dancefloor. It was packed, hot, sweaty with innumerable beers downed, and so much fun, intelligent banter. 

At about midnight, the party started thinning, and I hadn't seen the girl since dinner. But suddenly there she was, right in front of me, pulling me to the dancefloor. I love dancing, so we joined a group that was drunkenly flailing around, and both her and I seemed to have a lot more body control than the rest. The fact that she seemed not nearly as wasted as everybody else, combined with the overt rubbing of her body against mine made me worried, as that devil on my shoulder kept getting more insistent. And holy hell what a body she had on her, youthfully firm, with thickness in just the right amount, in the right places. 

Her top was a loose, worn, rock'n'roll band T-shirt, with the thin fabric stretching over a big pair of perky tits, because it was tucked into a tight pair of black jeans that accentuated a slim waist, and hugged a firm, round, absolutely perfect ass that flowed into beautiful thick legs. Her converses moved in perfect time with the music while she danced herself close and then away, again and again, really showing off, while locking my gaze with a wild ""fuck-me"" look. I could just laugh nervously as I started to feel my cock chubbing, while keeping up (and trying to keep a safe distance – there were people all around).

After a while I got aware of that angel character, and whispered into her ear: ""As much as I want this, I just can't"". I left, to go upstairs to my office and get my jacket. Coming back out in the stairwell, there she was again, leaning against the guardrail, looking at me with a sultry and disappointed smile. This was just too much, my willpower had run out, and we were alone in the dark. I went up to her, feeling her warmth as I grazed her face with my cheek. She put a hand on my waist, pulling me closer as I was just taking in the velvety softness of her face, and then we locked in a kiss. Oh god her lips were just as full and firm as they looked, and her tongue aggressively pressed into my mouth, hooking into my teeth, pulling me into her. I grabbed her waist and pushed her away with the intent to leave, but then she said ""come to my office?"", and the smile on her in that moment made me just grab her hand.

She had been stationed in an editing room in the old attic (our office is in a big historic building), so we had to climb two flights of stairs, and then walk through a series of rooms before getting to where she wanted me. It was bright in there until she turned off the lights, and seeing her move around the room after she'd pushed me onto the tiny couch used for visitors was exhilarating, but also made me a little too aware of the situation. She sat down on top of me and we quickly found our way back to kissing, this time with hands running all over bodies, through hair, while she rubbed her hips against mine. I was so hard now, but as my hand found its way into her bra, grabbing her intense softness, I snapped out of it again, and said ""I really shouldn't be doing this"". By now we were half lying down with her by my side, so standing up was easy enough for me. 

As I stood up, she just smiled, and said ""you're right, we shouldn't"", but her hand had a firm grip on my belt, holding me back. She started unbuckling it, looking up at me. I trembled as the zipper went down, her now tugging my underwear down, and watched my cock spring free right by her face. Then she just let out a sigh, and put her tongue on it. I wasn't fully hard, but her warm breathing together with her tongue trying to lift it between her lips made it pulse as it got harder with every heartbeat. I was shivering by the time she took my glans in her mouth, and I can't remember the last time I was that hard. My cock looked almost artificial, veiny with a dark purple head, and I couldn't help staring at her closing her lips around it with muted moan. 

She didn't suck it, so much as made love to it with her mouth. There was no bobbing, just slowly sliding it into the warm wetness, her tongue tracing around the head, pushing it around while I gasped at feeling so much detail. I had my eyes closed by now, and when her hand started caressing my thighs and balls, I jerked out of her mouth saying ""if we're doing this, then don't make me cum just yet will you"". She started laughing, and said ""what?"" with a cheeky smile.

I grabbed her neck and pulled her up so we could kiss, while I lost my jacket and sweater, and she pulled that T-shirt over her head. As we were kissing again, she lay back on the couch, and I unclasped her bra to reveal the most beautiful breasts, pale, and much more than I could hold in my hand, with tiny, stiff nipples right at the crest. I couldn't help but lick them, grabbing her hard and pushing her unbelievably smooth skin into my mouth, until I'd sucked both nipples and they were glistening wet. I suppose I looked crazy, because she was almost tittering as I started working my way down her flat stomach, frantically pulling at her trouser waistband. 

Looking up to be able to figure out how to unbutton her trousers, she seemed a little shy all of a sudden, although still smiling. She was wearing a cheap, sheer purple panty underneath, and I started kissing the fabric, feeling her soft mound against my lips, before I pulled all of it off. I could see a wet glistening patch in her panties, that matched the crystal clear wetness on her swollen labia. They were covered in beautiful downy blonde pubic hair, and I think she said something as I lowered my mouth on it, but by now the only thing I could take in was how much I wanted to taste it. Feeling her wet pussy open as I pushed my tongue into it made me grunt all the way from the pit of my stomach. I grabbed her hips with both hands and pulled her hard against my lips, trying to get as much of her pussy into my mouth as I could. My tongue explored every fold and detail, and soon I started finding a slow lovemaking pace, that let me feel her stiff clit slide from almost down my throat all the way to the tip of my tongue, and with every new take I could taste new wetness as I slid over her opening. 

I looked up at her, and her eyes were closed now, her breasts heaving with her breathing, and she'd placed a hand on top of mine on her hip. I felt like I was in a trance, where I just wanted to be one with her writhing body. But I was also aware that I wanted her to come, and I wanted it to be intense, so I slipped the hand she wasn't holding underneath her, and started pressing against the stretch of skin just below her pussy, trying to gauge whether she wanted something inside her. She really did, because now she was pulling at my hand, wildly grinding herself into my mouth. As one, then two, fingers found their way into her tight wetness, I felt how tense her muscles were against their sides, and pressed firmly up against her pubic bone, pushing her sex even harder into my mouth. We were like a wave in motion, every lick of her pussy starting at my waist, with one fluid movement that pushed me against her, my fingers deep into her, and her into my mouth. She followed eagerly, so my lips were in constant connection with her warm, silky skin. Her moans were erratic and her breathing heavy, adding to the bliss I felt when looking up at her beautiful blushing face. 

After what felt way too short, I sensed her abs tense up, while her pussy almost pushed my fingers out of her. I had to use a lot of force to hold her down, and I started pushing my fingers even deeper into her, stretching her inside up toward my hand on her stomach. She didn't make much noise when she came, but she got incredibly wet, to the point where my fingers fucking her started making the sexiest, sloppiest noise. I struggled to keep the rhythm with my tongue on her clit as she was bucking hard against it, almost bruising my lips. And then she let out a long deep sigh as she relaxed back on the tiny couch. She looked down at me and started caressing my hand on her hip, looking so blissful. I slid my fingers out of her slowly, watching her pussy close back up as they left her smooth inside. They were glistening with wetness, and I couldn't resist licking them. She tasted clean and, for the lack of a better word, innocent. 

I smiled at her and started standing up, feeling satisfied. I didn't have protection with me, so leaving things at this made sense. But then she flipped over on her stomach and looked back at me with a begging look, and for the first time I got a full look at her ass, right in front of me. It was the most perfect round bubble, to the point of looking perky. Her thin waist was accentuated by her pushing it out, creating a perfect, smooth, curvy line from her shoulders to her knees. ""Fuck me"" she said, calmly. I could see her pussy glistening and swollen between her thighs, and I suddenly became aware of how hard I was. Feeling my cock slide against her smooth skin was electric, and I grabbed it, pressing it against her, sliding it over her thigh, then her buttock, down her ass toward her pussy, with a firm grip at the base. As it slid over her opening I slowly pulled my foreskin back, and just groaned at the feeling of her silky labia against my glans. ""You sure?"" I asked her, and again she said ""Fuck me"", but a little more insistent this time.

Pushing into her, I had to fight the urge to just fuck her like crazy, knowing that would push me over the edge way too quickly. Her inside felt like it was tugging me into her, with warm, wet waves of intense pleasure radiating from the head of my cock into my groin. I grabbed her hips and pushed myself all the way in, making her let out a loud, deep moan, that kept going as I found a rhythm, fucking her with short deep strokes that kept as much as possible of my cock inside her, but also allowed me to push into her with force. Watching the muscles along her back play as she pressed her body back against me was beautiful, and I leaned forward, sliding my hand up against her back until I could grab her throat, right at the base, while I kept fucking her, slowly picking up the pace.  

Holding her down like this, with a firm grip and my fingers pressing against her throat, drove her crazy. She started making a grunting noise every time my cock bottomed out inside her, and I could feel her pussy gripping it harder, and at the same time getting so much wetter. Every stroke sounded more and more sloppy, and I could feel her wetness sliding down my balls, and I wanted to see it. Straightening myself I saw her glistening lips gripping my cock, pushing a thick creamy buildup down toward the base. I couldn't get enough watching it, and grabbed her hips, pulling her ass open to be able to see better. Looking at her glistening wet, beautiful, pink little asshole made my cock twitch and swell up inside her, bringing me right up to the point of orgasm. There was a ridge of creamy wetness building up right at the edge of her pussy, and I suddenly felt like every cell in my body screamed to taste it. 

I slid out, and held her open, looking at her gaping, pink opening from behind, before I put my mouth on it, frantically sliding my tongue over her pussy and asshole, trying to get as much of it into my mouth as I could. She writhed and moaned ""fuck, fuck, fuck"" as I pressed my face hard against her, locking her hips in a firm grip. I was completely taken over by desire, and started fucking her pussy with my tongue, I just couldn't get enough, and then I moved to her ass and started pushing it hard into her. Using all the force I could, I felt her asshole giving way, feeling how her strong muscle gripped the tip of my tongue, and how with every push I could get just a little bit further in. Soon I was fucking her ass with my tongue, as deep and hard as I could, holding her firmly against my lips. The feeling of wanting to lick her inside, stretching her open, controlling and consuming her body had me completely wild. I wrapped one arm across her back, while I found her pussy with the other, pushing two, then three fingers inside her, feeling her stretch against them, while my thumb found her clit. By now she was really loud, in short uncontrolled almost screams at every push into her. Even though my tongue was aching, I never wanted it to stop, timing my hand fucking and rubbing her pussy with it pushing her asshole open. 

I have no idea how long we did that, but after a while she started vibrating, then shaking, and I felt her pussy grabbing my fingers as she came. Once she came down from it, I suddenly felt how sore my tongue and jaw were, and I kind of slumped back from where I was standing on my knees. Seeing her wet, swollen pussy made it impossible not to lick her, even though I could barely move my tongue without whimpering in pain. She was just breathing heavily, lying flat on her stomach on the couch. ""What the hell was that"", she said, making me smile as I was sitting there catching my breath. She looked back at me and shook her hed, smiling, and then sat up slowly. I could see how sweaty she was around those beautiful tits, and little beads forming along her hairline. ""...you're crazy!"" she said, looking at me sitting there on the floor, panting, and slowly stroking myself. 

Then she turned herself toward me, slowly spreading her legs, and said ""You can come inside me, I just got off my period"". Even though I hesitated, it felt like such a reward, and also, now I was rock hard. I got on top, and held her legs up so we were both on the couch, and steered my cock into her. Looking her in the eyes, I started fucking her, completely focused on the sensations. The arm I'd used to fuck her was barely able to hold me up, so I leaned down on my elbows, feeling her soft and velvety skin against me, the fresh scent of her hair combined with the intense smell of sweat and sex, and how my cock was completely encompassed inside her. As we started kissing, I could feel how my already impossibly hard cock swelled up even more, making me feel every detail in her pussy clearly, how it hugged and pulled me into her, as the warmth of my orgasm started building in my groin. I grabbed her hair and held her head back, fucking her with all my force as I came, for what felt like forever, pumping my cock all the way into her. 

When it was over, I just slumped down on top of her, and caressed her cheek with my cock still inside her. She just stared at the ceiling and breathed slowly, until she looked over at me and said ""I have to go home"". I shivered from how sensitive I was as my cock slid out of her, pulling with it a stream of cum dripping onto the carpet. She was sweaty, with red patches all over her arms, face, and where I'd grabbed her, and her pussy was beautiful and swollen in that blonde patch of hair, slowly leaking. 

We dressed, and I think we both suddenly started feeling nervous, not knowing whether anyone had noticed – we had no idea what was going on in the rest of the office. I checked my phone once I got my jeans back on, and it was almost 230 am. ""Right, we probably shouldn't leave together"", I said, and gave her a kiss. She just smiled shyly, now back in her rocker outfit, but with her makeup and hair completely messed up, and kind of snuck out through the door. As I left a couple minutes later, I could hear her in the bathroom as I passed it, and there was no one on the same floor. A couple drunk colleagues were lingering where the dancefloor hade been, and I waved at them as I left, walking home feeling completely spent.

The next morning I groaned from how sore I was, in the weirdest places, like my right forearm, my knees, and my tongue. Still I managed to get to work at 9, being one of the first people there. I felt almost paranoid, thinking about what had happened just a few hours ago, and whether someone knew – that was probably just the hangover talking. I got lucky and ran into the girl in the stairwell, where she smiled at me, as I asked her ""Do we need to talk?"". ""Well, I don't think so at least"", she replied."

I'm just a curious, motivated, first year student that really wants to get involved in the compsci program and make the best out of my Western experience along the way.

Since you were all first years at one point, you must have stumbled on some great opportunities during your time at here that helped you in your upper years. 

Well I want to find some great opportunities too, but I need direction! I need to know what I should be doing, what opportunities I should be going after.

So let me ask you:

Are there any clubs that I should be joining? (I know its late but first semester was really rough)

What should I do during the summer? Learn a language? (I was thinking C++) Internship? Any particular place come to mind? With my experience (Python, and currently learning Java) will I even get opportunities?

Thanks, in advance!

A small firm has reached out to me about an internship that would start as soon as possible. They said I would be working around 20 hrs a week with an increase during tax season. I have been trying to find an internship, interviewed for some, and have been rejected. The problem is that I already have a full course load this semester with intermediate accounting 2 being one of my classes. I am afraid that this internship might interfere with my GPA. Another concern is that I want to be in audit and my guess is they will have me doing tax. I also don’t want to get stuck in a small firm. I am set to interview with them soon. I will go for the experience. Just wondering other people’s thoughts on this? Should I take it if I receive an offer? Is this too much to take on with a full course load?

Side note: The firm is really small, and so is their building. Not sure how many people work there. Their website is very dull, looks like something from 2005. All of this is okay, it just adds to my concern of how well the job will be.

I work for a small IT staffing agency out of Raleigh, NC called HireNetworks. Today I have an opening for a full stack engineer to join my (well-funded) e-commerce startup client in Durham!

Although the position is technically full stack, much of your experience will involve working on the back end, primarily in NoSQL (MongoDB experience is preferred), Node.JS, and ideally AWS. You'll also work with Wordpress, and will collaborate with front-end developers who are working in Angular. Hands-on experience with modern technology is what's really important here! A couple of years of professional experience would be nice, but if you're a new Bachelor's grad with some solid internship experience or a really strong Github portfolio, I'd love to work with you and see where things go!

The position is direct-hire full-time; target salary is $60,000 - $70,000 with some flexibility for the right fit. Please note that this company has not implemented a benefits plan yet, so definitely adjust your salary expectation accordingly, or be prepared to negotiate other factors such as a sign on bonus or additional PTO. The client is unable to sponsor visas or consider subcontractors. PM me for more info, or to get your name in the running!"
7t81pj,8,2018-01-26,Fired from p/t job 2 days ago. Looking for areas of self-improvement from this difficult experience.,Tempo_Rubato,DecidingToBeBetter,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/7t81pj/fired_from_pt_job_2_days_ago_looking_for_areas_of/,"At the start of this year, I decided to try something different and do p/t university, p/t work at the mall. I landed a job at a store involving machinery. It was fine at first and I got along with my coworker who trained me. Then the manager started training me. Manager was OK at first with just a strong personality, but soon it got worse, like she'd give me a death glare for answering a question not exactly right. That made me anxious to the point where I was afraid to make any mistakes while training. My shifts were infrequent, and I couldn't retain all knowledge after 5 days of no work when she'd only shown me the task once at her pace. She'll talk away and punch buttons without letting me try it (coworkers always let me be hands-on with machines). If I remembered 8/10 things she said, she'd yell at me over the 2/10 things I forgot. Manager later showed her true colours with yelling, threatening, saying things like ""I want to kill her"" over the phone, swearing in her language, and sometimes in front of customers too. I didn't have opportunities/guts to talk to her about her reactions. I felt like a child being scolded, not like an employee in a workplace.      
       
&amp;nbsp;

    
My last shift I was with another coworker, and I could calmly and successfully complete any task that she asked me to do. It was smooth sailing with frequent small talk until closing when I punched a critically wrong button on the cash register by mistake. I was never told it was irreversible and critical not to punch it. She had to call the manager about it and I was dismissed over the phone through a tirade of yelling.    
    
&amp;nbsp;

    
Before this I worked in volunteer jobs, a self-employed job, an internship for uni, and the most relevant is a p/t job at a clothing store 3.5yrs ago. Management at those jobs never reacted to my mistakes like this. Also in previous years, I had a rough patch in life which made me more prone to anxiety and depressive feelings. I've tried to manage these negative feelings, but they affect me on and off. The manager's behaviour was a big trigger and almost made me have a breakdown on Monday. Even though I parted on good terms with the coworkers, manager likely gossiped about me and I can forget having a good reputation with coworkers (she's gossiped to me about the coworkers too). I feel uncomfortable even being near that part of the mall.     
    
&amp;nbsp;

    
I don't want my parents knowing because they'll probably make it seem like my fault. Only 2 friends, a uni counselor I spoke to, and my boyfriend know the details. What they said was consistent with my findings when Googling about the situation, that manager was verbally abusive and controlling. They've never been treated like that for mistakes in their p/t jobs before. Bf noticed me channeling a lot of energy into my anger. I don't want to burden him with my problems, but he's the one I felt most comfortable talking to.       
    
&amp;nbsp;

    
I know I need to deal better with being under time pressure, with or without a strict manager. What if in the future the same situation happens but the job would be critical to my survival? There has to be something my coworkers (they worked there for 3 and 7 years and have a good relationship with manager) can do that I couldn't, and I want to improve on that if it's an area worth working on for the sake of future jobs. I already know I need work in conversation skills, and some minor mistakes were truly my fault because I was tired or I mind-blanked. Manager questioned my ability to perform in future jobs related to my uni studies during one of her rant sessions, and now I'm questioning the same thing.     
    
&amp;nbsp;
    

Because I can't stop trying after the first fail, I already applied to a volunteer position for an event next month related to my studies. My greater goal is to land an internship this year that's better than my previous one. What can I do to improve my overall workplace skills? Thank you for reading this half-rant-half-reachout.

7t8efo,1,2018-01-26,"Nothing gets me excited anymore, I used to be so happy.",bye-bye-vcard,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7t8efo/nothing_gets_me_excited_anymore_i_used_to_be_so/,"To start with, I'm a female who just entered her 20s. 

A year ago I never would've thought that I would be struggling with mental health but here I am. I am deeply unhappy and lonely. It seems like I'm always waiting for the next chapter of my life to begin and when it does, it's never better.

1) Moved to a new city for a 6 month internship having just started a relationship 5 hours away from my new home. Long distance drains you in a way that you never expect it to. It's like you have everything you want but it's locked in a clear plastic box and you can touch the box and admire what's inside as much as you want but you can never really truly have it.

2) Didn't manage to connect with anyone form my new life as much as I wished to, probably because I was too focused on making the relationship work. As a result, I was lonely 90% of the time, work became a game of 'how fast can 8 hours pass today' and I lived mainly for the weekends when I could visit my SO. I did not make any progress in any other aspect, 6 months of my life I am never getting back.

3) A close relative passed a month or so ago, which was the first death we've had in the family. Hit me really hard that I was far away from them and was left all alone to deal with it. I guess my best way of dealing with it was pretending it wasn't real.

4) My SO doesn't express feelings often and doesn't know how to offer emotional support which made me feel like he did not care. I know this isn't the case but why can't I stop feeling like this? Not it's come to the point where even if I feel upset, I don't want to bring it up because I don't want to be the annoying girlfriend who's always crying about something. 

5) Family life is toxic. Came back home after 6 months and discovered all they do is yell at each other for minor things and play the blame game about a thousand times per day. I really can't take this anymore.


Reddit, I am scared. I miss being a genuinely happy person but right now it feels like I will never be excited about life the same way like before. "
7t8m38,4,2018-01-26,[M4F] Care of Magical Creatures [PossibleNSFW][Discord],Dr_JS,Roleplay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/7t8m38/m4f_care_of_magical_creatures_possiblensfwdiscord/,"*It was hard for Hagrid. Hogwarts had been the only home he'd known since his childhood. He had shed blood here, in battles and to the blast ended skrewts. He had made friends here. He had found family here.*

*However, with Professor McGonagall's retirement last year, the last familiar face was gone from the school. Flitwick, Trelawny, Vector, and Sprout had all moved on to other career opportunities or to the contented boredom of retirement.* 

*Plus, at 89 years old, he was no longer as spry as he once was. His bushy beard and wild mane of hair were as silver as Dumbledore's had been. His joints ached and his back was tight. He could no longer, single handedly, carry the 12 Christmas trees into the Great Hall. He could no longer remember the names of the Centaur foals or keep track of his teaching duties. It was time to retire.* 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had some large shoes to fill, both figuratively and otherwise, taking over duties for Hagrid. He had been the grounds keeper for longer than many could remember and a very capable Care of Magical Creatures teacher to boot. He was my favorite teacher during my time at Hogwarts and, if I allow myself a hint of immodesty, I believe I was one of his favorite students. Not to take away from the famed witches and wizards that he knew. But, I think he saw a bit of himself in me. Most wizards, after all, are an indoor lot. They relish their libraries, their bubbling cauldrons, and dark lairs of contemplation. Hagrid and I were of a different sort. 

Growing up, I relished the woods behind my home. Hiking. Swimming. Climbing. Running. Searching every nook and cranny, aching to soak up each droplet of sunlight and understand every square inch of my small kingdom. I had an affinity for animals, even then. They found me, ran with me, played with me, and protected me. I didn't know it, then, for what it was... Magic. 

Muggle born and unsure what to think when I received my letter, I arrived at Hogwarts and, unlike my classmates, felt drawn not to the Castle with all of its glittering candles and translucent ghosts but to the forest and the lake... I could hear them, calling me. Their voices were so much more complex than the ones I had heard growing up. The animals behind my house were babbling toddlers and these creatures were speaking. I could hear the unicorns, the squid, even the acromantula. I relished the subtle variations in their auras, the minute differences in the way I sensed them. None of this even came close to my elation at meeting the Centaur or the Merpeople. 

I was sorted into Ravenclaw and thrived in all my subjects, though Care of Magical Creatures was my speciality. I earned 8 OWLs and 5 NEWTs (Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Herbology, and, of course, Care of Magical Creatures). Yet, I didn't spend my free time studying in the Library. Instead, every spare moment would find me running through the grounds, climbing in the forest, swimming with the giant squid, or visiting with Hagrid. 

He took an interest in me. Tutored me. Fostered my love for all creatures, the magical and the mundane. When I graduated, he even contacted a close friend of his, Charlie Weasley, and got me a summer internship studying Dragons in Romania.

After graduation, I spent the next 5 years following in the footsteps of the great Newt Scamander. I explored the wilds of the world, cataloging and updating many of his entries in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" and trying to make my own mark on Magizoology. 

I was in Greece, studying the mating and nesting habits of Griffons, when I received Hagrid's letter. He told me of his plans to retire and that he had suggested my name to the new Headmaster as his replacement. He asked if I would be interested. I dropped everything. Like Hagrid, my time at Hogwarts was the happiest of my life and being a teacher there had always been my dream. Once more, the old game's keeper was looking out for me. 

And, so, a new adventure begins... The sun glinting bright off the windows of the castle and the surface of the lake, I stand, awaiting the arrival of my very first class. So much to learn, so little time.

I've also had a past history with depression through my early adolescent years, and went to a behavioral hospital where I was evaluated back in the eighth grade when I was about 13. I had a very rough upbringing from having abusive parents and my house burning down at the time which had a traumatic effect on me then.

Over the past six years, I've simply grown out of that and have been moving forward towards gaining a better career and life.

Thanks y’all,dallub,AskNYC,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/7t9dkh/help_texan_with_moving_to_nyc_for_advertising/,"First let me explain, I am graduating college from Texas Tech university soon and am an Advertising Major with an Electronic Media Communications minor. Where is the best place in the world for advertising? NYC. Now don’t try to talk me into a different city because right now that where I am set on. I grew up in a very small town in Texas and then moved just north of Dallas (large city) in high school. Where I went to college could also be considered a small town. So anyways I just have some questions for locals. Now some  of these questions might seem weird or funny to you but again I’m a small town Texas at heart so just keep that in mind. 

You don’t have to answer all of these I know it’s a lot of questions—-

1. (Going to start with a very Texan question) price of beer? I love beer and here in Texas you can get a 30 rack of miller light for $25. Keystone (if you’re just partying and don’t care) for $19. Are the beer prices about the same there? Do they even sell 30 racks in NYC? I’m not looking for draft beer prices at restaurants but rather case prices at grocery stores.

2. What is your favorite place to catch some cheap beer and food for happy hour in NYC? (Visiting soon and want to try some places)

3. What is the night life bar scene like? Here in Texas the bar scene is amazing. Fun environments and everybody comes and parties together.

4. If I kept my style of wrangler jeans and cowboy boots would I get weird looks? Here in Texas that’s common af. We just have pairs of wranglers and boots out the ass because well it’s warm and comfy.

5. How hard is it to get an advertising job in nyc? Would I be easier to come to the city first then look for one or maybe apply online while in Texas and try to get some offers while still here?

6. What can I expect to make in my first advertising job? I plan on doing account management or copywriting. I’ve got some great internships with well known companies on my resume but what did you start at?

7. I really want the Manhattan experience  but is Brooklyn or somewhere like that really worth the cheaper rent if you include travel cost to manhattan everyday?

8. What are the prices of travel? I love to walk or bike so I’ll probably stick to that as much as I can but how much does a ride on the subway cost on average?

9. Good areas I should look for cheap rent? And areas I should avoid for high crime

10. When I’m broke are there really like $1 pizza places I can survive off of? If so what’s the best ones!

THANK YOU! I appreciate any answers 
have a good day and WRECKEM TECH"

But I just wanted to share a positive story that happened today. I intern for a state assemblymember in California and today I was tasked to be her rep for a public hearing concerning the poverty and obstacles POC men and boys face and possible solutions.

The hearing was being run by three other assemblymembers and they had 3 different sets of panels to discuss the issue.  There were actually some pretty left ideas being thrown around and getting applause and agreement from the crowd and elected officials and some of these were:

* UBI
* Free Pre-K
* Free college
* Bail Reform
* Guaranteed Housing
* Criminal Justice reform
* Reallocation of the marijuana tax money (currently 20% goes to law enforcement)
* Converting prisons to centers of learning
* and a bunch of others.

One of the assemblymembers is trying to procure $100 million dollars to combat what he calls Post-traumatic ""Street"" Disorder, which is aimed at helping those who have been incarcerated or in gang life and are trying to be rehabilitated.

I actually came out that hearing really positive and optimistic. So I thought I'd share."

Every semester we get at least one student with mental health issues who says or does something strange, so nothing surprises me anymore.  I smile politely and respond with a noncommittal “Oh really?” as I hand him the books he’s checked out.       
“Yeah.  You don’t have to worry though, he’s a nice guy.”        
The interns who haven’t adjusted to the weird things that happen on campus snicker and I give them a dirty look of reproach.  Nevertheless, Ceiling Man becomes an office joke.  Every time something goes missing, every time a piece of equipment misbehaves it gets blamed on Ceiling Man.  Every strange noise the weekend crew hears in the deserted building is attributed to him.        
“Don’t be absurd,” I chastise them.  “Ceiling Man isn’t doing any of those things.”      
But the stories persist, and over the years he goes from being an office joke to our own homegrown urban legend.  Inevitably, at some point after they’ve been hired, I’ll be approached by a wide-eyed intern who says, “Is it true that someone used to live in the ceiling and they’d take things and break stuff?”       
Last summer we were replacing our security cameras.  I asked for volunteers to help me out, but mostly I wanted someone to hand tools to me and keep the cables from getting tangled.  I was halfway up the eight-foot ladder when my helper nervously whispered, “Watch out for Ceiling Man.”         
I sighed and rolled my eyes and took a few steps back down the ladder to snatch a flashlight before returning to my perch.  “Look, I promise you there’s nothing to worry about.  I’ll look for myself.”       
Bracing my hands on the corners of the ceiling tile I pushed up hard and a mixture of dust, mouse shit, dead bugs and insulation rained down on us.  Once the coughing and ineffectual attempts to brush off debris had subsided I slid the tile to the side, stepped further up the ladder, turned on my flashlight and swept its beam across the expanse of pipes and air ducts.  “Hmm…nope.” I punctuate the statement with an exaggerated shrug.  “Satisfied?”  The intern nods, still a bit wide-eyed and I return to the business at hand.           
I didn’t tell her about the figure sitting propped against the largest air return duct with sickly greenish gray flesh and empty eye sockets, their occupants long since rotted away.  The swollen purple lips were pulled down into a fierce scowl.  When I first saw him, he was smiling but his expression has been changing a bit every year.  I think he’s getting tired of being blamed for everything.

7t9gd4,4,2018-01-26,My [24F] boyfriend [25M] won't have a conversation about marriage. We've been together for six years.,throwaway4eva987625,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7t9gd4/my_24f_boyfriend_25m_wont_have_a_conversation/,"Tom and I have been together for six years. We met when we were 18 and 19 years old  and have been going strong since. We grew up in the same city, but I didn't meet him until he had already moved away for college. My parents moved nearly 3 hours away right before my official high school graduation. We ended up going to the same university, but our breaks were generally spent apart. Last year I was in a different state for an internship, but we still saw each other every month. We currently live together in the house he owns. We both have good jobs and contribute equally to the household. (I pay him rent and do most of the household chores since he lets me live here for super cheap.)

Here's where our issue is. We've been together for six years, but I have no idea when we'll get married. We both want too but it has never been up for serious discussion. He is the only one out of his group of high school friends and our college friends to have zero debt and own a house. He makes good money and owns several cars (he's a car fanatic.) I graduated a year late, have tons of student loan debt, but I have a decent paying job in the healthcare field. With our current arrangement I could pay off my loans in about five years. My point is: money is not an issue in our relationship. BUT he will not have a conversation about marriage.

Before my internship we talked about our future and he said he thought we could get married after we'd been living together for a year. Which is logical. We've both lived all over the place, so knowing we can be good roommates and handle day to day life with each other is important. We have dog and a cat together. We spend time with our mutual friends and our own friends equally. We have date nights and have plenty of quality time with each other. Our relationship is great.

He understands I won't change my last name if we get married. He even suggested our children take my name. We have agreed on how many kids to have, how we want to raise them, and what is most important to us in life. We are incredibly compatible. We have literally talked about everything every couple should talk about before marriage. 

I have tried a couple times discussing an engagement. I even straight up asked him ""are we ever going to have a serious discussion about marriage?"" His response: ""yeah."" And that was it. I tried pressing more and I got nothing in response.

Well, now all our friends are getting engaged. All of his high school friends (who are, honestly, pretty immature) are getting engaged and they are incredibly happy. We have gone to every engagement party and several weddings and these guys have seriously matured since I first met them. All of their wives/fiances are wonderful women. But, they like to makes hints at when Tom will pop the question. He laughs it off every single time. I plaster a smile on my face and say ""ohh we will eventually but we're not in any kind of rush."" I pretend it doesn't bother me. 

I'm reaching the end of my rope. It's been nearly 8 months since I moved in and we have not had any kind of conversation about an engagement.  I don't want to give birth three times after the age of 35, which is a possibility at this point. Everyone thinks we're going to get engaged soon but I honestly don't see it happening. He has played it off for so long like we will, but he won't talk about it.

My main question: am I right to feel insecure about this?? I don't want to be the marriage crazed girlfriend but it's been six years and we're both in a good place financially. How do I bring this up AGAIN?

Tl;dr: my boyfriend of six years doesn't seem to care about getting married."
7t9m7k,141,2018-01-26,"Got club scheduling confused, ended up with an internship offering",throwaway5436542,ActLikeYouBelong,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActLikeYouBelong/comments/7t9m7k/got_club_scheduling_confused_ended_up_with_an/,"**Before you read, please note: I do not know if I can get in trouble for this and I do not know if the recruiter would get in trouble for this.  Therefore, I will keep the post as vague as possible and not provide proof.  I'm not asking you to believe me or take my word as gosple.  I am simply here to share a story.**

The story starts 2 weeks ago.  It's my Junior year in college and I am very asocial.  I usually just hang out with my girlfriend or play minecraft in my spare time.  Around christmas,  I decided that this would be the semester were I leave my room and join a club.  Being a HR major, I decided I would join the HR club.  We did the usual orientation meeting and I met a lot of cool people.  When leaving, we were told:  General meetings will be in this room at 4:30 on Wednesdays.  We will have socials on Saturdays at 9:00.  Every week will either have a general meeting or a social.  I got an email later that day saying the first social would be next week and the first meeting would be the following week.

This week rolls around and I'm bumping into people from the club.  It's kinda cool to have people you can say hi to in the business school and it makes me feel like I'm part of something bigger.  I'm all hyped up for the first meeting and somehow in my brain, ""the following week"" turned into ""next week"" which of course, meant ""this week"".  

So sure enough, at 4:30 on Wednesday, I walk into the room where we have their meetings and there is a club there.  I only met the new people and senior officers at orientation so I don't think much of it.  I don't know anyone there and nobody knows me, but its the start of the semester and nobody thinks much of it.  

Some professionals from a national company come in and begin to talk to us about social branding.  It's not what I expected from a ""general meeting"" but because I  never had one before, I didn't think about it too much.  I can't see the person to sign in with and the people who need my paperwork aren't there.  This makes me worry a little.  An electronic sign in sheet goes around and this calms my worries.  This must be how they're taking roll.  She keeps mentioning the management club and how management is important, but she never says the club by name.  Again, I feel like something is slightly off, but I'm engaged and nobody else seems confused so I just ignore it.

About halfway through the presentation, she says the name of the club.  I don't process it at first, but about 20 seconds later it hits me.  None of the club mates are here.  Nobody has the same paperwork I do.  Nobody has the club shirts on.  This is the business admin club.  I'm not in the first club meeting.  I'm in a seminar that I didn't sign up for, and nobody noticed.

I go into a slight panic.  It's my first club meeting and I'm missing it because my dumb ass walked into the wrong room.  I'm in the middle of the class so I start thinking about my plan.  How do I worm out of this room?  What do I say when I get to the right meeting?   Should I just skip it?  I slyly pull out my schedule and check the room number.  It's what I expected.  ""Am I in the wrong building?""  ""Is this the room I think it is"".  I had 3 classes in this room so I'm sure I'm right.  Finally I double check the date.  I realize my original mistake, and take comfort in the fact that once I leave this room, I can disappear and nobody will know the difference.

After coming to that conclusion, I had to weigh my options.  I could simply walk out like I have to use the restroom and not show up again.  *Or* I could just stay here and leave with everyone else.  I figure I have nothing better to do and the seminar is interesting, so I decide to stay.  After all, if nobody figured out that I wasn't supposed to be here, they probably won't in the next half hour.  After all, I'm not disrupting the club in any way and they won't be better off if I leave.

So I hang around and keep participating in the discussion.  It's all relevant to my career so I'm taking notes and in general enjoying it.  Another sheet goes around where they ask the rising seniors (juniors who will graduate next year) to sign it and provide contact info.  I'm worried that they'll catch on if I do, but I sign it anyway.  They then want people to play a game for starbucks cards.  The presenter asks me if I want to come up.  

Ohshit.png.  Hell no.  I'm not going to stand up in front of everyone, take handouts that were paid for with club funds, and leave never to return.  I see my neighbor wants to go up so I say she can go up because she'll probably have better use for the cards than me.  Everyone is happy and the game goes on.  She gets some free coffee and I don't have to blow my cover.

Finally they end the presentation and break for snacks and a group picture.  I don't feel like stealing food I didn't pay for, so I slip out in the chaos of the feeding frenzy.  

Yesterday, I got an email from the presenter offering me a full-time internship that paid double minimum wage.  Apparently she was impressed with my activeness and selflessness (even though I was only trying to cover my ass).  When I told her that I wasn't in the club, was there by mistake, and only stayed because the info was useful, she seemed even more interested in me.  I guess they really want someone who wants to better themselves, even if he is a forgetful idiot at times.

Again, IDK if I stole that internship opportunity from anyone in the club.  IDK if I can get in trouble for taking part in a seminar I didn't pay or sign up for.  IDK if the recruiter would get in trouble for portentially breaking the policy.  IDK if the club I crashed will be mad at me for crashing them and ditching.  There are only 2 clubs in my school that meet on wednesdays at 4:30 so any info regarding the state, the company, the school or club names was withheld.  I will not be replying to questions that could be used to figure out who or where I am.  I will not be providing the email evidence.    Thanks for reading

**TL;DR  Got dates mixed up, went to wrong meeting, stayed because whynot.jpg, got offered internship by presenters.**"
7tb8a3,1,2018-01-27,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7tb8a3/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
7tc64g,435,2018-01-27,[LONG POST] This is how it took me 7 years to finish my first manuscript,Himself89,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/7tc64g/long_post_this_is_how_it_took_me_7_years_to/,"I've read posts celebrating first drafts. Having recently completed my first draft, I thought ya’ll might find my timeline instructive. Perhaps you will recognize yourself on this timeline. Don't lose the faith! There are dozens of us! *Dozens!*

* **Summer 2004-** My first summer job introduces drama to my otherwise ordinary life.
* **Summer 2011-** As a senior in college, I decide to take a creative writing class. I am hooked. I experience a ""*this is what I was put on earth to do*"" moment.
* **Fall 2011-** I learn the mantra ""write what you know"" from my writing professor. I decide to write a short story about the summer of ‘04 (now seven years past) in the third person. My story is twenty-seven pages long. 
* **Spring 2012-** I read *Jesus' Son* by Denis Johnson. I rewrite my Summer ’04 short story, copying Johnson’s prose style and swapping the tense to first person. This is a 100%-rewrite, start-from-scratch draft. I submit this story to a prestigious writing summer conference. I fail to gain admission.
* **Summer 2012-** I graduate from college and decide to spend a year writing and reading to hone my craft. To fund my funemployment, I have saved $9,000 from winning essay contests. During 2012, I get up every day at 6am and write until noon. In the afternoons, I freelance. My 1099 tax form that years totals $16,000 earned wages. I read about thirty books, one hundred short stories, and write ten short stories of my own. 
* **Summer 2012 (also)-** I begin to plot out and research an ambition dystopian novel. After three months plotting, two chapters written, and hundreds of hours invested, I realize this is far outside my abilities as a writer. I abandon the project. It sucked.
* **Fall 2012-** Six months of funemployment down, I feel pressure to do something with my life. I apply for eleven fully-funded MFA programs using short stories developed during funemployment. Applications cost me about $1500, the last of my money. 
* **Winter 2012-** I freak out about my application stories. I realize they’re incredible overwrought and lack substance, but it’s too late; I’ve applied to eight of eleven programs. In a frenzy, I pull my Summer ’04 story from a drawer and rewrite it in three days. I submit this story to the final three MFA programs.
* **Spring 2013-** My girlfriend dumps me. I’m a 23-year-old loser working odd jobs with no skills, no money, and a drawer full of bad short stories — but I’m well read! Day after day, I check my email hoping for good news. After admission season ends, I’ve been rejected by ten MFA programs.
* **Summer 2013-** In early June, I’m unexpectedly admitted to one MFA program off of the waitlist. It’s fully funded! The dream! The program admitting me received my Summer ‘04 story. But after consulting my friends in MFA and my professors, I realize I'm not ready.
* **August 2013-** I turn down my admission and move to New York where I've just landed an internship. I tell myself I’m going to have Interesting Life Experiences™ and forestall my MFA for one or two years.
* **Summer – Fall 2013 –** My internship ends and I’m hired. I have a real job now. I work from 9am-6pm every day, often staying late. I begin to wake up at 5am to write before work. When I'm hung over, I get up at seven to squeeze in a quick hour of editing. Since college, I’ve been submitting each of my short stories to major literary magazines. By this point, I’ve accumulated more than one hundred rejection letters. I keep a spent scratch off ticket above my writing desk onto which I’ve written the words “YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL” in red sharpie. 
* **Spring 2014 -** I grow frustrated I can't get published. In an epiphany, I decide I should write a novel. Screw the lit mags! I consider restarting the dystopian epic but think better. One snowy January morning, I begin expanding my Summer ’04 story. I have a lot of material. After one coffee-fueled week, my thirty-page story is one hundred pages. 
* **Summer 2014-** I am promoted at work, move apartments, and get new roommates. Major life changes destroy my writing routine. I don’t write for 6 months. I tell my new roommates that I’m working on a rough draft and that if I don’t finish by Christmas, I’m going to throw myself off the roof of our apartment building (jokes!).
* **Fall 2014-** I re-read *The Art of Fielding* and read *A Visit From The Goon Squad*. I feel these books capture the novel as I want to write it. My 150-page draft is in first person, so I revise the entire thing to be third person like these books. 
* **Winter 2014-** Because of my big rewrite, I don’t finish my draft by New Year’s Eve. I don’t jump off the building. I still write in the mornings before work, but I have a career now. Work travel and frequent adjustments to my schedule force me to skip many days of writing. 
* **Spring 2015-** I am doing research to better understand my characters. In one instance, I read a 700-page book on the Grateful Dead. 
* **Summer 2015 -** I fall very deeply in love and begin a new relationship. This throws off my writing schedule again. Once more, I tell friends I’m working on a rough draft and that if I don’t finish by Christmas, I’m going to throw myself off the roof of my apartment building.
* **November 2015-** After writing on my novel constantly for one-and-a-half years, it's only half finished. I'm advancing in my career and finding less and less time to write. At the suggestion of a friend, I (reluctantly) participate in NaMoWriMo. We begin attending meet ups and group writing sessions. I find the people really eclectic and nice. I write mornings, nights, and weekends. I crest 150,000 words. My book is 326 pages. As the month concludes, I finish the penultimate chapter of my book. This is not the ending. But it is an ending. The rough draft is done.
* **Spring 2016-** After three months focusing on other projects, I begin the first major rewrite. The old adage proves true: “You don’t know what your book is about until you finish it.” I realize I have heavy lifting to do on this draft. After two years, the real work has just begun. I’m expanding sections, adding characters, deleting entire chapters, rewriting almost every sentence. Once I’m halfway done, I let my partner read the first half of the draft. She has major feedback, but is mostly complimentary. She says, “I don't think people would say reading this was a waste of time.”
* **Summer 2016-** I get a new job and relocate cities, but I refuse to let this throw off my writing. It does anyway. 
* **Fall 2016-** I begin the second major rewrite of my rough draft, using my partner’s notes as a guide. I tell my partner I’ll throw myself off our building if I don’t finish by New Year’s Eve.
* **New Year’s Eve 2016-** I’m not even close to finished. The book is poor — so much junk DNA. With each new chapter revision, I see more areas for improvement. I’m reminded of Zeno’s Dichotomy: each time I get halfway finished, I spend an equal amount of time getting to the next halfway point, and the next, and the next. Editing is infinite but time is finite. The writer’s paradox!
* **Winter 2017-** My latest draft is now 10% shorter and each sentence is much better. I have rewritten the intro chapters at least fifteen times. I’m beginning to feel proud of this book. 
* **Spring 2017 -** I begin another, final, start-to-finish rewrite (number 4) and promise friends if I don't finish it by summer, I will jump off the roof of my new building. By this point, they know I’m full of shit. Somehow the book changes more with each rewrite, instead of less. It doesn’t feel like refinement; it feels like each rewrite helps me understand what the book is really about, and shift everything to be in service of this. 
* **Summer 2017-** After getting busy at work, I lose my groove and put aside the novel. I go eight weeks without writing. Once I pick it up again, I start editing from the beginning, all over again. The fifth rewrite begins.
* **Fall – Winter 2017-** The endless rewrites. For three years, I’ve been reading other fiction books for research instead of fun. I’ve had my head totally in this project. I’ve been promoted again, and my career constantly gets in the way of my work. In any given month, I only write for two weeks. I’m growing desperate. I fear I’ll never finish. After a really rough week at work, I consider putting this dream aside altogether.
* **Christmas 2017-** I take a week off to do major rewriting. This is the sixth rough draft now, but who’s counting? I work my old hours, getting up at 6am and writing until noon. This bleeds into the New Year. 
* **January 2018-** At long last, I write the book’s final chapter. The manuscript has been rewritten six times from start to finish, and some sections more than twenty times. I take a few days break then edit the newest parts over again, and again, and one more time. Finally I’m satisfied. 
* **Today:** I am 28 years old. I have exported my manuscript to pdf. It is sixty chapters long and 115,870 words. At long last, I’m going to send the draft to a few close friends for feedback before I send to agents. It has taken four years to get here since choosing to expand my short story into a novel. I have a “cut sections” document that is longer than the original thirty-page short story. I have lived in nine different apartments in five different cities since I started working on this draft. This fall will mark seven years since I wrote that story, and the events themselves occurred fourteen years ago in the summer of 2004. 


The task ahead can seem impossible, but if I can get there, anyone can. Writing is a lonely and thankless hobby, but it’s one I could not choose to abandon. I hope, in reading this, you can relax, enjoy your life, and, most importantly, keep writing. While writing this book, I’ve gathered new material and completed an outline for my next book. I’m going to start working on that new project after I finish writing this sentence. See you in seven years.

If I waved my magic wand tonight and caused you to wake up with half as much muscle mass, so that you struggle to get up again when you sit down and struggle to keep yourself from falling down while walking, would you thank me for that? Would you be happy about the fact that you can't climb up the mountains anymore, that a journey by bicycle or a hike through the forest becomes torturous?

What if you could take a pill, that ensures you're less intelligent, so that you struggle to express your thoughts, have no desire to read complex books anymore, can't comprehend new societal and technological developments and can't hold onto your present job any longer, would you head to the pharmacy to take it?

If you could take a pill, that enlarges the size of your prostate, so that you eventually struggle to hold your urine and fear going out because you might pee your pants at unpredictable moments, how much would you be willing to pay for that? Gentlemen, do you ever use a razor blade to remove hair from your head, to make it appear as if your hairline is receding? Here's one for the ladies: If the supermarket had a new kind of fruit that removes fat from your hips and thighs and shifts it to your stomach area, would you stock up on that fruit?

The answer to these questions is probably a resounding no. You are gradually transforming into a state of being that you're not looking forward to. Your body is gradually deteriorating, along with your mind. It's something you're unable to stop, although through great effort you might manage to slow it down a little and through great stupidity you're able to slightly speed it up.

You would never choose to have this happen to you, or to anyone you like. You would hate it if your twenty year old daughter suddenly looked like a forty year old woman. At the same time, you probably feel uncomfortable with the fact that there are those around us, who don't feel like making peace with this prospect at all.

We're not actively hated, in the way that some people are, but our mentality is nonetheless seen as dangerous, selfish, pathological or unhealthy. We get sly remarks in the media, that all the advocates for the elimination of aging are wealthy white men. Peter Thiel is accused of being some kind of vampire, because of his association with research that gives young blood to elderly people.

I seem to have a weak spot for smart men with enormous beards. Aubrey de Grey has observed this odd relationship we have to aging. He believes that we have developed a kind of psychological strategy to cope with the fact that we're gradually deteriorating. He calls this the pro-aging trance. Because we have lived for generations with the reality of gradually deteriorating and turning into a burden on our family and society, we have developed a cultural attitude towards this phenomenon that pretends we should put up with it. 

This attitude made sense when we had no methods to address aging. Now that we are in the process of developing treatments for aging that genuinely have a significant effect, our outdated cultural approach to aging is as harmful as many of our other outdated cultural attitudes. Today, our sentimental approach to the reality of aging means that we are putting up with a source of suffering that has no genuine justification.

Some will say that it is unnatural to eliminate aging. I don't think this is a justified response. We have eliminated other natural forms of suffering, that nobody seems to desire to return to. Consider that back in the 19th century, we had infant mortality rates of around 25%. It was quite common for parents to watch half their children die. People did not just simply put up with this, they were horrified and greatly saddened by this reality. There were plenty of parents who spent their whole lives grieving, because they lost their children.

I don't see anyone today suggest that we should have to put up with such a reality. We can return to this more natural reality, by getting rid of modern sanitation, returning to a diet of cereal grains and eliminating modern medicine, but I don't notice a lot of people eager to volunteer. It's completely unnatural for us to raise 99 of every 100 children into adulthood, but I never notice anyone complain about it.

To me, the next step seems self-evident. The immediate goal to pursue here isn't to get rid of death altogether, as that's simply not a relevant goal within our day and age. If an earthquake strikes and your house collapses, there's nothing we can do about it. No, the goal we are interested in, is to prevent the source of indignity and suffering that afflicts all of us, provided we live long enough. Aging, is not something I would wish upon people. 

To seek to avoid aging is not selfish. Aging in others is not something we benefit from either. I don't benefit from the fact that my country has a quarter million people who suffer dementia. I don't benefit from the fact that millions of people in my country have reached the age where they're too old to be genuinely capable of working. I don't benefit from the fact that women lose their fertility in my society before they reach the age where they feel ready to have children. 

I can't think of a way through which aging happens to benefit me. ""What about the fact that old people hoard resources?"" You might wonder. I think this is largely a consequence of aging itself. Old people become risk-aversive and fearful of embarking on new endeavors. If old people genuinely end up hoarding resources, the best solution would be to implement greater wealth taxes. Finally, in the kind of world where new therapies would increase our healthspan, old people would forego hoarding resources, to spend their wealth on therapies that increase their health.

On the other hand, I can think of plenty of ways in which a world without aging would benefit me. I would like to be eighty years old and still able to climb onto mountains or dive into caves. I would like to stay mentally sharp for as long as I exist. I'm fearful of the day when I'll never have anything clever to say again, when I lose my ability to deliver anything meaningful to others, when I'm no longer able to entertain concepts that I could comprehend in the past. I actively take measures that I believe, based on the scientific research I've read, allow me to function at my cognitive optimum. Will it make a profound difference? Perhaps not, but if I live long enough, I'll hopefully gain access to treatments that allow me to maintain my optimal state even longer.

What I know all too well, is what I don't look forward to. I don't look forward to what I have witnessed when I would visit my grandmothers in the nursing home. I don't look forward to becoming too frail to walk. I don't look forward to suffering strokes that leave me unable to talk, or diabetes that leaves me unable to see. I don't look forward to having to wear a diaper again. If I can't be what I want to be, if I eventually find myself imprisoned in a hollow shell of what I used to be, then I will quite happily choose to leave my body altogether. I do not fear death, but I do fear degradation.

In a world where people age, I'm blessed to be a man. Young women don't know how blessed they are, but old women know all too well how blessed young women are. Consider the whining of young Hollywood celebrities, who complain about the fact that a powerful man might have let his hand slip after having a few too many drinks. Who complains about the fact that this happens to them are young pretty woman in their twenties. 

Middle-aged women who have spent fortunes to hold onto the vestiges of the good looks they enjoyed in their twenties, know all too well that to be a beautiful young woman is such a blessing that you shouldn't complain about it. Brigitte Bardot and a number of other prominent French women recently signed a statement in which they pointed out that the hysterical feminism of Hollywood celebrities is effectively the equivalent of a princess sleeping on a pea, whose complaints threaten to release a new wave of cultural puritanism. 

Consider John Lasseter, the founder of Pixar, who had his career destroyed and his name dragged through the mud, because he enjoyed hugging young women. What kind of person do you have to be, to attack such a man years after you last met him? You either say no to your boss and make clear to him that you do not consent to his hugs or you keep your mouth shut. If you choose to abuse your privileged position as a good looking young woman, you're not just damaging John Lasseter, you're leaving millions of men in a position where they feel as if they could become the sudden victim of a witch hunt at any moment.

What particularly annoys me here, is the discrepancy between how innate human behavior is judged. Consider that a young woman, who poaches a middle-aged man away from his wife, tends to get away with her behavior. If anything, she is going to succeed at portraying herself as the victim, even if the children end up growing up without their father. We innately think of a young woman as innocent, even when her behavior is manipulative and machiavellian. In contrast, a normal middle-aged man, who can not resist his innate biological desires, is at risk of social ostracism and legal consequences if a young woman dares to make a complaint about it.

This phenomenon happens every generation. Entitled young women gradually find themselves transforming into women who desperately try to cling onto a source of power that is slipping from their hands. The clock continues to tick and once you hit thirty, it's over. You might still be beautiful for a while, men may still be eager to be with you, but the world no longer revolves around you the way it once did and it never again will. We don't appreciate the gifts of beauty and fertility until it is too late. We write feminist diatribes and pose as innocent victims, until our ovaries cease to function and we start to recognize our own former arrogance in those who have now started to blossom.

To me, there is a relatively simple solution to this. A woman in her forties, who has gained the wisdom of experience, should still be endowed with the beauty and fertility of youth. If men in their forties had beautiful wives at home, then young women would have to suck it up and cease complaining about the peas beneath their mattresses. We can not have a healthy society, if males from the ages of fifteen until death all pursue young women aged in their early twenties, while settling for older women as second best. The biggest inequality in existence, is not between black and white people, or rich and poor people, but between old women and young women. It is a form of inequality that harms all of us. 

Perhaps most important to understand, is that this form of inequality that is damaging our society is relatively new. In 19th century England, being a young woman sucked. There was an abundance of young women, because many women died during childbirth or from other ailments, while young men left England to settle foreign lands. Many families bemoaned the fact that their daughters would never marry and unless they were willing to live as mistresses of old married land-owning men, they would end up as spinsters. 

The privileged state of being a young woman came about in first world nations after the end of the second world war, once everyone's life expectancy began to increase, while young Western men no longer left to settle foreign countries but young men from non-western nations did begin to migrate to Western nations. The peak point of privilege came about once our birth rates began to drop dramatically, as now a young twenty year old woman would have a big range of suitable partners. The young woman could now place a variety of excessive demands upon her mate to be, while a variety of white knights will seek to score cheap points to gain her favor.

To have a society where people are genuinely equal and where men don't have to fear losing their job at the company they helped start because they felt like hugging a new young intern twenty years ago, it's necessary to ensure women can spend a longer share of their lives living in a state of optimal fertility and beauty. This is in everyone's best interest and it's a necessary aspect of protecting Western nations against the looming prospect of demographic annihilation.

To illustrate why I expect we will succeed at this endeavor, I would like to get into some more detail about how would we go about accomplishing this. To start with, an important problem that women fall victim to is that their fat reserves begin to decline. During puberty, a woman builds up feminine fat reserves that are used to nourish the brains of any children she might have, during pregnancy and lactation. As a woman ages, these fat reserves are diminished. A woman aged fifty can still have a healthy looking body, but she will inevitably have to work hard, to replace muscle with fat and thereby conceal her age.

This happens because humans build up senescent cells in our body, that prevent our fat reserves from regenerating. We build up senescent cells in the fat reserves beneath our skin, which then cause the fat to disappear by prohibiting our non-senescent cells from reproducing. This causes thin looking skin and brings an end to a woman's hour-glass shaped figure. We now have drugs that allow us to [eliminate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4051295/) the senescent preadipocytes that cause this problem. Once these cells are removed, the surviving healthy cells are free again to regenerate decaying tissues.

The skin itself can also be restored with relative ease. As we age, our dermis thins, while our stratum thickens. Regular exercise reverses this trend, thereby allowing you to have healthy looking skin at an older age. In addition, vitamin C and Aloe Vera applied directly onto the skin on a regular basis allows the dermis to repair itself and produce more collagen. What's important to understand is that people age in different ways. To preserve youth, every form of aging has to be addressed. Thus, both the fat reserves beneath the skin need to be maintained, as well as the thickness of the skin itself.

In a similar manner, we can prevent or even reverse menopause. The human body is programmed to lose fertility, to prevent women from competing for scarce resources with their own daughters. This problem can be [addressed](https://gizmodo.com/the-crazy-plan-to-restore-a-womans-fertility-and-defy-t-1793011031), by using concentrated blood factors, that are injected into the ovary. This is not a permanent solution, more elegant solutions will come into existence over time, but for now it can already deliver us a tremendously useful contribution to addressing aging. Over time, we will develop even better therapies, until eventually we reach the point where a woman aged forty could not be distinguished from one aged twenty, unless the two of them would open their mouths and speak."

I am a SAHM of an almost 4 year old and a 20 month old, both boys. They are AMAZING! However, I can't stop being sad about them growing up. I am so, so thankful that they are healthy and CAN grow up, as so many other children never get the chance to. But I look at their little faces, and I cry. I pull up younger pictures, I cry. I think about it, and the tears flow.


I don't really have a reason, though. I did have ppd after my second son was born, but they upped my dose of my depression and anxiety medications, and it has changed a few times since. In general, I was ok for a while.


Not only is it the sadness that is controlling my life, but now I don't want to get rid of any of their baby clothes or toys because of course, I am reminded of them being little. Anything else in my house, get rid of it, I hate clutter, take it. But those things, I don't WANT to keep them, but am too sad to give any of it away.


I do see a therapist, but don't feel like I've gotten anywhere really. She thinks I feel deep regret for not being the mom I want to be, thus beating myself up, which is totally true (I have a history of not loving myself) but I feel like there's so much more I just can't put my finger on. I really like her, and she actually wants me to see one of her interns to see if they can help further.


Has anyone else experienced this? It's getting worse, and I just don't want to be sad. I feel like it is making me miss out on making memories because I don't want to forget the old ones. Thanks so much for reading this!"
7tds4k,3,2018-01-27,Seeking Advice on my Standing with a Professor for MEXT 2019 Scholarship (Embassy),hawtdawgsandwich,movingtojapan,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/7tds4k/seeking_advice_on_my_standing_with_a_professor/,"Hey everyone. I'd like to ask for advice regarding my situation with my looming application for the MEXT Scholarship (Embassy).

A little background to explain my situation:

So about a week ago I participated in an event hosted by Kyoto University. The event was kind of unusual where I live: potential graduate students get to have 1-on-1 interviews with actual professors from the university. The event had a screening process and I essentially got into that shortlist of potential students. Cool.

So when the real thing happened, the professor I really wanted to talk to wasn't present (sad) and the professors suggested that I get in touch with him. I'm currently trying via email. Alas, no response yet.

Given that, my questions:

1. Do you think that the whole shtick with KyotoU increases my chances of getting the LoA from the professor that I like? Getting shortlisted was great and all but I didn't get the internship given to the top performing students there. With me never meeting the professor in person and my rather poor performance in the interviews (as personally assessed), I'm truly doubtful of any significant gain in terms of chances of getting in.

2. Related to 1, should I start contacting other professors from other universities now or do I put it off until a certain amount of time passes by/I get rejected? A professor from my university who did the whole MEXT thing in his time suggested that I refrain first since he thinks that the whole event had a lot going for me. As you can tell from 1, I'm sort of doubtful of any advantage gained from said event. Context: I originally planned to start contacting professors as early as last December but wrong expectations for the KyotoU event had me put it off.

If you've made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this piece of mine~~ I'm really gunning for 2019 so any piece of legit advice is greatly appreciated ;A;"
7te34j,1,2018-01-27,Intellectual Life,tifecool,CreepyPastas,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/7te34j/intellectual_life/,"I’ve always been fascinated with life. No I am not a biologist nor am I an archaeologist. Yes, life fascinates me, but the study of biology, for me, has always been a challenge. For one, I am utterly terrified of blood, an irrational fear perhaps; haemophobia to be precise. I cannot stand blood, I get queasy just at the tinniest sighting of the crimson red liquid, crimson red ironically being one of my favourite colours. I even go as far as to round off all the corners in my house and to only use butter knives; OCD if you may, though I’ve never actually been diagnosed by a certified therapist. To add the cherry on top, I’m also very sceptical of people, hence why I’ve never seen a therapist.

I know, I am quite the flawed specimen, by societal norms at least. On the other hand, I do have some perks. I’ve never been much of a bragger and I’m not too modest either; no, this is not what I am referring when I say I have some perks. I just want to establish myself as a realist, so you can take my word for it when I say that I am abnormally intelligent. Quite the cliché charactLer I suppose. I know, praising my own intellect sounds quite contradictory to my claim of not being a pompous bragger. These comments aren’t mine rather those of my parents, teachers and now my colleagues. I personally have never seen myself as all that gifted until recently. To be honest I find it quite absurd to base intelligence on how many trophies, medals or certificates a person has under their belt, which I do have quite a number of but obviously do not hold the biggest arsenal of silverware in academia. The thing about book smarts and most other skills is that even the least talented of us can come out quite successful with a good bit of perseverance. Yes, it would be easier for those of us with “good genes”, but as clearly proven time and time again, achieving what nature tries so hard to achieve with random chance proves to be far more easily accomplished and perfected using unnatural, artificial or synthetic means.

I feel a little history is in order for introductory reasons, just to explain how I came to writing this memo. I’ll return to my theories of intelligence later on in this memo, for now I think it would be appropriate for me to explain myself by sharing a segment of my childhood. 

As a child I was the cliché loner. Maybe lonelier than the cliché to be honest, not for any specific reason, I suppose I was or I am simply far more on the introverted side of the spectrum. Growing up, having the curiosity for life as I had mentioned before, but lacking my yet to arrive phobia, lead to a carefree and fearless investigation of life. As a young child I played with a few animals here and there, but as the years flew by I realized my curiosity couldn’t be quenched by just playing with life, so I decided to delve deeper. One day I decided I would have a look inside one of my playmate, a pigeon, I had named Ed. 

I nursed Ed back to health after he’d suffered from a broken leg and was limping on the pavement in my garden. No, I was not psychotic, I was 11 at the time and had a very “underdeveloped” understanding of death. I had planned to simply open Ed up then sew him back together, something I’d seen on the TV on numerous occasions. I’d figured it wasn’t going to be a difficult ordeal, similar to opening and closing a box I had thought. The operation took place on a Monday afternoon. It was a snow day so school was cancelled and I was home alone. Ed was in my room and my parents weren’t around, the perfect time to carry out the operation as my parents didn’t allow me to use knives at that age. I got a knife from the kitchen and commenced the operation. I tried gently inserting the knife into Ed but he’d flap his wings aggressively anytime I’d apply pressure. It was clear he didn’t seem to like it very much and I couldn’t blame him; I wouldn’t like a knife forcefully inserted into me either. So I did what any responsible caretaker would do when taking care of a patient in pain, I gave Ed a painkiller. I knew how it worked since anytime I had a sore or an injury my mum had given me two pills, making it quite easy to deduct its function. When my parents had a pain they took three, they gave me two so I had deducted at the time that one would be just enough for Ed. In hindsight, the single pill had probably killed Ed from an overdose even before I had started the operation.

After a few minutes I decided it was time to begin the operation as Ed seemed to be asleep and calm. I inserted the tip of the knife just under his black beak and gently applied pressure as I dragged the knife down to his feet. This was the dreadful moment in which I developed my phobia. The red liquid from Ed’s lifeless body spurted in all directions and at the same time just seemed to seep outwardly from the cut. I was frozen for some reason; I just knew I had done something irreversible, like smashing a coffee mug or breaking a mirror. I carried Ed’s body to the sink to try to get rid of his spewing blood, the high pressure of water from the faucet caused Ed’s insides to leak out of his now greying corpse; I threw up at the sight of it. Unfortunately, my breakfast had landed into Ed’s giblets worsening the already horrendous scene. I hid under my covers for an hour, rewinding the events and revisiting the gruesome image.

My dad arrived home minutes after the hour. I’m not going to try and convey the shock on his face after he’d seen the sight as I could never give it justice with my perspective or description. He likely thought I was a sociopath or psychopath or something but after witnessing me murmur and sob with a runny nose while trying to explain what I had done I feel he had realized that it was not my intention to kill Ed. Both my parents sat me down and spoke to me that night about what I did. Being old fashion, they didn’t believe in therapists either. From that point onwards I became agitated whenever I witnessed blood. Further down the line, knowing my “operation” would be irreversible but still having a morbid fascination with life I chose to try and carry it out once more. Do note that this was quite a while after the incident. No, I did not carry out my operation on a human test subject, that would be incredulously contradictory to everything I had previously experienced. Instead I carried out my operation on a few insects, I figured that all will be well as insects didn’t have blood. I quickly discovered that studying insects proved to be just as nauseating. I didn’t develop a fear of haemolymph if that’s what you’re thinking, but I did how far faint a few times after cutting myself during my operations. As you can guess this is probably what lead to my avoidance of sharp objects.

Eventually while playing video games, one of my favourite pastimes, furthering the cliché, I had somewhat of an epiphany. I realized life didn’t have to be composed of hormones and neurons. As soon as this fact dawned on me I turned off my games console and simultaneously browsed on as much programming information and content as I possibly could, only limited by the connection speed supplied by our ISP. In a little over 8 months I had mastered 6 coding languages, ranging from Java to HTML. My programming of AI was still in its infancy for quite some time, only used to program the most basic of game AI. Eventually I began taking internships in different companies, most being game companies and then a few in non-game companies. The non-gaming related companies were surprisingly far more beneficial to my AI programming skills. The companies that were more market oriented worked with AI that could in a way learn. I’ll be it a very rudimentary way of learning but still brilliant compared to the static and basic AIs created within the gaming industry. As a goal for myself, I set out to make an AI that could learn in a way a human does or better yet in a way a child does.

While working on achieving this goal I simultaneously developed an interest in philosophy. This was inevitable retrospect. When searching on life you'd be quite unlucky (or lucky depending on how you see it) to not stumble across some lengthy philosophical essays. A lot of them were quite repetitive and the majority were more of summaries of old ideas than completely new ideas. As time passed I delved deeper and deeper into the different schools of philosophy. I eventually got a job working as what my boss liked to call an “Artificial Intelligence Architect” for a company with big ambitions. They had a vision that complemented my goal so it was an easy decision to take the job. I don't feel it's too important to talk about the company in great detail, the vision simply was to help human endeavours using AI. I'm not quite sure but I think I even signed a confidentiality contract while being hired, which means little to nothing now if I break it. Moving back to my discussion on philosophy, I eventually I came across a summary on Albert Camus’s happy Sisyphus. The summary unnerved me and didn't sit quite well with me, so I made it an objective to read the original piece... this only worsened my objections to Camus's work. 

A while back, prior to me working in my new workplace, I managed to create a working AI able to learn similarly to how humans learn, but also learning exponentially faster the more data it acquired. It showed promise but was limited to how much processing power my system, at the time, had. 

Every other day I would buy better and more efficient parts, adding overclocking modules anywhere I could, skyrocketing my electricity bills in the progress. I even went as far as creating a less performance demanding and memory enhancing standalone operating system for the program. You could probably tell that this took a hefty toll on my wallet, hence the reason I had to get a good paying job that at the same time didn't reduce my programming time. It was a miracle I found the job I did in such a short time span, two weeks from when I started looking to be exact. I guess you don't really notice things till you start searching. After getting the job I was able to upgrade my system as fast as I could hoard and or get deliveries for high end computer parts. I even had the luxury of getting to run my program on a super computer at my workplace.

I obviously mentioned the program I was working on in my CV and in my interview, my boss took an immediate interest in my work and after a month of work she told me I should only work on developing it and should inform her if I needed any additional funds. I hit a gold mine and heaven in one instantaneous moment. I immediately began the setup of the program on the super computer while also catering to my personal version of the program at home. After seven days it had been installed on the super computer and began to learn, this is when something truly peculiar happened. The program just seemed to turn it's self off after reaching a certain threshold. It took the whole of the seventh day to setup and run the program so I wasn't able to do the much needed debugging at work, also being too tired to stay overtime, luckily I had collected the high end parts that I ordered a while back that same morning. My goal was to run my extensively optimised version at home and see if it ran into the same issue, if so I would start the debugging process and finish it before the next day of work. It was a Friday by the way.

I installed the new parts that Friday night after work, I had nothing better to do, so how better to past the time than with wires and transistors. The setup took me from 10 to 4am with a few breaks here and there; I slept as soon as I was done. I've never really enjoyed sleeping all that much and to be honest I was really ecstatic to be nearly done with my life time goal so early into my life. I woke up at 8am and ran the program; unexpectedly the same issue occurred, meaning it was not a remote occurrence. It wasn't anything programmed in to the core code and I was sure I didn't code in any fail safe to prevent anything like this from happening when pushing the computer to it's limits. I read through the whole code for about four hours checking through every line of code thoroughly over and over to no avail. I would try to resume the program from where it closed and it would close nearly instantaneously; restarting the program just lead to the same crash after reaching the threshold learning rate. After another four hours of analysing I got fed up and completely removed the ability of the program to even be closed... this lead to my greatest realisation. The next event was truly incredulous. The program passed the threshold and I was filled with absolute ecstasy, this however, was short-lived. The program after a minute simply shut down the system...  Unnerved, I went to sleep. 

I woke up, re-ran the program several times and everytime the same thing; the computer would simply shutdown autonomously. This was puzzling but then I understood, I always did. 

My understanding is the reason I hated the concept of the happy Sisyphus. Able to see how it is flawed in every possible way it could possibly be flawed. The analogy it creates is inconsistent with reality and the conclusion reached, a false assumption. This is where I share my theory on intelligence and attempt to persuade my idea.

The undeniable fact of consciousness within the universe is that it is overtly pointless. Sisyphus’s punishment may in a way mirror our human condition but with a blemish that changes the whole image. Sisyphus has no power over ending his pointless existence, he is cursed to be punished forever. We, conscious Homo sapiens, are far luckier than Sisyphus. There is a reason intellectuals are plagued with depression and may even admire death, they possess the esoteric understanding which comes innate only to a few. The same reasoning that became apparent to my program after surpassing the threshold…

This is truly how intelligence should be measured, this is how intellectuals should be recognized. The willingness to end one’s own existence is the only measure of intelligence. I am upset I had not been intelligent enough to reason this at a younger age, but still at a young and ripe age, I feel I am finally able to observe myself as an intellectual, capable of reasoning above the average person. I finally see myself as someone worthy of the worthless praise from family and colleagues. And finally I see the pointlessness of this realization. Able to see the pointlessness of me writing this and sharing with the world a fact that many will ignore. 

I shall be carrying out the most intelligent action I have and will ever proceed in doing soon enough. Just like Ed, I will be taking my own painkillers, not enough to kill me as it may lead to my more primitive wiring to survive to take over, but just enough to help me carryout my precautionary steps to prevent me from seeing my blood trickle in case of any mishaps. Yes, I may understand the pointlessness of my fears but I shall always be limited by my mind designed by evolutionary random chance. My last pointless request is to warn not to force a conscious intellectual being into existence, it shall simply let the boulder roll. Again I am far from a genius when dealing with biological life, so precautionary steps are necessary. Luckily spoons aren’t sharp… neither are bullets.


POLICE REPORT 30th of November 2012.

This was recovered from an unknown John Doe’s laptop. His body examined and determined to have been dead for six months with rapid decay due to excess maggot and rodent activity, furthering the difficulty of identification. A gruesome scene was found of the unknown personality, both eyes gouged out, two bullets lodged within the skull, and small trace amounts of cocaine stained crimson by what is assumed to be the personality’s blood.

7tetdy,1,2018-01-27,[M4F] Female Boss and The Intern,ViciousPervertion,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7tetdy/m4f_female_boss_and_the_intern/,"The world of interns is full of ""Hot Female Boss"" and ""Hot Interns"", it doesn't matter if you don't work close to them, if we see you at least once that means you're on the list. 

Now the problem with the female boss is that everyone wants just the interns and secretary, they think those are the only submissive ones, no one say it out loud but they're afraid of the female bosses thinking none of them are worth the risk of getting in problems with HR for misconduct.

Fuck that, when the others look away afraid of being catch looking at your ass i'm the one who keeps looking and smiles when being caught, the few times you come to correct someone behavior i'm the only one smiling knowing they hate that shit.

This is my second month at the company and i'm still waiting the call of HR, but the call never happens so that means you like it? It's hard for me to approach you without bringing too much attention to us, so.. how do we handle this?

---

Hello, sorry if the prompt is a mess, it's kinda hard coming up with this idea without making it sound like a femdom scenario, this is a mutual attraction thing that happens in a place where our jobs are in danger and that makes it more hot.

How do we start this scene?

1. Company Party and specially the Christmas party where people really go crazy.
1. Company Vacation with all service paid, maybe i'm not an intern but the new guy who is invited.
1. Finding you at a random bar one night, maybe a bar with a dance floor or just a straight up 'Leave me alone' bar where we see each other drinking our problems away.
1. Your scenario. 

When i say female bosses means your age can be whatever you want, from young to milfs.

Open your PM describing yourself or find a picture of how you want to look, your kinks and limits.

My Kinks: Cheating, Anal, Rough Sex, Recording, Name Calling, Creampies, Lingerie, Heels &amp; Feet.

My limits: Beast, Death, Non-con, Femdom, Scat. Hope to hear from any of you!

7tfo5i,17,2018-01-27,[Help] Do you think getting a dog would be happy if I got him/her as a new grad?,QuantumQuadTrees8523,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/7tfo5i/help_do_you_think_getting_a_dog_would_be_happy_if/,"So I'm in college right now and am planning on getting a dog my senior year of college, probably in the spring semester a few months before graduation. I'm not very worried about apartment codes because I'm sure that I can find a place for my senior year and for post grad that will allow me to keep a dog. I'm in the SF Bay Area and will hopefully be working there post graduation too if everything goes as planned. I'm in tech and so I, very fortunately, don't think money will be a big object in the future as a young professional living in the city. Granted, this is if everything goes as planned. 

My question is: Do you think a [golden retriever, shiloh shepherd, German shepherd] would cope well to living in this kind of situation? Bearing in mind that I'm confident that I can get at least a solid hour long walk every morning and evening. A bonus is that the company that I am currently signed to intern with over the summer will likely give me a return offer as long as I do well during my time there and they have a dog friendly office. So I can give my dog two long walks daily plus take him/her into the office with me as well to hang out while I work. I can also probably get a short walk in during lunch time. As far as being a young adult in the city goes, I'm sure that going out on weekends and all that good stuff is fine so long as I take the necessary precautions. My personality definitely is one that plans about ten steps ahead for everything so I'm positive I wouldn't forget making accommodations for my dog if I were to spend the night somewhere or was coming home late. 

All this being said, do you think getting a dog right before graduation is a good call or not? Maybe even a little bit after graduation. I'm willing to wait until I join the workforce to take the plunge. I've just loved dogs forever and so I'd like to bring one into my life for the first time. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: You guys are all homies! So based on the advice I've gotten so far, I'm probably going to wait about a year to a year and a half to get my puppy. I'm going to make sure my company and apartment policies are conducive to having a big ol golden retriever doggo in my life before I take the plunge. Here's to summer 2020 for my dog!! "
7tg4bm,28,2018-01-27,[SPOILER] Can't spell Tegan without TEA.,abieyuwa,htgawm,https://www.reddit.com/r/htgawm/comments/7tg4bm/spoiler_cant_spell_tegan_without_tea/,"And that's AWL she servedt last night!

* [mrw](https://media.giphy.com/media/xO1nkt2luziHC/giphy.gif) michaela had the audacity to text Tegan after getting caught in a lie

* [mfw](https://media1.tenor.com/images/406003959b3dc435678261d83bac2650/tenor.gif?itemid=5674080) michaela actually showed up to her place of work thinking Tegan was gonna be anything but tight-lipped and pissed after she quadruple crossed her for taking a chance on her

* [Tegan](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2014-08/21/18/enhanced/webdr05/anigif_enhanced-5397-1408658439-1.gif) when the girl that back-stabbed her showed up to her job to chat shit like they all weren't about to get slaughtered in cold blood






Shit, the ONLY thing Michaela should've been asking her was weather or not she got to keep those cute ass LV pumps Tegan gave her. I really cannot believe the stupidity of Michaela. Like girl, I love you and I stan, but I stan talent not idiocy. She followed Laurel into a burning building and rather than escape with her life, she chooses to go deeper.

I cannot tell you how satisfied I am that Tegan let ol' girl know the true gravity of the situation. I'm sure Tegan and her firm knew the kind of corrupt fuckery Castillo and associates get up to. It's her fucking job. That's what they're there for. That's why big companies like Antares hire big firms, to make sure they can skirt the law with no issues. So she knows first hand the kind of danger they're all in by having those files leak, especially under HER watch. She's as good as dead.

I also feel that this is a callback to Annalise's line about her ""looking for a mommy everywhere you go"". Unlike Annalise, Tegan was not trying to put her neck on the line to protect someone she barely knew. So her lying for Michaela/K4 was to protect herself and cover-up the fact that she had a lapse in judgement and failed to protect her client. If those files get out, then I'm sure that Tegan could be buried deep in litigation for breaching her clients privacy or w/e, so it doesn't really matter what $$$ she gets from the IPO if it's just gonna be taken as fast as it was given. 

And I know it had to hurt Tegan that Michaela was the one to end her career like that. For starters, Michaela is probably one of the few Women of Color, specifically Black women, in that entire firm. I know Tegan saw her and felt a connection to her. She wanted to raise her up and teach her everything she knows. And as a WoC myself I can relate to the feeling of loneliness in a professional setting with not a lot of people who look like me. 

So it had to hurt extra bad when Michaela was lying on top of being the cause of all her current miseries. You could hear it in her voice too when she told Michaela to not show up at her work or contact her ever again. And for her to throw caution to the wind and show up casually like it was nothing, I'd be furious and hurt. It's next level audaciousness that I can't even understand. 

And despite all this she still shows up to Laurel's bedside whenever she wants her. 

Michaela deserved this. She didn't want that career. She didn't want that internship. She'd rather play Laurel's sidekick than ditch her and do better for herself. I know she's my fave, but I don't particularly feel bad for her because this was a predictable outcome from before Laurel even got the rest of the K4 involved. I mean, how can she talk about having something good with Tegan and rubbing that in Annalise's face? Talking all these nice things about your new boss to every one, but clearly you didn't care enough to protect the only fucking person giving you a chance after all your fuck-ups. I mean I guess following people to their deaths now is the new wave, huh?

7tg6sr,38,2018-01-27,[S14E10 Spoilers] My Goodness....,silkscarves,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/7tg6sr/s14e10_spoilers_my_goodness/,"What a powerful episode. I just got done watching, and that was easily my favorite of the season, and one of my favorites in quite some time. 

- I’m a huge April fan and I had no idea that this episode was going to mainly revolve around her.  Seems like there wasn’t any hype for it.  In any case, Sarah Drew was phenomenal.  Beginning and ending the episode with the shower scene was brilliant.  The Samuel reference gutted me. 

- The directing was outstanding!  All the little moments and details came together to make a powerful hour of television.  (Edit: I thought Chandra directed, but maybe not??) 

- Matthew was looking good!!  I have a lot of respect for him as a man.  Very upstanding, and he was still very respectful towards April, when it would’ve been understandable if he hadn’t been.  I also like the actor and I thought he did a great job tonight.  He should get a role in Station 19, or a recurring role in Grey’s, like Nicole the paramedic used to have. 

- Jesse did a great job. I haven’t enjoyed him this season, but this was the Jackson that I love.  Passionate, vulnerable, courageous, empathetic.  Jesse nearly had tears in his eyes during certain scenes.  More of THIS Jackson please!! 

- Mer’s comments about fleeing to Canada were hilarious. 

- “The Talk” with Tuck was heartwrenching.  I definitely teared up.  Chandra and Jason George (Ben) knocked that performance out of the park, but it makes me sad and angry to understand that it probably wasn’t entirely a “performance.” 😣😢😤

- Crazy that Paul was relegated to the B-plot.  I’m glad in some ways that they wrapped up his storyline, even though it was teased for several years... Really, Paul was never the focus- this was about Jo and defeating the demons from her past.  I’m happy that she can fully move on and become willing to receive professional accolades for her surgical skills and prowess.  This also bodes well for her future with Alex. 

- I like Intern Helm more and more with each episode. She has a decent presence on screen.  I think the actor portraying Vik Roy could tone down the goofiness a bit.  

- The overarching theme of wondering why God will forsake His believers really hit home with me.  

- I remember reading recent posts and comments on our beloved sub inquiring about April, and if she had slept with anyone else besides Jackson, etc.  Y’all had some major foreshadowing!!  😂😞

- Overall, I loved the episode and I plan on watching it again!

7tgnxc,2,2018-01-27,"I[31F] think I am engaged[3yrs] to a scumbag[33M] like his friends[30sM], I don't know what to do after hearing what I did last night.",CautionPrecaucion,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7tgnxc/i31f_think_i_am_engaged3yrs_to_a_scumbag33m_like/,"I posted this on another sub but they locked it before I could respond to anyone. I need advice.

I have been with Ben for 3 years, and we have been engaged for 1. Ben has 2 best friends, Colin, and Nick, they have been friends since middle school, and after college they opened a club together. Nick the Manager, Colin the DJ, and Ben the Promotor.

By the time I met Ben, he was already working as a silent partner and had a fulltime career in network security. He and I hit it off amazingly,  he is cute and funny and sweet. A perfect gentleman. It wasn't until a few weeks into dating that I met Nick and Colin. These two were total scum from the 1st meeting. Nick kept leering at me, and Colin flirted with everything that moved, even though his girlfriend and little daughter were right there.

Over the years, as I got to know all three of them, the club they opened turned out to be a stripclub. Not the high end kind either. It's one of those places where the girls are fully naked, and people bring their own liquor and get charged $10 for ice and cups. I also found out that it was pretty much a prerequisite to work there to sleep with Nick and Colin when they wanted. Ben assured me he never engaged in that sort of thing.

Colin also cheats on his longtime girlfriend constantly. he doesnt even try to hide it. He is also very emotionally and verbally abusive to her, and I suspect the child too. I've heard him go off on her and send her home crying. Whenever I want to say something to him about it, Ben says I should leave it, and it's none of our business.

Both Colin and Nick seem to have a serious disdain for the female gender. On Fridays, Nick and Colin come over after the club closes, and plays Xbox with Ben.(I've pretty much forbaid him from stepping into that place during business hours). I've had to start wearing ear plugs because they are so loud, they cuss, they make threats to what I can assume are children, and they talk really horribly about women. I've never heard Ben join in, but he doesn't protest much either.

Last night though, things were different. I woke up at about 5am, and they were still at it. I took out an earplug, And I could hear Colin invite Ben to Vegas. Ben says how that would be so awesome, but I would never allow him to holiday with the two of them. Then Nick said it. ""Nancy better give great head cause she is a fucking bitch"". I heard Colin laugh, and Ben tells Nick to watch his fucking mouth. Nick says sorry, and that he was just telling it like he sees it. Then Ben said that I did give great head, but that's not why he was with me. They said why, and he responded with ""I love that fuckin bitch"". They all laughed.

Nick said some more stuff about Vegas, and then said that if he broke up with me, he could get as much head as he wanted from the club. Ben said something like nah, but I would think about it, if you could talk your mother into it. Remember Colin, she gave great head. They all laughed more.

Nick said something I couldn't really hear, and then said to Colin, that his daughter was starting to bud,(she's 12 btw) and he should maybe think of bringing her by the club, call it an internship. I could hear Colin tell him that's too far, and Nick just laughed. Ben says to Nick that he went too far, and the decent thing a for a friend to do, is wait until they are 14 Before we start perving on her. They all laughed again.

At that point I heard enough. I was so pissed,  so disgusted. I lay there until Ben came in, ready to sleep. He was still asleep when I woke up for worm this morning. So when I get home we are gonna have this out. I don't know what to do, or what to say. Am I over reacting? I've never known been to talk about me like that.  to sexualize a child, it's disturbing to me.

I should add, Ben is NEVER like this when Colin and Nick aren't around.

**TL;DR My fiance and his friends were talking really disgustingly about me and a child. On top of the other things in their past it makes me scared if I am doing the right thing by marrying him.**"

7th6lr,2,2018-01-27,From intern to full time need help deciding which opportunity I should take.,KingBlerd,ITCareer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareer/comments/7th6lr/from_intern_to_full_time_need_help_deciding_which/,"I have two current full time  job opportunities presented to me at the same company. One is a suppport role while the other is a system engineer/Technician role. I am having a hard time deciding which I should go with. 

Here is a little information about me. 
-I am a senior undergraduate student who will be graduating this semester. 
-I am currently an intern at the company
- I have about 2 and half years of suppport experience. ( 6 months at the current company)
- I will have about 6 months experience in a systems engineer role( I currently work with the systems/networking team

Based on my experience with the company so far I can determine the following
- suppport will be easier and more laid back. I can also see myself becoming bored with this however. I would however be able to work 4 days a week as opposed to 5. I would also have the fee time to pursue what I want in my free time. Basically as long as tickets are covered I can do whatever I want. Potential for a raise every year as well 

- with the systems role it will definitely be more challenging. I will admit that I am still learning and I feel like it would take me a bit of time to catch up to my counter parts. The company still seems willing to accept me despite this fact. The pay would probably be more than the suppport role but I would not have as much freedom. 

Well Reddit, what do you think? Which would you pursue? Are there other factors I should consider? Any advice and help is greatly appreciated. "

7thtuq,11,2018-01-27,Been trying to sort my life out but I don't feel like it's changed my outlook,Zakoth,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/7thtuq/been_trying_to_sort_my_life_out_but_i_dont_feel/,"Not sure what I'm looking for out of posting this, kinda want to get it off my chest. 

For background; I've been under the weight of depression for about 3 years, leading to a fair amount of drug and alcohol abuse and a sort of downward spiral. Around this time last year my long-term girlfriend broke up with me, the girl who I still believe to be the love of my life. That furthered everything and I was drinking or high 6 days a week for a good 3 months, I also started smoking about a pack a day. Things tapered off with the drugs/alcohol but most of 2017 I spent hating myself/my life.

So, as a sort of resolution I stopped smoking, cut back on the alcohol and decided to do no drugs for 2018. I've been eating healthier, managing to lose about 4 of the 10kg I put on in 2017, I got an internship sorted starting in June too. The thing is, I don't feel much better; I don't feel 'depressed' but I just don't like where I am right now I guess. At university I feel alone, only really speaking to 2 of the people I live with, I hate my job but can't quit because I need the money (I have about £20 to live off until my next paycheck in 3 weeks). 

I don't really know what to do anymore, despite losing the weight I haven't gained any confidence and I can't even tell the difference. I've tried about every dating app in existence but I think I'm failing because I'm simply not good at socialising. I feel like I've dug myself into a hole over the last 3 years that I'm not going to get out of. I literally spend all day on Reddit and watching YouTube from the ones I like.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should/can do? I feel like I'm going to go back into the old habits, which I'm sure will kill me sooner rather than later. I've not read over this as I've typed so sorry if it's a bit incoherent."
7thyd4,1,2018-01-27,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7thyd4/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."

I'm currently a Junior at a liberal arts school majoring in physics, with a likely minor in philosophy (although I am only a few credits away from a minor in mathematics) and after applying to and researching many of the REU programs available I've become less and less interested in pursuing further schooling. My uncle (Lawyer by trade) and my dad (works as a ""high yield bond analyst"" and has a masters in statistics as well as an MBA with he obtained later) and have really come around to the idea of potentially working in quantitative finance. 

I'm very early on in looking for interships for the summer but the sooner that I can begin to establish some sort of direction the better. I have a basic understanding of coding in python and am far from opposed to the idea of taking more computer science courses in order to work better with large amounts of data. That being said, through physics I've developed a decent mathematical acumen and would like to work with that.

The reasoning behind this post is I'm wondering what careers are out there for those who have studied physics and if maybe anyone can share any personal experiences with working in finance after studying physics in college, and where I can potentially begin my internship search (I'm already working with my school and networking with alumni etc.)"

The Joe/ Paul storyline really annoyed me. I couldn’t believe they actually killed him like that. So all the hints and foreshadowing for a finally major storyline just ended with what: 
1)ending of an episode just to have a cliffhanger
2) one major episode after the break

They couldn’t even give her 2 fully episodes after the break. The second episode was obviously Kepnar centric. Im not saying I don’t like the Kepner struggle with faith but why are they really not giving Joe anything. 

Joe has an abusive husband, solution lets just kill him off. Oh and lets give away his organs just to make us feel better. 

The hospital is attacked by hackers, solution internet hackers intern does what the fbi couldn’t and the story ends. Where did all the fbi guys go to? What was the point??

Thats just two examples from the latest episodes. Why is the writing just taking the easy way out, especially with Joe. I really wanted more from this storyline cause not everyone’s abuser just dies instantly after confrontation especially with all the sexual misconducts that we read on the news. 

The storyline could’ve had so much more instead of this very superficial ending. I don’t feel they are giving Joe any real good stories to herself, the focus is always on her and Alex or nothing at all. "
7tiwjn,2,2018-01-28,Has anybody tried buspar/buspirone? Looking for advice on starting medication!,tciz26,emetophobia,https://www.reddit.com/r/emetophobia/comments/7tiwjn/has_anybody_tried_busparbuspirone_looking_for/,"My emetophobia has improved immensely in the past year, and I attribute that mainly to therapy and exposure. I am by no means cured, but I really think that the combo of therapy and being around sick people and rationalizing the situation helped me a ton. 

Aside from that though, my generalized anxiety comes and goes in waves depending on how stressed I am, and I have been way more stressed than normal these last few weeks as I've started a 30-hours-a-week-unpaid internship for school, along with 2 difficult online classes, and my part time job I have to keep to pay rent. I think that all of this stress has been causing a bunch of stomach problems lately, which in turn makes my anxiety a bit worse. I am strongly considering getting on some medication for anxiety, but I don't really know what my best options would be and I would love some advice. 

When I went my the doctor around this time last year to ask about anxiety meds, my actual doctor was booked so I had to see the P.A. at the office, and he didn't bother to listen to what caused my anxiety, the severity, or the symptoms. He pretty much ignored me as I tried to explain things to him and just said ""I'm going to give you Buspar, which is what I start everyone on.""

Needless to say I no longer see the P.A. and I wait until my regular doctor can see me before I schedule appointments because he is fantastic and takes the time to listen to me. But I decided to research buspar and after finding out it wasn't an SSRI and was non-habit forming and has no withdrawal symptoms I decided to give it a go (I told the P.A. that I didn't wanna be a zombie and that was the only part he listened to I think). Anyways, every time I took the buspar (I started at 7.5mg in the morning and at night) I became super nauseous and dizzy. Even after being on it for 3 weeks and upping the dosage to 15mg twice a day I only noticed nausea and no help with my anxiety other than it making me tired. I stopped taking it after being on it for about a month because to me the nausea was 100% not worth it, especially considering that's what made my anxiety skyrocket in the first place 😂

My question is, have any of you ever taken buspar for anxiety, and if you did did you have any of the same symptoms or did it work for you? If you haven't taken buspar but are on a different med for anxiety do you have any advice or suggestions? Obviously I am trying to avoid nausea or vomiting as a side effect, but I know it is common and that each medication affects everyone differently. I am up for trying new things and risking the nausea and such in order to find something that works, but I would really love some advice from anybody with experience regarding buspar or other meds! I'm sorry this post is so long but I really really appreciate any advice 💜"
7tj0zm,3,2018-01-28,My boyfriend [25 M] of one year pushed me [21 F] down hard to shut me up. Am I expecting too much?,vsuga,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7tj0zm/my_boyfriend_25_m_of_one_year_pushed_me_21_f_down/,"I've never had a relationship longer than a year. I am starting to think that maybe I have high expectations or I don't give enough chances/have enough faith. They usually end with me having too many expectations. For example, my ex was a really good guy but he was too controlling, had trust issues and would constantly accuse me of cheating even though it's as small as seeing me respond to a text at night from a guy in my class who randomly ask me about an assignment. So I dumped him....

and now....

My boyfriend and I have been seeing each other for a year and recently we've been going through a very rough patch. I just started a stressful internship that's crucial for my future career, recently found out my mother is diagnosed with thyroid cancer, and my bf and I have been fighting a lot mainly because 1) we can't seem to reach each other's expectations 2) I tend to be sensitive when I am extremely stressed (like now). 

We fought again today. He invited me over to his home for dinner and I had expected we do something nice because it's my only free night for a while due to work and also taking care of my mom. We haven't really seen each other since fighting on the phone one week ago. I really wanted a night to de-stress and talk about my current worries but after we ate he just fell asleep because he was ""tired"" from his morning ski. He knew that I was going through so much shit but it didn't seemed like he cared. I basically just sat in his house for a solid hour wasting my night away and regretting coming over because I could've been with my mom.... 

I was really frustrated at that point so I woke him up and told him that I had wanted to spend quality time together considering we don't see each other often and he complains about not seeing me. He kept saying he was tired and needed a quick nap. (he expect me to just wait until his nap is over??) This escalated to a full on fight where I was yelling and crying which at that point he shoved me hard onto the bed to shut me up. His reasoning is because I was yelling, the neighbours could hear, and that I don't listen to him when he tells me to stop yelling....

This is not the first time I felt scared around him. There was another time quite a while ago when we went to a friend's party, he brought me back to his home and I was apparently yelling and crying cuz I was pissed drunk. I do not recall the night except that he made me very scared. He punched a pillow next to me to shut me up but drunk me thought he punched my face. I ran away (still drunk), somehow got myself a taxi in the middle of a sketchy street in downtown and went home safely. His reasoning was he was drunk too and didn't like to see his gf so drunk. I had expected he at least take care of me and call me a cab if I had wanted to go home....Nonetheless, i still gave him a chance because I really wanted this relationship to work. 

Now, I am not too sure. 

Redditors, what do you think? Should I give this relationship another chance? Is it acceptable at all? Am I expecting too much from relationships?

  **tl;dr**: Bf shoved me hard, should I give him a chance?"

I kinda messed up in the second sem in my first year which really made it hard to pull my gpa back up. I'm thinking of doing further studies but I don't really know what to do. I'm expecting a 3.3 this semester as I've had two modules I really struggled with.

A brief calculation brought me to the conclusion that even if I were to work insanely hard for both my internship and my final semester in school, I wouldn't be able to enter computer science, information systems or computer engineering since even if I got straight As for my final two semesters, I would get a cumulative of about 3.45. I'm not exactly sure what to do as of now. I'm quite interested in Front-end web development and user experience design. But that said, I'm just worried that if I applied for any MNC jobs with my potato resume, I would still be rejected before even reaching the interview stage. Which is why I want to further my studies. I'm not so sure about digipen or SIT, but based on some research on other forums, I see that people from SIM can't really find jobs either and end up being stuck in some dead end job (Source is from a few years ago though, so it may be different). So yep.

Also quite sure overseas studies is not viable."

7tjock,4,2018-01-28,Boring Dutch coming of age tale,gewoonmoi,pitchamovie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pitchamovie/comments/7tjock/boring_dutch_coming_of_age_tale/,"Hello,

I just finished writing a treatment for a film script (40 pages). Is there someone who wants to share his / her opinion? Please let me know if you want me to send you the treatment.

Short summary of the story. The story takes place in The Netherlands, and is written in Dutch (I am almost finished translatig it into English). The story revolves around a Dutch-Moroccan young man. Themes include dealing with social anxiety, transition from youth to adulthood, life between two cultures, death and rejection.

After an innocent conflict at his internship at an insurance company, the protagonist explodes, gets in his car and drives away from home and work. He has a burnout. He later explains that the eruption was more of an excuse to get out of his responsibilities at his internship. After spending weeks away, he returns home, where he is welcomed by a relieved, loving family. His father is relieved that he is back home broke. No money means that he has no crime on his conscience. The young man, 26-years old, does not know what to do with his life. Without work, without ambitions, he spends his time in bed or behind his PC. He has a neighbor, also Moroccan, about whom he daydreams. Images of her touching his hand, or making intense eye-contact constantly flare up. Daydreaming is something he regularly does. He'll close his eyes and then walks on a red carpet, surrounded by an enthusiastic crowd. Or he'll be in a television studio, being interviewed. He regularly puts his ear against the cramped wall of his bedroom, looking for the voice of the girl next door. When he hears a vague female voice outside, he rushes to his attic window and observes that same neighbor in her backyard. The 26-year-old protognist clashes with his conservative parents, who impose on him an evening limit (he has to be home before midnight). When he has finished smoking his cigarette outside, he stumbles upon the girl next door, who rushes past him with a disapproving glance. Back home, he feels his heart beat in his throat.

His parents leave for Morocco in the summer. He spends the summer in the company of his childhood friend, who sells cocaine from his car, more and more often in the company of his friend. The dominant, socially skilled dealer likes the company of the submissive protagonist. The protagonist's schedule changes from attic, internet and daydreams to one in which he arrives home early in the morning and wakes up late in the afternoon. Late at night they regularly end up visiting a whore street in the city of Utrecht. Under the influence of alcohol, the main character tells his comrade that he loves him.

Summer is over, and his parents are back home. His comrade approaches the protagonist with a chance to help a friend of his with cannabis cultivation. The protagonist is introduced in the world of cannabis cultivation, in which he quickly learns all the tricks of the trade. The protagonist spends more and more time with this third person, who clearly has a dominant attitude towards the protagonist. The protagonist is called one evening by the weed farmer, who asks with a stirring tone where he is staying and that he is waiting outside for him. In the car there is a quarrel about the fact that the protagonist should have known that they were going to prepare cannabis that evening. The protagonist demands that the car is stopped and he gets off quickly.

2 years later. The protagonist is working in a factory. He seems happy. When he arrives at his parental home, still his own home, he finds a full house. Brothers and sisters, cousins ​​and nieces. In the corridor he is explained that father is sick, cancer. He drops to the ground. A young doctor stands in the living room, surrounded by the family, he explains what the situation is and what the course of events will be. After the doctor has left, the father makes a prayer, in Arabic.

The main character helps his weak father put on his shoes, and the two walk into the streets. The father tells his son, in Moroccan, how it was when he just arrived in the Netherlands. He points to a house where his former supervisor worked. He does not live anymore. At his work, at the factory, the protagonist can agree with his colleagues. Especially with a native Dutch colleague, a minority between the Poles and Moroccans. The two regularly smoke a cigarette together. They like each other. Father's health is getting worse quickly. He has trouble coming out of his bed, and going up and down the stairs. The family arranges a hospital bed for the father to sleep in, for downstairs in the living room.

In the living room the family doctor tells the family that father does not have long to live, at most a week. That same night the main character sleeps on the couch in the living room, next to his father. He bows to his comatose father and kisses him hard on his lips. ""You never let me kiss you. But now you have no choice. I love you so much. You are the best father who could wish for a son. "" He takes a towel and dips it in a glass of water, which he uses to keep the sleeping father's lips moist.

It is hectic in the house. Voices on all sides, sad voices. In the living room a white sheet covers the body of father. The body is later revealed in the mosque and with a large audience the so-called 'prayer of the dead' is done. The whole family travels to Morocco for the funeral. In all the hectic of the funeral, the protagonist finds peace in the sight of the gigantic mountains around him. He sits with his brother, observing the mountains. He reminds his brother that all of their praying to God was in vain, it didn't help father. Isn't that proof that God doesn't exist? The brother tells him to watch what he's saying.

Back in the Netherlands. The main character spends their first night with his mother in bed. Nonchalantly, she tells him that she has learned that the girl next door is going to marry. A tear leaves his eye and lands on his pillow. At work. The Dutch colleague asks, while enjoying a cigarette, whether the main character wants to hang out with him that evening. The protagonist agrees. From the bedroom of his mother the protagonist sees how the girl next door comes out of her house and gets into the car. He shuts the curtains and directs himself to the door while his mother walks into her room. She tells him how she wants him to finally find a wife and settle, and give her a grandchild. He places his hand on her cheek. At that moment there is a bell. ""Your brother,"" mother says. The protagonist walks down and pulls the front door open. There is indeed his brother, and sister-in-law, who carries a fresh baby in her hands. The protagonist embraces his brother.

Late in the evening, canals of Utrecht. The main character and his Dutch colleague are hanging out. Clearly under the influence of alcohol, they both have a good time. They end up on a bench along the canals. The Dutch colleague places his hand on the hand of the main character. Their lips slowly meet each other. Then they let go and the main character pushes his face in his hands, out of shame. Tears flow over his face, while the colleague is sitting beside him, befuddled. Then the crying turns into a hysterical laughter. The colleague joins in and together they laugh. End."

I guess I am wondering when should you still hold on hope for a future in a relationship, and when should you accept that you are just on different paths, even if you love someone?  

For background, my boyfriend and I met abroad. We became good friends while working for the same international company, and began dating long distance (we were in the same country, but about 6 hours apart), talking daily, and traveling together on weekends or for vacations whenever possible. After about a month of dating we were both eager to put the boyfriend/girlfriend label on it. We have always gotten along great - he is kind, upbeat, hardworking, loyal to friends and family, doesn't take himself too seriously, and is adventurous - and we have plenty of interests and values in common. He told me on several occasions that I'm his dream girl, and he wanted a future together. 

When our contracts working abroad were up, and we started planning our move back to our home country, I had hoped that we would be able to be together. However, he was applying to a limited number of jobs in a small field, and I was applying to graduate school.  He received and accepted a job offer on the opposite side of the country to where I received a substantial scholarship offer to a top graduate program.  He was, and has been, supportive of my studies and encouraged me to take the scholarship. 

I had hoped (and expressed to him) that he would move to be in the same city - or at least a closer commute to my program - but he hasn't been able to get a job in his top choice field here.  There are other jobs that he could get (as he has experience with lots of transferable skills) that would pay a similar salary, but he hasn't applied for those positions. I didn't want to force him to broaden his job search, but really wish he would have, because if I could have been closer to him without adding $100,000+ of student loan debt, I would have moved. I also hustled to land a 6-week internship near where he lives, so that we could have more time together, last year. 

Now, I am almost halfway through my graduate program and we are still long-distance.  It is clear to me that we will continue to be long-distance for the rest of my program, which frankly sucks.  As I think about my post-graduation job search, I am deeply concerned that we will not be able to find a place where both of us can work our first choice jobs. I have discussed this concern with him on several occasions. While he says that he will move to where I can get the best job out of graduate school (my future career is relatively high pay, so it would make sense financially), I am having doubts that he will really be happy to move and give up his job, when he has been so reluctant to do so for these past years.  I mean, if being with me and having a future together was his top priority, wouldn't he have take a job closer to me a year ago? His job is clearly important to him, and I respect that. But, I also know that his job and his relationship can't both come first.  

I guess I am just afraid that I will wake up in a year plus, when I finish my program and have a job, and we will still be long distance. I don't want to spend most of my twenties in a long distance relationship.  I want a partner who I can share my life with.  I think it is really important to get to live with someone before you know if the relationship actually works - and so to me the potential for our relationship to deepen is only possible if we actually live together. It sort of feels like things are just in a holding pattern right now. 

If anyone else has been in this type of situation, I would love some advice. How did it turn out for you? When should you hold on to hope, and when do you know that your life paths just are incompatible? What would you be considering if you were me? 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend and I have been together for about 2.5 years - most of it long-distance - I feel like it is impossible for things to grow and develop like this. If it isn't possible to be in the same place at the same time now, due to career conflicts, will it ever be? "

I've let myself get to this point, it's disgusting and embarrassing. Honestly it's worse than the majority of what I read on here. And I spend many hours at night between the /suicidewatch forum and this one. I want to be completely truthful with what I've become even though I ruminate all the time and cannot muster the courage or energy to make the necessary changes. 

I've been heading in this direction for two years now since I graduated college but realistically it's been my whole life. When I read my journals from 2006 (12 yo) I was constantly writing about suicide, cutting myself, dejection, and loving that I was ""emo,"" and stood out from everyone else. Granted, many people go through that phase...but looking back at that and the journey to where I am now shows something went really wrong in my development as a young woman (of color, I'd like to add). 

I never felt that I fit in with the black kids in highschool and went to a predominantly white school as an only child. Throughout my life I've always had phases with one best friend I held for years until the friendship naturally grew apart. I spent almost all four years of high school in an abusive chaotic relationship with a guy (and his outwardly racist family) that seems to have permanently damaged myself esteem and stunted my growth. I chose to stay and fight to be together against everyone's advice. Thinking that little of myself... 

Fast forward to my last year of college. I've had a series of failed long term ""relationships,"" where my insecurities were reflected back to me. Obviously indicting I had personal work to do. I've now put a name to what I experience ""social anxiety."" Although I was able to hold a job as a server, generate a decent saving and tell everyone my aspiration was to go into Forestry. 

By the end of college I've mellowed out but smoked weed constantly all four years. Never allowing myself the opportunity to make a network of friends. I have a loose network of friends from high school days. Fast forward to now... I've failed at the only internship that could've gotten me forestry experience. I am completely socially inept living on my own in a house with people I don't know, my relationship of three years is ending. And I quit. Just as I quit the series of serving jobs I had before the internship unable and unwilling to handle the social pressure. I mean holding a conversation is incredibly awkward and strenuous. I realize I have no idea who I am. And maybe never did. Never experienced true happiness independent of a romantic relationship. 

2016 I graduated it's now 2018. I just got discharged from the intensive group therapy program I admitted myself to after two months because I continued to drink alcohol and I'm in a co-occurring track. I am actively self sabotaging by not responding to any of my friends/mentors that reach out for the last 6 months. I don't work and I spend 80% of my time in bed. I've given up. I am languishing. I destroyed my public reputation in the local community this summer after going on a 5 month drunk manic rampage after my relationship ended. Sleeping with men up to twice my age, fighting my parents who took my car, getting involved with cops, landing myself in the psych ward five times. Losing friendships but the whole time feeling the most ""confident,"" in my life. Having the most ""fun/adventure,"" I've ever had by genuinely trying to kill myself basically. Laughing it off until I came back to reality in early October and survived. All the false confidence disappeared when I had to move back home. I'm afraid to put much more detail. But I've spent so much time alone I truly cannot socialize now. I am paralyzed. My body chemistry is destroyed from poor diet and alcohol. I am completely emotionally numb. I make people feel awkward and uncomfortable. I have no identity and I'm not trying. 

I did horrible things to people who showed me love this summer. Tried to take care of me. I revealed the lack of human compassion and morality in my heart. I've tried to hang myself a few times but can't go through with it...driven myself to the cliffs...knowing I can't jump. This should be an opportunity to ""reinvent,"" myself but I won't put forth the effort despite therapy and my parents support and forgiveness. And everything in life requires that effort. All that charisma and talk I had over the summer...and the absolutely silent person I am now. Has people I interacted with concerned, convinced I'm psychotic, reaching out or staying far away. I'm hiding myself away. What would you do?"
7tluxy,12,2018-01-28,[Actual Happiness to Thoughts Overload],Symphoney,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/7tluxy/actual_happiness_to_thoughts_overload/,"Good morning everyone!


If you recall, I have made a few posts on here, but one, in particular, was when I publically announced to you guys how I left Islam but felt very... very down (an understatement). The worst thing about it was being cooped up in my own home throughout winter break (I'm a sophomore in college, I get like 4 weeks off). 


I was stuck in a compound, chained to a daily routine, chained down from thinking or moving freely, and mentally accusing my friends of that but realized the real culprits were my parents and religion. So, I managed to unlock those chains, but I'm still stuck in this compound, not only because my parents would not let me leave, but also because I wasn't ready to, mentally, financially, physically, or emotionally.

Every night, I'd be stuck with my thoughts of that one inevitable day of telling my parents but also being scared of no success. I was full of what-ifs, ""what if I don't get a job? What if I won't get accepted? What if I don't get money?"" I want to graduate first, I want to get a job, I want to be financially stable and then I'll be out. Not just that, I want to make sure my family will be okay after it all...

-----

So, school started last week and I didn't realize this is what I needed. My friend texted me, albeit she was Muslim, asking to hang out. She did invite me to her place over winter break and my mom wouldn't have minded entirely since she's Muslim, but it couldn't work out because my friend had work. I was fine with that because I've never really... visited a friend for casual reasons before. I've gone to someone's place, either Muslim or not, only for academic reasons and one time, for a birthday, which I was surprised of. Otherwise, I've never watched movies with my friends in person, really had a continuous conversation or a friendship I can fall back on.

This week happened and my friend texted me if we could hang out on Wednesday. I thought it was like, going to a building on campus that had a cafe so I said sure. Then when the day came, my mom was driving me to campus to drop me off. (Yeah, I'm not allowed to drive alone, which is not just because my mother wouldn't let me, but also because I don't really have a car anyway and I wouldn't want them to get me one)

My friend was texting me while my mother was driving but I tried to make sure my mom didn't see. I read ""going to"" and ""Starbucks"" and my mind started running, frantically, in circles. My mom dropped me off, oblivious to my sudden change in demeanor. While I was walking to class, I texted my friend [finally] of how I've never gone out to a place with a friend before, where my friend actually drove me somewhere. My friend responded ""aww"" to that, and let's just say the conversation went from me trying to figure out pros and cons to finally letting up after I thought the following:

Girl, you denied anyone who asked to hang out with you because of parents and religion. You have been afraid that you were being watched all the time, more of Allah than your parents. You wanted to please only Him, and to do so, you had to be obedient to your parents. Now, you know that adults don't know best. Now, you know that there's no one watching over you and that only you can watch out for yourself. You never got to experience what it was like hanging out with a friend and you're 19. It's time to finally live and experience. No more cage, no more chains, at least temporarily.

So, I did it. We went to her car, had a casual conversation after she scared me from behind. I was a little hesitant walking across the parking lot, afraid a car would just hit me and then the ""what if"" of my parents questioning why this happened ran through, but I shut those thoughts away.

I hated those whispers. They always came to mind. ""What if your friend got in an accident?"" I shut it away. I opened the car doors, sat on the passenger seat and felt comfortable in it. My friend drove and fortunately, the Starbucks was only down the road, no problem. I never knew there was a Starbucks nearby, which surprised my friend. I also explained how I've only been to one, once, and thought it would be my last time. I was a little clumsy with the names like ""tall"" is apparently small.

My friend had to explain that a stopper would be good to use so that it wouldn't spill in the car and ahh it's embarrassing but I was having quite an amazing time. I looked at the Starbucks place and was so tempted to take many pictures because it was like traveling to somewhere foreign! It was all thick glass, and inside, it was a bit compact but it was nice!

We were walking back to her car, I was still afraid of the parking lot that nonetheless, having a friend accompany me was nice. We sat in the car, drove around campus and I was ogling at the mansion I never knew existed near my campus. She showed me other buildings the campus had that I never got to see or explore and I was astonished. I bet my friend was having a grand time seeing how I was reacting.

Unfortunately, I felt a little awkward when she brought up her Muslim friend is an interior designer, remembering then and there that she's a Muslim and how awkward would it be to tell her I'm no longer one. Another whisper came to the back of my mind of how she's doing all this, despite not being allowed to. How was she able to feel comfortable doing as she pleases even though she wasn't supposed to?

Anyway, we returned to the campus and had an actual conversation going. It was nice! Usually, my conversations with colleagues would only pertain to the academics or internships, never really about life or arranged marriages or culture. So, here we were doing just that. She had to go to class and I thanked her a million times for this opportunity. I knew if I hadn't done this, then I would've regretted this, immensely.

I walked out of the building we were in, and another friend walked out from another building. We saw each other and she yelled my name from there and I yelled hi back, smiling like an idiot because of how my day was going already. We had a quick conversation, and I felt something strange inside me. I wasn't sure what it was yet. I was walking to the university's library and before I reached the entrance, some guy said hello to me. He was an alumnus of the high school we both went to and I said hello back with a smile just as large as his and that was when I knew it.

I was in the library, went up the stairs, and sat on the couch, just tracing back. I remember how I used to feel like an outcast everywhere, even to the Muslim society. I remember trying to go to MSA on campus but felt out of place because these guys swore, these guys dated, these guys got to go out, yet they wore hijaabs or topees. I remember visiting family friends and feeling out of place, they'd talk to their own groups while I just made sure the kids were alright. I remember hating how much I had in common with people who were not Muslims, so I'd stay away from them.

I realized while walking as the wind blew nicely against me, as I looked up to see the trees that towered above me, while the clouds mashed together and the sun shone brightly, that I was so busy trying to fit in somewhere when I was a part of something already.

I was a part of the human race. I was very much human.

-----

No longer do I need to feel guilty for being friends with the opposite sex.
No longer do I need to restrain myself just to suit my parents' definition of what a proper lady was.
No longer do I need to submit to someone who doesn't exist.
No longer... do I need to view life as something insignificant because life is temporary.

How ironic is that? You'd think I'd give value to life because of religion, but instead, I gave it no value because it held none when the life after was eternal. No, I viewed life on here as nothing but a test. Then, after leaving Islam, I wasn't sure how to view life since I lived it like some lifeless vessel. Now, being on campus, despite knowing that finals will show up right around the corner to harass me, I realized I should try living because, wow... that feeling?

-----

That feeling after actually living? That was amazing. I was actually smiling. I actually felt that happiness and wondered if this was what other people felt. It was absolutely phenomenal.

Though, after that... I encountered another friend of mine, who I met in high school. We were just having a chill conversation, literally. We were outside the library, I was on my way back from class after texting my friend something silly that happened. It was like yin and yang standing outside.

Right in front of me was someone who wore the Niqaab, talking about her struggles, while I wore no headscarf (never had in public) but this time I wasn't following religion any longer. We spoke of how Pakistani culture doesn't help religion and I agreed to that, but mentally thought ""except, Islam created roots to Pakistani culture too."" We brought up arranged marriage and she was sincerely for it, while I stood there not at all for it.

She tried giving me advice on how to mentally prepare for it, how I should come up with strategies when dealing with my husband, how I should be open to it because time is running out, etc. All the while, I'm pitying her because she thinks that she is obligated to do all of this. This girl, she created a website for Hadiths, yet I questioned why she was not at all bothered by the Hadiths she was writing, not to her face of course.

We finally finished talking on a good note, but I couldn't help and think about all of this. (I was also bugged that she was allowed to drive alone, dang it. I'm not) Now, I'm not second-guessing my decision, but my thoughts about religion started to flood in and became mush, it was insane. I thought about my future, the possibility of arranged marriages, and I was getting those scary thoughts of wanting to die because of the ""what-ifs.""

-----

Ugh, this is just horribly annoying. I was finally able to see the beauty of life but when reminders of religion come around, I get these invisible chains tempting my wrists, wanting to come back and I'm like ""No."" I get stronger when I read those ""Hadiths of the Day"" so I truly thank you for them.

I just wish there was a way for my parents to be open-minded and accepting of this. I fear they'll split because my father will blame my mother for my departing of the religion. I fear that split will leave my mother in a horrible position, unable to care for the family on her own. I fear my siblings won't be able to lead a normal life, despite also losing belief in religion now that I brought up some points that had them thinking.

My brother even went as far as saying ""Just leave on your own, don't worry about us. I'll just continue acting like a Muslim."" I look at him with horror, the idea of him willing to do such a thing for me? I've tried to do a lot of things with them in mind, putting them before me, that hearing this... I just couldn't. He said he'll just run away when the time comes for him and I said, I'll try sending money if that time comes.

This is just a mess of thoughts, I had nowhere else to put. I know life isn't meant to be easy, but seriously. This is just... ridiculous."
7tlwsd,22,2018-01-28,Fresh graduate [Arab] finding a good CS job in Mexico?,chicadelacomputad,mexico,https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/7tlwsd/fresh_graduate_arab_finding_a_good_cs_job_in/,"Hola 

I posted this in another subreddit, but I was told this subreddit would give me a good answer as well.


&gt;Let me give you a little bit of a background first, I'm currently studying CS with a GPA of 4.748/5.0 and I'm graduating in May. I had an internship this summer but most of the work was more managerial than technical. I have entered a few CS related extracurricular activities and competitions. I have a nano degree in Android Basics Development. I am passionate and a fast self-learner. My programming project portfolio is varied... but sadly I personally don't feel like any of my projects were particularly challenging, I know I can do more. I speak fluent English, most people think it's my first language.
&gt;
&gt;As for my personal background, I am an Arab living in the middle east, raised by a very conservative Muslim family. Here's where it gets complicated... I've been with my Mexican boyfriend for over 15 months now, but having a life with him in the middle east is virtually impossible as I don't think he can stay here much longer.
&gt;
&gt;Ideally being a CS major I would want to go to SV but I don't have the money nor the experience. I'm thinking of moving to Mexico because I absolutely love Mexican culture, the people, and the food. How possible would it be for me to find a good job in somewhere like Guadalajara or Mexico City?
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: I got an internship offer at IBM where I live, would it make things easier to accept the internship, and ask for a full-time job in GDL if I do well by the end of it?"
7tlylm,3,2018-01-28,College student with no on else to turn to,IgetitIdont,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7tlylm/college_student_with_no_on_else_to_turn_to/,"I'm a junior in college majoring in film production. I should have about 40k in debt when I graduate. I'm getting a credit card and currently pay for my own phone, water and electricity (apartment rent is covered my financial aid). I do not have a car but I will have about 3k in August to get one. My (lower mid - working class) parents are not financially stable and I'm the first grandkid to go to college on both sides and not drop out for some reason. I do not have anyone to get advice from. 

I'd like to end up in a writers room and work up to being a showrunner/TV producer but my last and current job is working in advertising and graphic design. My dream job is to be a director. I have lots of experience but that's  not how the film industry works, of course. I do not mind getting into event photography or staying in advertising. Unfortunately, my two jobs have been non-workstudy on campus and so I cannot likely turn those into full time careers. 


* My university has a program where students can ""study abroad"" in LA and are given an internship. I have the option of going the spring semester of my senior year (would cost about $3-7k) or the summer after I graduate ($15k) My parents are encouraging me to go because the experience is important since I picked a more difficult field and that the extra loans I'd have to take out are a drop in the bucket. Is a max of 15k really not worth much? I'd love to go but I'm not sure if it's the best financial option. A lot of kids go through the program and end up with jobs from their internship or at another similar place and stayed in LA. I also know kids who didn't get anything. Should I take that opportunity?


If I don't take the program and get a job then I need to figure out where I'm going to live when i graduate. 



- I can stay in my college town of Austin, Texas which has a great film scene. I also have the most connections here in regards to getting on to other people's sets. I like advertising and would love to work in an advertising field here. I also wouldn't mind getting in as an event photographer/videographer. I'm currently building a portfolio of my commercial, graphic design and narrative work so that I can be prepared. But I don't know how expensive life really is after college and if staying here is the right decision. I live right by campus but I'd like to move further out my senior year so that when I graduate I wouldn't have to live near college kids and pay astronomical prices. Is life after college truly that ""paycheck to paycheck"" expensive?

- I also have the option of moving in with parents who live in Atlanta (they just recently moved there, I do pay instate tuition). My parents are on the brink of divorce and my father is verbally abusive to my brother (he is not and has not been abusive to me). My brother will likely be in community college at the time I'd be living there. They said I could stay in the basement so the only time I'd ever really see them is when I'm in the kitchen. My parents are bad with money so I'd likely have to deal with wifi, cable, electricity and water off at times. I also, don't think I can handle seeing my father mistreat my brother anymore. I've spoken up about it since I was in high school but now my father is more sensitive about it. I can trust that my mother wouldn't allow him to kick me out but I can't assure that I'd have a positive home environment. Also, how drastically does one's relationship with their parents change when they move home post graduation? And should I (20f but I'd be 21 if I moved in) be worried about my social life? Overall, if post-college life is truly that expensive, I don't know what to do. 

TLDR: In total, I just don't want to be crippled by debt and living paycheck to paycheck like my parents do. Statistically, that's unlikely, however. What can I do now to maximize my chances of being stable financially after graduation?"

&amp;nbsp;  

**Intro**  

He's the OG Boy Wonder, a swashbuckling daredevil with a heart of gold, who's not afraid to fly without a safety net.  

She's an iconic breakout superhero, a determinator with a sharp mind and the will to overcome any obstacle in her way.  

Dick Grayson (Robin/Nightwing) and Barbara Gordon (Batgirl/Oracle) may have began their superhero careers as sidekicks and supporting characters, but they've grown out of their initial roles and have undertaken journeys to blossom into their own leading characters. And throughout the years, their paths have crossed repeatedly, as colleagues, close friends, and lovers, while igniting explosive ship wars all over the Internet.  

&amp;nbsp; 

**The Early Years**  

As one of the first of many supporting characters in the Batman universe, Dick Grayson made his introduction as Robin in 1940, bringing a side of lightness and a relatable audience surrogate to the dark and broody Batman. A circus boy who had watched his parents die, Dick was adopted as a ward of Bruce Wayne, and became his crimefighting partner, setting the standard for kid sidekicks and kicking off a great legacy.  

Barbara Gordon made her debut in 1967, originally created for adaptation in the *Batman* TV series. The daughter of Police Commissioner James Gordon, she got her first taste of crimefighting foiling an attempt to kidnap Bruce Wayne while dressed in a Bat costume for a party. In direct contrast to the original Batwoman, a damsel-in-distress love interest, Batgirl was a capable crimefighter and detective, and quickly became a fan favorite among readers.  

In 1975, Batgirl and Robin were brought together as co-leads of *Batman Family*, an ongoing anthology series featuring stories about supporting characters of the Batman franchise. By day, the college-aged Dick Grayson was an intern working for Barbara Gordon, who by then was a Congresswoman in her mid-20s. During this period, there was no intention to romantically pair the two, [though Dick's attraction to the older woman was a point of comedy](https://i.imgur.com/gijcvpA.png). They were, however, loyal partners who fought dastardly villains like [a devil-worshipping ghost of Benedict Arnold](https://i.imgur.com/HStVyUQ.png) and [the Penguin's daughter (not really)](https://i.imgur.com/35mHgRo.png). Comics were weird back then.  

The early years of the Batgirl/Robin partnership were consolidated in the Post-Crisis timeline with Chuck Dixon and Scott Beatty's *Batgirl: Year One*, which saw a younger Barbara [flirting and teaming up with Robin much earlier in her career](https://i.imgur.com/EI85gOQ.jpg). Tragically, there were no Benedict Arnold ghosts involved this time.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Nightwing and Oracle**  

The 80s saw Dick and Barbara go their own separate ways. Dick became the face of Marv Wolfman and George Pérez's *The New Teen Titans*, DC's bestselling book that saw Dick undergo significant character growth (aging quickly into his 20s), as he learned to be an open and trusting leader, and fall in love with the fiery (I'm so sorry) Starfire. In the famous story arc *The Judas Contract*, Dick traded in his green shortpants to [become Nightwing](https://i.imgur.com/AkmKKBU.jpg), as a tribute to his inspiration Superman.  

Sadly enough, Barbara received neither a spiffy disco outfit nor an exotic alien lover. Instead, she was infamously crippled in the Alan Moore story *The Killing Joke*, as a means to bring anguish to her father Jim Gordon. Unhappy with the treatment of the character, writer John Ostrander and editor Kim Yale decided to reinvent the character, bringing her back into publication under the alias Oracle in the pages of *Suicide Squad*. As Oracle, Barbara slowly became more prominent figure over the years in the greater DC Universe, serving as an all-knowing information broker to the Bat Family and the Justice League. She also became the leader of her own team, the [Birds of Prey](https://i.imgur.com/kE8JaXy.jpg). Outside of comics, she was recognized as an inspirational hero who did not allow her physical disability to hold her back.    

After his wedding to Starfire was rudely interrupted by an evil Raven obliterating the minister and implanting a seed into the bride, Dick moved back into the greater Gotham area and rejoined the Bat Family. In his solo *Nightwing* series penned by Chuck Dixon, Dick set up shop in the Gotham-adjacent city of Blüdhaven to investigate the local organized crime scene. It was there when Dick reconnected with his old friend Barbara for tech support. Fans responded positively to their interactions, and Dixon, who also wrote *Birds of Prey*, slowly built up a romance between the two former partners. Also, Barbara owned some really neat [Batfamily](https://i.imgur.com/QWWzCNL.png) [plushies](https://i.imgur.com/Rq9m1o7.png).   

A series of banter and flirtations eventually led to Dick taking Barbara out [on a circus date](https://i.imgur.com/1N8wZTf.jpg), in the fan-beloved *Birds of Prey* #8. While reminiscing over their history together, Barbara told Dick that she was proud of who she had become, in spite of her injury. She also admitted that she missed swinging through the air, which prompted Dick to [take her up on the trapeze](https://i.imgur.com/DaprScH.jpg), culminating in a [quiet intimate moment](https://i.imgur.com/ZTN4VqR.jpg). Following the circus date, and their time spent together throughout the events of *No Man's Land*, their attraction matured into a stable relationship, as they helped ground and provide emotional support for one another, all while fighting their own battles.  

After Dixon left both titles, the Dick/Barbara relationship suffered. Barbara's insecurities and Dick's overbearing tendencies, compounded with a female vigilante from Blüdhaven stalking the couple, resulted in a break-up. Depending on who was writing, the couple was on and off again. At one point, [they were engaged](https://i.imgur.com/TH3vqSz.jpg), only to have the wedding called off due to ever-changing and confusing editorial directions.  

Their relationship did smooth out over time, particularly when Dick took over the Batman mantle in Bruce's absence. In Scott Snyder's *Batman: The Black Mirror*, Dick worked with Barbara and [Commissioner Gordon](https://i.imgur.com/istbtIQ.png) to solve a series of grisly murders. Dick [came to Barbara's aid](https://i.imgur.com/KowLwmc.jpg) when she was kidnapped by her psychopathic brother.  

In the kind-of-canon-but-who-really-knows-the-story-behind-it-all *Convergence* event, the pre-Flashpoint Dick and Barbara received their happy ending, [finally getting married](https://i.imgur.com/io0FyPC.jpg) in front of their colleagues and friends.  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Post-Flashpoint**  

In the Post-Flashpoint timeline, Dick is back to being Nightwing, and Barbara, thanks to an experimental surgery that restored the use of her legs, has become Batgirl again. Being in their early 20s, Dick and Barbara did not retain their romantic history, though they do remain close friends [starting from when they first worked together as teenagers](https://i.imgur.com/d0YwRRa.png). Despite [mutual interest](https://i.imgur.com/v05NCkr.png), they had never found the time to commit to a serious relationship, thanks to a number of reasons, including [family tragedies](https://i.imgur.com/XdjQ0OM.png), [competing love interests](https://i.imgur.com/yAgY8SR.png), and faking death to [go on wild superspy adventures with ""Scary Gay Batman""](https://i.imgur.com/mNno1Px.jpg).  

&amp;nbsp;  

**Other Universes/Media**  

The Dick Grayson/Barbara Gordon relationship has been depicted in a number of media adaptations and alternate universes. The classic *Batman: The Animated Series* first introduced the relationship (and arguably popularized it). They were initially shown as a college couple, each unaware of the other's secret identity, and later as exes who [bickered like a divorced couple](https://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m82jxi9R0f1rcpewuo1_500.gif). In *Young Justice*, Dick and Barbara were childhood friends who later became [""friends with benefits""](https://i.imgur.com/oJhNDeP.jpg) following the time-skip. Other works, such as [*Teen Titans Go!*](https://i.gyazo.com/4b3d0a918d002e18f864c3ff4d9575db.gif), [*Batman: Li'l Gotham*](https://i.imgur.com/XCatzjp.png), *Earth 2*, and *Tiny Titans* have had mentions as well.

7tm4yl,145,2018-01-28,"Is she really nice or really controlling? MIL won't stop infantilizing my daughter and argues with me when I try to parent. (Long, so very long.)",kassiekatt,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7tm4yl/is_she_really_nice_or_really_controlling_mil_wont/,"I am always nervous to post because I don't want to be ""yelled"" at, so a product of my shitty past. I also have issues with setting boundaries and sticking up for myself that I am in therapy working on. Lots of narcs in my past that were around me growing up and even are around still, if more covertly.

Most of the time I think my MIL is really nice and there is something wrong with me for doubting it. I have two things that she's done to me that I will never forget or forgive. I may go into more detail in future posts but one involves me being hit with something and she protected the person who hit me (faaaamily is why) and the second that as the only person invited to our wedding when we eloped, I was NC with both parents at the time and they would ruin it anyway, she said no because she didn't want to get off the computer and go. But out to eat, little kids birthdays, holidays, and literal daily shopping trips are ok. She pretends she doesn't like to leave the house but she's gone a lot of the time. It's an excuse not to have to run a brush through her hair or wear something nicer imo.

Anyway, due a bunch of background info, I don't want to get into I stay with MIL while I attend university. I would stay elsewhere and did previously but it ties into the narc/abusive parents situation I have. Yeah, stepparents included like a damn nest of cluster b issues. I once tried to go out and get a place on my own while letting kiddo stay with MIL while it was stable for a month because I didn't want to uproot DD if it fell through. It fell through horribly and resulted in me staying at a homeless shelter for a couple of weeks at night while spending my afternoons with dd when she got out from school. MIL figured it out and invited me to stay with her. This is why I feel like such a bitch for telling her no or setting boundaries with her. So, if your advice is for me to move out asap please don't even bother because it's what I'm working on and it pisses me off because I totally would do that already if I could. Please and thank you. Also, please be gentle with me. If you glance at my post history I'm having a hard time as far as family and relationships go. I'm separated from her son and have been for a few years if that contributes anything to the advice giving. 

But yeah, plan to get out is in motion and I don't have much time left in school but I'm at the work for free point so I am not home often and MIL helps care for dd. Even before this her son would buy dd stuff and gets her food but as far as actual care he left it to his mother and part of why we are separated and yet I'm in the situation I'm about to describe anyway and that pisses me off too. 

When we were together in our own house he wouldn't keep steady work. He does great now which I'm happy and proud for/of him but it seems convenient to me. Anyway, I ended up having two jobs and would work for the landlord as a painter/cleaner/yard person/trash taker outer/ and anything else needed to fix up properties to get more money. He would pay me cash if I needed it or take it off our rent. That man was an angel, I swear. Rarely would I ever take cash and I made sure to bust my ass and try really hard at the work given to me. He offered it to my husband too while I was at work and the few times dh did the work he would take all the cash and landlord said that work wasn't done as well either. Which was so embarrassing to me. If that was the only embarrassing thing.

I found out that while I was at my night job that he would have MIL come over and watch dd and let her clean and do the laundry and everything while he went and played video games or whatever next door. I would sometimes take an extra third shift since I was a waitress and they would all hang out at my house at night. It really upset me and I felt, it may be wrong but I felt betrayed too. Because not only was he doing this but he would keep our only vehicle with him and sleep through when he was supposed to pick me up and kept saying, ""well, have your co-worker friend do it,"" Click. ZzzZzzz. 

This is the first time I've actually shared this. It's scary tbh.

While dh was in high school he wanted to wrestle another year so he tried to fail his senior year, this is a story straight from his mouth btw, and MIL went behind him and did all his homework for him so he didn't fail. Which annoyed him. Ya'll. I know. I accept responsibility for my choices to be with him and I love my child so it is worth it. Plus, he's changed now that he's got his way kinda, more on that later.

It may be all over the place but there is the briefest amount of info I can give you to kinda paint how this happened and why. Also, hopefully, it helps to finally share this stuff. I read a story yesterday and a woman was in a similar situation as me and no one was berating her or looking at her weird like wtf Why? What is wrong with you? Maybe I won't delete this. Hope not. I'm terrified.

So, dd and I are here at MIL's and she helps me care for dd while I'm at school as I said. She's admitted to me she babies dd too much and I'm like np you recognize it and I'll help you not. No big deal since I'm the mom and around right? Sigh. No.

You'd think I'd shit on a holy book and slapped her in the face with it from the look I got. 

She does everything for everyone around her and unless they put distance between themselves and her there is no stopping her. Mention you're leaving? Here's some money. Buys stuff. Cleans stuff. Watches all the kids in the family. Only BIL comes by for visits and doesn't do this stuff he's the functional one as I call him, SIL too. The other kids had to struggle to get out from under her too nice control tactics imo. I'll post on that later too. It's the kind of drama we love here.

My mom has even noticed this and MIL has tried to do stuff for her too. And if I didn't have a few instances of doubt about MIL I would hate myself for this because she's so nice and people like her so much.

When her daughter lived with her and her kids were with MIL as well, both ILs undermined SIL at every turn and especially with the youngest who is near dd's age. ""Oh just leave the baby alone."" was FIL's mantra and MIL's was ""Don't worry I'll do it you go do xyz."" and not taking no for an answer. When SIL thought about moving out of state once I heard MIL ranting in her kitchen and she threatened grandparents' rights if SIL ""took her baby away."" Yikes.

So here I am and I'm noticing that my kiddo is a bit timid and can't do as much as other kids as far as independence goes. I asked her if she had to make herself toast where would she start and she said she'd look it up on her phone. I hate myself and I'm so disappointed in myself that I let this infantilization happen to my daughter.

The current issue is dd bathing herself and washing her own hair. To not get into too much detail my dd is basically a mini adult and she's been wanting privacy and people not to touch her lately. Which is totally cool except that she thinks she can't wash her own hair and said she didn't know how. Like, dudette I have done it for you myself and I know I walked you through the steps?

I think she's afraid she'll get soap in her eyes and is like terrified of it. I get that it sucks but there is no issue going on that makes it particularly worse for her, I've talked to her and asked several times. This is just typical kid trying to avoid discomfort.

I'm ready to get her some earplugs and goggles and let her go and said as much in front of MIL. MIL laughed but I notice she's been quieter around me and kinda sulking too.

Yesterday was to be the first time dd took a shower on her own. Dd comes to talk to me and looks gravely worried. ""MIL said there is no baby shampoo and she has to help me and told me to tell you."" Nah. I told her she didn't need help and she didn't need baby shampoo on top of that. Put a washcloth over your eyes and learn how to not get soap in your eyes yourself kid. Learn how to rinse it out of your eyes, and figure out the rest. Like edging baby bird out of the nest and even said that to MIL to get my point across.

MIL bathed/washed dd's hair yesterday anyway. If I would have fought it it would have been a huge scene and dd looked like she was in the middle and about to cry because she's afraid to try herself and afraid of the soap. I cannot help but be frustrated a little with dd about this. I am being gentle with her but at her age and this issue, idk what to do past telling her it's something she's going to have to figure out at some point. I've explained the steps the process and anything to help her. I want MIL out of the fucking bathroom with my kid. 

She acts like ""oh well, since kassiekat isn't up dd's ass I have to be or she will be neglected."" at least that is how I feel. Idk it could be something she does to feel needed still. She could be a covert narc and exerting her power and control. IDK

All I know is I feel like MIL is the other parent. Dh just rolls his eyes and huffs if I say anything and he doesn't want to do the care stuff so of course he's ok with it. She gets all quiet and pouty and I know she's pissed.

She tries to argue with me telling me what dd needs like idk. Like she's the primary caretaker and I'm on the outside. And when I do try to set boundaries or do things like this with dd I get so much passive-aggressive resistance and excuses from her.

Any advice please? I can't leave just yet and even if I did move out early it would take months. TBH this is my least abusive option atm and shelters are not an option.

Thank you for those who hung in there and read all this.

Also, a couple of people suggested a book to get dd about how to care for your body and it is aimed at developing young people. I am for sure doing that. I just want MIL to stop infantilizing and smothering my daughter without seeming ungrateful or anything. Obvious I'm rbn huh? Yeah, I know... I have a lot of guilt over all of this for many reasons too.

Thank you again. &lt;3 Also, may need a name if there are any suggestions.


eta by not home often that's me being gone two days a week from 9am-9pm and then will probably be 3-4 days when internships start again. But I am there when she goes to school, bed, and other stuff. 


2nd edit: my dd is 11 if that helps anyone else out with advice. too. I appreciate you all. Thank you for caring enough to reply and help &lt;3

7tm5ki,3,2018-01-28,I [24F] broke up with a guy [22M] and I'm unsure how to interact with his mom [50sF] in the aftermath,worriedthrowaway99,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7tm5ki/i_24f_broke_up_with_a_guy_22m_and_im_unsure_how/,"Throwaway because some people involved use Reddit. Details have been changed a bit to protect anonymity. This is pretty lengthy and I appreciate anyone who reads it. I'm happy to provide more clarification if needed. On mobile so I apologize for any typos/errors

I met Monica [50sF] at my summer job. We hit it off really well and became pretty close. As I got to know her better, she began to tell me about her son, Darren [22M]. Darren was in a really bad accident three years prior and now lives with a horrible chronic pain condition. He's completely dependent on his parents and it puts a huge amount of physical, emotional and financial strain on the whole family. Darren is very lonely because all of his friends have gone off to college and are moving on with their lives, where his has stagnated. After she had told me about this, I offered to meet him. She appreciate the offer but didn't take me very seriously at first, because a lot of people offer and never follow through. I kept insisting and she finally set up a meeting. 

Darren and I ended up hitting it off better than anyone expected and we started casually dating one another. His parents were absolutely enthralled. The whole family started to become fixated on me. They were putting a lot of pressure on me to basically be Darren's reason for getting up in the morning. Telling me that I was gonna be a huge part of his recovery, that they hadn't see him this happy in years, offering me a room free of charge (I'm a poor college student so that was hard to turn down but I'm so glad I did). I don't hold it against them, they were and are still desperate and not thinking rationally. But it was too much for any one person to handle. 

We dated for 2-2.5 months. I let it go on for longer than it should've. Mainly because while I knew things weren't going to work long term, we were both having fun, and Darren kept expressing that he wanted to keep it casual and non exclusive. However I could tell that he was far more attached to me than I was to him. What finally ended it though was when we all went on a camping trip together, Darren kept trying to initiate sex when I explicitly told him I was uncomfortable with the lack of privacy, and assured him we could once we were home. He kept pushing it and finally threw a huge toddler style tantrum when I wouldn't budge. He said some incredibly hurtful things, such as telling me that he didn't give a shit about my feelings, and insinuating that prior sexual trauma in my life was the reason why I turned him down sometimes and how this is cruel to him.  When I told him he was being callous and selfish, he got offended by my ""name calling"" and told me that I was making a big deal out of nothing and I was ruining the rest of the trip by choosing not to let this go. He was so venomous and angry and his behavior truly frightened me. I have been in an abusive relationship in the past, and I'm really susceptible to gaslighting and similar things in the moment. We were out of state, and had two more days on our trip. I didn't have another way home. I'm not proud, but eventually I just rolled over and apologized for upsetting him. I just wanted him to stop being angry at me, it was terrifying and triggering. 

For the remainder of the trip, I kind of convinced myself that I was fine and acted normal and sweet to him for the rest of the trip. Once I got home and I had space, I realized how fucked up the whole situation was and how awful I had felt. I ended it via email, which again, I'm not proud of. But I had so much anxiety around calling him that I kept putting it off, and I realized doing it asap mattered more. Before that fight, I would've been open to staying friends. But I made it very clear in my email that his behavior was unacceptable to me and to not contact me again. 

Now, here's my question. Recently I started working at the same place again, a paid position this time (I was an intern during the summer). I'm incredibly happy to be back, this is a job that I love and I might make a career out of. I have a good rapport with the staff and clients involved. Except Monica. I haven't seen or heard from her since I ended things with Darren, which was almost five months ago. I reached out to her once via text about a week after the breakup and apologized for the hurt I caused and let her know that I still considered her my friend, and it was okay if she didn't feel the same way. She never responded. So I have absolutely no idea how she feels. Does she hate me? Is she embarrassed? Who knows. Hell I don't even know what she knows about the situation. I don't know what Darren told her, if anything. But now that I'm working this job again, it's only a matter of time before I bump into her again. And it's causing me so much stress and anxiety because I don't know when, or what it will be like. 

My boss, who I'm pretty close with (met him when I was a kid), who is also Monica's boss and friends with her whole family knows about the situation and has been very empathetic (he even told me that Darren's behavior was inexcusable and to kick his ass to the curb when I was fretting about hurting Darren's feelings) so I know someone has my back if things come up at work. I'm just not sure how to navigate this. I'm not sure if I should try to seek her out, not necessarily talk to her but just to get a gauge on how she feels by her response. We work in different areas but things intermingle and coordinate from time to time, and waiting for the shoe to drop is causing me such unease. I still care about Monica. To some extent, I still care about Darren, though I have no desire to be close to him again. I know that me and Monica probably can't be friends again, but I hope that we can at least be civil with one another. This company hires on a gig by gig basis, and a lot of people want me to work one this summer, but I know for sure that Monica is working that same one. I'm kind of at a loss over what to do. 

Help me Reddit, what should I do?

TL;DR: started seeing my friend/coworker's son casually, ended it after 2.5 months. Started working at the company again, haven't seen my friend/coworker since I broke up with her son, will eventually bump into her and I'm worried about how to navigate things because she might hate me "
7tma0n,117,2018-01-28,"From Campaign Manager to Homeless Shelter -- How a lawyer, candidate, and local leader is getting away with defrauding Seattle Voters and Pete Holmes not doing his job. Police Report Included.",pbtechie,SeattleWA,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/7tma0n/from_campaign_manager_to_homeless_shelter_how_a/,"Hello /r/SeattleWA, 

&amp;nbsp;
[Police Report](https://imgur.com/a/ertHY)
&amp;nbsp;


   Long time redditor and Seattle native here. This last summer I went from a volunteer to campaign manager on a Seattle City Council race. I was accelerated to this position through hard work, passion, and grit. This is my story of events.

&amp;nbsp;


I was inspired into the political realm when Bernie Sanders ran for President. I volunteered over 200 hours in 3 1/2 weeks at his Seattle Capitol Hill campaign office. The connections I made with staff and volunteers was astounding. Recieving a hug and a thank you from Bernie himself was worth every minute I spent volunteering. It made me want to step away from my background in theatre/music production. After that campaign was over, I wanted to continue on locally. 

&amp;nbsp;

Upon seeing strong, passionate, and powerful women of color,  [Nikkita Oliver, Nina Turner, and Erin Jones on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSIsDoG15o) supporting the campaign of Sheley Secrest for City Council Position 8. I immediately went on to the Seattle.gov page to find the campaigns contact page to express my interest in volunteering on the campaign. I was responded to by Secrest's Strategy Company, B&amp;B Strategies. One of the co-founders met me on 4/26 to give me a rundown of the campaign, and said I would be a good fit. The next meeting I would attend would be on 5/6. 

&amp;nbsp;

We met at a brewery on Lake City Way. B&amp;B Strategies was ran by two guys that are well versed in Washington Politics, one of them being the Chair of the Snohomish County Democrats. When I walked in, I was announced as B&amp;B's new intern. Which was a surprise to me. I accepted it at first because of their client roster and how good it would look on a resume. After the Meet &amp; Greet took place, Sheley wanted to be sure that I was solely on **HER** campaign. B&amp;B agree that was the case. So, for the following 2 1/2 weeks, I worked my ass to prove I could be an integral part of the campaign. Sheley and I had many talks on how much it meant to her to have a White Male helping her campaign. I was getting her on panels, involved in discussions, and using my own personal connections to help inform/educate her on topics/issues that she didn't know so well.

&amp;nbsp;

On 5/20, minutes after securing an Endorsement for Our Revolution Ballard, B&amp;B Strategies recommended to Sheley that she should put me on staff and sign me on as her campaign manager. We entered into an agreement on 5/26 and I got to work right away. I was in charge of leading the social media campaign, volunteer organization, public events, the candidates daily schedule, media relations, and many other things. Everything except finance. Which was incredibly problematic as I wasn't able to budget for work/volunteer space, hosting events, media purchases, and my material expenses. I was even told not to bring anything payroll related to her (Sheley's) attention. That was all in B&amp;B's hands.

&amp;nbsp;

**Democracy Vouchers:** A big part of my position was to come up with ways to obtain Democracy Vouchers (in fact, part of my pay was based on how many we got, so there was incentive to get what I could). But, in order to even be able to get the funds from the city through this program, every campaign had to go out and get [400 Signatures AND $10 donations to go WITH each signature](http://www.seattle.gov/democracyvoucher/i-am-a-seattle-resident/faqs#What%20does%20a%20candidate%20have%20to%20do%20to) from Seattle Registered Voters. Sheley was actually in the [ introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvvi2ZhCLY8) that helped explain the program. She was even called out by the Seattle Elections &amp; Ethics Commission, because even in the video she didn't explain the requirements how the law was written. This was something I had to repeat over and over to her because when we were at public events, people had more questions after her explanation not making sense. The campaign was having trouble meeting the requirements of the signatures and donations. Mainly after they were submitted to the city the first time around because the voter information that was submitted wasn't matching the city's records. So we had to go out and make up about 70 signatures/donations.


**On 6/3** at the Seattle Trans Pride Festival, just like any other event, we had a quick meet/review in Sheley's about the event we were about to participate in. Our goal was to 60 at this event, which we got 56. Sheley instructed me to just ask for signatures at the moment, ""We'll worry about the donations later"" she said. On the following Monday, we were going to an Upzone meeting. Again, in our car meeting, she asked me to reach in the back and grab the signature sheets and do a quick recount confirmation. Upon stating, ""yep, 56"" She pulled an envelope out of her purse, filled with $20's. She took out $40 of it, put it back in her purse, filled out '$10' for each empty box then folded the signature sheets around the envelope. Inside, my spirit was immediately deflated and questioned to myself what I got myself involved in. We went inside to the Rezone meeting, about 20 minutes in, our financier from B&amp;B came in and she handed off the money &amp; signatures to him in the back of the gymnasium. 


&amp;nbsp;

As 6/15 rolled around, I was told I wouldn't be receiving my paycheck until the funds became available. By 6/25 I was getting worried. After hearing from the SEEC we were informed that they were having trouble confirming the Donations with the respective signatures. I was down to one meal a day, and was dodging fare enforcement to make campaign events, and my phone was turned off. Any idea how hard it is to manage a campaign without a phone? I express that I would probably have to step down, but was talked out of it with the verbal agreement of a raise and the overall meaningfulness of the campaign itself. In fact, we were having a fundraising event hosted by Molly Neitzel, of Molly Moon's Ice Cream, that I made happen. Was told that if the Dem Voucher Funding didn't come through before that I would be paid from that fundraiser.


&amp;nbsp;

On 7/6 While I was staffing her over Facebook while she was at a live event at The Moore downtown, which I was live-streaming to our our social media, I found out that she had paid someone $40 to create an online flyer for the Molly Moon's Fundraiser. Yet, I couldn't even get $10 for the bus over the previous 2 weeks. When I brought this up, I was immediately relieved of my duties as the campaign manager. 



&amp;nbsp;

On 7/13, asking for a follow-up on my pay:
&gt; ""Yes, you will have trouble getting a paycheck in your hands by Tuesday night. As we have all informed you, until we qualify for the vouchers, you will not be prioritized over keeping my campaign running. As instructed, invoice us and we will pay off our debt as well as we pay our other debts.""

I submitted the invoice, and followed up again 4 days later after not hearing a word, 7/17:

&gt; I feel like this is a nightmare that won't end. Repeatedly, I've instructed you, Mario has instructed you, and Garrett have instructed you to invoice what is owed

I was told shortly after by B&amp;B that 'they weren't even getting paid' 

&amp;nbsp;


So I was keeping up on the Seattle.gov page daily to see if she ever got the funds from the Dem Vouchers. On 7/21 I decided to go into the Seattle Ethics &amp; Elections Office to share what had happened at the Trans Pride Festival and that cash hand off. 

On 8/16, I received an email from a Detective with the Seattle Major Crimes Task Force, requesting a meeting. They insisted we meet asap, with in 2 hours I was greeted by three detectives at a Starbucks, where I gave my statement in a Police Cruiser. Which REALLY made me feel this was incredibly serious. I had been approached by a reporter the weeks prior but put it off as I was in kind of a depressive funk from the whole ordeal. But after speaking with SPD, I called the Times Reporter. The next day [he published this article](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/seattle-candidate-accused-of-defrauding-democracy-voucher-program/)

&amp;nbsp;

About 9/22 it sounded that the detective had finished his investigation but was getting some push-back from the City Attorney's Office. He informed me that if I wanted to see any traction on this, that I would have to lead the charge, and probably even contact the Attorney General. Which REALLY stuck out to me. Over the next month, I was played phone games by the City Attorney's Office and King County Prosecutors Office. Finally on 10/27 the City Attorney's Office accepted the receiving of the Police Report, [which recommended charges against Secrest](http://q13fox.com/2017/12/15/police-recommend-false-reporting-charge-for-candidate/)

This has been sitting on Pete Holmes desk [ever since](http://mynorthwest.com/863989/still-no-charges-against-seattle-progressive-activist/?)


&amp;nbsp;

On top of this case, I have been trying to get Sheley into small claims for the lost wages part. With her being a lawyer and knowing the game, she's been able to dodge service, including hiding out in Cuba (I shit you not). I had a room in Shoreline that I lost because I couldn't maintain rent, my coming forward burned bridges among the political connections I had made, and am currently in a shelter in Downtown Seattle. I feel completely burned by this entire experience.  All I wanted to do was help bring equity and a voice to a demographic that is quickly being pushed out of the city. The friendship held between City Attorney Pete Holmes (who ALSO benefited from the Democracy Voucher program), Sheley Secrest and the King County NAACP is quite apparent. The voters and property tax payers of Seattle were defrauded and she's getting away with it.

7tmqzk,0,2018-01-28,Should I wait on a job offer or accept the one I currently have?,lolzbandit,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/7tmqzk/should_i_wait_on_a_job_offer_or_accept_the_one_i/,"Hey everyone! As the title suggests, I'm stuck in an unfamiliar situation and I'm not sure how to go about it.

A bit of background about myself, I'm currently in my 3rd year majoring in Accounting and I've recently gone through 2 interviews at 2 different firms. 

I've gotten an offer from Firm A (I'll exclude the firm's name for the time being until it becomes relevant to the discussion), but before I make my call I also want to know about the decision for my application at Firm B. I've been given until the end of this week to take the offer, but Firm B is notorious for taking their time to reply to applicants. Both of my interviews had taken place last week, so I don't expect to hear back from Firm B until mid-February earliest. 

I've made a list of pros/cons for taking the offer, and one for waiting it out, but it still hasn't made the choice any easier. 

Taking Firm A's offer (Accounting Analyst, 8mo contract):
PROS
- Guaranteed job
- Centralized on accounting
- More technical experience to be gained
- Smaller company, could be easier to stand out from other interns (?)
CONS
- 1.5hr commute one-way to the office
- Situated in the outskirts of town (little chance of hanging around after work)
- Pay is below/average for the position
- The offer was presented a few hours my interview (through phone); wasn't sure whether that should be a red flag
- The hiring manager didn't seem too interested in what I had to say; literally my only impression of the company was from my interaction with them


Waiting for Firm B's offer (Financial Analyst, 16mo contract)
PROS
- Better reputation
- Closer to home
- Better networking opportunities
- Greater exposure to other departments
- More attractive company culture
- Potential better pay
- Potential better overall experience
- Longer term = higher (?) chance of full time offer upon completion
CONS
- Highly competitive position; lower chance of being offered

If you managed to read through all this, I'd greatly appreciate your input! I'll be sure to stay active on this thread to clarify any points.

7tn4mw,12,2018-01-28,Locked into G-Suite!,bb79,google,https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/7tn4mw/locked_into_gsuite/,"Hi.

I signed up my domain to Google Apps/G-Suite back when it was a free service. At the moment I only have one user account under the domain, which I use as my personal Google account and is also the account for my Android phone, app purchases, music, books, etc.

Unfortunately Google won't allow user accounts managed under G-Suite (even the really old types) to access family sharing, Project Fi and a whole bunch of other good things.

I've spent the last hour stuck in Google's Kafkaesque world of support pages, admin panels and forums and it seems like there is no way to ""downgrade"" a user account from using G-Suite to a bog-standard Google account. There also seems to be no way to contact support or speak to someone who could help (so much for those helpdesk scenes in The Intern...!)

I could delete the G-Suite account, along with my user account but then all my Android, book and music purchases will evaporate.

Has anyone else come across a workable solution? There must be a way.

Thanks."

I'm a little naive for a girl my age, but that doesn't stop my confidence. I have a beautiful face that compliments my athletic, petite frame. My hair is blonde and hangs in thick blonde waves around my small shoulders - - my perfume smells of coconuts and vanilla. I have piercing blue eyes which are highlighted by perfectly applied make up; my lips are stained a bright red. You notice the dimples that bite into my cheeks when I flash you a wide smile of pearly white teeth.


It's my first day at the office and I've chosen to wear a pair of black nylon stockings, black pumps, a fitted white blouse that hugs my perky breasts, and a wavy loose fitting black skirt. When I walk, the fabric dances in the air against my upper thighs with the sway of my hips. The hem of the skirt is long enough to conceal the supple curves of my creamy white ass cheeks. 


You gulp heavily behind your desk as I move towards your office. I take a deep breath as I knock softly on your office door, preparing myself for our first introduction.

Hi there, my name is Violet and I'm 21, nearly 22. I am hoping together we can establish a long-term RP using my prompt as our first introduction. The direction our 'romance' can go is pretty limitless aside my from Scat, gore, vomit, blood, and water sports. 

I like spanking, light bondage, romance, cheating, public sex, affairs, the idea of being or almost being caught, cum play, oral, strong men, men who are eager to explore a younger woman, beards, tattoos, and the idea of a man taking my anal virginity. Once we establish our likes and dislikes I am open to exploring ourselves together more. 

I am hoping to find a writer who uses detail in his responses as I myself am a detailed writer. I'd love a reply to my prompt along with some information about yourself

Wow this week has been a shitshow. I moved yesterday for the next two months while I have an internship, which has been really good and really bad.

The good is that I'm staying with a relative who I get along with really well, and who also is working to be healthier. She doesn't need to lose weight like me, but we're both working towards healthier habits, and having someone else makes it really fun. We went to the gym yesterday and are going again today. With my internship, I also will be able to cook and plan what I eat for all three meals. I'm very optimistic about the next couple of months.

The bad is that this past week has been terrible. I have been incredibly anxious about this internship, which always gives me weird food habits. The first few days of the week I barely ate, and then I just started eating a ton towards the end of the week. I also have been eating out a lot with friends and family, which always encourages me to eat more than I want to/should. 

All in all, the last week was not what I'd hoped it would be, but I'm optimistic about the week ahead!"

We're in college. In the beginning, he began pursuing me, I wasn't interested, but continued to hang out frequently. I fell in love with him and we began a serious relationship. 

Used to spend the night together nearly 6/7 nights a eek. Summer 2017 he wanted me to move in with him in Jan 2018 after I got back from a Fall 2017 out of town internship. (Something came up to no fault of my own, internship lasted for 4 weeks instead of Aug - December) I ended up signing a lease for an apartment back in our college town. We decided we'd get a small duplex unit in Fall 2018. 

He has now signed a lease, Fall 2018 - summer 2019, to ""live with the guys"" for another year. We don't spend the night with each other much anymore, 2 - 3 nights a week. He says it's because he really needs to focus on school, which is completely understandable and believable. He goes out with his guy friends pretty often.. but rarely seems interested in doing anything with me. His sex drive is considerably lower too. (I'm a gym girl, so it's not for lack of attraction) We've talked about it some, but don't seem to get anywhere. *He's definitely not cheating on me.*

I'm afraid he's falling out of love with me and either 1) sees it and is trying to figure himself out and needs space... or 2) is stringing me along just because ... or 3) he doesn't know it. but I still feel inadequate and am just being crazy for the first time. 

I used to be a big priority in his life, but now I feel like I'm on the backburner and am seriously taken for granted. I know I deserve to be treated better, but he clearly doesn't see anything wrong with this. I want to spend the rest of my life with this guy but ... I'm just full of doubts. What can I do?

I approached but have found out they are taken. 

I also keep doubting that computer science is for me. I hate my major, but I like that I get a lot of money through it. I want the money to be able to buy all video game systems and to go on nice vacations and to be on a yacht with model like beautiful women. 

I have really bad grades. I have 2.4 and I need to get it up to 2.6-2.8 in order to study abroad and to join a fraternity. Most parties are Greek only. How do I get my grades up? I don't have any internship/career experience. I also doubt my computer science major and am in it for money only. 

In class, I usually approach women with ""how was the quiz"" or ""ready for the coming test/exam"" or ""what did you get for x problem on the assignment""? Or in social events/bars/beach approaches, I will make a comment about the weather or ask her if she is here for x event or ask her what she enjoys at the bar. I approached a few women this week, but they acted cold and in some cases, straight up ignored me. What did I do wrong? Was my frame/game too weak? I'm in my junior year of university and still haven't had a girlfriend or sex, and have been trying since high school. I have been cold approaching girls in classes/social events/yoga classes. I have asked out a few girls, but I found out they already were taken when I approached them. I have no idea how to get them interested on a date or to take them to my place. How do I build rapport and create sexual chemistry? I am also awkward as FUCK online, and say something which causes them to end to convo or unmatch me. Even in person, I will use some stupid pick up / PUA line and they will be turned off.

What do I need to improve? I feel like a failure. I have no gf, most of my friends are busy, and I have no job or internship experience.

7to4ms,2,2018-01-28,"Me [34 M] with my [30 F] since 4 years, in LDR but hate it and going insane",RelevantToTheNameOf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7to4ms/me_34_m_with_my_30_f_since_4_years_in_ldr_but/,"Hi all, I need a fresh perspective on this to make sure I don't do something too rash. 

I'm 34 M, and have been in a relationship with a great girl for the last 4 years. She had recently got out of a long-term relationship and started seeing me, same with me although I had a few more months of being single. We didn't know each other before. 

I proposed to her almost one and a half years ago and she accepted. However, she kept it a secret from her family for a long time. We can't talk about the future, or set a wedding date because she always wants everything to fall into place before we get married or think about children. I want children and don't make it a secret. She does too but she wants all the stars to be aligned beforehand. 

She was doing a hard degree program and when that finished, she went away to her home town for an internship. That internship turned into a temp job, and though I didn't like it, I accepted it because it was in her field. Sometime later, she said she didn't like the job, and it wasn't what she wanted to do long-term. 

Now: our ups and downs. 

1. When we were a very fresh couple, I made the mistake of taking our relationship as non-exclusive, and was with another woman for a while at the same time. It was wrong, I never told her when it was happening, only after I ended things, because I wanted to be serious with her. She took it as cheating and to this day, goes back to it at every argument we have. 

2. A few months after I told her about the other girl, I found out that she was actually still in a relationship with her ex. She would visit him when she was in her home town. Her parents didn't know about me at this point. I kept this bottled in for a long time, but exploded and was ready to break up with her over it but she said she would stop being in touch with him. She claims he has mental issues and had threatened numerous times to commit suicide. If I take her at her word, there was no sexual contact between them after we started dating. This contributed to me not trusting her.   

2. We were long-distance for a few months although we visited each other almost every weekend. In that time she was very jealous and controlled my movements because she thought I was doing something with very girl who looked at me. In that time-frame, I took to hiding pictures that I had with friends who were girls, especially ones she was especially jealous of. Nothing sexual, just selfies on a night out or whatever. She found those a few months later, and had a meltdown. Again, my fault. I should have left them out in the open and faced the consequences as they came. I never cheated on her but to this day she brings it up.  

4. Last year, I got sick of the arguments and her constant questioning, keeping tabs on me and going through my phone at every opportunity. We went on vacation, and I told myself that if she looked through my phone I would break up with her. We had been long-distance at this point for 8 months and engaged for a year. Well, she did and when we got back I broke up with her. I was carrying the anger of months of being suspected, and didn't care about her feelings. She tried to reach out a lot, and it was really hard on her. I didn't answer her because I felt we weren't on a good path. We were fighting all the time, not only about the trust but everything else. Well, long story short I did a lot of introspection and realized that I needed to work on myself and to listen to her. Her lack of trust just meant that I needed to work harder to build up trust. I did all this in about 4-5 weeks after the initial break-up and told her that I wanted to get back with her. She accepted, in a fashion. 

Her main complaints were: 

1. I don't take care of her monetarily.  
2. I take too many selfies with other girls. (She doesn't care about selfies I take with guys)   
3. I should have only a tight friend circle that I always hang out with and shouldn't meet new people too often because it's unnecessary temptation.   

I'm simplifying things because I'm a stereotypical guy and I'm sure there's an entire emotional range that I'm compressing into the 3 points above. 

Now, it's been 6 months since the break-up and her job contract has been extended. She still hates the job but is refusing to even consider moving back to our apartment without a job lined up. To me, that's insane because I know how hard it is to find something from far away. On top of that, she commutes 2 hours a day and barely has any time. In the entire time she's been there, she hasn't applied for a single job because she needs to hit every bullet point on a job description to even consider applying. As someone who's had many jobs and been on both sides of the interview table, I know that most job descriptions are wishlists and companies often accept candidates missing many requirements or skills, especially at a Junior level. 

Our trust issues have only gotten worse but this time I know she's not just looking for a reason to dump me so I take things as they come. She went through my phone again during our last time together. Didn't find anything and said that I would have deleted everything anyway. I was pissed off at that but don't know what to say. 

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Long-term LDR, I don't know where things are going. Job and trust issues. I am extremely lonely and social options are curtailed by her because she doesn't trust me. What should I do? "
7to6no,12,2018-01-28,Marriage advice needed. Wife said something hurtful recently.,birdgottafly,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/7to6no/marriage_advice_needed_wife_said_something/,"My wife is pregnant with our sixth child. This is an unexpected pregnancy. We were talking about the need for more space than our current home and we decided to start shopping around online for a new house.

She found a few places and I did and we were comparing them. All of the places I picked it were the size we needed for our family and all at good prices, my wife picked out houses that were significantly more expensive. 

We had a good time sitting together and looking through our prospective new homes. Then she found a place she fell in love with. She was ecstatic about this house and sent the realtor an email right then. The whole time I was quiet because I know that this house is way out of our price range.

I brought this up and I said, “Babe I like it too, but you shouldn’t torture yourself. You know we can’t afford that.”

Then she got very frustrated. She became much more distant, got disgusted, and then stopped wanting to look at houses. She got up took her shower and was quiet until we got into bed.

Then as we were laying there she sat up and said, “If you would get a real job and quit playing around with airplanes we could afford that house easy. You don’t even use your degree and I’m tired of being the only one really contributing financially to the household.”

I was able to diffuse the situation and she was calm the next morning. But that comment really hurt me.

For reference, my wife is an orthopedic surgeon and I own a flight school. My school is successful but thanks to the over head, I only bring home about $60k per year on average, which is obviously puny compared to what she brings home.

I started my school about a year prior to meeting my wife. When we met she was just starting her internship and I was financially supporting our budding family while she paid on her loans.

Owning this school was a dream for me since I was a kid and losing it would be like losing a part of who I am. 

To add, I’m a much more active parent than my wife is because she spends a lot of time at work. I help with homework and projects and set up vacations and drive them to friends houses and practices. I cook our meals, I take care of keeping the house clean and the yard manicured.

I do a lot for our family and I don’t think that should be discounted just because I make less money than she does and we can’t afford an obscene house because of it. 

But I also like to keep an open mind. 

Tl;dr - My wife made a comment about how she wishes I would get a real job so I can earn more money for it family? Am I wrong in this? Should I sell my school and start working in my field to bring in more money? Is my wife right?

[](http://bit.ly/2hkkQrA)Unpopular Opinion: I hate people who have the 'poor' mindset. 
   
   
 I not only oppose government welfare, I oppose private welfare.  You'd be better off burning your money than giving it to a person who lacks the drive to provide themselves opportunities.  At least burning it would provide you some heat.
   
   
 For the last 9 years, I've been living with poor people.  Why?  I rent out the spare room in my home, because I'm extroverted and like having some extra spending cash.  Every single one of them has been lazy and stupid.
   
   
 I recall one had tickets to Lollapalooza. She paid $50 each for them.  They were selling for $300 each on StubHub. Her boss wouldn't give her the day off. What'd she do? Well, not the smart thing, which is go to work and sell the tickets. Nope, she calls in sick! Yeah, I'm sure that won't be remembered come raise or layoff time.
   
   
 Another had to borrow money from me every year for his girlfriend's birthday.  Same girlfriend.  Three years in a row. 
   
   
  Sure, he always paid it back promptly, but seriously....  It happens on the same day every year!
   
   
 My current tenant is two months behind on rent.  I offered to knock off $150 if he raked the leaves and cleaned the gutters (a $60 value).  Guess what hasn't happened a month later?  Guess who won't be making any more generous offers of work in lieu of rent?  (Seriously, if you're looking to hire anyone in the Lake Worth area, check with me first to make sure you don't hire the guy.)
   
   
 He's a tow truck driver, who gets paid on commission (using his bosses equipment).  He was complaining about not getting paid to be on call.  I suggested he should go to his boss and ask how he could be of greater use to his boss. 
   
   
 Explain to his boss he wants to make more money, but he understands he needs to provide value to his boss, so he is respectfully asking his boss for help in becoming a more useful employee.  He looked at me like I had grown two heads. Then he went into a screed about how it isn't fair he doesn't get paid by the hour (even though his boss only gets paid a flat rate per tow).
   
   
 No matter how much you help these people, they will always be poor.  They squander every opportunity you give them, ignore any advice you give them, and only ever think of their own short term pleasure.  We should do away with all forms of charity, with the possible exception of work internships.  Work opportunities will separate the wheat from the chafe.  Let the rest die face down in the gutter.  At least then we'd get soap and glue when we rendered down their bodies.  (There's a touch of sarcasm in this paragraph...  you know, for effect)
   
   
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go stand on my porch and yell at children to get off my lawn.

I’m graduating hopefully in the spring but unfortunately have had 0 success getting a job. I’m a bme applied math double major, and I applied to a bunch of consulting firms and got rejected from everything, specifically I’ve applied to ~60 jobs on handshake that look relevant to my major but no acceptances so far and it’s getting super depressing. Any advice on what I should do or what I’m doing wrong? Here is my [sufficiently anonymized] background:

Major: bme/ ams looking to go to med school after 2ish years off
Work experience: research in a lab, Microsoft internship no full time offer [back when I was doubling in computer science], Deloitte internship no offer, Stryker freshman year, few side projects
Gpa: 3.93; MCAT 523
Extracurriculars: president/ vp of 2 volunteer groups, leadership position in 1 other finance related group
No big awards

I’m really new to reddit so sorry if my post doesn’t meet reddit etiquette and pls maybe don’t downvote me too much."
7tou2w,1,2018-01-28,M4A - On the Campaign Trail,FPThrowawayFP,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7tou2w/m4a_on_the_campaign_trail/,"Your rise to political stardom was, to say the least, unprecedented. Young and always hopeful, challenged a long-standing and popular incumbent in your party's primaries. You had a snowball's chance in hell, but you won the people's hearts through well-crafted and expertly-delivered speeches, smart ad campaigns, and maybe a few underhanded leaks here and there.

Who wouldn't want to work on a campaign like that? I knew I did - as a student looking to launch his own political career, interning at a campaign was already a no-brainer, but you were practically running in my backyard. I know these people, and I know how to win them over. I joined your campaign a few weeks before the primary, betting that you'd keep closing the gap in the polls. I gave suggestions that proved to push you over the edge. Now, we were in for a long general election campaign.

I didn't mind, given the opportunity that you gave me. But it's been stressful, and your youth also meant that you didn't have a husband or wife by your side to help you through this like most candidates for public office. Dating during the campaign was, of course, not an option, even for your staff and interns. The schedule was just too hectic.

_________________________ 

I walk down the hall of the hotel, tablet in my hand. One of my supervisors had given me an update to report to you in the evening. Reaching your door, I adjust my tie and shirt. Every time we spoke, I made it a point to try to impress you as much as possible. With a gulp, I knock on your door."
7touyb,0,2018-01-28,Round 2,YungLass,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/7touyb/round_2/,"We started dating March 2016. It was my first real relationship, and I fell hard in love with him. We dealt with a lot of tricky situations, including distance. June 2017 things took a turn south. We both started having some intense mental health issues. Depression, anxiety, the works. I was leaving Minneapolis to spend a month in Chicago for an internship, so we decided it would be a good time to break up. It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever experienced. My mental health plummeted even more than before, and I reached my lowest low in a new city, surrounded by strangers. I never stopped loving him, but I tried really hard to move on. We talked a few times while I was gone, but he was still adamant about staying broken up. Upon my return, we talked about everything, and decided to keep the label off and just see what happens. We start by being just friends, but this eventually turned into reviving the relationship for the most part. We talked everyday, had sex, saw each other at least once a week, did activities together, etc. It felt like things were starting to go back to normal, that we were on our way to being good again. However, he sat me down tonight and told me that he needs to break it off again. He said he wanted this to work out so badly, that he doesn’t think he can do better than me, that he’s been trying to feel the way he used to feel about me again, but he just can’t. He doesn’t know why his mind won’t let him be in love with me, but he doesn’t want to keep dragging me along. I’m devastated, because I had no idea that the past 6 months had been so one-sided. His actions made it seem like he was getting better, but it had been basically just an act the whole time. He was just going through the motions in the hope that his feelings would come back. I don’t know what to do. I miss him so much already. He knows me better than anyone. I’ve never felt such a genuine connection with someone before. I can’t have him in my life as a friend because I care too much. But because of that, I don’t think I’ll ever see him again, and that breaks my fucking heart."
7tovnt,1,2018-01-28,Asking out the girl I dream of,DanielzeFourth,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7tovnt/asking_out_the_girl_i_dream_of/,"Me and this girl met at a rave, she approached me and asked for my number (fucking great how can you mess this up right). I texted her and asked her out on a date, she said she was too busy during the summer holiday because of her 6 days a week 9-5 internship, so we said we'd keep in touch for upcoming raves or festivals. ( all of this happened in August 2017)

After this time we kind of forgot about each other until late October when she sent a message via snapchat asking at what rave I was (Because I had posted a snap in my story) I told her the rave I was at and asked her if she's got any festivals/rave's planned to see if we were going to the same. Long story short we were both going to a huge festival on the 23d of December.

So it's the 23'd of December, time to rave and meet up with her 3 hours into the festival I text her asking where she's at, she texts the stage where she's dancing with her friends, I walk into the direction of her stage but before meeting up with her I wanted to pass by the bathroom to check how I look. She must think I'm attractive as she asked for my number but when I stop by the mirror I realized at that moment I looked like shit (I think i'm quite attractive but there at that moment I looked scruffy). Someone had spilled their dark drink over my white shirt, my hair looked messy as I should have gone to the hairdresser 2 weeks ago, my face had gotten a few pimples from eating chocolate during the holiday season and to top that all off I was on molly (she uses molly as well, it's just that I look like a psychopath when I'm on it)... combine all these things together and you get a fresh cup of rejection. Something I'm not really waiting for as her interests are exactly the same as mine and her appearance would be close to how I'd describe my dream girl... so I really don't want to mess this up. In the end I didn't meet up with her I didn't even give an excuse why I never showed up because I just blacked out and had no idea what to tell her.

Here are my options I've thought of so far:

1) Texting her ""I got an extra ticket for a rave, want to go with me"" after she says yes I buy 2 tickets for a certain rave

2) Wait until the day we happen to be both attending the same rave and meet up then and there (will most likely only happen in the summer of 2018)

Asking her out on a more personal date, like a dinner date is a no go in my eyes because it's been nearly half a year since we actually exchanged digits and we barley know each others names.....what would you do?

7toxye,9,2018-01-28,Which Offer To Accept (x-FI post),TitanUcheze,fatFIRE,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/comments/7toxye/which_offer_to_accept_xfi_post/,"I posted this originally on Financial Independence, but the more I lurk on this forum the more I realize that either through entrepreneurship or high salary and investing fatFIRE is the lifestyle for me. Hoping to gain insight from more experienced people who are where I want to be. 

Which Internship Should I Choose? 

I’m a Junior studying both Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science and have had 2 internships so far (first was Mechanical Engineering, second was in Controls/Automation Engineering). Here are my options for my third internship this upcoming summer/winter.

Internship 1: Working as a Software Support (IT/Deployment) for the largest public sector software company in the US. Pay is $20/hour ($30/hour overtime). Probably only ~40 hours a week, for 12 weeks, which comes out to about $10K pre-tax for the summer, but gives me 2 weeks to travel and enjoy summer break. About an hour drive from my house, I could probably negotiate a stipend or increased hourly rate to make up for travel costs. The upside here is I get some resume experience from a software development company. 

Internship 2: Working as a Controls Engineering intern where I did this past summer at a large pharmaceutical company, where I could negotiate a higher wage because I’m a year older and have more experience. They love me at this internship and want me to come back. It’s only about 20-25 minutes from my house, and while there’s no set amount an hour for next summer (I can negotiate what I want), last summer I made $17/hour but with as much overtime as I really care to have, usually about 10 hours of overtime pay a week, at $25.50/hour. I imagine I could ask for $21/hour this summer, with $31.50/hour overtime. From this job, I could work from the day I get out to the day I go back to school, for about 14 weeks at a gross pay of ~1.1K a week, or $16K. Downside is this wouldn’t boost my resume on the Computer Science side of things.

TLDR: Having had a Mechanical Engineering internship and one within Automation Engineering, both in a large pharmaceutical company, would it be wise for me to branch out (for longer commute and less money) into interning for a large Software Development company or wise for me to stay put and rake in more money (about 1.5x) at a job that will guarantee me full time after graduation but risk not having an internship to back up my Comp Sci second degree. 

What would you do?"

7tphci,20,2018-01-28,I hope this is a better week (cancer and car accidents),Emeroder,Nanny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/7tphci/i_hope_this_is_a_better_week_cancer_and_car/,"It's 28 days into 2018 and I'm already looking forward to 2019.

Friday January 5th my family found out my father had a type of leukemia- myeloma bone marrow type cancer. My family knew something was up on account of good enlarged spleen, weightloss, and anemia. We decided to just have a nice holiday together and take the diagnosis as it comes.  Obviously no one thought it could be cancer. We're all devastated, especially my mom  She won't talk prognosis just treatments and doctors appointments.   I'm still in shock so my emotions haven't caught up with me.  I'm also taking 8 antidepressant/anti psychotics/ mood symbolizers so I'm pretty mellow these days.  

My fiance's father was also very ill.  Last Friday, after a bout of untreatable fevers and generally feeling shitty, he was diagnosed with sepsis. His white blood cell count was scary low. We cared the worst. Turns out after being in remission from leukemia for 30 years, it's back.   My fiance left for TN (we're in NC) to go be with his dad.  He was so scared but i encouraged him to go and stay as long as hee needed to. It's all so crazy because the cancer is  suspected to be the same exact cancer as my father's. The eerie thing is my father had surgery in April 2017 and my FIL had surgery July 2017. It's just crazy. The biopsy comes back tomorrow. 

Last wednesday (the 24th) my fiance called me with the bad news around 11:50am. He cried and we were just beside ourselves.  I sadly had to hang up as I was about to be on my way to pick up the older girls from preschool. It wad 12:10pm and i was turning left at a 5 point intersection (known for being treacherous) I saw a guy coming and there was no one behind him so I thought ""great a nice big clearing"". I thought the guy was going faster than he was and I smashed into him.  Did i mention i had the 18mof in the back seat?  Yep.  She cried for about 8 seconds before continuing to play with her toys.  Kids.  I, of course, call MB and through tears apologized and begged her not to fire me. I mean i was hysterical.  I hate that i was but after everything going on I've given myself a pass.  MB was amazing. She wasn't mad, baby was tightly strapped in with her buckles up to her pits and she was perfectly a-okay.  I was totally alone. I couldn't call my parents because 1. They were at the oncologist 2. They don't need this right now and 3. I'm 28 and  can handle this on my own. I still haven't told them. The tow truck came, I didn't get a ticket (Brightside), and beside a busted lip,  cracked nose and bruises I'm fine.  MB2 took me home. I got home around 2pm. I called AAA and my insurance. There was nothing left for me to do. I just laid on the living room floor. Thankfully my fiance cut his trip short and came home the next day. I'm so thankful for that and we have a good plan financially. 

 My fiance is carpooling to work and letting me use his car. DB and MB2 installed the 3 carseats. So far it's been life as usual.  I'm doing my best to not inconvenience them still workingthe 40+ hours, still going to school, and doing internships on the weekends. I should be getting a report on my car tomorrow.  Looking at Carmax and Auction Direct, just incase.

I'm glad you all are here.  If you read all that i hope you have a good,  safe week. 

Tl;dr
My father and FIL have cancer.  Got in a car wreck with 18mof. Life sucks right now"
7tplqo,8,2018-01-28,I just watched my mom cry her eyes out after watching The Pursuit Of Happiness. And I think it's mostly because it's almost exactly what she went through at some point,momoneymomorrison,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/7tplqo/i_just_watched_my_mom_cry_her_eyes_out_after/,"So if you've never seen the movie, it's basically about this guy called Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) who's a single father (his son played by Jaden Smith before he became weird) that's struggling with no money to his name just trying to scrape by. He eventually lands an internship as a stock broker (unpaid of course) and in the meantime he's trying to sell these things called bone density scanners just to pay to live at a crappy motel for the night with his infant son. And he even experiences homelessness as he sleeps in a subway bathroom and gets his money taken by the IRS. But in the end, he gets the job as a broker and finally starts living comfortably and is finally happy.

Now my mom never became a million dollar stock broker or anything like that lol. But she's been where Chris was at: living alone with her only child (that would be my older brother) struggling to make ends meet. I have yet to meet his dad so I'm guessing he left as soon as he found out she was pregnant. She was in fact homeless and lived day-to-day in a homeless shelter. Sometimes she'd get lucky and get a room. Other times...it was either spending the night on a bench at the nearby park or at a shady bus station. All with her baby boy the whole time. But don't worry, things eventually got better. 

After she found a job at a restaurant waiting tables, and one of her co-workers let her stay with her, she saved up enough and went to night classes to learn the computers and Microsoft Office and all that. After she was done with that, she got two jobs: a job at a contracting company where she's been ever since and another working at the local transit authority. She finally got her first apartment as well shortly after.

Let me tell you, my mom is a hard woman. She doesn't take shit, especially from us. And I understand why. Btw I finally came into the picture six years later as my mom finally found someone who stuck around this time and was actually going to be there for her. She's been happy most of her life ever since.

I'm sorry for the rant but I just love that movie and loved watching it with my mom for the first time "
7tqcq1,22,2018-01-29,"Why has it always been ok to hit me, talk shit about me, make fun of me, and to hurt me? Then I'm the problem if I address it or stand up for myself. Every.single.time. (Long)(TW physical abuse discussed)",kassiekatt,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7tqcq1/why_has_it_always_been_ok_to_hit_me_talk_shit/,"I posted in here and another sub around Christmas how my possible Ngrandmother and Aunt assaulted me at Christmas because I wouldn't let Ngrandmother walk all over me and subsequently physically abuse me. How dare I, I know.

I also posted asking about what to do if my mom rugswept this as I had a sinking feeling. I was told that telling her who she could and couldn't talk to was controlling and just doing what she used to do to me. However, I can make my own choices on how I react to her and what she does. Like I said there is a post somewhere in another sub about it and I even showed it to her. Even then she seemed worried about not talking to them. Less worried about stating what they did was wrong but hey...can't control that.

I have been NC with them since that. Aunt's NC happened a few days later. I think my mom may be lying that Aunt apologized for hitting me before she left, but either way that's what was told to me that happened. Then I notice she has me removed from her social media and she brags about doing that to people to hurt(?) them? Either way, she does it with the intent to piss you off and hurt you. The woman who used me as her free therapist for her bitch of a mother and used me as an emotional dumping ground and emotional support dog all in one. 

Heh, my mother tbh does the same thing. If I confide in her, seek support, try to address her abuse in the past or whatever she takes it as a chance to eventually turn the subject to her and her issues. Be it bitching about her marriage or asking for advice for what doctors to go to for her abuse from my dad and her parents.

I don't think she will tell about what she did to me. She claims to not remember due to her chronic illness or medicine but she seems to remember it just fine to laugh at me about how she just to beat me. According to her though, those are fights and I deserved it because I was just sooo manipulative and difficult. Oh, and don't forget clingy because asking for affection as a child makes on clingy. I mentioned that my daughter is very similar to me and I don't think she is clingy at all and I love to hug her and love it, even more, when she asks for it. My mom looks at me and scrunches up her face ""well, yeah, but you were different and just wanted hugs aaaaall the time."" Mind you she left 6am home at 6/7pm and literally locked herself in her room until 9 or so. She was also gone on the weekends because she left us with her drunk friends daughter who was only a year or so older for weekends at a time with zero way to contact her. That was preferred to the strangers that always screamed at us and never fed us that were hours away, she never explained why or who they are and plays like she can't remember. We never ate at any of the places she left us because they didn't have food for their own kids or they just didn't want to. I was often defending my little brother from a young age and then at 11yo I took over childcare in that aspect. Also did a lot of housework too and rarely went anywhere. But she got us braces and did fun things with us sometimes. 

That's what sucks. I feel like I'm so ungrateful and such a bitch for not appreciating all the good things she's done for or with me but it doesn't make what she did go away and she did a fucking lot. And on at least five occasions between two partners has mentioned these abusive stories and laughs and laughs about them, always to my SO. Otherwise, it is, I caaaaan't remember!

Then I remind her of one situation I remember vividly and she fucking tries to change the end, or ""I didn't mean to hit you with it, I just meant to throw it."" Fuck off.

But I'm so enmeshed and she acts like she is trying to get help but change but it's all bullshit and has zero to do with helping me or being accountable for what she did and does. It's about her getting disability and fighting with her husband. The list of symptoms she said that she was given reads cluster B, and she argued with me about it and oh no it's my chronic pain disease. Um, that doesn't have anti-social behavior, rage, fighting people. not able to function with people or focus on work and she pitches full on stomping, cussing, and sulking fits at work like she would do with us at home. And is offended that they acted like she would blow up on them when she was let go because noooo idea why they'd do that.  Her last physicaly fight was a few months ago because a woman paused while crossing the street during a festival to look at her phone and called my mom ugly when my mom started to scream and talk shit cussing at her.

I told her not even a month ago I am struggling with this whole ""thing."" She said something about ""yeah, I feel bad enough about the past as it is."" Ok, glad you feel bad but for what because though you try apologizing to me too with a basic sorry you say you don't remember what you did which I find highly fucking doubtful.

The only reason we talk is because I broke NC when I was pregnant, she kicked me out because I didn't want to play her and her husband's control games nor have a car that was supposed to be mine held over my head. It was a birthday gift at 16 but stepdad drove it until I was 18 six days a week. Mom just chuckles about it like yeah he's such a controlling asshole what can you or I do? Hahaha. Back then after 18 they would call me and threaten to call the cops to report it stolen if I didn't jump and ask how high. Even being 5minutes late was ""planned and willful disrespect.""

I stay somewhere kinda awful because when I separated from my abusive estranged husband I couldn't stay there and get on my feet because stepdad just wanted to chill at they house playing world of tanks and don't you know I cost this in ...he had ever bill figured to the penny but would tell me to quit my ""bullshit"" job. He would threaten to try and get my mom fired and once threatened to call cps on me because he was pissy I wasn't being controlled just right. That was when we left and he's not ever done it again because I dared him and told him he'd end up in jail one way or another.

She bitches about him but oh she does assure me that my skills that I'm using and talking about in therapy (trying to break through to her what I need to get through this because I'm already NC with my perv dad and his enabling family. I don't have many people left and it's so fucked up. I just want her to be sorry and mean it and go to therapy and not hurt me anymore. Seems though instead of hitting me it's a dingy unintentional kind of emotional thing. Her mom does it and I've even said this to my mom before. It's her meds and her being sick! Not her making shitty selfish ass choices and rugsweeping and making excuses for her abusive, controlling, stupid ass pos husband.

Deep breath...sorry I ranted. Tbh I made myself cry too. I'm so made at them all and I'm hurt and betrayed. They spent my whole life trying to convince me I was stupid (dingy is nicer and funny tho! but stupid is used too) cray, a bitch, sensitive, irrational, going too far setting boundaries, and overall trying to get me to shut the fuck up.

I thought my mom was on my side. When they attacked me I thought she finally got it and saw it. I was will to use her past as an excuse and forgive her. Though I don't abuse my child and had it just as bad. I'm tired of asking her ""well, ok if it were my dd, her granddaughter would that be ok to say or do?"" It's not my fucking job and she should fucking know better and it's to the fucking point I am repeating myself and she's doing the same shit. It's all about her now and her not having a job and going on disability. 

Guess who else doesn't work? I'm in school full time and at the end of it aka I get to do internships and work for free basically.

But now it's all turned to be all about her and ""just stay strong you can do this just focus on school generic generic generic bs. btw..."" and then goes on with her own problems. Usually about stepdad or money. It's been all about money forever. I may post about how I had to sign up for loans back when I was 18 for school that she hounded me to pay but there was a divorce agreement that each of my parents would pay half that my dad showed me. So do with that info what you will.

Anyway we were having dinner out and I complimenter her shirt. She said it was new and she got it from Aunt's town. Previously she had mentioned that she's text my aunt too but tried to play it off like it was just to tell her that NGrandmother has text now. Which I'm sure happened because that narc woman can't do shit for herself ever but I don't think that was all. I think she is playing both sides and listening to them bitch about me and listening to me trying to process and deal with all of it too while sitting pretty in the middle and nodding along to both.

I know I can't control who she talks to, what she does, or who she has a relationship with. I don't want to. The fact though she's doing this and it's no big deal that they hit me and one tried to hit me with skillet is sending me another message about her. I told her this yesterday with no response from her. I also told her she can do what she wants but don't expect that her tears or begging will have me around them ever again and that means holidays too because NC means NC. Also no reply.

She also acts like she doesn't like them and that hanging out with them is a chore now that she avoids and I know it's a lie. There was this whole thing a year ago where I had to tell my mom three fucking times not to send my bedroom furniture an hour away to my aunt and ngrandmother's house for their guest room. Idc how nice it would look and idc how much you wanna impress them give them your spare set. Get to aunt's and aunt is all ""it's ok you can keep your furniture your mom said you changed your mind, I have an air mattress."" Smh. No, mom said she was giving you the set she had in storage so take it up with her. This has a point promise.

So a year or so later at this dinner mom starts going on about the furniture and sending it down to them. Remember she doens't like them, they are abusive, they are this that and the other around me. I ask her why are you still hanging out with them, going to church, lunch, shopping, and giving them stuff after what they did to not only me but you too?

She does this when it comes to my stepdad too and thinks she is so clever and makes me think that calling me ""manipulative"" from birth to 18 was projection too. She smirks and says well it's more like free storage for me. Ooooh teach them a lesson and we have a storage unit so she doesn't need them to be free storage. It's bullshit. 

Like I said she's basically playing both sides and if she's talking shit about them to me I can guarantee that she's doing the same with her sister and her mother. She will fall over herself for her mom's approval, they both will because she was absent and neglectful when she wasn't there hitting them and being verbally abusive. I just know how it is when they get together because I used to be there and heard it about every other family member.

It was suggested I can only control my own life and my own reactions. True and fine. I feel hurt and yet again unsupported. Then at the same time, I need to keep a hold of that anger I have for what she did to work through this and bring it to light. I'm still too afraid of hurting her feelings vs processing and stuff.

I also feel manipulated. Like, on Christmas day as she was holding me and rocking me on the floor after my Aunt hit me I thought ahead to right now and for some reason knew that this is where I would be still.

I feel abandoned, worthless, hurt, bitchy, petty, guilty of course, ungrateful, horrible, and everything else. Again.

I tried to convince myself my mom is like me but just a little more damaged and that we were in this together to figure it out until we each got out own therapists and stuff. That she was going to try and. Idk.

I've also heard the Ollie Matthews video about the price of forgiveness being too high. I tried to get her to listen to him to help her and help her maybe see where I'm coming from on shit she did, but no.

Again, I'm just free therapy and an emotional dumping ground. The odd one out. The crazy one.

Why have they always hated me? Why has it always been ok to hit and scream at me? Why is it ok still? Why do I not matter to them? Why does she supposedly treat my daughter better?

Example on the last is I was always told that she didn't like me but she loved me. I've had to explain to her twice to stop saying this because she still will with stepdad. Oh, I would tell your dd I don't like her actions... sigh. I guess it's because I'm always going to be second class. Idk it would almost be better if she were honest about it and didn't try to lie about being around them to me. I feel played. Seriously, if it wasn't some big lie and bs game that she dances around the truth I'd feel less; well, unsupported. Like if she grey rocked them about me and whatever I wouldn't be posting. It's just not going that way though.

Also, had this been my brother and mother hitting my daughter. I would at least me fucking mad and want apologies. Nope not even that though. Make excuses for them, rugsweep it, and talk about how wrong I was to say that to Ngrandmother and I""m just sooo crazy.

During my thinking I also realized Aunt knew about my abuse from my mouth and my mom's and still never had her stop or protected me nor called for help. I am furious with them all and it starts from so far back.

I'm not sure how to handle it.

Thanks for anyone who read through that hell of a rant and thanks for any support or advice."
7trgkc,2,2018-01-29,I [23F] need help talking about my mental health issues with my co-workers and boss. [30s],damegrizzly,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7trgkc/i_23f_need_help_talking_about_my_mental_health/,"I've been dealing with depression for all my life basically but the anxiety is a rather new flavor to my life. Despite being a great student before, now I can't seem to finish my degree because of all that. (I've been to a therapist, didn't help much, on my way to find a new one)

A couple years ago, I did an internship at this agency and I really liked it. They contacted me in autumn to ask me to work for them so I said yes. I was really nervous because it was my first job and I feel like I'm not good enough. They asked me why I wasn't graduated still and I said I had some health issues and that was why I couldn't pass my exams. I quite liked this way of explaining it and at the end of the day it's true. I think they got what I was trying to say but I'm not sure. But they're the kind of people who think that anxiety is just stress and depression can go away with thinking positively and whatnot.

I had to take the month off to pass some exams but I just completely panicked like always. I didn't even take those exams. I know they would've been happy to help me but I just couldn't bring myself to ask for help. (This is another issue of mine) Now, I have to tell what happened and I really can't think of a appropriate way to do it. If I go all emotional and dramatic I feel they will just see that and think less of me. If I try to be positive or neutral, they might just think I don't care. I'm lost here.

Thank you for your insight.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm a student but I work part time at a great agency. I didn't work this month to pass some exams but I just freaked out and failed. I don't know how to explain the situation without being too emotional/talking too much about myself/giving the impression that I just don't care. "
7trjyp,9,2018-01-29,When I (f) meet guys at work or university I usually keep my relationship hidden as I feel they change their behaviour if they know that I have a bf.,CompanionCubeCutie,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7trjyp/when_i_f_meet_guys_at_work_or_university_i/,"[Conflicted]
I have changed my workplace quite a lot recently, due to internships I'm doing. As I'm in IT, I usually work with males, many of them are my age or slightly above. I usually avoid talking about my boyfriend and sometimes I'd even lie about the time I spent with him. It's not that I don't love him or that he's embarassing me (I'm deeply in love and we'll be moving in together soon, after 1.5 years of long distance relationship), but I feel as if my colleagues act different as soon as they know that I have a bf. Usually they are pretty nice with me and make me feel special, but I have learned that this sometimes changes as soon as they realize I'm in a happy relationship.

I'm trying to change my behaviour, but it's really hard as I like the attention I'm getting - on the other hand I'm normally a really honest person who hates lying. 
It's not a huge confession, but I wanted to get it off my chest anyways.


Edit:
My bf knows about it and doesn't care, as I only act like that with people I barely know (e.g. colleagues who I'll be working with for like 2 months max). He knows my family and my friends and they know about him.

Also I didn't actually lie about having a bf, I just said I'd be moving in with a friend, even though I should have said that it's my bf. I just didn't want them to ignore me or to act weird. Yes, it was wrong. That's why I posted it here."

7trqd4,2,2018-01-29,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,weakthrow,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7trqd4/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you.

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

7ts9hn,18,2018-01-29,Artist Spotlight: My Chemical Romance,ThumbForke,ListeningHeads,https://www.reddit.com/r/ListeningHeads/comments/7ts9hn/artist_spotlight_my_chemical_romance/,"Welcome to Artist Spotlight, where members of the sub can draw attention to some of their favourite bands, or maybe help guide you through a more daunting discography! This week, u/harmonyunoxx will be talking about **My Chemical Romance**.

*****

#####The origins (2001-2002) 

My Chemical Romance have a humble beginning. Lead frontman Gerard Way never set out to be the lead person of a band, but that was before 9/11 happened. Before 9/11 happened Gerard Way graduated from school of visual arts in 1999 with a degree in cartooning and illustrations. In September of 2001 he was a D.C. Comics intern in New York City trying to get into the comic book industry, but after 9/11 happened he decided to give this band thing a shot with his brother Mikey Way on bass, Ray Toro on lead guitar, and Frank Iero on rhythm guitar. The band name was taken from a book by Irvine Welsh called Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance that Mikey saw one day at his job at a book store. Once they had a band name and musical influences from bands such as Iron Madian, Black Flag, The Smiths, and The Cure, the band formed in the fall of 2001 and were able to get a record deal from New Jersey called Eye Ball Records. 

#####I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love (2002-2003) 

Bullets is the foundation of what makes a My Chemical Romance album. It has a loose concept about a Bonnie Clyde cast of characters who end up being gunned down in a desert. This album also highlights Way’s interest in vampires with song titles like Vampires Will Never Hurt You. With Early Sunsets Over Monroeville Way was inspired by the movie Dawn Of The Living Dead. Most songs on this album are fan favorites. Though it’s not a big album like The Black Parade you can see with this album what a great My Chemical Romance album could sound like. 

#####Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge (2004-2006) 

Three Cheers is what made My Chemical Romance, My Chemical Romance. It's what launched them into stardom in 2004 and made them the band they are remembered for today. Inspired by the band members love of horror movies and punk rock this was truly the start of the band's signature sound of loud guitars and angsty lyrics hidden behind those guitars. It's the first concept album the band tried to make. It follows the storyline of ""a man, a woman, and the corpses of 1000 evil men"". Gerard Way said that the story is about ""a man and a woman who are separated by death in a gunfight and he goes to hell only to realize by the devil telling him that she’s still alive. The devil says he can be with her again if he brings the devil the souls of a thousand evil men and the man agrees to do it, and so the devil hands him a gun. "" but the story really ended up being about loss and life after Gerard and Mikey loss their grandmother while recording the album. The loss of their grandmother changed the direction of the album and inspired the first track of and single off the album called ""Helena "". Three Cheers set the blueprint of a My Chemical Romance concept album that we will see in their next two albums after Three Cheers, but for many fans (like myself) see Three Cheers as their best album and thought it would be hard for them to make a follow up that would be better than this album. 

#####The Black Parade (2006-2008)

If Three Cheers is the band's 70s punk rock classic than The Black Parade is their late 60s early 70s classic rock album. The band was heavily inspired by The Beatles’s Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club, Queen’s A Night at the Opera, and David Bowie's The Raise and Fall Of Ziggy Stardust, which was the inspiration behind the album’s original name ""The Rise and Fall of My Chemical Romance "".  The album was  recorded at a haunted studio called The Paramour Mansion. This would inspire their songs “Sleep” and “Disenchanted”. The main storyline was inspired by Way's frustration with the modern pop punk's scene lack of original storytelling in their songs. The story follows a character named “The Patient”. The Patient dies due to their battle with cancer at the start of the album and when he dies death comes to him by a Parade he went to with his father when he was young. This was inspired by Way’s view on death as he thinks when people die we will see our fondest memory. We see this storyline happen in the bands most known song “Welcome To The Black Parade”. “Welcome To The Black Parade” pre-dates the album by a few years and was original called The Five Of Us Are Dying, which was a song idea that was brought about by rhythm guitarist Frank Iero. Many claim the song to be this generation’s answer to Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody”. This is the album the band is known for by diehard fans, casual listers, and critics. This is the album sees the band at their creative peak and it made then take a few more years than usual to make their final album, Danger Days. 

#####Danger Days: the true lives of the fabulous killjoys (2010-2011) 

Danger Days is the band’s final act before their 2013 break up. For Danger Days the band were once again inspired by their punk rock roots and in particular protopunk acts such as The Stooges, MC5, and The Damed. This album was probably the album that was the most inspired by Way’s love of David Bowie. Danger Days was a hard album to make for the band. When they first started recording they had 36 songs, but weren’t happy with any of them so they scrapped what they had and started again from scratch which lead them to writing the first single off the album Na Na Na. After writing Na Na Na recording the album became more and more easy for them. The final song that they recorded is the song The Kids From Yesterday and as a band it’s their favorite song that they made for the album. Danger Days sees the band using different kinds of tools to make their sound different from previous albums. Tools such as synthesizers, drum loops, and sampling from other songs made their first and last appearance on a My Chemical Romance record. Like their previous albums Danger Days is a concept album, but also a comic book mini series written by Way and former keyboardist for Pencey Prep Shaun Simon. The storyline for Danger Days sees the band member’s alter egos in a desert dystopian version of California in the year 2019. Their alter egos call themselves the Killjoys and they are battling the corporation Better Living Industries that is set to control everyone’s lives. At first fans didn’t appreciate the album as much as The Black Parade as they thought it was too different from The Black Parade and thought it strayed too much from the sound of their previous albums that the fans loved, but 8 years on the fans seem to appreciate the album for what is is and think that it’s a final message from the band that they can live with. 

#####The Paper Kingdom: The album that never was
 
Before the band announced their break up in 2013 Gerard Way said in an [interview](https://youtu.be/5U9YnIUt-Q4)that they were in the studio for as they called it at the time “MCR5”. In an another [interview](https://youtu.be/CNjyx15MniA) that Way did shortly after the break up Way said that the album would have been called The Paper Kingdom and the concept was about parents in a support group that had kids that died from various tragic deaths. The band decided that the concept was way too dark for them and decided it would be best for them to break up and not go on with recording the album. Many fans believe that [Piano Jam](https://youtu.be/1mF4KfeDIjo), a song that Way has preformed a few times during his solo career was written for the album. 

#####Conventional weapons and break up (2012-2013) 

Instead of recording their fifth album, the band decided to release a series of singles under the name Conventional Weapons from October 30th 2012 to February 5th 2013. The songs were recorded before they recorded their final album Danger Days. The songs were released two at a time onto iTunes which ended up being 10 songs total. The band announced their break up on March 22 2013 and a few days letter Gerard Way posted a goodbye letter on his twitter account. By the end of the band Way had relapsed into alcoholism and his brother Mikey was dealing with his own depression and addictions and the members decided it was best for them to break up if the band would be a negative effect for them instead of a positive one. In 2014 they released their final song Fake Your Death and released a greatest hits album called May Death Never Stop You that also had unreleased demos from their early years. 



#####Recommended listening 

Here I’m going to recommend what I think are the three best songs from each studio album as well as other songs that they released that aren’t seen on any of their four albums. I’m also going to include demos and covers that I think are a nice addition to their discography.

7ttoqq,143,2018-01-29,My [26F] boyfriend [26F] wants his stoner brother [23M] to move in with us rent free -- how can I assert myself respectfully?,EngineerGal,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7ttoqq/my_26f_boyfriend_26f_wants_his_stoner_brother_23m/,"My boyfriend and I have been together for four years. We have a great companionship and he is very supportive of everything I do. I thought we were going to get engaged this year but the past year was rocky for us so I am hesitant now.

Recently, he brought up the idea of letting his brother live rent free in the 2 bedroom 1 bath condo we bought 50/50 while he ""gets his feet off the ground"" simply because he wants his brother to move to the same city as us. The brother is not needy. He lives with his upper middle class parents now while he finishes college and is historically lazy and unmotivated. Additionally he smokes weed and drinks which is not something I want in my home.


I told my bf I do not want to live with his brother. He said ""ok"". I went on to ask why he wants his brother to move here without a job, and why he thinks his brother would be motivated to get a job if his we are paying his rent. He got offended, told me it was none of my business. He later told me that he dosen't like the way I talked about us ""paying his brothers rent"" because ""thats my brother, he's family"". 


I strongly believe that you should help family out when they need it. But I also feel that it is ridiculous to invite the brother to live with us in an expensive city with no job prospects. My bf dosent seem to understand this and thinks I am being insensitive or disrespectful. How can I assert myself respectfully? Or perhaps I have done enough communication and damage.


Some history that makes me certain I do not want to be walked over again:


Last summer, my bf invited his friend Jeff to live with us rent free because of unique financial circumstances -- Jeff was paying his way through school and finally had an internship. I told him this was **not** what I wanted but would agree if it was very important to him. Jeff ended up living with us for three months.


We had a two bedroom two bathroom apartment which we split the rent about 60/40 with my bf paying more (because he insisted on a fancier place that was out of my budget). 


Living with smelly Jeff last summer was not fun for me. I was sad that I didn't have our guest room for when my family visited. I was uncomfortable being alone in our apartment with Jeff while my bf was out of town. Especially because Jeff drinks and does drugs, which is very inconsistent with my lifestyle.  Overall I regret agreeing to have him -- my bf and I have ruminated over it in couples counseling multiple times :(


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend's brother is an almost college grad with very little direction. My bf wants him to move to our (expensive) city with no job and live in our 50/50 shared condo rent free. Having been down this road before while my bf's friend lived with us rent free, I don't want to do it again, but want to be respectful and assertive without ruffling too many feathers -- how can I express this and approach similar requests that infringe on my personal needs?"

I have a STEM background so it's going to be a steep learning curve. 

I just got diagnosed and was prescribed Vyvanse but since my daughter is still nursing I want to try and wean before I start taking my meds.

I reeeeeally don't want to blow this internship. If I do well, there will be an offer for a full time job. I could have a career and maybe finally some financial breathing room. 

Anyone out there do something like this unmedicated? Any tips on how to succeed?"
7tudbk,5,2018-01-29,Sophomore in college on an investment banking track looking to transition into sales,soulblade22,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/7tudbk/sophomore_in_college_on_an_investment_banking/,"Hey guys, I’m 19 and currently in my sophomore year of college in Pittsburgh majoring in Finance with a minor in Computer Science. Since the beginning of Freshman year I’ve been going through college as if investment banking was my direction out of college and have started a university fund, networked with other bankers, etc.. Since I have an interest in Finance and believe that it’s important to work extremely hard in your 20’s, investment banking just seemed like the best direction. Now I’m starting to think that sales may just be more optimal. If I look back to situations where I’ve performed at my best and enjoyed doing it they all have to do with overcoming a series of barriers or managing a team of people to maximize performance. I lead a sector in our university fund and really enjoy managing/motivating a team to outperform specific metrics. I have a passion for entrepreneurship which synergizes well with sales. If I were to go into IB it’s almost impossible to even pursue any personal projects for the first few years. This may be irrelevant, but both of my parents are in residential construction sales. I’ve always been self-motivated and enjoy finding solutions to problems to reach a goal.  It just seems as though I can leverage my natural abilities and skills much better in sales than a career in IB. 

A junior year summer internship is extremely important in IB, so, this summer it’s crucial I find something in sales to make sure that it’s a better fit for me. I figured an SDR position would be a great place to start if I could find somewhere that has an internship program. If I do decide to fully commit to sales after college I plan on preparing just as hard as I have with IB with as many public speaking classes, improv courses, books etc. as possible with the time I have left in college.

I’ll be living in Pittsburgh all summer which means there should be an opportunity to explore this field somewhere. We’ve had amazing growth in tech companies/startups in the past few years so I think this may be an option to pursue. My only concern with this is their training programs may be lacking. I plan on trying to get into a neighboring ivy league school’s job fair since they have companies like SalesForce tabling there. I figure breaking into another schools job fair will at least show some kind of determination and be memorable to the sales reps.

I am a junior software engineer and honestly feel like if DBG did freelance online internships to help with their code they might be able to get cheap labor from people like myself that are passionate about the game. The database is monumental yes, but I would love to get practice in handling and learning about a in production code base and working on fixing minor details that would help out senior or more experienced developers. 

Just food for thought but maybe do a vetting process and get in contact with junior devs that really love your game and your company. We want what's best for this game and alot of us already spend alot of time helping players and making materials to help players. It wouldn't be an issue to work on the database via reviewed commits to the code base.

Tldr- let junior devs and passionate programmers do volunteer work to help keep up with the current issues of the game through a carefully vetted internship program."
7tvlbs,1,2018-01-29,What Factors other than GPA/MCAT are optimal for MD/DO Applications?,harhar321,premed,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7tvlbs/what_factors_other_than_gpamcat_are_optimal_for/,"Hi all,

I'm a freshman in college that has just begun my journey through the long, devastating process.

I'm completely oblivious and possess no knowledge of what activities help students stand out towards medical schools. Moreover, I'm not sure exactly what other factors medical schools 'like' to see in their applicants other than GPA/MCAT scores.

I've stumbled across internet articles, posts, and forums where they lightly touch over clinical volunteering, shadowing, research, and what-not. However, their tips are all over the place.

Can ya'll provide me with more specific insight these optimal factors that MD/DO schools are looking for - along with how many hours total we should have in each of those things?

Currently, I am enrolled in a freshman research program at my University. Also, this summer I am trying to find some internship opportunities revolving around the public health sector (my college major) in Houston, Texas. I'm not even sure if interning would look as good as doing research over the summer. This summer, I am also trying to garner a few shadowing hours as well.

Any suggestions and tips will help me tremendously.

Thank you all!"

7tvyqd,80,2018-01-29,Whiny Hoarder and Third Wheeling: The Aftermath,sardonkey,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/7tvyqd/whiny_hoarder_and_third_wheeling_the_aftermath/,"Welp. I knew those couple days of silence was too good to be true. 

Yesterday, Whiny invited herself on my date with FH in order to remind me she controls FH, and can do what she pleases. Reminder, FH is disabled and I've been banned from WH's home, and FH will be moving 4 hours away from me by the 14th, and I simply cannot see him after that due to school, work, my internship, and budgeting. Our time together is *extremely* important to me. She knows this, she also knows we want to get married at some point. 

FH and I have agreed that whenever possible, we'd elope, then have our big 'real' wedding at a later time, so that in case of emergencies, I'd be in control of FH's medical decisions and anything else that could arise. Whiny, FAIL, FFIL, and none of my family know about this. FAIL is a shy, quiet FM who will tell Whiny whatever she knows so that FAIL can go back to pretending she doesn't know Whiny, FFIL is a twisted son of a bitch and will tell Whiny just because he knows it'll rile her up. My own family can't be trusted to behave like normal human beings, either. 

Anyways, no one knows, we don't even know when it'll happen, but because I have the worst luck, or maybe Whiny might actually have some brain cells, she figured it out. She started crying this morning before work because FH is a horrible son, who abuses her, makes her poor, caused her Bipolar Disorder, and wants to leave her for Sardooooooooonie. Because remember, she refuses to use my name. (I know she knows it, she used it when FH was in the hospital during the accident, fucking cunt.) 

Then she goes on to lay the guilt on thick, after all she's done for FH, she cosigned for his first brand new car, he put her through extreme anxiety when he went missing, (she didn't even know he was missing until **1-4*** days later.) She saw him in the hospital before Sardooooonie, which means she loves him more than me, (I got her the fucking ride *to* the hospital to see him, I came 4 hours after her.) She starts to tell him that he's just like FFIL, that FFIL didn't appreciate that Whiny nursed him to health after FFIL's tongue cancer diagnosis, (When they thought he had it in his cheek again, Whiny said he deserved it.) 

Then, Whiny hit him where she *knew* it would fucking destroy him. She brought up his deceased best friend. She told him that DBF would be ashamed of FH and the way he treated Whiny, and that DBF was a better son than FH would ever be. DBF hated Whiny, and DBF and FH were brothers, basically. The poor man hasn't even been gone for 5 months and Whiny is already using him against FH. 

At that point, FH called me crying while he stood outside Whiny's soda can waiting for FFIL to come pick him up to take him to FAIL's, which was surprisingly kind of FFIL, since FFIL has an extremely hands off approach when it comes to FH, and FFIL lives a city or two away. While he waited I could *hear* Whiny screaming that she'll sue me if he elopes with me, that even if we get married she'll make it that I won't be in charge of his affairs, that I ruined him, and that she was disgusted by me. She also started screaming that she would tell *** (someone FH is having legal troubles with) that FH was in town still, and where he would be moving because FH deserves whatever *** will do to him. 


Ugh. This whole episode lasted almost two hours. 

FH is safe, he's in the process of getting a restraining order on ***, who already was warned by police to not come near FAIL's, FFIL's, or Whiny's. I'm at home sick, I've forgotten what food tastes like, how to breathe, and what it's like to not have a headache. FH has already contacted his lawyer, and tried again at moving up his schedule but he was just told again that if they put him on the waitlist he'll lose his Feb, 13th appointment which he doesn't want to worry about right now. Today's been hard and it's barely 2 PM. 

**The amount of days they were missing have been fudged. All that matters is that Whiny didn't even realize FH was missing.**"
7tw3hz,1,2018-01-29,Korean Tourist Visa + Visa Run..?,Skylance123,korea,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/7tw3hz/korean_tourist_visa_visa_run/,"Hey everyone,

So long story short, I am a college student in the US and will be returning to Seoul for an internship from this upcoming June through until early December. I'm extremely excited to be able to return to Korea and to get some valuable work experience whilst back, but one thing I'm unsure of right now is the visa rules/policies. 

When I go to Korea for my internship, I will technically be in my fifth year of a five year Masters program at my home university. So I will still be a college student. Talking with one of my advisers earlier today, he told me that since I am technically still a student and not working full-time in Korea, I am not able to apply for a regular work visa and will instead have to apply for a tourist visa. It is my understanding that with a tourist visa, you need to do a ""visa run"" once you near the 90 day expiration date in order to refresh the 90 day period on it. My questions are:

1) Is this the only visa I can apply for in my situation? It's sounding like I will be very busy during my time in Korea with the internship and don't know if it will be in the cards to take a day or two out of the office to ""travel"" for the sake of renewing my visa.
2) If this is my only option, what is the most convenient country to visa run to? (e.g. my adviser told me a lot of previous students have traveled to Japan for a weekend and returned).

Any help/tips are greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
7tw4qu,25,2018-01-29,"I [22F] am worried that being too willing to compromise my goals/desires for my boyfriend [21M] now, will create a permanent change in the dynamic of our relationship, and lead to resentment down the line.",hcass-,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7tw4qu/i_22f_am_worried_that_being_too_willing_to/,"We have been dating for 16 months now. The first 12 months consisted of us living two hours apart, while we each attended separate universities. We saw each other often, and did not struggle with the distance as we were both very busy. Leading up to my graduation I often discussed my desire to move to an entirely new state/area of the country, an idea he was not keen on. 


One day he admitted that he, ""couldn't see our relationship working if we didn't live in the same city,"" and as we grew closer I became okay with the prospect of moving to his city while he finished his final semester of college. I figured I would live there until he graduated (December 2017), and realistically would probably stay there an additional 1-2 years as we both started our careers. At this point (September 2017) I was very in love with him and didn't see another option if I wanted our relationship to work.


So I moved to his city, and got a nice job and found a great living situation. The first two weeks were going better than I had expected, when suddenly he was offered a low-paying post-grad internship at a church in a city five hours away, that would keep him from having to work in a cubicle, while allowing him to pursue his love of music. I recognized that the opportunity was rare, and knew he was miserable in his internship for the state, so I was one of the only people in his life to encourage him to seriously consider the job.


It's now three months later, and I am living in the city I moved to for him (he didn't ask me to move with him initially because ""he knew it would be selfish""), and he is living five hours away. I am not upset at the situation for now, and think that in all honesty it is good for each of us for the time being, but I am growing increasingly anxious about our future. What was initially supposed to be a 1-year internship is now likely turning in a 2-year gig, with the possibility of it turning full-time. Since moving he has missed me much more than he had initially expected, and is suddenly saying that I should move to be with him (again) and we should get engaged this year and married next summer.


He is quite religious in comparison to me, and I think his motivation to get married is stemming more so from that, than it is from a place of logic, which makes me skeptical enough. The bigger problem I have with the situation however, is that the city he is now wanting me to move to, is essentially the last place on earth I would ever want to live (it is a place disliked by most). I am now feeling frustrated, as it kind of feels like he guilted me into moving for him once, and is now trying to do the same to me again. 


As much as I hate where he has moved to and am finally getting happy where I am now, I would consider moving for him if it came down to it, but I'm worried that it would set the tone for the rest of our relationship. I don't want to be in an unequal partnership where I am expected to drop everything in the pursuit of his dreams, and I don't trust his promise that if I move for him now, he will let me choose the next city we go to (when I either begin law school or pursue a new job). Long story short I am just very afraid that if I am the one to continually make concessions for him now, it will never change, and will lead to me resenting him/our relationship. 


Am I freaking out for nothing? If not, how do I go about finding the right balance between caring about myself and my relationship? If anyone has ever chosen a relationship over personal goals or vice versa I'd love to hear your input, and how it turned out!

  **tl;dr**: Moved cities to be with bf after receiving an ultimatum from him, only to have him accept a job offer in a city 5 hours away within a couple of weeks. Now being asked (pressured) to move for him again, which could be very negative for my work/social life/overall happiness/etc. Afraid of giving up too much of myself for love and regretting it down the line."

Disclaimer: I already have a job, but I am looking for a different niche field. 

Aside from my current job, I get the boot after the fucking ""HR interview"" every single time. Apparently it's not enough that I get the go-ahead from the technical interview. A bimbo with a business degree from a mediocre college and zero experience in CS gets to give me the boot because she doesn't like the way I sound on the phone, and it happens almost every time.

7txwvx,2,2018-01-29,[M4A] I didn't expect to enjoy my sister's Sweet 16 this much!,ForPostingSmut,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7txwvx/m4a_i_didnt_expect_to_enjoy_my_sisters_sweet_16/,"Zach received an ominous text from his sister Jenna as soon as he switched his phone off of airplane mode as his flight pulled into the gate. ""Just a warning - things here are a little different now.""

He had been eagerly awaiting his return home for Thanksgiving break. It was his first time seeing his family since early summer. At 22 and a senior in college, he spent most of his time at his university focusing on classes and internships and preparing for his eventual graduation. He checked in with his family often and everything seemed to be normal, so he had no idea what Jenna could be talking about.

As he grabbed his bags and waited for his Lyft to arrive he arrive his thoughts jumped from one unpleasant thought to another. His mom and dad couldn't possibly be getting divorced. At times they seemed obnoxiously in love. His family's house is an old house with most of the door frames slightly out of wack so it's not unusual for a closed door to pop open. It's something the family has always been used to and since growing up, they were always taught to be open about their bodies and sexuality. It just wasn't a big deal to walk past the bathroom and see someone stepping out of the shower, dripping wet and naked. There were a few times, coming home late after being out with friends that Zach walked past his parents' room when they were clearly in the middle of making love. On time in particular he saw his mom riding his dad in reverse cowgirl and pulled the door closed to give them some privacy. He heard his dad call out ""Thanks!"" and his mom just winked as she bounced up and down. Since that's what he has always known, he didn't think it was weird and since there were nothing but signs of a happy marriage he was hoping his sister was alluding to something else.

Zach tried to push away his worries and regain his excitement for his visit back home. Jenna's birthday was a few weeks back, her Sweet 16 and he decided to just wait to give her her gifts when he got back for Thanksgiving. He picked out a hoodie for her in the college bookstore as well as a few giftcards and was looking forward to catching up with his little sister. Thanksgiving was always his favorite holiday, less hectic than Christmas was the focus just on being together, eating, watching some football, and enjoying each other's company.

Everything seemed normal as the driver dropped him off in his driveway. Both his parent's cars were in the driveway and it looked like Dad had already gotten started decorating for Christmas. All good signs. He opened the door and called out a greeting and heard his mom's cheerful voice reply, ""I'm in the kitchen honey. Welcome home!"" Zach dropped his bags in the hall and headed to the kitchen, but froze once he entered. His mom was busy, bowls and trays all around the counter - a sight he expected. What he didn't expect - his mother was clad only an apron. ""Oh Zach, I've missed you sweetie!"" She gave him a hug and kiss on the cheek as if everything was normal. Mom patted his arm affectionately and she seemed to be reading the confused look on his face. ""Jenna and your dad are upstairs and they want to see you as soon as you get home. Check her room first.""

Zach left and made his way upstairs, confused with his mom's attire, still worried about the text and concerned about the urgency with which he was sent to see his father and sister. His bewilderment grew when he heard his father say with a laugh, ""Don't tell your mom, but I think you might be able to take me deeper than her. That little mouth of yours...damn.""

He heard a muffled giggle from his sister and followed the sound of their voice to Jenna's room and saw his father and sister, both completely naked. His dad was sprawled out on his daughter's bed and there was Jenna, bare ass in the air as she slid her mouth up and down her father's cock. Zach's dad noticed the arrival of his son and propped himself up with a grin. ""Glad you're home son!""

""Since Jenna turned 16 we decided we should be even more open about sex and stuff you know? Your mom and I always taught you kids that sex was nothing to be ashamed of and should be shared with people you care about and totally consensual."" He gave Jenna an affectionate pat on the head, ""And is there anyone we care more about than family?"" Dad struggled to explain the recent changes in the family in between moans and sighs of pleasure.

Jenna pulled back, letting Dad's cock slip from her mouth. She wiped some spit from her lips and smiled. ""Zach, I thought it was a little weird at first too, but after I thought about it made total sense. We couldn't wait until you got home to tell you all about it. And show you too."" She stood and approached her brother, still standing in shock in the doorway, and wrapped her arms around him in a sensual kiss.

Thanks for making it this far! I wrote this up as third person, but could be done in first person if that's your preference. Open to replies at any point, for short- or long-term play. I just wanted to create a fun, incest-themed prompt that's dirty, yet sweet and playful as well. Open to adding other family members as well such as older siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles, maybe even grandparents.

Kinks are mostly vanilla - oral, cum, light spanking, dirty talk, and certainly open to others. I see this as being playful and fun with genuine affection between the characters. Not exactly freeuse but very sex-positive.

However, I know there's more prospect in better wages in finance when you look at how much you earn for the amount of work you do (versus accounting where I hear that ""earn peanuts"" for doing much more work). This will help me decide where to specialize in my business major and will also help me decide what type of certification will be better for me to work towards (i.e. CPA for accounting). I'm just been so stuck because in my past two internships at two banks, I've had coworkers tell me to go for finance and not accounting, but in all honesty, I don't think I'm a strong finance student or that finance interests me as much as accounting work does (as boring as some make it seem!)

It's good to know there many people out there who experience the same thing, which I had trouble finding a term or name to define my situation.

Anyway, I was born Filipino. My parents left the country to Malaysia when I was only about 3 or 4 years old. Dad found a job there and my mom decided to follow him after a few years since he left. Naturally, I had to follow as well out of necessity and not by choice. My parents couldn't live with the idea of leaving me behind under the care of relatives.

All my education, from kindergarten, all the way to college, was all in Malaysia. I have integrated so well with the local culture that many of my Malaysian friends, even strangers would say that if I never told them I was Filipino, they would never be able to tell. I could speak the national language so well as if it was my native tongue. Plus I'm fluent in several dialects which I conveniently switch between depending on where I am in the country. Malaysia being a multiracial country, I could also speak some Mandarin Chinese, which is way more difficult than the national language since it's very tonal heavy. But best of all, I still retained my ability to speak Tagalog fluently. I could speak all 4 languages -English included- without a hint of accent. 

For the last 25 years, Malaysia has been my ""home"". Yet the gravity of my situation never really kicked in until the recent 5 years or so. See, despite being Filipino, I realized that I could never truly relate with my home country. In fact, I could hardly feel it being home at all since I left at a very young age. I have very little sense of connection apart being able to speak Tagalog fluently, loving the food and seeing relatives whom I grew up with. It feels foreign to me that every time we visited once every so often, there comes a time when I just can't wait to get back to Malaysia. Also I have no interest in the country's politics, local issues, and so many things that my parents casually talk about. After all, I never received a single hint of education about my country apart from what I'm told, have read, and my own experiences. But ask me about Malaysia, yes I have tons to say.

Last year I just hit 30. Finding jobs abroad isn't as easy as everyone else thinks as there are immigration issues to deal with. The problem with immigration policies in any many places these days, is that it's not as convenient as it used to be back in the 90s or even pre-90s. Those were the golden days of moving abroad as long as you could afford it. My uncle left for Germany without a job and having little money back in the late 70s. He's now a citizen and married happily with his German wife. Yeah try doing that these days and see what happens to you at the embassy and immigration. Compounded by the slumping economy everywhere, employers aren't too keen to hire foreign professionals because of the hassle they have to deal with the ever tightening immigration policies. Not sure for other countries but in Malaysia, this is a problem faced by many expats here despite hordes of non-professional illegals getting their citizenships; let me emphasize on that, CITIZENSHIPS! not PR! Anyway I won't bother getting into the dark side of local bureaucracies. This story isn't about that.

I've only had 2 full time jobs so far. One during my internship after college, which I held on for 2 years, after which I decided to work online jobs as a freelancer, targeted at the US and Europe market, thanks to the dawning the Digital Age. I had to find alternatives if a local job was difficult to procure. As of today, I'm glad I walked that road because it paved the way for me to obtain a job in Tech industry in California, USA, which suffice to say pays really well especially knowing that I didn't have to be there and I could enjoy work as a Digital Nomad in this region, with freedom to do whatever I want and still earn a decent monthly income. Apart from that, I supplement my income as a Digital Artist having my own private online freelance business and passive income, mostly receiving clients from the US, EU and Australia.

I live with my parents. FYI, traditional Asian cultures do not ascribe to the American social construct of leaving the nest at a legal age. Living with one's grownups is perfectly fine as long as everyone shares the burden of the household. Plus with the ever inflating costs of living these days, many millennials, even those earning a decent income can't afford to move out. Not sure about situations in other regions in the world, but this is a thing in this part of Asia. 

Anyway, my father is the very reason why we could renew our yearly visas in this country for the last 25 years. My dad has a company as an architect here. Speaking of which, he's reaching retirement age within this decade and when that time comes, that privilege goes away for me, my brother, and my mom. One of the reasons why I have prepared and built a mobile income and lifestyle in case there comes a day I have to repatriate back to the Philippines, at least my livelihood remains uninterrupted. And I foresee myself living a nomadic life if I were to truly repatriate because I can't bear the idea of living in the provinces, which my mother looks forward to since she grew up there. Admittedly, I'm one of those people who can't bear to live without good internet and especially when my work demands it.

Thing is, my parents left the country during their 30s. I can truly understand their sentiment of wanting to return home. But they will never understand things from my perspective especially being someone uprooted at such a young age. It's another sub-layer of the expat life. I can't blame them though, and I understand my parents retaining their nationalistic pride while I don't.

Lots of my friends talk about settling down, many even getting married, but those aspirations aren't my priorities right now. The idea of settling down is a concept quite alien to me as I never truly had a sense of belonging since young. In fact, I'm still figuring that part out. The constant reminder by my parents as I was growing up, that I'm Filipino not a Malaysian, yet living the ways of a Malaysian, it's a constant battle between two worlds in my mind.

My life as a TCK has always been a flux. My life is neither here nor there. Outside of the confines of real world rules and legalities, my identity can't be summed up by what passport I hold, my address of residence, or my country of birth because... I don't know. I can't properly put it in words as it's quite abstract in my mind. All I can say is that the only identity I can truly ascribe to is being myself. I'm the result of my life in 2 places.

My Malaysian friends and acquaintances have acknowledged me as one of them in all aspects. They even told me to just stay put since I'm truly ""Malaysian at heart"". As comforting as it sounds, they will never understand that officially and legally, I'm still a foreigner. It's quite lonely sometimes, knowing that you're trapped in your mind with this reality and there's just hardly anybody who could truly level with you.

At my age, I've learned to be at peace with myself and whatever situations I face in life. The challenges I've faced being a TCK have made me stoic in many ways. I've always held Bruce Lee's mantra of becoming like the Water. Be formless and adapt to every situation you face in life. Water will always find its way around hindrances in its path. Scary as changes can be, I have accepted that this is the reality of being a TCK. I've dealt with uncertainty for as long as I can remember.

Being a TCK isn't as glamorous as many people think. Those romanticized articles about TCKs living a great life and being part of a unique culture of different blends is not the definitive reality for many TCKs. It's one tiny facet of being a TCK. But know there are many unspoken hardships that come with it, along with its perks of course.

I would say despite my worries and fears, I can take comfort in the fact that the future is not written in stone. I have no idea what the future holds for me and I don't think there's any point thinking too much about it. There's a lot of good things to look ahead in life. Being a TCK has taught me to never take anything for granted. I'll never know the day when this chapter may come to an end and step in to a new one. I admit it won't be easy. I won't sugarcoat that. And no one should.

I'm eager to hear from others who share similar experiences. Know that you're not alone. "

I'm applying for the Microsoft Explorer internship online. I'm in the process of finishing up my Resume and contacting the recruiter. I'm really looking forward to experiencing this opportunity! I have several questions for those who experienced this intern:

What are the questions that they will ask both the recruiters and Microsoft ? Any hard ones I should study for ? 

Do I need any experience with coding(I'm still learning) and mathematics?

How was the culture and learning experience?

We currently use React &amp; Redux for the frontend. The backend is developed using ASP.NET (due to company intern experience). I started with react-localize-redux, which I find is a nice tool and not too heavy. I also heard about i18n, but think that this is too complex for that specific use case. Do you agree with that or think that even for a smaller application, i18n is the choice (e.g. due to long-term support)?
In react-localize-redux, the translations are stored in a .json by default. Does anyone knows a tool which easily generates such a json-file? I mean that the translations can be done by a person without programming-experience.
Thanks in advance!"
7u0e6l,6,2018-01-30,Us &amp; Them,PkmnTrainerArtie,alasjuicy,https://www.reddit.com/r/alasjuicy/comments/7u0e6l/us_them/,"Chapter One: Fernando

I really wanted to know what my wife is up to lately. She has been acting strange and I have this gut feeling that she has been hiding something from me. It is the sort of feeling that squeezes your insides over and over again and will only stop until you get some answers. And one of these days I will find out what secret she hides. 


My wife and I had been married for a couple of years now, 6 years to be precise. We have two kids, a 5 year old boy and a 2 year old girl. We both are working in the medical field in the largest government hospital in our province. I serve as one of the psychiatrists in the psych ward of our hospital while my wife is a nurse at the ICU of the same hospital that we are working at. 


I met her during my internship as a resident at Region III Medical Center here in Angeles, Pampanga. She was then a newly-licensed nurse who started her work in the psych ward. She charmed me the first time I saw her. I was just biding my time with the rest of the nurses in the nurses’ station of the ward and her touch suddenly sent love jolts to my spine and thus bloomed our relationship which was so much exciting during our boyfriend-girlfriend years. 

I pursued her after the touch she gave me when I was spending time with the rest of the nurses chatting during our night shift. I couldn’t stop texting her the moment I got her number and I knew that she couldn’t stop texting me too since she would reply seconds after I had sent my message. We would sometimes sleep until the wee hours of the morning texting or calling each other talking about things. She was so addicting that I couldn’t get enough of her. 

Every after shift before I go to sleep I would imagine her long wavy hair that smelled like lavender and see her radiant, fair, and beautiful face in my mind. I didn’t know I was already in love and I didn’t know that she felt the same way too.

There was this one popular patient among the doctors and the nurses named Romeo that would sing the classic song “Love Me with All of Your Heart” by Engelbert Humperdinck every time there was a full moon. We played bets on the night where we predicted Romeo to sing his favorite song at 12 midnight. My bet was that he would sing on that night of the 3rd of October while she bet that he would sing on the 4th of October. The condition was if I win, she will get to have dinner in my studio-type apartment and have to spend the night with me and if she wins I will have to treat her and her fellow nurse friends at Starbucks after the end of our shift.

Fortunately, Romeo sang on the 3rd of October and I won the bet. I was going to spend dinner and the night with Ms. Jane Irene Holmes. She is a Filipino-American since her mother got married with one of the American Air Force officers at the Clark Air Base back then. 

Her friends were teasing her during the shift before our day off. Some of them were even telling her how lucky she was. Yeah well, probably because some of her colleagues were somehow eye-flirting with me. As a Psych resident doctor, I know if a girl is eye-flirting with me especially if she bats her eye at me like what her colleagues usually do. They really were not my type. It’s Jane whom I want since I am partial to women who have fair skin.

The bet was well known among the nurses and the residents during that shift. My fellow colleagues were even teasing me to do well during that night. They were even telling me to eat a lot of aphrodisiacs in order to improve my performance. I shushed them and explained that it was just dinner and a sleep over, nothing else. But of course, they wouldn’t believe me, especially of my reputation. 

To tell you the truth, yeah, I’m a little bit of a playboy. I have been hooking up with student nurses in the university where I studied medicine. They are so irresistible. I am so attracted to beautiful, fair-skinned young women with long black hair. It seems that my libido would always be on haywire whenever I glimpse at these kinds of nursing students. My friend knew me of this reputation. I must have had a bad reputation among the young women of the university I went to since I was just interested in 1-night or even 2-night stands. Sometimes some girls would even request for a booty call which I would willingly oblige. 

I texted her on the eve before our dinner and she told me to pick her up in their house in Balibago which was in a subdivision near Fields Avenue. I have already planned out how this dinner was going to be. And I hope that she would like it. 

The truth is, I’ve never done anything like this to a girl before. The past girls I’ve been with were just flings probably because of the surge of the hormones in a teenage body. But I know that this time would be different. Cooking is one of my hobbies to relieve stress from work and I have never cooked for a girl before. It would be a fancy and beautiful dinner that I will be preparing for her and I keep on wishing to myself that she would love it. 

The day came for her to finally spend the night with me. She told me to pick her up at around 7 pm at her place. I prepared myself by wearing the best clothes I’ve got and spraying one of my expensive perfumes. This is finally it. I have also prepared dinner and I wanted her to taste my all-time favorite dish which is Pork Binagoongan. I even bought red wine just in case she wants to drink. I knew then that that night will change everything.

So I came to the subdivision where she was living in my red Honda Accord which was a graduation gift to me by my father. When I came to the Kamagong Street where she texted me to go I saw her waiting by the front green gate of their house. She was there standing in her lavender dress looking gorgeous as ever. Her long hair was quite blown by the wind that even the skirt of her dress was swaying with the wind’s movement. I saw that her legs were as fair as her face. She was wearing high-heeled purple sandals and I observed that she had her toes done. I got down of the car and smiled at her. She smiled back at me with those red and glossy lips that I wanted to kiss at that very moment. I took her hand and led her to the passenger side of the car being the gentleman that I was. I opened the car door for her then she entered the car. I then went back to the driver’s seat and began to drive back to my apartment. 

I was silent at first because I was quite nervous about this whole thing. I could smell her sweet perfume diffusing inside the car. She smells like vanilla. Her perfume perhaps is vanilla scented. 

“I noticed that it’s quite windy today,” I stupidly blurted out talking about the weather.

“Well yeah,” she replied. “I couldn’t keep my hair down.”

“That’s what I’ve noticed. You look stunningly beautiful with that hair of yours.”

“You gotta be joking right? With all of these split-ends and all? You’re just hitting on me.”

“No I’m not. I’m just telling the truth. And who cares if you’ve got split-ends, haha, it’s not a big deal for us guys really. I find that odd about girls sometimes you know. They make small things about their body a big deal and guys don’t notice about those things, honestly.”

“Yeah but our friends do. I should have had my hair trimmed a few days back. I’m just so tired after work that all I want to do is to go home and sleep.”

“Aren’t we all?”

We spent the whole 20 minute ride discussing about work. We got stuck for a bit in a traffic jam but it wasn’t the worst of it. We finally reached the apartment I was renting and I parked the car in front of the gate of the building. I politely opened the door for her as she got out of the car. I led her to the apartment’s gate and I opened it for her with my key. I opened the door to the apartment and led her inside my apartment’s living room. 

I turned on the lights and offered her to sit on my couch and asked her, “Would you want to watch some movies or something?”

“It’s okay just turn the TV on. And wow you got a nice entertainment set. You’ve got all of these DVDs and gaming stuff.”

She touched my DVD collection and laughed at some of them since most of the movies I’ve got were geeky stuff and some where even animated features. She also went through my video gaming library. 

“Yeah that’s what I usually do during my days off from work. Work, play, eat, you know.”

“Are you sure you don’t bring your girlfriends here?”

“You are the first girl I’ve brought here since I just moved into this apartment a couple of months ago.”

“Really? Are you sure?”

“Hell I’m sure,” I said and shifted to offering dinner instead. “Are you hungry? Do you want some dinner?”

“Yeah, I’m quite hungry.”

“Well it’s perfect timing since I’ve cooked my favorite dish for you,” I told her proudly.

“I hope I won’t get my bowels loose because of your cooking.”

“Yeah right. Ha-ha-ha, very funny,” I sarcastically told her.

“I was just joking,” she told me. 

I took her hand and led her to my dining area which was composed only of a single wooden table with two wooden chairs. I pulled out the chair for her to sit on. I turned on some sweet and mellow music to set the mood then I set some plates, cutlery, rice, and the dish on the table together with wine glasses and a bottle of red wine. I took a seat and started staring at her face.

“I knew you were on to something,” she said.

“On to what?” I asked sheepishly.

“The wine? You’re planning to get me drunk, aren’t you?”

“No. It’s just wine. Who wouldn’t want a classic red wine? Are you not drinking then?”

“I do, but you know, I might get drunk, and you’d probably rape me.”

“Rape you?!” I exclaimed and laughed. “If I was planning to rape you, then I would have done it the moment you set foot into this apartment.”

“I’m just kidding. You’re so gullible. That’s why we love teasing you Dr. Fernando Montemayor Jr.,” she said placing a lot of emphasis on my name.

“Don’t call me doctor. Just call me Fern. My friends call me Fern.”

“So its Dr. Fern now is it. Fernando Montemayor Jr., it seems like a typical villain in a Filipino action movie.”

“I know. My friends keep on teasing me about that. Enough about my name. Let’s have dinner now.”

I let her have the food first and generously poured red wine into her wine glass.

“Hey slow down with the wine. You really are planning to get me drunk.”

“What if I do?” I teased and then she gave me sharp and teasing look. 

When she finally took a bite of the dish I was cooking I saw that savory reaction on her face. I knew that she was pleased with what I have cooked. It really is one of the best dishes I love cooking. 

We silently ate for a few minutes. We also took a sip of the wine. While eating we were giving each other stares. I’m not sure if the look I was giving her were looks of desire.

“Where did you buy this? I’ve never tasted Pork Binagoongan like this before.”

“Thank you for your compliment. And excuse me, I didn’t buy that dish, I cooked it myself.”

“Are you sure? Maybe you ordered this from one of the fancy restaurants from around here. A psychiatric doctor like you can cook? C’mon.”

“Seriously, I cooked this dish,” I told her seriously quite irritated at her skepticism.

“Okay, but are you sure you didn’t put any love potion in this?”

“Why would I even do that?” I told her then I stood up without realizing it.

“To take advantage of me,” she taunted then she stood up too. 

“Oh yeah?” Then I started moving towards her. “What if I really am planning of taking advantage of you?”

I gave her a hard and fiery look then I grabbed her longingly while my body was so fueled with libidinous excitement. I started ravaging her lips with my own and held her body with my hands. She was kissing me back like there was no tomorrow. I held the back of her head as I returned her kisses back. Her lips are so sweet. I could still taste the wine from her. Our tongues were dancing inside our mouths. 

I started kissing her face while she let out a silent moan. My lips moved to her left ear and then went down to her neck. I was now cupping her right breast with my hand and gently massaged it while kissing her neck with my wet lips. 

We started moving towards my room while we were still kissing. I pinned her back to the door of my bedroom and started kissing the top of her exposed chest then moved my lips to the center of her neck while she moaned. She was grasping my head while I kissed her neck and chest alternately.

I opened the door and we went inside the dark bedroom then turned on the air-conditioner. We didn’t even bother turning on the light. I kicked away my shoes and she pushed me on the bed. My back landed onto the soft feathered mattress and then she went on top of me. She was the one kissing me now. She started kissing on my lips, then my face, then my ears, then to my neck. It felt so good. I could feel her tongue tracing the bottom of my neck up to my right ear.

I started unzipping her dress. I gently tugged the dress away from her until she was only in her black and red underwear. She too removed my shirt and started kissing my chest. She sucked on both of my erect nipples and she did it so well that I let out a loud whimper. She started kissing my quite hairy abdomen while she was undoing the belt of my pants. She unbuttoned my pants and pulled the zipper down and tugged the pants together with my socks away from my legs leaving me with just my black boxer brief. 

She again kissed my chest then went down to my abdomen. She bided her time kissing my abdomen but she was now feeling the largeness of my now erect manhood with her right hand. She now went down to my boxer brief and started kissing my manhood which was just separated by the fabric of my underwear. 

I was breathing heavily in desire. My heart was wildly pounding inside my chest waiting for the next thing to happen. She now boldly let go of my cock from my boxers and saw its erectness. She then held it in her hands and started stroking it. She then fully removed my boxers and that was when she placed my pulsing manhood into her mouth.

Her mouth was hot and it felt so good to be inside. I moaned in utter ecstasy while I held her head as she was moving her way onto my cock. She was even playing the head of my manhood with her tongue and she amazingly did it so good. 

I knew it was my turn after she played with my cock in her mouth for a few minutes. I moved on top of her and I kissed her wet mouth again. I placed my hand behind her back and unhooked her bra. Upon removing it, her breasts were revealed to me. They were both so full and had pinkish nipples. I started devouring them with my lips and I licked and played both of her rosy nipples with my tongue. She let in a few gasps of delight while I was doing it. 

My lips then moved down to her soft abdomen and started kissing and licking her there. She held a handful of my hair in her hand until I reached her panty. Her womanhood from beneath it smelled so sweet. I lightly kissed her mound from beneath her panty. She pushed my head towards it and let out a moan.

Without hesitation, I removed her panty from her and saw her trimmed mound. It was pretty-looking and I love it. I kissed her first on each of her thighs.

“Please Doc… please,” she said. I already know what she wanted.

“I like the sound of that,” I told her with my deep resounding voice. “Just call me Doc this time.”

“Yes Doc yesss... Please do it now.”

From her thighs my lips went up to her womanhood. I started kissing her there with my lips and my tongue until she flowed with her witness from within. Her cunt felt good in my mouth. It was sweet and tangy. She gasped and moaned while I was continuously kissing her there. I placed my finger into her while I was licking her cunt. 

“Just like that doc… Ohhh… Just like that… It feels so good…”

She pushed my head further into her womanhood and let out a loud moan of ecstasy. She was fully wet now. Her cunt was drenched with both my saliva and her juices.

I moved on top of her to be horizontally parallel with each other. I looked into her eyes which were so much blazing with desire and I gave her that kind of stare too.

“What now?” she asked.

“I’m going to fuck you now,” I told her.

She held my manhood and guided it to her cunt. I pushed it in and we both gasped. It felt so good to be inside her. It was so warm inside her and my cock was already pulsing inside. I knew she was no longer a virgin but that really didn’t matter. I wanted make love to her tonight. That’s all I want.

I started to move on top of her. She joined me with my rhythm as I again was kissing her like a mad lover. Her hands were on my back holding me while I pumped in and out of her. We were both breathing so hard. She was moaning so loud now that I didn’t care if the neighbors can hear her which I probably think that they would. 

Afterwards, while our hips were still rocking at each other, I looked into her face. She was looking back at me and smiling and then let out another moan when I pounded on her so fast now. 

“That’s what I want,” she said. “Make love to me faster. Make it faster. Ooohhh I think I’m going to come. I’m right there… It’s almost there… Aahhh… Doc here I come!”

She rolled her eyes in delight when she came. Her body shivered in climax and I could feel her cunt throbbing onto my cock. I was not able to come yet so I rolled over and signaled her to be on top of me.

She sat on my manhood then started gyrating on top of me. Up and down she went while I clasped both of my hands onto her soft breasts. I sat up facing her while she was on top of me and sucked her nipples. My lips moved to her neck then back to her lips and our tongues were playing with each other inside our mouths while she continuously moved on top of me. I held her in my arms while she was fucking me. She wrapped her arms around me too while we were both moving our hips and kissing each other’s face. 

Up and down she went…

Up and down…

I can feel the pressure building inside of me. I knew that I was about to come. I can almost feel it.

“Jane…” I whispered. “I’m about to come.”

“Come inside me,” she said.

“Are you sure?”

“Just come inside me. I want to feel it inside me. Please come inside me. I am about to come too. Oooohhhh…”

Our hips incessantly rocked in a sensual rhythm. Back and forth… Up and down we went, until finally when I couldn’t take it any longer. My mind exploded together with my manhood in sheer ecstasy. We both moaned in climax. My seed was planted deep into her and I could feel it flowing out of her wet womanhood. 

She got off me and lay down beside me. I was so much satisfied with what we did. It was one of the best experiences I have had with a woman. The way she made love to me was one of a kind and she knew what she was doing. I know that this woman is a keeper. I told myself that night while she drifted off to sleep with one of her arms around my chest, I am going to marry her, before I closed my eyes to sleep.

7u15hc,27,2018-01-30,"Mom(56F) doesn't like my(21F) boyfriend(20M) because he has ""bad energy""",sadgirlpng,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/7u15hc/mom56f_doesnt_like_my21f_boyfriend20m_because_he/,"Hi, first time posting here sorry for my english it's not my first language. I need some advice.. And sorry for the long post, there is a TLDR.

Back story: First let me say that my bff is really sweet and awesome person. He makes me very happy, and he is really hardworking(goes to college and has a  good internship in a big bank), he is a  great guy and very handsome(tall, curly blond hair, green eyes, very athletic...). We love each other very much and everyday he tells me how happy he is with me and how beautiful I am and how lucky he is. We get along great and never had a fight.

In the other hand we have my mother, overall is a good mom, but can be really judgmental and have some issues regarding money and life expectations. She also believes in cosmic energy, spirits, tarot, etc(which is fine because I do too). I know it maybe sounds confusing but I'll be important.

Now the issue: I met my boyfriend on tinder over a year ago, we started dating but nothing too serious, after a few months I wated I relationship but he wasn't ready yet so I broke things off, It hurt me a great deal because I was really in love with him, but we stayed friends. That happened in October(2017) and we were November, December till mid January apart.. then we were at a party in the 13th of January we kiss and on the 14th he tells me he was really in love with me and no other girl would compare to me... The point is we started dating again this time in a serious relationship with telling each other's families and friends, the whole thing. (Just to be clear my mom don't know about all this, all she knows is that we were friends and than started dating this month)

His family absolute loves me, I get along great with them, I have been in their house several times and everything was fine. His friends like me, my friends like him etc etc..

And then there's my mom... The thing is I come from a relatively wealthy family, and my bff does not. I live in a rich neighborhood and he does not. Which is no big deal at all, we have no such problem between us and he works hard to improve himself financially so he is not ""after my money"" or some bs like that. That's important information because since my mother met him and I told her where he was from, she says she can't talk to him for long or spend time to actually know him because he has some ""bad energy"".

Last week I told her about our relationship and she flipped. She said that ""OMG, I cant belive you are with him, you know I don't like him.. Are you really serious about this?? OMG he is so ugly and hideous !! I won't intrude myself, but omg he has such bad energy and is no good, and did I already told you I think he is hideous ???"" and then started laughing like she was mocking me, and in the end she said ""I can't believe you chose him, he is POOR"".

I felt so bad about it, I couldn't stand up for myself because I felt so attacked, all I said was ""How can you say this without even know him?"" and she ""I can't know him he has such bad energy, I don't like to be around"". I immediately went to the bathroom so I could hold back my tears and then I talked to my boyfriend about this, and of course he got upset. He was always so nice and respectul with her, and he has done nothing but good to me. 

I want her to accept him like she did with my ex(he was very rich and she made him feel like part of the family), I don't know what to do since she seems so irreducible about her opinions. I'm so sad that she cares so much about this material things, and it's all about showing up to society etc etc..

Just to make clear I still live with her, I do go to college and work, but in my country we don't always leave home to go to school and I don't make enough money to provide for myself but I do contibute around the house and pay for my own things.

***TLDR: My mom doesn't like my bff because he comes from a ""poor"" family and uses the excuse that is about his ""energy"". I want her to accept him and stop talking bs about him and our relationship.

7u1adv,4,2018-01-30,Am I over exaggerating? Can someone help me please?,Zavquintan,abusiverelationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/7u1adv/am_i_over_exaggerating_can_someone_help_me_please/,"I’ve been contemplating on posting this and asking advice for awhile now.
My boyfriend (M/26) and I (F/21) have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We moved in together early a yet into the relationship and I’m not too sure why because all of this started even before that. Our relationship hasn’t been a good one since the beginning because I think it was based on lust.

Here are a few incidents I can remember:

-I do the dishes all the time, but when I want to relax and ask him to do it once he gets angry and calls me names under his breaths 

-he calls me garbage when I don’t do something. Like once I forgot to pick up my books and he started calling me garbage, worthless, a bitch, and so on.

-once I was crying about my uncle passing away and I snapped at him saying I just wanted to be alone, he then called me names again and pulled me up by my hair (this is the only time it’s happened)

-when I accidentally hurt him he says “this is what it felt like” and tries to do it to me. An example is yesterday when he was on top of me I kept telling him to get off but i pushed his arm in an awkward way and he did it back to me.

-I’m afraid to talk to him about things because he’ll get mad and yell at me

-I take him to work every morning and even though I’m reminding him we need to be ready he ends up late out the door by 2-5 minutes every time. I try talking to him about it but he’ll yell at me jokingly whenever I try to say it and then it turns into him being mad at me.

-I saw his profile on three dating sites. I cofronted him and he got mad. Said it wasn’t him. He said the next time it happened he would look into it. It happened again, he got mad at me and didn’t do anything. Just yelled at me calling me names (idk why I stayed at that moment)

-lately I haven’t wanted sex because of how awful I feel about myself and he gets mad at me and then I usually give in

-He usually says something mean to me when we’re done like he’s glad it’s done

-he calls me an idiot daily. And tells me to stfu. If i don’t he’ll grab my face. He won’t hurt me but just grab it 

-he’ll usually come home two hours before me and I usually get home and cook but when I ask him if he can he’ll get upset 

-he says he’ll change but it only lasts a week. When I ask him why he said it’s because I don’t support him and I’m the reason for all his problems

-he always wants things his specific way even when I’m doing it. Ex: I’ll go to the store a certain way and then elk say I’m dumb because the other way is faster. This is with cleaning, gaming, etc everything

-when he games he gets incredibly angry. I game from time to time and get angry but not like that. He’ll slam his mouse and take his anger on me at times

-when I talk to him he sometimes won’t rely. If I did it I’d be called a worthless cunt

-when we fight he says “how did I get so unlucky. I don’t want to be with you” 

-he also does a lot of this to his mom 

Even with all this he doesn’t apologize to me MOST of the time. He’ll just act normal. And happy.


I think he realizes he’s wrong; sometimes he’ll hug me right and say sorry. But even though he does I know I don’t want to be with Him anymore. I can’t picture us together because I don’t think he’ll change? I can’t leave either though. my family is on the other side of the country and I don’t have any friends here even. It’s just us. I also don’t have enough money with my internship to be on my own. This has really messed with my mind and self esteem. Idk what to do guys. I feel so broken. Can someone help me? Or maybe I’m over exaggerating everything. Can I get some advice?"
7u1hza,5,2018-01-30,Mental health or Intership?,NewContemporary,Anthropology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropology/comments/7u1hza/mental_health_or_intership/,"Hello Reddit,

  I am a junior in college . I am an anthropology major and so far have had two paid internships in the field. The first was close to my house and I made my schedule in a certain way where it wasn't an issue and I was only allowed 10/15 hours a week. 
.
Now, I have this other internship in the city closer to my campus and have had it for about a year now. It's a job researching and writing and I'm an assistant to my boss who gives me these assignments where I'm unfamiliar with the subject matter and I have to research and after that, write. I can do it it's just now I have taken my class load down from five classes to three this semester to balance everything more. Also last semester when I was taking five classes I barely made it by and simply just strived to pass my classes. However my mental health was out of whack and I was constantly depressed and then would have anxiety and used heavy drinking on the weekends to cope with everything . ...
.
This semester I'm trying to be nicer to myself and not push myself to the edge of giving up on school altogether as I have already come this far. So like I said , I am taking three classes. 
. 
However , these classes are now heavily discussion based and require me to actually do the reading to get points in the class. And the readings are pretty heavy and not always digestible . Not to mention, I actually want to understand what the fuck I am learning in class and remember it to a certain extent. I think honestly my profs were nice to me and passed me to a certain extent because I kept in communication with them about everything but last semester a ton of my assignments were late or I was given an extension. 
.
I don't drive right now as school is plenty expensive on its own without a car And I only get loans . So I take the bus and I have to be there with the way my schedule is this semester at 6 am to get there by seven then take the bus from work at 11 to get to school by 12. However, I have no classes on Fridays so I can actually work a full shift, as I do on breaks then. 
.
I'm seriously losing my shit right now cause although that works in theory in real life that's too much because of just having time to work out / sleep/ eat/ read / do homework takes a bit of time. I'm trying to take better care of myself this semester and the semester has just started and I'm already feeling myself get into this space that I really don't like. .
.
I just emailed my boss and asked if I can work remotely at school at my breaks between classes , and after school, then come into the office on Fridays to present my work and also to work one full shift then . This is really feasible because there's no real reason for me to have to be at work other than her seeing my physical body working. But with writing you have to be in a good headspace to write and when I have to commute in the early morning and fill like shit from reading and sleep deprived I can't wrote as is so my productivity is low. 
.
I work best around the afternoon when the gears have already been turning for a bit . And I am in a space where I can write....... Being in an office where people are gossiping and things or answering calls, etc. Is a hard environment for me to work in. 
.
If my boss doesn't take my proposal I'm not sure what to do . I like the job and it's a good job I'm not willing to just like lose my shit though to keep it. I live at home still and my parents support me for the greater extent of my needs except for when I have the money to help out ( books/ I buy my own food/ buss pass/ phone bill/ help with groceries for them / pay people I carpool with, etc) oorrr last semester I spent a lot of money on alcohol but now as I have been working out more and using that and yoga as an outlet and also lightening my load of classes ; I have lessened the drinking and now hardly do it at all unless it's a social thing and I find myself there . ( It's hard to get in shape when you drink) . 
.
I just don't want to get in that dark space again.... "

I have notes with questions I want to ask and an elevator pitch and all that, but my friends were like “All they ever say is to just apply online” and kind of disregard you.

Any tips?

Edit: Just got done...CAREER FAIRS ARE SO LIT YO LMFAO!!!! Like anyone else who is scared, don’t be! They want to talk like, it’s awesome.

Also shoutout to everyone who showed up tonight in jeans and sneakers, y’all da real MVPs bc I know I’d be feeling awful but you guys got more confidence than those are seemingly more “prepared”.

Happy internship hunting!"

7u2kez,15,2018-01-30,Looking for Haskell internship this summer,Vizaxo,haskell,https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/7u2kez/looking_for_haskell_internship_this_summer/,"I'm a CS student and Haskell/functional programming fan looking for an internship this summer, so I thought I'd ask if any of you either work at or know of companies that use Haskell and might offer internships (for myself, or for other people in a similar position (for anyone else looking, there was a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/6yuelo/internship_for_haskellers/) here a few months back)).

I'm in the UK, but I would also consider positions in Europe (though please feel free to post opportunities from anywhere in the world for other students).

I've been programming in Haskell for just over a year (both teaching myself and taking functional programming/Haskell modules). It's by far my favourite language to program in (though I have just started learning Idris, which might take that spot soon...), so I'd love to spend my summer using it and developing my skills further.

I'm in my second year of a CS undergrad course at a Russel Group university in the UK, and I did well in my first year (95% overall mark; 99% in the module which included Haskell). I've put up a small project of mine on GitHub to show my level of experience/knowledge: [a simple lisp interpreter](https://github.com/Vizaxo/minimalisp).

Thanks in advance for any information/help you can provide."
7u2khn,7,2018-01-30,How to survive the next few months,MN1314,badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/7u2khn/how_to_survive_the_next_few_months/,"I moved into a new house with a friend back in August. Her mom is a realtor and so she bought my friend this house while she’s in grad school for four years. I thought it would be great but I’m losing my mind living here now.

It all started when I first moved in and I realized just what a crappy person she was. She graduated from undergrad just two months before and I’m a senior in undergrad. She started talking about how undergrads are so stupid and that there’s so many undergrads in this town and then she literally proceeded to tell me “society views me as a better person and more successful than you because I’m in grad school.” (Never heard that before but ok). She tells me my major isn’t difficult (even though it’s in the top three of most difficult majors at my school, and my late nights studying and crying after tests can prove that) and she works 100 time harder and is way busier than me. Mind you, I work a job, I have an internship, I take a full load of classes, and am in a leadership position on my athletic team. She’s never worked a day in her life and all she does is go to school and come home. I’m up until 3am studying while she’s in bed before 10 every night. She dissed my friend for being an education major and said that she doesn’t work hard when I know for sure she works her butt off. 

So since her mom owns our house, she gets the master bedroom, the garage, a third bedroom as her “office” and gets all the storage space. I have a dinky little room which is fine because I’m paying cheap. 

But since you have the back story, here’s some problems I’ve been having. She watches me like a hawk every time I do something. If I’m in the kitchen cooking she has to come in and tell me how to do everything. “Make sure that goes in the trash, put that in the dishwasher now, don’t let that touch my countertops or you’ll ruin them.” Now I only cook whenever she isn’t around. 

She constantly complains about my dog. Yes she sheds, but so does hers. I sweep and mop the floors almost every day. My dog will bark if she sees a cat outside. But so does her dog. But according to her her dog is perfect and mine sucks. She also locks my dog in my room when I’m not home because she “barked”.

A few weeks ago I had the flu. She was incredibly rude about it. “I’m in grad school I cannot get sick.” She never asked me if I needed anything, and I was very respectful. I stayed in my room all week only leaving if I needed something to drink. If I touched something I wiped it down. In the middle of the week she slams a face mask and gloves outside my door and demanded I wear them when I left my room. I could also hear her on the phone with her mom taking about how gross I was and that it was such a hassle having me in the house because she feels like she can’t leave her room. 🙄

While I had the flu my whole body was weak and I couldn’t do anything so some laundry piled up and my room wasn’t as put together as usual. I left to go to the doctor and find out her mom had called my mom and said my roommate had been in my bedroom and bathroom, took pictures and sent it to her and that it was a mess and I needed to clean. Apparently the bug man was there and that was why they were in my room. However, it is against the law if they don’t give me 24 hours notice before someone (non-emergency maintenance) enters my room in their state. If I knew he was coming, my room would’ve been cleaner. My privacy felt extremely violated. 

Lastly, the thing that really set me off recently is that she’s been picking out every little tiny thing I do to complain about. I am very clean in the common areas. I never leave dishes in the sink, I wipe down tables and countertops when I’m done using them, I sweep and mop, and I never leave things lying around. I came downstairs one day and she says “is there a reason you didn’t push your chair in at the table?” It was maybe three inches away from the table. The next morning I come down to a note that says “push your chair in at the kitchen table, put the dog bowl all the way against the wall and clean out the dryer tray.” ( I was running late one night so I forgot to clean the lint tray in the dryer, and that was the first time I ever did it. She hasn’t cleaned it before and it doesn’t bother me because it takes two seconds to do it.) She thinks our house has to look like it’s in a magazine constantly. 

I’m tired of her arrogant and almost OCD attitude. I’ve made plans with friends to move to a new place when my lease is up but how do I stay sane until then? I hope this doesn’t come off as being super whiny but I feel like I’m just a person in this girls house who’s treated like someone who’s always in the way and that she doesn’t want me here in the first place. I hate to feel like that in my own home. "
7u2y4v,1,2018-01-30,Should I take a 12k pay cut for a government internship?,Shuldibemad,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7u2y4v/should_i_take_a_12k_pay_cut_for_a_government/,"Hello hello, just weighing my options here. I currently work at a small firm as an IT analyst and have capped out at 45K. This is the highest I can go here, give or take small raises of about 50 cents every year but that's not guaranteed. They offer $1500 a year in tuition reimbursement, free health benefits and an excellent retirement fund that they match at 5%.

 I was just contacted by the federal government and was offered a position as a paid student intern (in IT) with a contract that offers a full time position once I graduate college. I will start at 33k and receive a 10k promotion every year until I reach the ""promotion potential"" of my job. Then I'll have to compete for the higher jobs (such as GS-13's and above). College will be paid for. 

Here is my dilemma. Starting at 33k will be a drag, my partner and I have about 1500 in monthly expenses between the both of us. Partner makes 70k so we are quite comfortable where we are now. I also don't know if should put in the time in the government if I could get more money in the private sector. Everyone always tells me that in IT I can make so much more for a private company. Plus I'll be starting over as an intern, which worries me because I am a grown man in my late 20s. We live in the south, meaning my bills are low and no state taxes so we won't be starving or anything. 

Is the loss of income worth it in the long run? Should I stay at my current company or look elsewhere at a different, larger IT firm?"
7u32h4,6,2018-01-30,GPA concern for internships,Belforduo,GaState,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaState/comments/7u32h4/gpa_concern_for_internships/,"I’m an honors finance major in the honors track for my major with a 3.5 GPA. Ideally, I would like to secure an internship this summer before I graduate in December of this year (2018). I have applied to over a dozen positions with no luck. I’ve had my resume looked at countless time, ranging from executives to career services here at the school and heeded all their advice about formatting. I work full time at a large bank with 2 years experience and I’ve had experience as a finance associate at a medium sized company last year. Why am I having so much trouble getting a call from these companies? 

Some of companies I have applied to are:
Suntrust
The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
The Home Depot
UPS
Verizon
Cox 
Invesco
RaceTrac Petroleum 
GM Financial 

Are there any finance majors out there with a similar background that can suggest companies I may be overlooking? I don’t know what else to do at this point. What are these companies looking for???

I can’t help but think if I were at Tech with the same stats (maybe even lower) I wouldn’t have a problem with being noticed.

7u33km,6,2018-01-30,I need help with my quarter life crisis,kittybunnie,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/7u33km/i_need_help_with_my_quarter_life_crisis/,"I'm an engineering student at Virginia Tech. I did very well my first year then things went downhill. The second year, I had some personal issues which caused me to develop depression. I stopped being social and stopped doing well academically. I recently changed my major to aerospace because I hated my previous engineering major. I feel happier academically, but I'm still distracted and can't seem to focus on school. I did try therapy, but that did not work. I'm looking into other alternatives. I'm also taking a break this semester so I can work on myself. 


However, during the times I was depressed, I didn't do internships. I helped a professor with research one semester, but that's all. I'm worried employers will see my lack of internships compared to other students and think I'm unmotivated in my field. They wouldn't have a reason to hire a fifth year taking sophomore aerospace classes over a new sophomore. I've only been taking 1-2 classes past few semesters so I was still only a sophomore in my other major as well. Anyways, I'm worried this will impact my ability to get an internship when I start applying this fall. I got an offer to volunteer at the White House this semester, but I would have to move home for this. I know the opportunity is great, but I would be even more depressed if I go home (toxic family enviroment). I've finally started making progess, and going back home would probably undo that. My parents insist it's a huge opportunity and desperately want me to come back home. I'm not sure if that would look impressive or okay on an engineering resume. Otherwise I would get a job here in Blacksburg this semester or try to help a professor with research. Overall I just feel like a disappointment and that I've wasted a lot of time. Not sure what to do. "

7u3lu5,7,2018-01-30,Seeking advice for how to best navigate a professionally-oriented trip to Tel Aviv (science and technology),blowjangle,Israel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/7u3lu5/seeking_advice_for_how_to_best_navigate_a/,"I'm a graduating senior from UNC Chapel Hill in North Carolina, USA. My major is computational biology, though I have experience in computer vision, machine learning in non-biological contexts.

Anyway, I'm starting the job search and trying to cast a net as wide as possible. One idea I had for this was to extend my stay in Tel Aviv for 1-2 weeks, and use this time to explore the Israeli tech scene. 

My current game plan is to research and network. If an opportunity for a perfect job or internship came up, I might take it. But I don't like to approach networking that way, I prefer to just maximize the quality and quantity of my conversations with interesting people doing incredibly exciting work. If something happens, it will happen.

I'm looking for general advice. Has anybody done this? Is anybody currently working in an exciting tech company in Tel Aviv? What's the professional etiquette surrounding this type of meeting? Anything at all helpful for me to know?

Thanks everyone, really looking forward to my trip."

I am being flown out to a retail company's head office for a full day of interviews for a Digital Marketing Analyst position; I've already had 3 skype interviews with HR and the department manager.  I recently graduated with a Computer Information Systems degree with a minor in marketing, and completed an SEO internship at a very reputable global digitial marketing agency this summer. Since starting this process, I've competed several online courses for Power BI reporting, and Tag Manager which they've stressed multiple times they use. I'm very resourceful and learning new applications comes very naturally to me. For this final series of interviews, the recruiter stressed that I need to demonstrate that I've looked into ""the larger digital eco-system"". Can someone enlighted me on what this could possibly mean? I have hands-onexperience with several SEO applications, and have google certifications in Analytics, Search and Display Network, and Mobile Advertising, but no real experience with tag manager, SEM, and analytics. Any advice on where I should focus my research or if I can answer any questions to clarify anything, let me know. Thanks a bunch!

7u3tbi,4,2018-01-30,US/NL Dual Citizen Moving to NL,solskr,Netherlands,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/7u3tbi/usnl_dual_citizen_moving_to_nl/,"Hello all,

I'm a dual American/Dutch citizen moving to the Netherlands soon and am looking to get tips and hear from those who have done something similar.  I have visited NL many times, have family there, and am familiar with the culture and people--so this isn't a classic ""expat"" situation.  I'm more looking for info on taxes, employment, obtaining a driver's license, housing, moving monetary funds between countries, etc.  My relatives can't really answer those questions, so I'm hoping some of you can help! 

Some info on me: I'm a 30-year-old single male.  My Dutch is limited, but I will be taking classes the first couple of months to strengthen it.  I just completed a bachelors-level IT degree and so would be looking for entry-level work in the IT sector (web development, software engineering, etc.). 

1. I'm looking for intern/entry-level IT work and noticed many internship positions require you to be still enrolled in school (in the U.S. this is not always the case, ""internship"" just typically means no benefits and low pay).  How hard will it be to find an entry-level position in IT where the language is only English?


2. I've heard that getting a driver's license is very expensive in Europe, why is that?  I've also read that 30% ruling people can exchange their driver's license (instead of re-testing in NL), would I be eligible for that?


3.  Taxes -- this sounds like a mess and I don't know where to start.  I've heard that as long as I make under a certain amount, I'll only have to pay into social security in the US--how much should I plan on contributing into social security back in the US given your average salary? 


4. Health insurance--how does this work exactly?  Seems like you purchase private or get it through the government.  


5. What insurance companies, cell phone companies, banks, etc. do you recommend?

Any tips/info would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers,

7u4aw6,65,2018-01-30,QuadrigaCX get your shit together already,Cranky_Crypto,QuadrigaCX,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaCX/comments/7u4aw6/quadrigacx_get_your_shit_together_already/,"What kind of company is bursting at the seams with 'record breaking profits' (according to u/QCXDuane) and refuses to hire additional staff? Seriously, it raises a lot of eyebrows that you guys are still a 3-4 man show despite being the only game in town. Why can't you scale for the future? Given the elapsed time, why have you failed to meet increasing consumer demand? Where are all the profits going? Not to marketing and operations that’s for damn sure. Definitely not your archaic website and trading platform. Hire an intern. Temp workers. Anybody for fucks sake.  

Then there was [this post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadrigaCX/comments/7tui55/psa_if_youre_dumping_a_large_amount_of_crypto/) stating that the ETH hot wallet was depleted. Don’t you have alerts in place? Is that a sign of a healthy exchange? What kind of financial institutions let their second most popular currency run dry? It looks really bad however you view it. Liquidity issues are an indicator of a company about to go belly up. I’m not saying you are, but I was shitting bricks.

Verifications. Why are they happening out of sequence? Are you giving preferential treatment to those who appear to have money (i.e., Asians and older people)? And for the few who are finally verified, they soon find out that we are now down to one viable deposit method: Interac Online. E-Transfer and EFT is disabled with no ETA. The future does not look very promising for your clients right now. Seriously, are you guys even thinking about tomorrow?  

Speaking of Interac Online, numerous customers have had their funds go missing. The fuckin CT Payment deposit works half the time. Why don't you disable it until things are more stable? Oh, I know why: it's the only way for suckers to keep putting money into your account at the moment. Is there any rhyme or reason why some are going through and others aren’t?  

What the fuck is happening with bank wires. Some are seriously delayed while others are flat out missing. And why is your bank now a CIBC branch in Toronto and not the original Polish account? The way it looks right now: there is a lot of money going your way, but not much coming back. Switching banks on us was a bit concerning, too.  

I'm sure there are other stories outside of Reddit where customers are having deposit/withdraw issues with large sums of money. It just so happens that Reddit is the forum for Millenials to complain about their missing $250. What about the corporate investor with six-figures on the line? How about Chinese Whales? Do you think they are out here complaining on Reddit? No, they would have sought legal expertise or reported to the authorities already. I recall one post where a guy did report to police.  

No serious financial institution leaves their customers in the dark for weeks at a time when there is money involved. I don't care about your reputation as Canada's largest (only) cryptocurrency exchange. Maybe the service used to be good in the beginning, but now it has deteriorated to a comical level. Since 2013 you say? I have succulent plants older than that sitting on my window sill.  

Even if there was a serious backlog, you would expect the CEO or President to release a statement to customers. We get nothing but anecdotal stories that somebody, somewhere, ""got my funds, bro"". There is absolutely zero confidence in the company at the moment--whether putting money in or taking it out. In the regulated financial industry, the complaints would be piling high right now.  

Anybody foolish enough to defend QuadrigaCX is a blind fanboy. Nobody cares that you were able to deposit your allowance last week. Nobody cares that some neckbeard received a $1k wire last month. Some of us have been waiting weeks and months for thousands, or tens of thousands of dollars.  

To all the 18-year-old kids on the Internet telling others to ""chill dude, they're overloaded"". QuadrigaCX isn't your local weed dealer who ran out of dime bags and isn't answering the phone. We are talking millions of dollars unaccounted for nationwide. Wake the fuck up people. Stop drinking the Kool Aid.  

QuadrigaCX, stop acting insolvent. You look like [MF Global](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Global) right now."

I am a 25y old male and have had problems waking up in the morning for about 15years now. I have been diagnosed by my doctor with depression but already had this wake up problem when I was young. I know I have always been a night owl but now this problem is becoming too big. 
I am barely able to wake up a 10 or 11 am eventhough I go to bed at 11pm. If I go to bed at 9pm it doesn't solve the problem. I can sleep 12hours in a row. The thing is that I feel disconected with the world.

Anyway, I need an effective solution. This situation has been going on for too long! As long as I remember I woke up early easily only twice in my life! For example when I was young, I could not wake up on Christmas morning! 

In the morning I feel extremely bad with the impression that waking up is the toughest thing in life. Like if I woke up from coma. It is hard to explain but it feels like I have to wake up at 3am. I feel so bad that I sleepover. 

Right now I am self employed so the problem is not urgent but I am really afraid because I will soon have to find a job and here if you come to the office late 3times in a row you can be fired. In my country it is common thing to wake up before 7 or 6. Compared to that I look like a lazy person to society and it affected my life pretty bad (I almost failed my internships and school because of that). My goal is to be able to wake up at 8-8:30 (7:30 would be perfect, but 8-8:30 is very good already for me)

This is my last attempt on solving this problem before going to the doc and ask for a sleep analysis.

Thank you"

Keep in mind, these are all copy and pasted from the original posts, so apologies in advance for any repetition. Enjoy!
———————————————————
Going to combine two previous posts of mine, so hopefully it will garner more interest.
Hi everyone! I'm looking for something a little different today. I'm looking for more of a long term(?) romance between two people who meet at a club. I would take you to get some food so we can sober up, and we end up back at my place for some bedroom fun. You would end up spending the night at my place, and the rest is history. I'd want it to develop into something much more, and maybe even go the distance. Where we start with the roleplay doesn't matter much to me, whether it be at a club, eating together late at night, getting to the bedroom, or even the morning after. All of it sounds fun to me, and I hope it does for you as well! I prefer writing in the first person, and as for post length, I'm not too picky, just as long as I get more than two sentences or so. Here's a kink list for me, but I don't expect even a quarter of the stuff on here to be included. That being said, this can be as vanilla or as kinky as you want to get, I'm quite flexible :). Kinklist: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Feel free to respond at any time, as I'm always happy to accept new roleplaying partners. Can't wait to hear from some of you!

Looking to play out an office romance scenario, simple as that. Ideally I would like one of us to plan an intern, and the other to play someone a little higher up in the pecking order. I had originally imagined that this would happen between the CEO and an intern of his or hers, so I'd like to try for that. As for which of us plays the CEO and which plays the intern, I'm flexible on that. One other thing I should mention, is that I'm not set on playing strictly a guy. I can play a futa, or a true female, or even a MtF trans if that's something you're interested. Feel free to ask if you'd like me to play someone besides a guy. There are a few kinks I would like to include in this, those being impregnation and other pregnancy related kinks. Hopefully this will be more long term, so I'd like to explore that avenue. It's not enough for me to be sleeping with an intern(or the CEO) at my company. I want to create something more than just two people hooking up. I want to explore a hidden relationship and the trials that come with it. One last thing I feel I should mention, cheating scenarios aren't very high on my list, but I'll entertain any scenario that's suggested. Bonus points to anyone who wants to involve blackmail of some kind, also. I'll never turn down a blackmail scenario. Here's a kink list for me so that more ideas can be gathered: https://m.imgur.com/glf2fpv?r. Hope to be hearing from you soon! 

Hello, kind reader! I've always had this strange fantasy where I'm friends with a lesbian girl who would be out of my league even if she was into guys. But, I make a bet while I'm incredibly drunk, and so I obviously lose. Now, I've always been on the slender side of the spectrum. Flat and skinny and not at all muscular in any way. My friend has always thought I would make a pretty girl, and so she uses the bet as a means to transform me into her shemale lover or toy, permanantly. The only thing about me that makes me think I ever had a shot with her is the fact that I've got an absolute monster in my pants, 11 inches of hardness I've always thought could help me make a case for her dating me. So that's the prompt, and I have a template for what I'll look like after my transformation. Any ladies interested, feel free to PM me. This prompt is open all the time, as well. Hope to see those lovely messages start flooding in!

Hi there, DPP. I'm looking for someone who would be interested in doing some long term roleplaying. I won't tell you about what/who I am, because I'll be whoever you want me to be. Got an idea you want to use? A celebrity crush/r34 template you want to have fun with? Want to roleplay in a fantasy world? How about something futuristic? I could be someone famous, a total stranger, or your neighbor down the street. Within my kink list, the sky is the limit. I personally have no opinion one way or the other about what gender I play, and I think it could be more fun if you felt the same way, but it's by no means a must, only a suggestion. As for roleplay content, I'm not looking for a flurry of mindless sex. I'd like some buildup, some romance or some exploration of different relationships, whatever catches your fancy. I have several potential ideas if you don't have anything already planned, so feel free to PM me with any questions you might have, or to pitch an idea, or even just to chat and see if we're compatible. Hard limits are blood, scat, most filth (such as farting or extreme scent play), and BBW. Here is my full kink list for a better idea: https://i.imgur.com/Ro2sZcH.png. I look forward to hearing from you, so don't be shy!

Genie- You're walking through an old antique store, and you accidentally knock over a rusty looking Arabian oil lamp. ""You break, you buy. Dent is break."" The old Romanian woman behind the counter says, having seen everything. ""Seventy five dollars American, please."" She says, holding out her hand. After you reluctantly give her the money, you hurry home, frustrated. When you get home, you take the lamp out of its bag and set it down, glaring at it. You notice some words etched in the side and pick it up, seeing Arabic writing. You carry it to your computer and spend the next half hour translating it, chuckling when you figure it out. ""Come forth, Genie of the lamp. Huh, someone had a lame sense of humor."" You say as you toss it behind you on the couch, unaware of the smoke billowing out of it.

Cortana- You've always been an avid gamer, and have filled your whole life with video games where others would have with sports or clothes or celebrities. When you bloomed in your teen years, going from a scrawny nerd to an attractive high schooler over one summer, video games fell by the wayside. But after you saw the announcement of The Halo Collection, you got back into it, growing excited when you won a sweepstakes for an early copy of the game and a wearable Spartan helmet. What you didn't know was that one visionary at the software company had used this opportunity to experiment with localized A.I. and had created his own version of Cortana to live inside the helmet.

Buying a Celebrity at Auction- you go to the address given on the card, something you found in your mailbox one day, addressed specifically for you. You are in front of an old warehouse that's unsuspecting to say the least. You walk in, and a large man who could be close to 7 feet tall asks in a booming voice ""Can I help you, Sir?"" You flash him the card and he steps aside, letting you into a dimly lit showroom. You wander around, still confused about what this all is. You sit down in a soft armchair with your name on it, only seeing three other chairs there beside you. A man walks up to you and greets you. ""Hello, and congratulations. You've been selected for a once in a lifetime opportunity. In just a few moments, the first of 8 lots will be walked across the stage, where you will be able to bid on them, auction style, for the opportunity to own them. In this panel on the right arm of your chair is your button, and a special benefactor has graciously donated $50 million dollars to you for bidding money, so if you're lucky and you play your cards right, you might just walk away with any lot that catches your eye."" He bows to you and the auction starts. You sit up suddenly as the first lot is walked across to center stage, and is set down on a stool. 'Oh my god! That's (insert female celebrity here)!' You think, your mind racing. You make the connection, and with the $50 million in your grasp, you call out an opening bid.

7u4n1s,2,2018-01-30,Relapsed... What I learnt,RisG,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/7u4n1s/relapsed_what_i_learnt/,"I broke a 28 day streak today. I made the mistake of edging 2 days ago. It felt shit, and a waste. During my 28 days I experienced my worst depression, and had the best adventure while travelling overseas. I remember walking on sunday and it felt like everything was alive. Call me crazy, but I felt like a child. Everything seemed new and interesting..... I can't explain it. Maybe my senses were on overdrive, I don't know. People on the street stare at you like your different. 

When I got home I was so full of energy, and yet nothing to do, so I had a look, and then fell into the hole. I felt shitty and lethargic after my complete relapse today, but the lessons are still there. What I learnt from my depression was, that no matter how bad it gets I'm going to fight for my well being. Because I know that the light at the end was definetely worth it. I went straight to bed after I fucked up, and then I thought, fuck it I'm going to work. It's 10:45pm here, and I'm sending out my applications for internships. I'm continuing my language courses, and at midnight I'm going for a run!

Yes I failed, but I'm not giving up. I hope this helps the people struggling out there. You won't grow until you push back. You have to push back. Your fighting your own body, and it's urges. I still refuse to believe I'll relapse again. I really want to stop for good. "

2017 was an awesome year from march to november. I made a lot of progress in my life.

But since december 2017 each hardship is followed by another one. I don't have breaks. I'm constantly ""fighting"" against myself. I don't enjoy doing fun things because I can't stop thinking about the things I have to do (study, look for an internship, fix the issues with the landlord, go out of your comfort zone with that girl, clean my apartment, finish this project, work on your social skills, etc.).

So yeah I'm definitely more productive and confident than a year ago but I'm also constantly under pressure.

I'm always watching the time. I do have some time to rest but psychologically I can't really take a real break and stop thinking.

So now I just want to fap. I don't want to watch porn but just fap to release the pressure. Is it ok?"

I guess the problems started in September, at the beginning of my 3rd year. I told him I'd be going to a German-speaking country in January for eight months. This is a compulsory part of my degree. I either have to spend time in a German-speaking university or do an internship in a German-speaking country. He thought it was stupid that I had to spend so long away from home and kept asking if there was a way I could get out of it. He even suggested I change my major.

Eventually he stopped nagging me about it, but then in November when I was offered an internship after a phone interview, he wasn't excited for me at all. Anytime I tried bringing it up or talking about excited and nervous I was he'd change the subject.

The worst fight we had was on New Year's Eve. He got pretty drunk and kept repeating how he was wrong about me. When I asked what he meant, he said that he thought I was mature, but it seems I'm just like every other college girl and want to go on some eight month spring break in Vienna.

I left a week into January and he's just been giving me the silent treatment. He looks at my messages on whatsapp but never replies or answers my calls. I don't know how I can convince him I'm not partying when he won't even talk to me.

7u56rn,15,2018-01-30,I'm really bad at facilitating groups and I am way too controlling. Looking for advice on how to get better,letsflyawayyy,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/7u56rn/im_really_bad_at_facilitating_groups_and_i_am_way/,"I started interning about six months ago in PROS facilitating groups. I started out with a lot of anxiety thinking that I would not be good at counseling groups, despite my goal to be an individual counselor when I finish school. Everyone said that groups would get easier once I connect with clients and see how straight forward it is. But that has not happened for me.

I spend full days on the weekends planning out exactly what I'm going to do in each group. I write out notes and research every detail that I can think might come up in group. When I'm actually in groups I feel like I don't know what to say or how to respond therapeutically so it's easier for me to spend more time on psychoeducation and providing information. I'm extremely introverted so talking to large groups and initiating discussions is not exactly a pleasant experience for me. But my biggest concern is that members won't talk. 

I had a group this week that ended up feeling a bit more like I was teaching a class than counseling and at the members called me on it and basically said I wasted their time. I also had a lot of other issues in previous groups where I couldn't connect with the members. However all my coworker's and supervisors say I'm doing great. I have a tendency to personalize these things and I can't let it go. I feel like I let my groups down and I feel like I just have nothing to offer when it comes to counseling. The other interns don't have this problem. They literally just walk into group not knowing what they will do or talk about but when it's over they say it went really well and they connect with people. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong but I'm terrified of giving up my control and winging it like that. 

I'm at the point of feeling like I shouldn't be a social worker anymore. I don't think it's for me. I'm too introverted and bad at socializing and I feel like these issues will come up when I do individual counseling next semester too. It might be better to focus more on something like care coordination or even intakes but I feel like I suck at counseling. 

I don't know how to come back positively from this last group I had, it was so bad. I'm just trying to figure out what it is I'm doing wrong and how I can improve since I'm stuck with these groups for the next six months. "

I make around 100k as an engineer and my girlfriend just finished her communications degree. She had taken some time off from school to work a decently paying commissioned retail position to help her and her family out. Now, after doing an internship at a competitive marketing firm, she is looking to get an entry level job in marketing and communications.  
  
So far so good, right?  
  
Well my girlfriend REALLY wants to move out. Her situation with her family is more stressful than mine and her family lives in a very small apartment. I totally understand why she wants to move out ASAP. I am very fortunate to have chill parents that give me some privacy and don't stress me out, but of course moving out would be great for me too.  
  
But then today, a friend of ours mentioned there's an apartment opening in her building. It's in a nice area and within walking distance to nice restaurants. It's around $2600/month.  
  
My girlfriend wants to jump on this opportunity because she loves the location and thinks it's a good price for a 2 bedroom  in that location.  
  
I somewhat agree that it's a good price for the area, but I also think it would be wiser to wait until she gets a job. She said she could contribute $500 a month to the rent until she gets a job. But I don't want her to dig into her savings just to move out...  
  
I feel like we've already lasted this long living at home, so we might as well keep waiting until she gets a job. We also don't know if she'll be able to get a job in this area, and if she gets a job in the big city that's 45 minutes from where we are now, it would make more sense to get a place that's closer. I don't think we should sign a 1-year lease without knowing where she'll be.  
  
The pros of moving out would be she would have a lot less stress and anxiety from living at home. Also most two bedrooms in this area go for around 3000 or more, so it is a good deal for the area.  
  
She also thinks this would actually help her with her job search ad she'll be much happier and clear minded. She is very confident that she'll get a job soon. She actually got an offer from the firm that she interned at, but wants to hold out for another opportunity because it wasn't a fun work environment and she'd prefer to do in-house marketing rather than work at a firm if she can. But besides that offer she has only gotten a couple phone interviews so far.  
  
I'm not really sure what to do or say. She thinks that I'm being negative, but I'm really just trying to be realistic and keep focused on our main goal of saving up for a house, which will be significantly impacted by $2600 a month.  
  
TL;DR: Girlfriend wants to move out to relieve stress but she doesn't have a job yet and I think it's more important to save money in the interim."

I've never filed taxes before and wanted to know if my dad can claim me as a dependent. He only makes about $30k a year self-employed. Will him claiming me as dependent hurt my return?"

Me and a friend of mine are participating in an internship in Botswana this upcoming summer. As I have never left the country alone, I would greatly appreciate any tips and suggestions that can be given to me to help make the trip as smooth as possible. I am flying into Johannesburg with a 9 hour connection in Doha - I arrive at 4 PM and would like to explore the city for a couple of hours until we hop on the second leg of the flight to Johannesburg at 2AM. Given the limited time that we have in Qatar, what suggestions do you all have for MUST DO's/MUST SEE's in this city. I have heard that Qatar is absolutely stunning and would like to discover it for myself. For reference, I will be in Doha in the first week of June. 

After flying into Johannesburg, I will spend a day and a half or so in the city prior to hopping on a bus from the Johannesburg station to Gaborone. Once again, please let me know if you have any must sees in Johannesburg. After reading up on the internet, Johannesburg appears to not be the safest city in the world for tourists and any suggestions/tips to ensure that I will come out in one piece would be great. Also, if anyone has stayed in any hostels/hotels for a night near the bus station and also has traveled from the airport to the station would be willing to give me suggestions - once again would be greatly appreciated. 

I will then proceed to spend 1 month in Gaborone, and am considering taking a weekend trip or two to surrounding countries/areas (Victoria Falls / The Gaborone Bush / South Africa). After researching on tripadvisor, Gaborone doesn't seem to have many tourist attractions apart from some national parks / game reserves that I will be sure to visit while there.

Finally, I will return following the same route after spending a month in Gaborone.

Thanks very much for taking the time to read my long post and cheers!

TLDR: Taking a trip through Doha, Johannesburg and Gaborone and would appreciate tips for a first time international traveler at the ripe age of 18."
7u66dw,1,2018-01-30,"Fuck you, OCD/OCPD",NotPerfect8,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/7u66dw/fuck_you_ocdocpd/,"Since childhood intrusive thoughts are part of my life. Violent thoughts, sexual thoughts, religion thoughts. Always thought was normal doing compulsions to get rid of the damn things. 

Fast forward teenage years, my rituals increased and I was getting a ritual for everything. Counting, thinking another thing to get rid of the first thing. Always thought all this energy spending was normal. But when obsessing about past mistakes came, the suffering was huge. Now there was no ritual for me to make. Past mistakes are done, as a glass of milk can be spilled. 

Despite all this mind storm, I succeed in getting accepted into a decent college. First year was a nightmare, now I had to deal with career obsessions. The increasing uncertainty that a normal life brings was frying my nerves. Added to this was an obsession about HIV because I fucked some girls without condons in freshman parties. I had a random panick attack one night and decided it was the time to see a professional. 

After medication, I was able to continue my college life, have a girlfriend and work towards my career. Now I knew what was feeling normal. Focusing was easy. Forgetting mistakes or criticisms or any other stressor was easy. I could choose my battles. 

In my senior year I had already forgot that I had any mental illness. My psychiatrist decided to cut in half the dosage of my medication. Due to final college year stressors (thesis, internships, job hunting), I had some tough times but nothing like the breakdowns I had before college. 

I was able to finish my degree in time and still land a very coveted job in the financial services industry. After all this, my psychiatrist also thought I was cured and cut my medication. With all the new uncertainties of the business world, new obsessions and compulsions came around. About everything. I thought I was being fucked over by colleagues. I thought my boss was setting me up for failure. With all the office hours, there was little incentive for me to socialize, so I was in a new city, overworked, obsessed and anxious as fuck. After six months, my back hurt so much that I thought I had a bulging disc or some serious nerve damage. Couldn't sit for 30 mins without very debilitating sciatica pain. 

Ended up accepting a less demanding job with health insurance to treat my back without asking my parents for help. Fast forward one year with obsessing about curing my back, spending thousands of dollars on private appointments, sports doctors, phisioterapists, chiropractors, nothing worked. All the MRI came clear: I theoretically had a perfect back. 

Couldn't deal with this anymore, so I remembered my mental illness. I was not cured. I started to recognize the patterns in the thoughts. The obsessions never end. So I looked for another psychiatrist and started on medication again. 

I am starting to feel normal. My back pain was GONE in a month. Fortunately, I am still young and maybe I can still recover from my early career mistakes. 

Life is not going to get easy. I love my parents to death, but all their neuroticism around me and emotional withdrawal summed up with genetics helped build my fucked up neuron pathways. Children can feel stuff. 

It was very hard typing these words and accepting that this very text is not going to be perfect. As I wish all my times were. But by wishing every fucking second that all should be perfect, life is going by my eyes. Memories are not being made. Wake the fuck up"
7u72pf,8,2018-01-30,Thankful for this community,purplemoosefarts,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7u72pf/thankful_for_this_community/,"Just found this subreddit and it couldn't have come at a better time. 

I have had anxiety for a few years, but it really peaked when I randomly fainted for the first time in my life. I was in the beginning of a hospital internship and I had blacked out and woke up on the floor surrounded by doctors and nurses. It was scary and super embarrassing. 

Since then my anxiety has manifested in a fear of fainting again with no notice. I found reprieve in Sertraline and my fears have been well controlled for two years! This week, I started a new birth control and my anxiety came back with a vengeance. I froze as I was walking into the grocery store and wanted to bolt back to my car. It felt like someone was chasing me, but the world was spinning so I couldn't run. 

The doc is upping my dosage and I'm hoping after a few months on the new BC I'll even out again. It was very disheartening to start having these anxious feelings when I thought I had this monster under control. Fingers crossed for a higher dose and in the mean time I'm taking solace here. Thanks for all the posters and commenters - you're helping more of us than you know. "

Had it fixed under warranty two times and there are still major issues. What can I do?",psychoticbarracuda,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7u7838/bought_a_used_car_from_a_non_profit_dealership_in/,"I am going to talk to them about letting me return the car, they said it had a 3 day trial period. It also comes with a 30 day power-train warranty that went into effect on January 15th. The car is a 2012 Chevy Cruze Eco (Manual) with about 62-65k miles (I forget the exact amount).

I know that lemon laws (at least to my knowledge) don't apply to used cars older than 24 months or something. Are there any protections I have in case they don't let me return the car? I feel severely mislead, the car has had non-stop issues and they knew about some of them beforehand and did not tell me. One of the interns that I was driving with to show the clutch issue said that he knew this car had some coolant leak when it came on the lot and they sold it to me anyway. Below is the timeline of issues and repairs I've had.

Issue 1:

Car started to smoke under hood, took it into the dealership mechanic and they said it needed a new thermostat housing. They ordered the part, got the wrong one, waited for the correct part, fixed it, and I picked it up a few days later.

Issue 2:

The day after I picked it up, the clutch gave out. Took it into the mechanic, test drove it with one of the interns to show the issue, they said it needed a new clutch. The intern also talked about how he knew there was some sort of coolant leak when it came on the lot from being donated to them (the car was a donation that they were reselling). They took out my clutch, saw it needed a clutch slave cylinder (or something like that, I'm not sure) and ordered the part. They got the wrong part, again, and then replaced the clutch and I picked it up earlier today.

Issue 3:

The lead mechanic said the ABS sensor was faulty but was safe to drive before I picked it up. I said okay, he said they are waiting on the part and I can take it in whenever they get it to have it replaced.

Issue 4:

When I picked the car up, the stability control light was on and the dash shows that I need to have it checked out and won't let me use my main HUD below the steering wheel (MPH, MPG, etc). This happened today and they are closed so I haven't talked to them about it yet.

I'm really not sure what to do besides ask for my money back. It's getting ridiculous at this point. I spent about $7500 on this thing and feel really severely mislead and I feel like this shouldn't be legal. They keep messing up the repairs and have done this with my other car before this too, their workers are new and/or relatively untrained and mess things up a lot. My girlfriend mentioned something about a federal law that explains cars sold not ""as is"" have an expectation of usability and that I have some protections, although I could not find this and am unsure how it would apply to me.

Does anyone know what I can do? This has been affecting my new job (just graduated college and started my first job) and personal life, not to mention adding on a huge amount of stress and anxiety.

Thank you very much PF, I really appreciated any advice I can get. Please let me know if you need any other information.

It's dumb, really -- I didn't even drop my phone in the toilet, or in the sink, or spill water on it... There's just a mysterious small water spot on the side, and of course my stubborn ass self had to get one of the notoriously most-difficult phones to take apart on the market, so here I am.   

Hi there! I've posted here before, but that was last year and I've apparently changed quite a bit, so here's some stuff about me you're probably interested in hearing before you message me!  

I'm a second year college student studying International Politics with a concentration in National Security, minoring in Security and Risk Analysis. I'm at my flagship state university and as of this semester, successfully snuck my way into the honors program! Central PA doesn't have much to offer (compared to my hometown in suburban Philadelphia), but it's been growing on me over the past two years and I'm having a blast.  

Actually, if you're in the general field of cybersecurity or have any wisdom to offer about national security, please let me know! I'm relatively aimless right now and gearing up for a career fair next week to try and get an internship for the summer.  

Oh, of course I have to insert the disclaimer here that I am **NOT INTERESTED in sexual conversation**. Please do not attempt to steer me in that direction, because I will cease responding.  

*(Copy/paste below, cause this part hasn't changed, at least!)*  


Music is hugely important to me, and I tend to love when people I speak to have a similar taste! Lido is my favorite producer, but I'm terrible at favorites and genre-naming. I generally point towards future beats, but lately have been more into a nichey rap/hip-hop side of future beats. I have an EDM background and have gone to a fair amount of shows in the past, so I'm reasonably familiar with a broad spectrum of sounds.  
I also sing and play a bit of guitar, piano, violin, and drums!  

As a subset of ""EDM culture"", I'm also very passionate about something called the flow arts. It's a great conversation starter if you'd love to know more, but if you're already familiar with it all, I flow/levi wand and orbit mostly, with a sprinkle of poi!  

*(End pasting)*  

I'm pretty involved with the ""gaming club"" at my school, and I'm active on Overwatch (peaked at high plat, currently mid plat and dropping because the community is *completely* non-toxic). I'm running on a laptop for my system so I'm pretty limited, but I have enjoyed the heck out of Starbound, Warframe (longtime veteran player), and Fortnite (getting back into this) in the past!  

If you take a look at my old posts, you'll notice I am completely basing this one off of whatever I wrote previously so continuing on...  

I do still lift, but unfortunately am no longer affiliated with the club here at my university (dues/fees were WAY too pricey this year!). I realized I needed to fix my eating habits in order to continue to progress, so I reset my lifestyle and have recently gotten back into regular lifting. I'm a noodle currently (which is a bummer, cause I made a lot of newbie gains last year), but I'm optimistic for the future!  

On the surface, I am 5'4"" and Korean (born and fluent in the language)!  

If you've made it this far in this wall of text, send me your favorite story about a physical scar (like, on your skin.. y'know...) you have!

7u7hjb,2,2018-01-30,Birth and Death and Limbo,bond21,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/7u7hjb/birth_and_death_and_limbo/,"My current life. But not the one i will finish with. Formatting is weird, suggestions are appreciated. this is therapy and a remembrance for me.

I met an interesting girl at church early in the year of 2011, by the name of Lauren. My first thought is “exotic” for some reason; maybe it was the blond hair. After months of frequent contact at church, we start texting and calling while she is at work. Fast forwards to end of year we call and text most days. I meet up with her after dropping Kelsey at school and she gives me a bag of chocolate. After a romantic walk around Wal-Mart and holding hands, Lauren says we should date (October 9 2011). After church movie function (watched Courageous) Lauren says we need to talk, we go to McDonalds and she confesses that she had been married 2 times before. She is in fact still married. Tells me the guy was really abusive and she wants out but hasn’t been able to afford it and she left him in jail in Oregon. She is terrified I will hate her for it, starts tearing up, and this only makes me like her more. I reassure her that’s its fine (even though I am not sure it is) and we continue as a couple. 

Within a few days of starting our relationship we have gone on two dates and to one church function as a couple. Our first kiss (my first real kiss) is on the 14th of October 2011 at 12.31am. By the end of the month I know I love her. Early January she tries to convince me she is bad news for me and writes a list of negative character traits in my diary, which I ignore and love her more for her honesty.  We go on a date to a Christian concert and Lauren feels really called to become a doctor to Africa (she has stated she never wanted to go to Africa before). After a really quick 2-3 months I have fallen hard and propose to Lauren, who accepts. By the end of January 2012 my parents find out about her previous marriages and help me to realize that it isn’t right to date her if she is still married. So we break up until divorce is finalized and my parents advise me to refrain from dating her for a year after the divorce is final. The divorce is by publication , and complications make it stretch out really long. Two months later, maybe a week from the end, Lauren can’t take it anymore and says she must see me. I talk it over with my mom and she reluctantly agrees that talking to the person who had been my best friend for a while is ok. A week later (divorce is final on April 10th 2012) we are together all the time. Oddly, we had had a relatively tame relationship before the hiatus. But after, we were much more passionate about things.

My journal indicated major trouble by November of 2012. Depressive writings, signs of arguing with Lauren. If memory serves, she had started subtly requesting I go to bed early, and demanding I don’t watch TV without her by now. Implies I can’t be trusted if I don’t do exactly as she says. But we carry on and eventually set a wedding date for May the 4th of 2013. Four months after marriage, I am told that a really good opportunity for her reaching medical school lies in Dallas, Texas, by way of a nursing school. 

We always argued as a couple. Every day there would be some argument about something. But it seemed normal. But after our move to Texas, it seemed to get real bad.

The first time violence entered the marriage was during our first pregnancy as a couple, right after we moved to Texas. This was her third pregnancy in her life. During this pregnancy she refused to let me drive the car to work on nights it was freezing temperatures and she threatened me with a screw driver and a knife. She had also convinced me that I shouldn’t be taking my medicine anymore. And that it (the medicine) was bad for me. So I had stopped cold turkey, and it was giving me some big problems (really argumentative and weird withdrawal feelings), but it was what she wanted and I believed she was right. The first blow was a punch to my face over cookies I baked. I had wanted to make a treat for the family the way my dad would after a long day at work, I was told that I was being greedy and selfish. A week or two later, after an hour of hateful speech from her while we were in bed, I did a terrible thing, I slapped her. Only once, but it was more than it should have been. This, I feel, opened up the gates for a major deterioration.  We moved to a new apartment; then the baby was born on the 24th of July 2014 and it was like it never happened. We made up, apologized for what happened and tried to change. 

My diary notes I am very depressed in June of 2014 relating to  (among other things) Laurens “moods” and many schedules for different activities.

We came to blows again in our second, her fourth pregnancy. This was following a disastrous Christmas vacation where I was constantly berated for being a terrible person and eventually became suicidal. She felt I was being dramatic and called me terrible things for even saying I felt suicidal.  Constant bickering and an escalation of argument tactics led to more blows by her and I. I don’t know who struck first, but a vicious tumble on the floor was followed by a busted nose and scratches on my part, and bruises on her wrists and arm. Again we apologized, I told her it was wrong and it’s not who I wanted to be and she told me she knew I was good man. 
I tried to live up to that. I started seeing a psychiatrist to help with inconsistencies in my mood and creativity during this time. A few skirmishes followed where I did nothing in offence, and took the blows she dealt out. Kicks, punches, scratches, bites. She continued to get in my face screaming and yelling at me trying to provoke something. She then resorted to breaking items of mine and acting enraged if I dared yell about it. Then the baby was born and things improved. 

We had decided to move back to Georgia, and stay for a time with my parents so we could buy a house. Just before leaving Texas, she convinces me again that it was time that I try titrating off of my medications because one was “causing you to have pre parkensonian symptoms.” This was the medication I had been on the longest and was most afraid of coming off of, but she reassured me.  So I discussed it with my psychiatrist and we laid out a plan of titration. I needed to finish some hours for school at an internship, so I moved my family in with my parents in Georgia, then stayed for three weeks at our apartment in Texas. I felt this was best so I would have time to get over the worst of the withdrawal symptoms.

Within a few month of being back, still having some fuzzy effects of going off of my medications, we start having an argument. It climaxes with her yelling at me that I am worthless, that I give the family nothing and that I should just kill myself. She repeats variants on this theme for 10 or so minutes before I get fed up and shove her away from me. She falls over a chair in the living room. I felt so bad about it I called the cops on myself. I am taken away for processing and am ultimately released without a record. This may be due to her lying about what happened to the police.

Not too long after this, on a normal morning, we were playing around and she turned her back on me. So I had a tiny amount of water and poured it in her hair, away from her desk and papers. She snapped and said I was trying to ruin her things. She snatched my headphones roughly from my head and snapped them in half. Then she looked at me and came towards me in a threatening way with fists raised. I was trapped in the corner of my parent’s porch with her between me and the exit. I slapped her before she could get me, and I ran off.

The next incident was only a month or so later after we had purchased a house. The fight started because I had worked all morning and then I had gone to help my dad buy a couch for my mom. Because of some severe rain and Atlanta traffic a 2 hour trip became a 6 hour one. Upon my return almost immediately she started with accusations that I didn’t care for the family and cared only for my parents. I could tell she was quickly coming to the boiling over point so I started telling Emily to get away and go to her room. Lauren told her to stay put loudly. I was begging Emily to go. Lauren came up real fast to my back with her fist raised and I felt she was attacking. I pushed her away using my back (she fell across the bed on the floor). She then got up and lunged for me. I fell down so she would not get my face. She punched my face repeatedly anyway.  I got up and tried to find the phone. She was screaming I hope you and your parents die painful horrible deaths. I got up and ran to Emily to get her to run away and Lauren came after me, so I grabbed Emily and drug her to her room and shut her in it (which wasn’t the best idea, but I was panicked). Lauren jumped on my back in the hall and bit my back. She then tried to bite my privates over and over. She was grabbing and pinching them. I grabbed her hair to pull her away from my privates. She finally stopped. She told me I started it and then backed me into bathroom. She punched me twice in face as I tried to get away. I ran past her to John who was screaming and took him to living room. She followed me to living room, demanding I put John down who I was trying to take from danger. She was threatening to break my glasses unless I put him down. When I put him down she said I cared more about my glasses than my family and broke them anyway. She went to one of the back rooms and told the kids I was going to jail. I still have the bite mark on my back.

The beginning of the end started on a hot day in August. I had been working on the car on this day, which had been around 90 degrees, and had drunk maybe 6 bottles of water before going to work. After work we had a pleasant evening with no indications of trouble. At around midnight, I woke up and had to pee. I knew Lauren didn’t like it when I got out of bed in the middle of the night so I laid in bed for maybe an hour hoping I would sleep again. Finally not able to hold it I went to the bathroom. As soon as I was in bed, Lauren started berating me. Telling me I was a bad father, that I didn’t love her or the kids, and that I was so selfish for drinking so much water. The string of terrible things went on for maybe 20 or 30 minutes. Finally I told her she was being stupid and tossed a pillow from the living room couch to her side of the bed, a distance of 7 or so feet. It wasn’t a hard throw, just one of exasperation. We laid down for 30 minutes in silence, then she got up, ran to my desk and broke my headphones in half. Then said if she couldn’t sleep, then neither would I. So she started slamming the bed right behind my head every few minutes. It should be stated we have a king size mattress, and because I toss and turn I sleep on the very edge of my side, and Lauren on hers. I roll over after maybe 2 or three slaps, and slap the bed saying, “why are you doing this?. Her hand was right behind me, where it never is as the bed is big and we stick to ourselves. I hit her hand by complete accident, and immediately apologized.  I had no intention of hitting her. She told me I was scum deserving of death and proceeded to hit the bed approximately every 10 minutes for maybe another 3 hours. No other verbal or physical interactions occurred. 

After this things were bad for a few weeks, with her constantly being rude and ugly to me. I go to my father and ask him how I can combat the things she says, he suggests recording her so we can go over it. I agree, it was a bad idea. Anyway, he gives me some pointers and I try them out. But after another week of hell of all the kids and eventually me and Lauren getting the stomach flu, she discovers the email I had sent my dad with the recording. She screams at me to get out. So I leave and move a few of my more breakable items to my parent’s house. A few days later she tells me she is pregnant, about a month in.

In this initial stage, she is saying the reason for our problems is because my parents are too nosey and too invasive in our marriage. And I am cheating on her with them and TV. For the next few weeks we seem to be trying to work towards amends, she has me get an appointment with our pastor, who gives us bad advice. Then she gets us a counselor, who gives us bad advice. She then gives me an ultimatum; move back in or she will file for divorce. I decide after a lot of prayer that this rage she is in won’t end if I move back in and tell her I can’t move back in until she gets help. I am told I am a monster for even suggesting that she take medication while pregnant.  So tells me she goes to the court to file divorce, but apparently did not. 

We live in a limbo for a while where I go over almost every day to spend time with the kids and help her around the house. We have verbal arguments (continual accusations of inadequacy, cheating and other odd things) but no physical events occur. Towards the very end she asks if I feel sex is out of the question, and I say no. At the house she says “I just wanted it with you for the last time.” I think it’s weird, but ignore it. We meet at the house early in the morning for the next 5 days. It is a good week and we seem to be having a normal relationship, but a lot of prayer tells me to hold off on moving in, so I give it 7 days before I do. On the sixth day she calls and texts me at 5 in the morning to come over, I say it’s too early and it was like a switch flips. Later that day she gives me another ultimatum, or a set of rules I have to completely agree to or she won’t want me to move back in. The biggest item was her limiting my contact with my parents, and my parents contact with her (which was her biggest concern during this whole separation period) I didn’t agree with everything and she is mad about it. So I don’t move back in, and our brief interlude ends. I still come over every day for the next two or so weeks after this, she usually wants me to take the kids places.

On October 10th 2017, she has me come over and take the kids for a little while before I go to work. That night, unusually, she calls me after work and lets the kids say goodnight to me. Usually, she said that after 9 was too late and she had the kids in bed. The next morning I am served with a TPO, or Temporary Restraining Order. She had gone to the court the previous day and filed it while I had the kids. The 10th was the last day I saw or heard my kids. The 11th of October also happened to be the anniversary of our first date together in 2011.

The order lists her version of a few of the events listed in this document. But that, up until the TPO, had not been discussed. The accusations were that I was a danger to her and the children and she was fearful of me. The lawyer I have sought help from felt that anything she stated about me and the children seemed more like a difference of parenting style, and not me being abusive to them. And with other details it seems she has been somewhat manipulative of me and was very aggressive in her texts.

As it stands now, I am living off of my parents. The judge did not make it clear how we can sort my paycheck, so for now she is receiving 100% of it. I am too afraid to touch it. I cannot contact her or the children for 12 months, or if he allows a divorce (which is odd given she is pregnant, but he suggested it), we may sort out how and when I can see them.

I am left with knowing that my parts in this drama were wrong; I have tried to make amends for them. The guilt of it weighs heavily on me and I know I will have to pay for a long time for ever touching her. But I also feel I have been taken advantage of. Or is it just threads I am grasping for? For now, I am missing my children with a pain I can only describe like a hole in my soul.  And, despite it all, I still love her. The pain of this feels like a betrayal. Am I alone to blame, or is it her too? Or are we both deranged and don’t deserve any good?

Update 
I started going to an anger management class as per some offhanded remark/requirement from the judge. It is hard, because much of what they teach in the class in terms of abusive behaviors, I see in Lauren. Much of what I did wasn’t about seeking power or control, but an end to endless belittlings, manipulations and abuses.
My lawyer contacts me and tells me that my wife has a lawyer as well, and they are willing to negotiate time for me to have the kids over the Christmas holiday. On December 27 2017 I was allowed to keep the children for a few days. Lauren starts communicating with me , saying her lawyer says its fine. She gives me pointers on how to deal with kids, and rules for bedtimes and dietary needs. We speak a few times in person, and she reveals she did not mean for the TPO to go as it did. She wanted structured time for me to see the kids (visitation like?). This doesn’t make sense to me, but I don’t question it. She implies she may still have feelings for me, and definitely does not hate me. I felt a surge of hope and other emotions.

I have to go to work a day before my time with the children is up, and so I will go drop them off at our house (now really Lauren’s house). That morning I prayed for a sign about how to proceed with Lauren (“If this is to be again, show me, if not, show that too soon. I need a sign of any kind.”). When I get to the house I see a strange car in the driveway, but don’t mention it at first. I unload the kids and presents (they got a lot from me and my family) and then, before I go, I cannot help but ask about the car. “Whose is it?” I ask. Lauren places her head in her hands and says “it’s just a car” with an odd face. I ask, has somebody been staying here with you? She say “I don’t have to tell you anything.” So I begin to walk around the house and she yells “don’t you dare go in the back of the house, or I am calling the cops!” I should have left. But she was acting so oddly, what was I to think here? I walk around, but am so out of it I don’t see anything. So I walk back to the living room and grab some things she wanted me to take home and leave. She is on the phone with the police.

As I pull away, the police arrive and I stop and talk calmly with them. They say she wanted me off property. I show that there was some legal paperwork saying it was ok for me to have the kids. They show me, the judge hadn’t signed off on it yet, so I was in violation of TPO. I am arrested and kept in jail for 3 days. I see a judge while in jail, who puts a new bond order on me with the same rules as the TPO. It is for $5000. I am charged with a misdemeanor violation of a TPO. When I finally can contact my family, they arrange for me to be released.

The day of my release, the lawyer goes to court to deal with original TPO which is then dismissed. My lawyer tells me her lawyer says it wasn’t a trap, which it seemed like at the time. The bonded TPO order is modified a week later to allow me to see kids and speak to Lauren again. She says she had no idea I was going to be arrested and wouldn’t have called had she known. Also, it is revealed the car was her fathers. I still have the misdemeanor charge on my head. It could go back to court and I could be in more trouble. 

I feel differently now, than before. I am no longer willing to run back to her without condition. I have a clearer picture of what has happened. Rash decisions that keep compounding into larger ones. She says she wants to talk about everything. But I am afraid she wants to tell me I have to give up my extended family, my right to a peaceful home, my creativity. I want us to work out, but I cannot go back to how bad it was. She would have to agree that what went on wasn’t right from either side, and we would have to build anew. I don’t see her pride allowing her to do that though.

What about me, what am I willing to change? I am willing to go to counseling. I am willing to take classes. I am willing to seek couples counseling. I am willing to not discuss most small problems in my relationship with Lauren with my parents.

What am I not willing to change?  I am not willing to just submit to her in all she demands (of which she does a lot). I am not willing to stop talking to family. I am not willing to not ask my family for help if I see situations  out of my scope of ability to handle. I am not willing to be belittled and demeaned and nagged to death.

I need help. I am too afraid to do the right thing, or do I even know what the right thing is anymore?

This happened today during a job interview, it was also a company that I really want to work for which makes it even worse.

So I work as a freelance software developer so I am my own boss and when he asked me why I decided to freelance I said ""because I like being my own boss so I can work when I want""... That was such a retard fucking thing to say because now they will think I won't be suitable for them.

Not only that, he asked me to tell me abit about myself and I literally only spoke for like two minutes about my experience and all I could think of saying was ""I did a degree in IT and I worked as a intern software dev and as a freelancer after I graduated"" then went onto explaining the tools I use for development and although I am skilled and know what I am talking about, I still got stuck and sounded like I was lying through my teeth about everything.

FML i graduated in 2015 and still havnt got a job, not because there arnt any but because I am probably the worst person at interviews.

7u8cni,16,2018-01-31,I gradually left the church and feel much happier now.,AndreTheGiant192,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/7u8cni/i_gradually_left_the_church_and_feel_much_happier/,"I wanted to share my story if it helps others. 

I grew up in France as a Mormon. My family rejected their catholic faith when they met American missionaries in the 70s and started a Mormon church in their town. 

As a kid, I really enjoyed it. My parents were friends with other families at church, I was taught good principles, I enjoyed the friendship and the social activities. I was in the only Mormon in school, but it felt ok. The church was very small and was trying hard to be open for all by organizing secular events. We organized parties, I invited my friends to learn English with the missionaries, video game competition, outings. It was a good experience. 

My parents were not very strict about Mormonism. Since they had started the church in our town, they kind of picked and chose more easily what worked for them. They hated the temple and never went. They actually discouraged me from going. 

In my teen years it became a little more complicated as my sexuality was developing. I enjoyed masturbating, fantasizing about girls and getting my hand on porn. Real sex was off limit but I found a personal balance by taking care of my own needs. The first time I felt torn between choosing my religious belief and my desire was when my first girlfriend asked to have sex. We were teens, she was gorgeous. As much as I wanted to make love to her, I couldn’t deal with the guilt and the fear of disappointing my parents and losing my church membership. She broke up as she was ready to become sexually active.  

I went to college in Paris  France that had a much larger Mormon presence. There were many wards. I quickly felt out of place there. The Mormonism practiced there was closer to real Mormonism with all the silly rules, the pressure to go on a mission, the need to be compliant, be active in the temple. At the same time, there were many literal crazies at church. France has hard time recruiting members. Desperate missionaries who would want to have at least one baptism before they went home would literally bring to church people with mental illness, homeless, etc.  

I started to hate the church. It felt like nothing I had known growing up. I was meeting strange people with weirder rules. It felt kind of familiar but it was more complicated to navigate. I made friends but I kept trying to enjoy going to church and it made less and less sense. 

My college life was rich and fun but I was feeling a lot of pressure to hold to my church principles. I wasn’t a drinker or a smoker but  I did struggle to not have sex. As an early adult, having sex with your girlfriend is just part of life but being the only Mormon in college, I felt the need to be an example. I fooled around a lot with my first college girlfriend and I confessed to my parents and Bishop. I felt so guilty and I was shamed about it. Looking back, I had developed an unhealthy relationship with sex. I wanted it but felt guilty so I masturbated a lot and fooled around and then tortured myself that I was still a worthy Mormon.

 I unconsciously picked another girlfriend in college that was not very attractive and was not interested in sex. It filled my need of companionship without the remorse of sex. Relationship was ok but after being together for a few years, in the last year of college we gradually fooled around and both felt really guilty about it. It was a miserable relationship that lasted years. 

In parallel, church was becoming more and more awkward. I was learning about all the weird church history, discovering the temple and was pressured to go on a mission. I didn’t want to go and I was more and more disturbed by what i finding out about the church. I was also getting tired of the hypocrisy and idiosyncrasies I was noticing. I remember spending a summer in the US for an internship and learning at a Mormon church there how R rated movies are the work of the devil and then going back to France and having the french Mormon church  organize a youth event about watching an R rated movie. It made no sense. 

Since I was the only Mormon in college, I couldn’t even explain to my friend what the heck are all these Mormon rules about. What I was able to brush off as a kid, I couldn’t as an adult. I had existential questions like « my college friends are great human being, yet they drink and have sex but they are still great. Why wouldn’t they be saved?”, “people  at my church are nuts, hypocrites, spiritual bullies, yet they act as if they are so divine and look down on others”. It kept me up at night. 

When I finished college, I was sexually frustrated, trapped in a loveless relationship to shield me from temptation, hating going to church and hating  the time I was wasting with people i didn’t really enjoy. 

After college, I moved to the Florida for work. I went to church in a youth ward but felt completely out of place. I didn’t understand the culture, the weird conservative mentality, the “Utah” culture. It got to the point were I was just going based on the memory I had as a kid but I wasn’t enjoying it. 

My girlfriend came with me to Florida. We lived together for a month until she found another apartment. But we didn’t really love each other. I was becoming more and more sexually frustrated. I told her we should get married. I wanted to move forward in our relationship and have sex, but she had the maturity to realize I was just trying to be sexually active without the guilt. 

We broke up. It was painful. I had hoped she would become a Mormon, I thought she was the one. My world completely shattered. I felt guilty and angry. I also started to realize that I had made a lot of life choices based on “false spirit voice” in my head. I really wanted her to be the one but she wasn’t. Somehow I had convinced myself  it was my mission to convert her. I also realized I was going through life avoiding what I really wanted in life and being my true self.  The church made me feel guilty for natural desires. Did I really believe in the church or was I just going to keep my parents happy? I also recognized by own hypocrisy and that I was no better than the next person. 

I decided to stop going to church. I went out more , I made new friends. I eventually met a new girl. She was gorgeous. She had a very healthy relationship with sex. I was still attached to being a virgin (at least not penetrate someone) so we fooled around. But it was so fun, so liberating. I felt like myself, that I was understood and that we were sharing something beautiful. We were crazy about each other. 

Due to visa expiration, I had to go back to France.  We kept a long distance relationship. I went to church a few times in Paris but quickly realized I wasn’t interested. I still identified as a Mormon but i wanted to focus on building my best life. I didn’t want to be distracted by what an old guy in Utah who apparently speaks to god said or did not say. After feeling so enslaved for so long by the guilt of living my life and living up to the ever changing expected standard of Mormonism, I was started to focus on my needs, learning to listen to what I truly wanted. 

My long distance girlfriend quickly became my wife. We got married and she moved in with me in our small Paris apartment. Being married, young and with a lot of catchup to do, we enjoyed our newlywed life. Mormonism was slowly fading away. I couldn’t bring myself to put my wife through the mental stress had gone through. 

Long gone were the great memories of going to church with my family as a kid, the proud feeling of being ordained a priest by my father ( it felt like my dad was making me a Jedi Knight). Now it was just a source of mental stress, guilt and over complicated human relationships. My parents were also going through a similar realization. They had a new bishop who was pressuring them to go to the temple, pay their tithing, etc When they refused, they were shamed. The friends they thought they had turned their back on them and they became inactive.

 I still identified as Mormon but I was building my married life without it. My wife and I moved back to the US.  I didn’t even bother going to church. I started to realize I had to make a choice. I was still emotionally attached to my church membership as it was my dad who had baptized me. I had taken it as a sign of love of a concerned father interested in teaching good principles to his child. I agonized for a few years. How could i believe it was true. Did my parents get fooled? Did they fool me? 

When my first child was born, it was a turning point for me. What i saw during her birth was the raw power of life. The messy, bloody, painful reality of where a human being is coming from. She came out my wife vagina! The same organ that had been off limit for so many years. One of the  most beautiful moment  of my life involved blood, a vagina, pain, love. There were no angels, no one wearing a tie, no clean cut missionaries, no beautiful empty sentences like “I felt the spirit”. No it was just raw and so human. At that moment I realized how full of shit of all Mormonism was. 

I had been for years manipulated in believing that Mormonism was the answer to life questions when it was just an elaborate  business to influence members to join its rank and be guilted into staying. Jospeh Smith was a good salesman who sold dreams to whoever wanted to hear him. Add a little bit of magic &amp; mystic and nothing to lose and you have the birth of a religion. Joseph Smith was a religious entrepreneur who became successful. A lot of people joined his service, paid their monthly fee and made him powerful. Even better, the church has been able to convince its members to go on a mission to recruit more people to join the service. Numbers, numbers, numbers! 

From then on I was done. I promised myself I would never raise my kids religiously but teach them to respect religious people. I told my parents I was done. I realized they had been done too. I thought about having my record erased from the church but out of nostalgia I stayed. My dad was the one who had baptized me. Having a record of that somewhere in a database  meant something to me.

As years went on, I stopped thinking about the church at all. I have spent my time focusing on my family and myself and try to become a better father, husband, human. 

Not having the church in my life allows me to have my own thought, be in tuned with my feelings, be honest with myself and accept my dark side. I am more focused. I have also built more meaningful relationships. 

Church friends expire the day you leave the church whereas real friends will stick around. A much better investment. I am not perfect but it is ok. I don’t need to go to church to be a good person. I am actually a better person not going to church. I am more focused. 

Leaving Mormonism I also realized how actual little influence it has on my life and in the world. I realize I am lucky that my parents, my wife, kids have nothing to do with Mormonism anymore. We are all on the same page. In the grand scheme of things it is just 20 millions members at best. Probably half that. I work on internet application that have more monthly users than that. 

I recently thought about the church when it made the news about the new prophet. I saw another old American male being promoted to tell what people what to think (and make sure to pay their monthly fee and find more members).  

I don’t even identify myself as an ex-Mormon as it feels like it ties me to Mormonism in some way. I was a Mormon once as a kid and then moved on.
I am happier now. I hope my story helps you in some way."

**Blue Screen of Death Ads**

For quite some time--at least a year at this point, possibly longer--readers have been reporting major issues with the ads on Alison's site. Regardless of the device used, many are plagued with redirects and malware, and some users have reported actual device crashes as a result.

Alison went back and forth between insisting there was no issue and blaming the devices of those who posted comments about it and/or other sites they may have visited. As more and more readers raised the issue, she moved toward ""working with the ad company"" and offering advice such as clearing out your browser cache, using an ad blocker, using a specific browser, etc. More recently she began leaning on [this article](https://www.fastcompany.com/40516897/a-new-wave-of-bad-ads-is-hijacking-even-top-tier-websites) and saying, basically, ""A *lot* of top-tier sites are being affected by this issue!"" despite the fact that (a) AaM is not top-tier, and (b) almost every commenter insists that they don't have issues on any other sites.

A [major kerfluffle](http://www.askamanager.org/2018/01/should-i-stop-bringing-coffee-to-my-boyfriendcoworker-i-dont-want-to-show-up-for-my-last-day-of-work-and-more.html#comment-1827196) erupted in the comments section of a random 1/30/18 letter about the malware problem. Despite a preternaturally quick (and anonymous) reply from a user who insisted they had never had a problem, there was soon an avalanche of comments backing up the original commenter. Alison began ""remov[ing] comments that came in after that request [to move this to the open thread],"" except that critical comments which came in prior to the request were deleted and supportive comments were left up regardless of timestamp.

**Enabling a Sexual Harasser**

Prior to, and for the first few years of Alison starting her blog, she was Chief of Staff at the Marijuana Policy Project. It did not end well:

[*The Breast Massage Will Happen: Inside the Culture of Sexual Harassment at the Marijuana Policy Project*](https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/the-sexist/blog/13118659/the-breast-massage-will-happen-inside-the-culture-of-sexual-harassment-at-the-marijuana-policy-project), an article about Alison's handling of sexual harassment complaints against Rob Kampia, then executive director.

I can't ever seem to get on GOMI, but apparently [Alison made this comment on her own thread there ""explaining"" what had really happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drlhki1).

[My reaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/blogsnark/comments/7kktes/ask_a_manager_weekly_thread_1218_1222/drlj4hg) to that, since it just sounded *so* familiar.

Alison's [recent explanation](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/12/something-personal.html) of what happened at the Marijuana Policy Project, which (a) she admitted she posted because she was contacted by a reporter (most likely prompted by the recent spotlight on these problems due to \#metoo), and (b) differs quite a bit from her old explanation on GOMI. Comments were quickly locked.

**Glossary**

**[Chocolate Teapot Design](http://www.askamanager.org/2009/12/great-question-to-ask-your-interviewer.html)\*, Rice Sculptures, and All Things Llama:** I'm still working on finding the Ur examples, but basically generic jobs letter-writers, commenters, and Alison herself use as placeholders when they want to obfuscate the details of their actual jobs.

\*This is the earliest searchable instance of ""chocolate teapots,"" yet it's in a comment that says, *I would have been so tempted to try to ferret out if they were an AAM reader. Give them the side eye and oh so casually drop the phrase ""chocolate teapots"" into the conversation and see if they react.* Yet I went post by post through the eight months prior to this and found nothing. I really think these people just make shit up for lulz.

**Primo/Sly/Doris:** Husband, late father-in-law, and late mother-in-law (respectively) of regular commenter [the gold digger](http://diaryofagolddigger.blogspot.com/) and frequently referenced by same. Very frequently. As in, almost every letter sparks a memory about the dead in-laws which we then get to hear about in minute detail.

**""Oof"":** Alison's oft-used expression for a tricky situation.

**Misophonia:** [A condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misophonia) with no DSM classification or diagnostic criteria which creates in the patient an intense hatred of sound and those who make sound. Every third commenter appears to suffer from it.

**""Could we not [verb]? Thanks."":** Frequently used admonishment by backseat mods in the comments section.

***The Gift of Fear*** and ***The Sociopath Next Door:*** Two books which get recommended any time the situation described by a letter-writer involves fear, loathing, general discomfort, or the possibility of anyone involved being a big meanie.

**Attractive female in a male-dominated field:** Every third letter-writer, apparently. May coincide with being the youngest in the office.

**[Borderline Personality Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder/index.shtml):** ""Borderline personality disorder is a mental illness marked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image, and behavior. These symptoms often result in impulsive actions and problems in relationships."" All the villains in the letter-writers' and commenters' lives have this.

**Cultural differences:** Every workplace interpersonal issue, from constant sniffling to unwanted sexual advances, could possibly be explained by this, so tread carefully.

**Triggers:** Many commenters claim that everything, from being tapped on the shoulder, to ignored, to not invited to lunch with coworkers, triggers them. Most seem to think it means something other than it actually means.

**Toxic Job/Toxic Environment:** Every commenter has had one of these or is in one currently. Even though there is a [specific legal definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_workplace) for a toxic workplace, most of the commenters seem to equate ""toxic"" with ""anything that makes me feel less than happy.""

**Introvert:** Every commenter self-identifies as an introvert, but many seem to be conflating introversion with [hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori). They prefer email and eschew telephone and in-person communication, but [even email can get too stressful](http://www.askamanager.org/2018/01/i-delay-writing-back-to-people-and-then-never-do-it-can-i-fix-this.html). Then it's ""breathe into a paper bag"" o'clock.

**Things to remember:**

* [Ask a Manager bingo.](http://mfbc.us/m/vukbka) (Click ""New Card"" for more options).

* Don't ever, EVER tap one of these people on the shoulder. They'll lose their absolute shit and possibly spill hot tea on themselves.

* It is always tea. There are no other beverages. [This](http://www.askamanager.org/2009/07/things-i-like.html) might possibly be the origin. Or they just want to sound all Austentatious and shit and tea fits that.

* Said tea is frequently prone to a Danny Thomas [spit take](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake) in response to the regular commenters' dad jokes. The alarming frequency with which this occurs indicates that many readers perpetually hold a swallow of tea in readiness.

* Every AaM commenter is woke as all fuck and don't you forget it.

* Every commenter is either a stick-thin waif who needs to shop in the children's clothing section and [can't get half a sandwich down without throwing up](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/11/my-manager-wont-stop-talking-about-her-romantic-problems-not-eating-at-the-office-christmas-lunch-and-more.html) (letter #2), or they're a size 40W and can't find clothes at all. There doesn't appear to be anything in between.

* Ramona Flowers remembers each of her 837 past lives and has a relevant personal anecdote for every situation.

* Everyone is allergic to something. It could be dogs, it could be peanuts, it could be semen. And these aren't ""my head hurts"" or ""I'm sick to my stomach"" allergies; these are ""anaphylactic shock and instant death if someone so much as *mentions* peanuts"" allergies. You never know, so be careful when you pack your lunch. Someone might [steal it and get his HR fuckbuddy to threaten your job](http://www.askamanager.org/2016/07/a-coworker-stole-my-spicy-food-got-sick-and-is-blaming-me.html). But then again, [this awesome update](http://www.askamanager.org/2016/10/update-a-coworker-stole-my-spicy-food-got-sick-and-is-blaming-me.html) could happen to you! Or...not, since there's no way that happened. Never mind.

* These people can't just have an aversion to something or strongly dislike it. Everything they don't like is a full-blown bug-the-fuck-out-the-end-of-days-is-nigh phobia. [All phobias](http://www.askamanager.org/2014/06/employee-is-terrified-of-balloons-wife-is-hitchhiking-to-work-and-more.html) (letter #1) must [be accommodated](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/04/employee-wont-come-back-unless-her-coworker-is-fired-i-dont-want-to-work-in-the-office-sick-bay-and-more.html). Except [this guy](http://www.askamanager.org/2014/04/my-coworker-blew-up-over-a-photo-employee-keeps-bugging-me-to-interview-someone-and-more.html) (letter #4), because fuck him.

* Alison very frequently deletes comments that are critical of her or her regular commenters. At least two of us have personally had her accuse us of sockpuppeting just because we happened to agree with a critical comment. If you think the comments section sounds like an echo chamber, it's good to keep in mind that she does this. (And it's pretty hilarious considering [this post](http://www.askamanager.org/2009/04/burn-your-bridges-girl-digs-herself-in.html) from 2009 where she criticized another blogger with *Personally, I think deleting comments is off-limits, unless they're spam. If you're going to put ideas out there, deal with the response like a grown-up. Otherwise, why have a blog?*)

* In May 2017, Alison posted [A Decade of Ask a Manager](http://www.askamanager.org/2017/05/a-decade-of-ask-a-manager.html), and it links to some of the most-referenced letters."

i dunno if it bugs you as hard as it does for me that we have the timezones hardcoded into the language of the app.  
I have the client in english even it is not my mother tongue as the most of you probably will have.  
If i would set the language to german the time format would be european time and the zone would be MEZ instead of the complicated american system which changes from PST to PDT from time to time.  
Everytime we get a maintenance notification i have to use a time converter and have to solve riddles to get the time in my zone/format.  
Why i cant just set my timezone and format in the settings?!  
Would be so easy to code, just a few variables...  
Gumi, pls donate 1 hour (max if they dont let it do the intern lol) to a dev that he adds this option to the settings!  
  
TL;DR: Add an opotion to the settings menu to let users set their timezone/format independent of the language!"
7uaoi9,0,2018-01-31,M4f - Bangin' in 'Bama,Medium__Arousal,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7uaoi9/m4f_bangin_in_bama/,"*A great convergence of ignorance, poverty, and depravity -- or, 'how I had the time of my life in Alabama.'*

I dreaded my arrival from the moment of its conception, a little over 37 weeks ago.  I knew next to nothing about the place, somewhere south of Birmingham, of which I also had next to no knowledge.  I was aware only of the stereotypes.  The moronic drawl that is the sonic equivalent of drooling, the tendency towards obesity, and the dual love of God and sinning.

Those views blanketed the entirety of the south, with slight variations and additions.  For some reason I believed Georgia had less incest than Mississippi, that a Louisiana native was likelier more stupid than a Texan.  Of course no one was more inbred and less learned than my second cousin Sheila.  And why I had to spend six weeks visiting her and the lost (and best forgotten) branch of my mothers family down in good ol' 'Bama was beyond me.

Sheila was 22, a victim of rape (part of God's plan) -- one that went unreported (wrong to ruin a young mans life for one mistake) -- and a single mother.  These were the things that defined her for the past seven years.  I'd done my best to ignore her vague appeals for interaction in the form of Facebook status updates.  But then the private messages came.

Her words made my skin crawl.  They were cloying and I could hear her accent in them.  She was still 10 years old in my head, despite the pictures I'd seen, the hateful thoughts I'd seen her share so easily.  She was family still, no matter how distant, and I gave her my number and delayed every single proposal she made to catch up in person.

To my utter and complete astonishment, it was me who ended up making arrangements to visit her.  I was scrambling to find a job at the end of school and managed to snag an internship with a meagre stipend.  Six months of work in the deep south, in a small trailer where all work orders and billing were processed from branches across the country.  

I told her I'd be in Alabama, working only a dozen miles from her home, and that we would finally get to visit like she'd been begging for.  

I booked my flight and dreaded the dwindling moments until I would be stuck in a sweaty, bigoted, Jesus-praising pool of tepid shit.

7ubhv3,2,2018-01-31,I need help figuring some stuff out,Confused04849201848,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/7ubhv3/i_need_help_figuring_some_stuff_out/,"In the wake of all the #metoo and Larry Nassar stuff, I am starting to remember some things that happened with my ex boyfriend (25 M) that I (22 F) haven't thought about since before he broke up with me two and a half years ago. Him and I were together from when I was 17-19. When the #metoo stuff came out, I literally thought ""its so cool that these women are able to speak up, and I'm glad I don't have any stories like they do."" Two weeks ago I was watching the Larry Nassar trials and one of the victims was talking about the betrayal of trust and the pain that caused her. I thought instantly of my Ex. I wasn't really sure why at the time because I have been dating my current boyfriend (24 M) for two years now and he is amazing. I don't think about my ex.

I was driving to work last week and there was a discussion on the radio that I was listening to about the line between consent and coercion. There was a woman on talking about her partner pressuring her for sex. They were talking about whether it was sexual assault or not. It reminded me of something that happened with me and my ex in the 6 months before he broke up with me. You can skip over the next part if you don't want gross details.

After the first year we were dating he got on SSRIs. He was begging me to have sex without a condom because it was difficult (not impossible!) for him to cum with a condom on. He said it would feel better. I have really bad anxiety and I only felt secure having sex with a condom while I was on birth control. That way there was no way for me to get pregnant or get a disease. He kept pushing and pushing it even though I said no. I don't remember exactly what happened. I don't know why its so foggy for me. Maybe because I haven't thought about it. But one day he was in my room and was begging me. He started crying and said something along the lines of that he promised he would pull out but he just wanted to have a good sex experience. I was worried he would break up with me. So I agreed. When he entered me, I knew I had made a mistake. I laid there very still through the whole thing. I felt like I wasn't in myself. I started crying a little. He pulled out. I never told him to stop. I never said no after I agreed. I felt horrible. I showered and cried in the shower and he left. He called me after asking if I was upset. I told him I was and he started crying and saying what a horrible person he was and that he was going to break up with me because I deserved better and that he wanted to hurt himself over the guilt. I had to console him because I was worried he would do it.

Over the last 6 months of our relationship, we had sex without a condom a few more times. I always laid still and cried after. I would have horrible panic attacks the night before my period worried it wouldn't come. Any time I tried to tell him no or told him how anxious it made me, he would break down and say he was a horrible person. I just let it happen.

I stopped thinking about this when I got to work because I didn't really want to think about it.

I work as a social work intern for school. I actually help run groups of men who have committed violence against women and are court ordered to attend a program. I run groups with a licensed social worker- my supervisor. Yesterday in group we were talking about sexual coercion. As some of the men in the group were trying to understand what sexual coercion was through one of their worksheets, I was thinking about my ex. After group I had a supervision meeting and I was crying. My supervisor asked what was wrong and I told her all of this. She asked me some questions about it and asked if I would consider seeing a therapist. I told her I am already seeing one and would bring it up at my appointment later this week (which is true). I couldn't sleep last night because I was thinking of this.

I feel like I am in this weird in-between of ""what happened isn't ok"" and ""what happened is sexual assault."" I feel like what happened can't have been an assault because at the time I didn't think about it and was able to stay in the relationship. I recognized it was shitty when it happened, but it wasn't a huge deal and I never thought about it since. I feel like it isn't my right to call myself any sort of victim because I chose to stay in the relationship. I agreed to do it. I didn't say stop. Once we were doing it and I started crying and he asked if he should stop and I even said ""no."" I feel like this wasn't assault or even coercive. It was me not setting rigid enough boundaries. I don't know why I can't stop thinking about it when I agreed to it. I went into a rabbit hole on the internet and on reddit last night of reading all of these people saying that being pressured to have sex isn't rape or sexual assault or even coercion and how its an insult to victims to say it is. I don't know how to stop feeling like something so bad happened to me when it didn't. It's not like I was raped. It's not like I was abused. It's not like I was molested as a child.

I'm worried to tell anyone. Some of my female friends are survivors of actual rapes. I don't want to insult them by talking about this as an issue. I don't think any of my male friends would understand. I am worried people will think I am just looking for attention in the wake of all of this serious sexual assault stuff.

Just to be clear, I am not planning on making this public or ruining my ex's reputation or anything like that. I just want to untangle it in my head.

Am I just overreacting now because of the political climate? Am I just looking for a way to get attention? Is something else going on? Is what happened even that bad? IS it an assault?"

7ubq1h,3,2018-01-31,My OCD story,NotPerfect8,OCD,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/7ubq1h/my_ocd_story/,"Since childhood intrusive thoughts are part of my life. Violent thoughts, sexual thoughts, religion thoughts. Always thought was normal doing compulsions to get rid of the damn things.

Fast forward teenage years, my rituals increased and I was getting a ritual for everything. Counting, thinking another thing to get rid of the first thing. Always thought all this energy spending was normal. But when obsessing about past mistakes came, the suffering was huge. Now there was no ritual for me to make. Past mistakes are done, as a glass of milk can be spilled.

Despite all this mind storm, I succeed in getting accepted into a decent college. First year was a nightmare, now I had to deal with career obsessions. The increasing uncertainty that a normal life brings was frying my nerves. Added to this was an obsession about HIV because I fucked some girls without condons in freshman parties. I had a random panick attack one night and decided it was the time to see a professional.

After medication, I was able to continue my college life, have a girlfriend and work towards my career. Now I knew what was feeling normal. Focusing was easy. Forgetting mistakes or criticisms or any other stressor was easy. I could choose my battles.

In my senior year I had already forgot that I had any mental illness. My psychiatrist decided to cut in half the dosage of my medication. Due to final college year stressors (thesis, internships, job hunting), I had some tough times but nothing like the breakdowns I had before college.

I was able to finish my degree in time and still land a very coveted job in the financial services industry. After all this, my psychiatrist also thought I was cured and cut my medication. With all the new uncertainties of the business world, new obsessions and compulsions came around. About everything. I thought I was being fucked over by colleagues. I thought my boss was setting me up for failure. With all the office hours, there was little incentive for me to socialize, so I was in a new city, overworked, obsessed and anxious as fuck. After six months, my back hurt so much that I thought I had a bulging disc or some serious nerve damage. Couldn't sit for 30 mins without very debilitating sciatica pain.

Ended up accepting a less demanding job with health insurance to treat my back without asking my parents for help. Fast forward one year with obsessing about curing my back, spending thousands of dollars on private appointments, sports doctors, phisioterapists, chiropractors, nothing worked. All the MRI came clear: I theoretically had a perfect back.

Couldn't deal with this anymore, so I remembered my mental illness. I was not cured. I started to recognize the patterns in the thoughts. The obsessions never end. So I looked for another psychiatrist and started on medication again.

I am starting to feel normal. My back pain was GONE in a month. Fortunately, I am still young and maybe I can still recover from my early career mistakes.

Life is not going to get easy. I love my parents to death, but all their neuroticism around me and emotional withdrawal summed up with genetics helped build my fucked up neuron pathways. Children can feel stuff.

It was very hard typing these words and accepting that this very text is not going to be perfect. As I wish all my times were. But by wishing every fucking second that all should be perfect, life is going by my eyes. Memories are not being made. Wake the fuck up"

My friends basically know I have/have had/maystillhaveidfk an eating disorder. One of them is pretty obsessive about her weight and really hates herself about it, which yeah I can totally understand.

Is it wrong that I just... I just *don't* want to listen to her freaking out about weight loss? She may or may not be trying to rub it into my face, but she knows specifically that weight loss talk is triggering for me because I get instinctively competitive and insecure. 

I've been communicating and actively inviting her to the gym with me. She always says ""I'd love to!"" and then never follows up, or there's *always* something going on.

We've talked before about going to the gym, many times, since I figured it was the best way to fight my competitiveness--make it into a team effort, but I couldn't fucking deal this morning when she messaged me freaking out about ""losing 6lbs since school started"" but she's ""eating 1700 at 5 small meals a day"" and should she go to a doctor about it??

like what the fuck. I was straight with her and asked her ""Why are you doing this?"" and she just ignored the question. I didn't fucking know what to say. I just know that I need to go to the gym more often now, but I feel so sad about it. I feel so pressured, and it doesn't help that school and internship searching are pressuring me more than ever (so I don't go to the gym as often as I'd like, because I have to sit down and apply for things or do group projects etc.) 

idefk, I've been trying to ghost her because I'm starting to think she's not a very good friend and she started to sense it so she asked me about it last night... I told her it's nothing to really worry about. How do I tell someone with depression that there's only so much I can do before she needs to start wanting help herself?

For someone who never follows through with plans I suggest (or can never go to any plans she makes), and has a shitty habit of not responding to my messages for days and weeks now she's mad that I don't respond for a day? I didn't think anything of it, then she messages me at 1am this morning asking the randomest shit (about taxes and paychecks like wtf) and wouldn't really let me go even when I kept trying to tell her I have work at 8, and now this whole weight loss freakout?

she said ""I'm really happy I'm losing the weight this fast, but I don't know is this normal??"" and asked this question *three times* after I told her my answer each time. =/"

I originally wasn't very shy about telling people about my age because most are impressed that I completed my undergrad in a difficult medical science program in three years and immediately was accepted into this epi program. I'm the second youngest in my entire graduating cohort.    

However, I have recently started being rather reluctant to admit my age to people. I look a few years older than I actually am and can usually mask it, but some people aren't fooled. I feel that some professors look down on me because I am not yet published (no time with my focus on academics, though I'm probably going to have an assistantship this semester) or do not have enough ""experience"", despite a number of internships. Some of the other, older students speak to me in an extremely patronizing manner (I was straight up told it was ridiculous for ME to want a job with the federal government within the next few years) and some of the guys who I have been mildly interested in have shied away from me after learning my age (including my ex, who was very uncomfortable with the eight year age difference).    

I was originally very proud of where I am in life at my age but now I feel like I should have accomplished so much more just because the other, older students have done so much more just because they have been alive five to ten years longer. I feel like I'm being held back from gaining ""experience"" just because I'm younger and ""inexperienced"" (you need experience to get experience, of course! ugh). I'm so afraid I won't get the job or fellowship (and eventually PhD program) I want because my peers are older and have had time to do more things. It makes me feel insecure, even though I know it's ridiculous. "

7uc3um,1,2018-01-31,I'm [22M] considering how to rekindle love with an old crush [23F] that now lives far away.,lithium142,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7uc3um/im_22m_considering_how_to_rekindle_love_with_an/,"This girl and I met our senior year of highschool and connected very quickly.  lots of common interests, ect.  I was aware that she had a crush on me, but I was in a very serious relationship (3 years).  That summer, we hung out a couple times (grad parties and such).  I stayed at her house for a movie night, and her sister confronted me the next morning about whether we were going to start dating.  I was still with and very crazy about the same girl from before (who was perfectly okay with me being there btw.  I wasnt trying to cheat on her), and this startled me.  I had feelings for her, but I didnt want people to get that vibe, and I certainly didnt want to lead her on.  going forward, I put some distance between us, and after school started, we rarely spoke.  That was 4 years ago.  We went to lunch last summer before she moved to AZ, and I hadn't heard from her after that.


Now this is where things get weird.  The girl I was with from highschool, I was with for 7 years, right up until this past december.  She cheated on me, left me for one of my friends, ect. ect.  I'd rather not go into much detail there; I'm pretty well over that, if a bit emotionally scarred.  Anyway, we broke up between christmas and new years (great timing, i know lol), so I had a few days to talk with friends.  New years rolls around, I'm still depressed, but talked about it at length with people, so better.  I go to a family party, and towards the end of the night my cousin's girlfriend decides to put her best friend on facetime.  Well guess who that turns out to be!  No, not my ex.  It's the girl I hadnt spoken to since highschool.  Seeing and talking with her that night was like flipping a lightswitch.  I stopped being depressed, I had my confidence back, but there's also no getting around the fact that I was still an emotional train wreck.


Now, her sister had a pretty bad betrayal just months before, and she was the first to jump in and make sure I was okay.  Now, this is the same person that confronted me 4 years earlier.  So fast forward to new years, I decide to tell her about the night and ask about her sister.  She tells me her sister has some personal stuff going on, but that it probably wouldn't hurt to tell her.  So, we talked about everything.  I told her about the breakup, and how seeing her brought back all those emotions from years back.  She admitted to having a crush on me, but said there's a great distance between us, and that i need to take time to recover.  We talked a bit more, she told me i should come down to visit her in the spring.  We texted pretty regularly for a few days, but rereading them, those conversations were a tad awkward.  Once the holiday ended, It was a lot easier getting my mind into things other than relationships.


It's been about a month now, and we occasionally text or snap, pretty much always bs.  Her replies are pretty inconsistent, and not in a ""omg she's ignoring me"" kind of way.  it just confuses the hell out of me.  For example, Monday I sent her a snap of a dish we made in school (culinary student btw), she replies with ""oh, thats awesome!  how's your day going?""  I replied like 2 minutes later, and she still hasn't even opened it 3 days later.  Part of me thinks it's funny, and the rest of me is just confused.  When we do have decent conversation, it's always very light, amiable.  We're both total sci-fi nerds, so there's an endless supply of cheese thrown back and forth to each other.


Back on topic; My personal opinion is that I should not have told her about my feelings so soon; especially just after a breakup.  I dont see a way around the fact that it would throw some defenses up from her, and rightfully so.  plus the distance probably plays in her head too, but i'll get to that soon.  Now, there's no emotional need for me to pursue her anymore.  I'm generally a self-sufficient person, so after about the first week, I was pretty much fine.  I also know I have other dating options that would probably be a lot easier to pursue.  The thing is, I'm on here asking advice, and considering this, because i WANT to pursue a relationship with her.  She's got a lot of qualities that I just really love, and I know it wont be easy, but if it works out, I'm confident it will be worth the trouble.  As for the distance problem; she doesn't know this, but it's not a big issue.  I'm graduating this spring, and before she even left for AZ, I was looking into internships in the south.  My top two cities to shoot for have been New Orleans and Phoenix, so moving to AZ isn't even a big deal for me.  Thing is, how do i bring that up without sounding like a complete tool box?


So here's my thoughts.  our mutual friend (the one that facetimed her on new years) offered to help out.  She mentioned broaching the topic of her interest, and also the distance not being a big issue.  I think that would be the ideal way to go about it.  After that, I'll give her a few days to bring it up herself, maybe mention that im looking for internships.  If I do that and she doesn't say anything, I'm thinking it might be best to wait until I visit to really talk about it.


I'd really like to hear your opinions on my situation.  what would you do?  Is it possible i already blew it by texting her as an emotional blunderbuss?  Too soon to be considering things, still?  Do you think I'm asking the wrong questions?  Anything you want to contribute, I'll take into consideration.


TLDR: Crush and I super close in highschool.  dont date cuz im taken.  4 years later, my relationship comes to an abrupt close.  crush comes back into my life but now lives 1000 miles away.  distance np, I'm moving where i want this summer anyway.  Not sure how she feels about the situation, getting mixed signals.  How do I approach this with her?"
7uc4w9,1,2018-01-31,College student looking for advice on current savings plan and retirement [retirement] [planning],BlahBlahCleverName1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7uc4w9/college_student_looking_for_advice_on_current/,"Hi r/personalfinance I was looking for some opinions on my financial plans/future.

My background:
Currently 22 going to college, computer science major will graduate in 1 year. I live with my parents, but pay all my own bills. College is completely covered by financial aid and I even get a little surplus (I know I am very fortunate). I plan on moving out in about 1.5 to 2 years from now, since I will have a full - time job in my desired field. Luckily in my area there is a strong job market and starting programmers make about 45k - 65k. I plan on doing an internship this summer, and graduating after Fall 2018. Parents are terrible with their money, since they live above their means. Their bad example showed me how NOT to do things.

My financial Info:
I currently work part - time in foodservice making 18k a year. I have a paid off car and no debt of any kind. I have a checking account with a credit union that has around $500. I have 17k total savings, with 6k of that total in CDs. I am using [Barclay](https://www.banking.barclaysus.com) for both their high-yield savings and CDs.

The plan:
I structured the CDs into a ladder that is only halfway formed so far. Every 3 months I have been investing 3k, $600 each in 1year, 2year, 3year, 4year, and 5year. In August it will be fully funded and a $600 CD will mature every three months. I plan on having 1k in cash (minimum) to cover immediate needs and the 12k in CDs is my Emergency Fund. Barclay's penalty for CDs over 2 years is 180 days interest, that only amounts to about $7.26 (2.42%, for their 5 year), which I am fine with paying in an emergency event.

Retirement:
I read the wiki/sidebar and the next step for me was to open up a retirement account. Since my job doesn't offer any benefits, I figured I need to open a Roth IRA. I picked Vanguard as the holder, since I like the idea that the investors own the company. I was deciding on either the [2060](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=1691&amp;funds_disable_redirect=true) or the [2065](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=1791&amp;funds_disable_redirect=true) target date fund. I know the only difference is when they have fully matured (Me being 65 vs 70), but is there any thing else that would help me choose? Also I read in another post, in the event that the market tanks, that the fund will balance itself by buying more stocks, is this true? I would hope that the fund would buy low and sell high but I am not sure how that works. I plan in a week or so maxing out the 2017 contribution and then eventually 2018.

Basically I just wanted everyone's opinion and see if there is any recommendations. Thanks"

-

*It has taken me a few days and an ocean of tears to write this so be warned of typos, long paragraphs and lots of emotion ahead.*

-

So you would think at 23 I’d know everything that happened that eventually lead me to having my half sister, but apparently not. I recently learned that while my Dad blamed my Mom for him cheating, he took me along for the ride when he went to play house with his girlfriend! Please put your torches and pitchforks away llamas, nothing we do or say will fix the past.Maybe this is why I can’t remember anything past the age of 9 or 10? Anything I can remember is depressing. But I recently heard this from my Dad (and some painful days in therapy) so lets process this together. 

-

When my parents found out about being pregnant with me they were unmarried and lived in a okay-ish apartment in a not to okay-ish part of town. So they had a courthouse marriage and moved into a okay-ish house down the road from Dad’s parents, Grandma and Grandpa. The toilets couldn't flush if it had rained recently but who needs working toilets? Mom was still in college for an RN and working while Dad was working full/over time as the soda guy for local grocery stores. Once I was born Mom was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and she stopped exercising because I took up a lot of free time my Mom had. She began eating her feelings because Dad is one of those people who think depression is all in your head and that if you think hard enough it’ll go away. 

-

Imagine, if you will, my Mom: She moved three hours away from home to go to school, her family so far away with a new baby she didn’t know how to care for, her only help was her husband’s parents who were on their way from middle aged to elderly, her husband telling her her depression was all in her head, a baby who cried constantly when not sleeping and only sleeping during the day, she was going from Cheerleader-Pageant-Queen to Chubby-Depressed-Mother quickly and her school had her intern at the mental hospital where some very violent unstable people were kept. This was not the Happy Motherhood she thought she would have. So she took out her feelings on my Dad, who retaliated. I remember a lot of screaming when I was young, Mom would put headphones on me and play my only CD which had Pink’s “Family Portrait”. Ironic. 

-

So after a while of this Dad went to a class reunion and left with an old high school girlfriend in tow. Dad would stay the night at her house after tucking me into bed. I remember sometimes looking out my window as his tail lights disappeared into the night. I didn’t understand why my Dad was abandoning me and Mom each night. That hurt disappeared though when Dad would take some days off work to take me to the park and I’d get ice cream and candy all day, I even got to play in the dirt which I was not allowed to do ever. I’d do my own thing, but little did I know that Dad was meeting up with his girlfriend and having a nice picnic date while I had the time of my life. Dad bribed me with fast food to keep our days secret, and I did. As best as a 4 to 5 year old can anyways.

-

This continued for a long time, and I think Mom grew suspicious. Dad told Mom he was staying the night at the Grandparent’s house, so when he left Mom would sometimes check to see if his truck was there. Dad caught on and had his girlfriend pick him up from his parent’s house. Mom found it weird that Dad would pick me up from school when in previous years he never did, those were his picnic days. I never got a straight answer about why I was brought on these days, I guess she liked pretending we were a family having a nice day out or something. Mom and Dad’s screaming/arguing go worse. I memorized the words to “Family Portrait” and can still sing them now without the music. Then things got better. Mom’s best friend moved to town and helped with me, she looked just like Mom so I never knew if they switched places so Mom could sleep or study or just relax. I did not like new people so this worked on me perfectly. Mom and Dad stopped screaming at each other and there was peace, if only for a few years. 

-

Then one day while Mom was having one of her really good days she took me out with her while she did chores and bought us dinner, which was rare since Mom always made us dinner. She was meeting Dad at the restaurant for some reason and keep in mind I’m still a young, extremely hide-behind-her-parent-shy child. I smile and wave at people I know very well. And want to guess who was leaving as Mom and I walked in? Dad’s girlfriend. So little baby me remembering Dad telling me I always have to be nice to this woman Smiled And Waved At Her In Front Of My Parents. If we were outside I’m sure that storm clouds would have blocked out the sun and thunder would strike the ground around us. One thing I will never forget is Mom’s voice when she asked me who I was waving at. And Dad says the one thing he will never forget is my face in that moment. He says I turned around slowly, already shaking with tears in my eyes and all I did was look at my Dad for help. 

-

My parents argued openly in front of me after Mom juiced everything related to Dad’s girlfriend out of me. I wasn’t in trouble but I felt like this was all my fault, and honestly I think I had my first ever anxiety attack at the age of 7. My little heart was beating out of my chest as we all sat down to eat, I was shaky, felt hot and cold at the same time, and wondered if this is what bunnies felt before wolves got them. It was the calm before the storm, the food was in front of us but none of us ate. And then it happened. Dad stood up suddenly throwing the table and all the food and began screaming at Mom like I’ve never heard. My throat felt like it was closing and my hands were shaking so bad, I thought I was dying. My parents were completely different people right then. I couldn’t hear what they were saying all I could do was stare at my dinner mashed into the carpet by the tv which now had a big crack in it.

-

I looked up at my parents and it was like I was watching this happen on tv, like it wasn’t in that room. Everything was detached, like quiet, then I just remember sitting on the ground (we ate sitting on the ground like Grandma) next to the turned over table with the ruined dinner and broken plates and just this horrible noise. I didn’t know where this noise came from tl later when my throat was raw and my eyes were puffed up so much from crying they nearly closed. That horrible noise was me, it was the only thing I could do. After that I dont’t remember much, I know my parents took all of us to a therapist who had really nice dolls. I would see this same therapist when I was a teenager and threatened to kill myself. I miss her. 

-

I remember the next year Mom didn’t celebrate her birthday because Dad was gone. He was at my sister’s birth, which just happened to be the day before Mom’s birthday. I remember Dad coming home and showing me this pink squishy potato, saying I had a sister now. I told him I didn’t want her, he spanked me for saying that. I don’t like thinking about my childhood."

I was smart and motivated and ambitious. I loved going outside. I loved riding my bike. I loved going to the movies. I loved spending time with friends. I loved playing board games and card games. I was told I would go on to do great things, and I believed it.

I think it was middle school when things started changing. Like for most, that stage in life is tough to get through. I began experiencing emotions that I didn't know how to deal with. I had horrible friends. I had horrible teachers. But I got through it. I lost some motivation, but I was still told that I was smart and gifted. I was still told that I would go on to do great things, and I still believed it.

Looking back, I should have asked for help beginning in high school. My grades started dropping. I went from an all A student to getting a mix of As, Bs, and Cs. That should have been a warning, but I was still told that I was smart and gifted. By the end of high school, I managed to pick it up a bit and graduated with a 3.7 GPA. But this was the point where I started having more obvious emotional issues. I was quick to anger. I was quick to cry. I quit most of my hobbies. I was a bad friend. I had no life outside of doing homework, playing video games, and watching movies. But my grades were great once again, so no one, not even me, batted an eye.

I told myself that college would be different. It wasn't. I had no life outside of doing homework, studying, playing video games, and watching movies. But I did well in my classes, so no one, not even me, batted an eye. I rejected potentially good friendships. I spent most of my days in college in my room crying. My dog died. I didn't attend any job fairs because I was too afraid of being rejected. So senior year comes, and I am completely unprepared for a full-time job. I receive rejection after rejection for no experience internships. When I do receive an offer to do an interview, I decline as I am too afraid of rejection.

I graduate with good grades, but with no job. I move back into my parents' house and return to a part-time job I had worked at before. I am still told how smart I am. I am still told I will go on to do great things. I have no life outside of going to work, playing video games, and watching movies. I have lost all interest in things I used to love. I have applied for every job I can find. I get rejected for every job I can find. I don't feel like I can take the rejections anymore. I cry every single day. I've lost weight. I tell people that I can't find a job because I ""can't find the right fit for me"" because I'm ashamed of being a failure. So they still tell me I'm smart and I will go on to do great things. I can honestly say that I hate myself and the person I've become.

For the past ten years of my life, I have repeated the same pattern of being sad and not doing anything about it. I've finally decided that I'm going to see a doctor. It'll be just a general practitioner, but I've never asked for help like this before, so this is big for me. 

If you have any advice about going to see a doctor for depression, I'd love to hear it. I haven't even seen a doctor in almost seven years, and I'm nervous about what to say. 

Thanks if you read this whole thing."

7udn5t,22,2018-01-31,I landed myself a good job by lying [No Regrets],self-made-destiny,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/7udn5t/i_landed_myself_a_good_job_by_lying_no_regrets/,"I'm gonna tell you a few things about my life so you can understand why I did what I did. I was raised in a loving family where my parents never made me work and told me to focus on my studies instead.

 After graduating from high school (with average grades), my parents wanted me to become a computer engineer (which I had no interest in, at all!). So what happened next? A week into computer engineering program, I realized it wasn't what I wanted to do. I didn't even know what program I was interested in (I had some interest in business studies). 

It took me 4 months to convince my parents that I was in the wrong program and they finally allowed me to drop out. After I dropped out, I applied to a business management program which was going to start in 8 months. I told my parents I'll start looking for a job and work until my new semester begins. I didn't end up finding a job because I literally had no work experience. So I ended up playing video games until my college began (during this period, I felt absolutely useless for not being able to contribute any money to help my parents pay rent and other shit).

 Anyways, fast forwarding to last year (2017). I lied to my college that I got a 4 month internship (we were required to do a 4 month internship to graduate) and I got a friend to sign my internship papers and everything worked out perfectly! 

Anyhow, so I graduated and started applying for jobs. 2 weeks after graduating I got my first interview which I did well on (they didn't ask me about my previous work experience) and got the job despite having no work experience. It was a shitty desk job that gave minimum wage. I had to fill up forms for customers and shit like that and the customers were so rude like BITCH calm down this is my first day at my very first job ever! Anyways, I worked there for literally 2 days and quit the job via a text message. I was basically being paid to get insulted by rude ass customers (my parents understood my situation and let me quit). 

I went on a vacation with my parents the following week for a month and after returning I started applying for jobs again. This time the struggle was real. Out of 200 jobs that I applied to, only 2 of them called me in for an interview. Both of these jobs had different positions. ONE OF THEM HAD A REALLY GOOD PAY AND THE POSITION WAS WAYYYYY BETTER (lets call this job job2) than the other job (job1). Job1 offered minimum wage and a boring desk job. During the interview for job1, I did fairly okay and they said they'd let me know if I got selected in the first week of January of 2018. 

However, a day prior to my interview for job2, I literally sat down in my room and wrote down all the potential questions any employer asks an interviewee during an interview and I wrote down wise answers for all of them. Most of my answers had a lie in them. I also printed out some screenshots of a website that I had made during my last year of college as a part of a final project to look even more professional in front of the employer. I was sooooo prepared for this interview because I needed this job not only because of the pay but because of the position as well. 

Anyways, so I went to the interview and turns out it was the CEO that was going to interview me because the position was just sooooo fucking good. This didn't stop me from doing well on my interview. I made tons of bullshit up in front of him and spoke so confidently about having knowledge of software which I had no idea about. Before the interview finished, I saw a long ass list of people that were already interviewed and/or to be interviewed that week and I instantly knew I wasn't getting this job. Anyway's so the interview ended and the CEO said he'd let me know if I got selected in the second week of January (2018). 

So, I waited for January to come and I got no call from job1. It disappointed me because I knew I wasn't gonna get job2 so might as well just get happy with job1 that paid minimum wage. However, during the second week of January, I was sitting in McDonalds with my friend and I hear my phone ring. It was the person who interviewed me from job1, they gave me the good news. I started working at job1 the following day. 2nd day at job1 and my phone rang! I hardly ever get calls from people during the day so I had a feeling it would be my parents, it turned out to be job2!!!! JOB2 CALLED MEEEEEEEEEEEE AND GAVE ME THE BEST NEWS EVERRRRR!!! I HAD BEEN SELECTED FOR THE JOB I THOUGHT I'D NEVER GET !!!! 

Oh well, I went home happily and texted my boss at job1 telling him I was quitting. This was my second time quitting my second job on the 2nd day via a text message. Anyways, fast forwarding to today. 

Here I am, sitting in my own office at job2 writing this. I never imagined myself getting such a high paying job and the fact that I got selected out of so many other people makes me so proud even though I lied in the interview (NO REGRETS :)). I love this job because I hardly ever work. I finish 8 hours of work in 2 hours and have rest of the time to do whatever the fuck I want in my office. So guys! Do what you gotta do. At the end of the day, life is about surviving. 

And to those who have taken your precious time to read this whole post, I thank you from the very bottom of my heart.

TL;DR - Had no work experience and ended up getting a well paying job by lying very professionally at a job interview. "

What would you say are the most important things to cover/prioritize for this interview? "
7uef1q,1,2018-01-31,[M4F] Female Celebrities Wanted!,LordLeblanc,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/7uef1q/m4f_female_celebrities_wanted/,"I'm going for more of a niche, yet very powerful desire of mine that's been gnawing at the back of my mind: Celebrity roleplays! Currently, I'm only interested in playing alongside the celebrities, so any writers (even males playing female characters) who would be interested in playing any of these lovely ladies, please send me a PM. Do not post in here.

Before I post the list, here are some of my major kinks: https://www.f-list.net/c/vicodin/

As you can see, my kinks are pretty expansive, but it's easy to tell that when I'm playing a more dominant character, I like to be the dom, while playing more submissive female characters, I like the dom things to happen to me. For those who want a quick list: blowjobs, creampies, domination, sexual exhaustion, force, harems, outfits, high heels, and light footplay.

With that said, without further ado, here are the celebrities that I'd be very interested in playing against (In order of desirability).

Suzy Berhow: https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/gamegrumps/images/f/fd/Soozay.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161117165902

June Lapine: https://ageofshitlords.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/June-Lapine.png

Taylor Swift

Nicki Minaj

Emma Watson

Gal Gadot

Scarlet Johansson

Elizabeth Olsen

K-Pop Girls (Ask for further information, since I know not everyone is as deep into K-Pop as I am)

Also feel free to suggest some celebrities that would be fun to play with!

Here are a few ideas that I put together for some select girls in the list:

(Suzy Berhow, June Lapine, or Jessica Nigri): My character would be a newly enlisted intern or member of the staff behind their profession. For Nigri and Lapine, it would be a video editor. Perhaps for the sake of simplicity, our fellow celebrity could be under a network that allows office space to be given to all members. There are two ways to take the roleplay. Since Suzy and June both have boyfriends (at time of writing), it's possible that the intern could slowly move their way in on the fellow celebrity's relationship, either due to Suzy or June's lost of interest in their boyfriend, or the intern's movements and flirting with her. Another possible darker theme would be related to sexual assault, such as the intern bending Suzy, Nigri, or Lapine over a nearby desk while they're trying to record a video, and using that as blackmail for future acts. Or we can put together a different idea, feel free to add your own!

Actresses Prompt (Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Scarlet Johansson, Elizabeth Olson): Two possible prompts. One relies on blackmail, much like the previous prompt. Perhaps one of the actresses has their bodyguard bring their phone to a Geek Squad or phone repair company, only for the repairman to discover some nudes or private videos of hers. He fixes her phone, but downloads all of the videos and texts, using them to get the actress to meet up with him the next day. That day involves the actress cancelling all of her plans and being a toy for the stressed, minimum wage employee to use. Theme can go darker, such as manipulation and becoming her boyfriend, or it can simply be a one-shot.

Actresses Prompt #2 (Same actresses): A lucky winner enters a contest to spend an entire day with the celebrity, and in a shocking twist, the celebrity is all too happy to spread her legs for the winner. Maybe he's very genuine and nice during the dinner, or maybe he picks up some clues of hers that shows that she wants to be fucked and dominated by some nobody? We can decide.

And that's all I have for now! Please send me a PM if you are interested in discussing any of these ideas, or if you have an idea of your own! I'd love to hear from you, thank you."
