This is really long I guess, so sorry in advance.

I'm 29 years old. Female. Normal levels of attractiveness. Virgin.

I blossomed really early, or maybe I just ran into a lot of weird pedophiles, I don't know. I remember first noticing looks when I was about 10 from adults (a convenience store cashier and the men who worked on the racetrack backstretch [where my stepdad also worked]). As young as 12, the men on the backstretch would occasionally whistle at me if I was walking alone somewhere.

I was always really mortified, but I also wrote that off as me being too young for that kind of thing (I can't imagine any 12-year old girl being flattered about sexual attention from a 30+ year old dude).

When I was really young, like 8, I was visiting my biological father in Los Angeles. I remember getting into the passenger side of the car because we were going to a restaurant to meet some of his friends. I was wearing a long jean skirt that had snap buttons going all the way up the side. He kept reaching over from the driver's seat and opening the snap buttons up to my thigh, and I kept rebuttoning them, feeling anxious/upset/scared. I asked him why he kept doing that, and he stuck his tongue out of the corner of his mouth with a silly look and said, ""Because it's sexy!"" I remember this weird lump that formed in my belly when he said it and I just looked out the window for the rest of the ride, silent. I don't remember anything else like that happening with him, and as far as I remember the lunch was normal.

When I was 12 again, I snuck out of the house to go to the dollar store (my mom didn't let me go places by myself, especially a store that was a six-to-eight block walk away, but I went after school and before she came home from work) and a man with grey hair approached me, stuttering a lot, and asked me if I wanted to go get coffee. Horrified, I just shook my head in mute terror and he looked abashed and said, ""no, of course not, never mind!"" and fled the store. I figured maybe he thought I was older, but there's no way he mistook me for an adult. I was 12. I didn't sneak out for a long time after that because the dollar store was the only place to go and I was terrified of running into him.

When I was 14, I ran away from home because of a stupid fight I had with my mom. I wanted to teach her a lesson, and I had some really romantic notions about homelessness. I took the bus to downtown Seattle and just wandered around, and eventually a man started talking to me, complimenting my drawings. He said he would take care of me if I stuck with him. He led me to the woods and laid a tarp down on a big patch of ivy, because ivy was soft. Then he told me to lay down and he laid down next to me.

I was stiff and terrified, the nearest road felt like forever away. He rolled over towards me and kissed me on the mouth and said, ""Don't be afraid to warm me up."" He fell asleep pressed against me, his arm wrapped around me. I laid there for hours, wide awake.

I don't know what time it was when I finally got up. He snapped awake, disoriented and probably assuming that he was getting robbed, and I stammered out some lame excuse about wanting to go to the street so I could draw under the street light. He was too groggy to really process it and went back to sleep, and I went to the road and wandered until I found a payphone, and I called my mom (who had been losing her mind with horror since she came home and found my 'running away' note) and she came to get me. It was after midnight.

When I was 16, I got asked out. We went to the movies and he leaned over to kiss me and stuck his tongue all the way in my mouth. Disgusted, I had to physically push him off me several times, stating that I just wanted to watch the movie (which confused him) and nothing else. I didn't go on a second date, but he stalked me for a few weeks (calling me from his friends' phones when I didn't pick up for him, hanging around my work to watch me, following me home). He didn't get violent, but the experience left me cagey and untrusting.

After that, whenever someone would express interest in me, I would play dumb. I remember a guy who I thought of as very good looking (gushing with my friends about how HOT he was; a James Dean-like rebel without a cause punk guy who was pretty enough that I drew and painted him frequently). He dropped out of our high school but we crossed paths and he gave me his number and winked, telling me to call him if I wanted a good time.  I laughed and said, ""That sounds dirty.""

He looked at me like I was a moron and said, ""Yeah... it is."" I realized I was being hit on, and by a guy I'd crushed on for two years straight, a guy that me and all my friends thought was the hottest dude our stupid teenage brains could come up with.

And I laughed dumbly and pretended not to understand. I didn't give him my number back and I never called him. We ran into each other again a year later and the interaction was friendly and short; nothing more.

In college, I had to spend six months in New Orleans for an internship. I got drunk with two friends and one of them left me alone with the second friend, sensing some flirting between us. He got hit on by a gay man in the bar but managed to divert the stranger's attentions by telling him that he was trying to take me home, instead. We kissed to get the suspicious stranger off his case. It was my first consensual kiss in my life.

And it felt like nothing. Just weird rubbery lips against mine. Sometimes his tongue and my tongue, but it just felt like two tongues touching. There was no fireworks. No sparks. Nothing the books I'd read growing up said there'd be. No warmth. No draw. No electric current that shot down my body and curled my toes up. It was just two pairs of lips pushing against each other, and I was so fucking disappointed by how much like nothing it felt. 

I took him home because I knew it was the next step. When I got to where I was renting, I showed him the couch. I went to my room and shut the door in his confused face. I hesitated undressing because I was afraid he'd come in anyway. He knocked, so confused about why I was suddenly so cold, and I told him I was tired and just wanted to go to sleep. He kept trying to come in and I kept pushing him out and I locked the door. 

In his drunken state, he messed dumbly with the locked door a few times before realizing this was it and conking out on the couch. I was awake for hours, wondering why I felt so disgusted by the thought of doing anything with him. I didn't really want to take him home but I wanted to stop being a virgin. I wanted to have sex and see what it was like. Then, when it came right down to it, I panicked and shut it down.

Since then, I haven't dated. I feel lonely sometimes, but when someone hits on me, it's like something inside me shrivels up. If I like someone as a friend or even possibly as more, the second they indicate a sexual attraction towards me, the part of me that regards that person in a good light actually shuts down a little. I like them less, and then I hate myself.

I feel lonely but I can't stand the thought of dating and the presumption of sex that comes with it. Am I sex-averse because of something that happened to me, or am I asexual and always have been? Did I have such a bad reaction to all those seemingly minor occurrences because I've been asexual all along, or because I was a dumb kid, or what?

The more I research, the more confused I get. I want to be happy. I've never minded not ever having sex, and I don't feel an urge to lose my virginity with anyone, but I crave a closeness with someone that I don't really know how to get without putting sex on the table. 

I don't really know what I'm asking, I guess. Thanks if you read this far."

I just found out I got rejected from a study abroad program fellowship. I was so excited for this specific opportunity, I had a professor edit my two essays and another professor write a recommendation letter... I really tried to impress with my application but in the end I wasn't good enough.

One of my closest friends is going study abroad this summer for her specfic major, and I envy how she'll be able to live away from her family for a while while I'll have to stay in the city and try to find a job or internship in the city this summer.

I'm am starting to get frustrated living with my parents. It for multiple reasons but mostly that I'm not my best person with my family, they don't really promote the best in me because, I guess, my interests are kinda foreign to then.

But I can't afford an apartment, so I'm kinda relegated into staying home.

This study abroad opportunity was kinda my best bet in living alone for a few weeks (because it was all expenses paid) but now that's off the table.

I dunno. I'm graduating college this June but I feel so constricted into staying in the same place I've always been all my life. It's sad and frustrating..."
62pfhq,13,2017-03-31,What I have felt about college recruiting so far.,NotDoneContinue,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/62pfhq/what_i_have_felt_about_college_recruiting_so_far/,"Hi, I just wanted to share something to college students who are new to recruitment.

I'm going to write down some key important factor that I felt it was important to me getting interviews and everything. 

It's not going to be long. Just going to keep it short and answer some of the questions along. (Note that I'm from SoCal)

1. Keep your GRADES up.  
   I think this factor is more important than people might think. 
I've read a lot of posts in this reddit forum saying that they got in to Big4 with GPA lower than 3.0. Not really guys. Unless you have something presentable other than the GPA. Please keep the GPA higher than 3.6 if you want to get interviews from Big 4. 

2. Networking is always good.
   People say networking is really important. Yes and No personally. I've gotten a lot of interviews from the big firms without even having to meet the recruiters at a firm. Networking with professionals definitely helps your chances, but I didn't feel like its that big of a deal. HOWEVER, if you have a specific firm that you really want to get in(ex. PwC), make sure you network a lot with them.  

3. Apply Apply Apply Apply!
   This is most important thing I want to remind you guys. 
Always apply even though you might not even qualify for the job position. PLEASE apply to every position possible. Job experience is crucial in accounting world.
And.. don't be lazy, please fill that one page resume. If you didn't get any internships, grab any job possible that has to do with customer relationships.   

All right, I think that's it for now. If you have something to comment on feel free.  "

Chapter One: The Envelope/The Coffee

some brief NSFW language in this chapter. 

----------

Memories of the During would come back sometimes as if they were on an old VHS tape, left playing on fast-forward, or in a time lapse— the beats of the story still visible, discernible even at this high a speed, but the minutiae lost in the shuffle of the changing scenery —and Amanda would think about the drive from the office to the school, watch the ruffling leaves and feel the steering wheel in her hands. Sometimes the memories would come back like a stack of pictures, too bright and vivid to be real— when Amanda could breathe in and smell the blood-tinged air, hear the crunch of little shards of glass from the blown-out windows underneath her feet as she walked, when she could feel Tim’s weight against her as she struggled to hold him up before he sank to his knees in the parking lot just behind the caution tape, when she could feel the camera strap digging into her neck and the sinking in her gut as everything she’d ever learned about being a reporter left her brain—

Sometimes the memories wouldn’t come back at all. Sometimes she wouldn’t think about her life as a Before and a During and an After. Those were good days. 

She remembered the During in fragments, flashes of what she’d been able to reconstruct with notes and pictures and stories she had to write, and she remembered the After as the long waking nightmare, the slow-motion car wreck or hurricane or just a disgustingly human evil, that it was. 

Before— before it began and before she and Tim pulled up to the school in her beat-up Jetta, white-knuckled and shaking— she remembered the envelope, and she remembered the coffee. 

The envelope was small, yellow, the kind that would come with a grocery-store birthday card— she’d seen it in Lauren’s hand out of the corner of her eye as the woman crossed the office, before she’d even arrived at Amanda’s desk that morning. Without even looking away from her email, Amanda said “Absolutely not.” 

“But you haven’t even heard my pitch yet,” Lauren had said in response, tossing the envelope onto Amanda’s desk. It skittered across the desktop and settled next to her elbow. Amanda still didn’t move. 

“I specifically and repeatedly told you I didn’t want or need these tickets. Look, it’s… I really appreciate the effort you’re putting into this, for whatever reason.” She stopped typing and turned to face Lauren, picking up the envelope and holding it back out to her. “It’s not happening.” 

Lauren didn’t take the envelope back. She sighed instead, tucking a curl of dark hair behind her ear, and reached for the spare chair that Amanda kept next to her desk. The chair was usually occupied by a reporter hunting for a story, or whatever beleaguered intern had drawn the short straw that week and had to compile the police blotter, so that they could crank up the volume and listen to the police scanner that lived on the shelf above Amanda’s desk, in the little alcove that she generously called her “office.” It was still early, she remembered, though, not quite eight-thirty, and the rest of the news staff was still trickling in after oversleeping or supervising school drop-offs. 

“These tickets weren’t cheap,” Lauren said, once she had settled in the chair and Amanda had gone back to her email, putting the envelope back on the desk in front of Lauren. “And you’re getting them from me for free! It’s perfect.”  

Amanda couldn’t help but think about the one other time in her life she had been set up— during her sophomore year of college, when one of her roommates kept insisting that her ex and Amanda would be perfect for each other. Tyler’s hands had been clammy, she remembered, and his grip was limp. They’d had nothing to talk about besides the weather, and even though they had gone to the cheapest greasy spoon in their tiny college town and planned on going Dutch, he had dropped his wallet somewhere on the walk from her dorm into town and she’d ended up using the last of her paycheck from her info-desk job to pay for them both. 

The idea of a date with Tim, she knew, was a pleasant one. She tried very hard not to think about it that way.

“The only people,” Lauren continued, “who don’t realize you’re perfect for each other are you two. Face it—” she snapped her gum “—your life has become a bad sitcom. Accept it, and accept that the next logical step is an office romance.” 

Amanda squeezed the bridge of her nose. “One, I don't date coworkers, just as a personal rule for myself. Two, I really don’t want to be at the mercy of Shannon from HR because I broke some obscure non-fraternization rule. Three, I don’t even like him that much anyway—”

“Bullshit,” Lauren cut in at full volume, then covered her mouth dramatically, mockingly, at Amanda’s “not-in-the-office” glare. “You’d need a chainsaw to cut the sexual tension in this office.” 

“—and even if I did, four, I would never tell you because, lest we all forget, you are trying to hook me up with your brother.”

Lauren laughed out loud, throwing her head back. She was not the type to do anything halfway— not gestures (stubborn bruises dotted her arms and legs from constant flailing), not her writing assignments (she was technically a talented writer, but insisted on reproducing the entire court report in her column down to every eye movement and intake of breath), and certainly not gifts to encourage her coworker to start dating her twin. 

“You actually think I care about that?” Lauren asked. “I’m trying to set you two up, for Chrissake. Seriously.”

“Also, five, you have an article you should be working on.” 

“Seriously.” Lauren slid the envelope back toward Amanda. “I'll watch Avery that weekend and Timmy’s big dirty secret is that he’s a nut for classical music. You two’ll have fun.” 

“First-date things are— y’know. A bar. Lunch. Maybe a movie. Not dinner and the fucking Philharmonic. That’s… that’s like an anniversary thing. A special occasion.” *The kind of date that has to be perfect,* she thought, too much pressure for someone who hadn’t been on a real date in eighteen months. 

“You two are well past the coffee stage at this point.” Lauren suddenly looked up, and her face twisted into a sickly gleeful smile. “Ha! He’s carrying two coffees! I knew it!” She flailed her hand at Amanda, which must have been an approximation of “I-told-you-so” pointing. 

“Please leave before he gets too close and hears us.” Amanda exhaled loudly and rubbed her hand across her cheeks. She couldn’t help it. This— turning into a sixteen-year-old band geek with the football captain awkwardly flirting with her, instead of the thirty-one-year-old woman she actually was who thought herself above a schoolgirl’s crush —was par for the course when Tim came up in conversation. Even after four years of seeing him almost every day, eight months of sharing the alcove-office since she became co-editor of the news section of the newspaper, and alternating bringing each other coffee every morning, he could still set her off if the situation was just right. 

He had never gotten her (admittedly complicated) coffee order wrong in that time, was the most patient man she'd ever met, absolutely devoted to Avery— there were, by Amanda’s estimation, about ten million pictures of her taken at various points in the last thirteen years on his side of the alcove —which she thought was incredibly attractive, and, yes, okay, he had a jawline that could cut glass and the bluest eyes she had never seen in a human being. Every move that he made screamed “husband material” and their age difference— he was forty-two —was the only thing that gave her pause, but not even a big deal in the grand scheme of things. 

Ninety percent of the time, Amanda could function completely normally around him, as if he was just another coworker, another friend, just her officemate, and the playful smacking and beer-drinking and knee-bumping at their monthly dinner with a big group of work friends was just playful. The other ten percent— and fuck, Lauren was right. Her life had become a bad sitcom.

Tim was in their alcove-office by the time she snapped back into reality, smiling at her and murmuring a greeting. Lauren had disappeared, but Amanda noticed the yellow envelope was now tucked underneath her computer keyboard. Tim put the drink tray down on his desk and took off his computer bag, leaning it against the drawers under his desk in one fluid motion. Amanda’s face had probably returned to its normal color by now, but she could still feel her skin prickling, something wriggling around inside her stomach. She brushed a speck of dirt off of her skirt to distract herself and leaned back in her chair.

“Can you believe,” he was saying, holding out a cup to her, “that it’s almost seventy degrees at eight-forty? And sunny! In April!” 

“Global warming is real,” she replied and accepted the cup. Large iced coffee, two sugar packets balanced on the lid, a splash of French vanilla creamer to lighten it, ice only up to a certain point— God, he’s good, she thought with a grin. This was the summer coffee order that she hadn’t indulged in since the middle of September, when the temperatures started to drop off and stay that way. “Thank you.” 

He sunk down into the chair and shook his mouse to wake up the computer screen. “I couldn’t remember if it was two or three sugars, but—”

“It’s two. This is perfect.” She took a sip. “Thanks.” Behind her, the computer chirped, the sound it made when an email arrived. Amanda swiveled around in her chair.

----------

(When the memories would come back, Amanda couldn’t help but think of a chain of maybes. Maybe— no, definitely —she would have known earlier if the police scanner was working, and maybe she would have been able to do something, to do more than stand slack-jawed and shell-shocked, watching Tim keeled over on the pavement next to her. Maybe if Tim hadn’t gotten stuck at the red light at Blossom and Malone, maybe if he’d laid out his clothes the night before, maybe if Avery’s bus wasn’t two minutes late. Maybe he would’ve gotten to work forty-five seconds earlier, maybe she would have put the coffee down before the email came. Maybe if she would have turned the other way. Maybe if she hadn’t spun around so forcefully. Maybe if her hand was a little higher. Maybe the scanner would have kept on working, and the little voices would have told her before Jenna brought over her phone with Twitter open on the little screen.) 

----------

None of that happened. Instead, the bottom of the cup hit the lip of Amanda’s desk, and she lost her grip. Once it made contact with the cords sticking up from the power strip on the ground below, the cup exploded in a shower of ice and plastic and milky coffee. The strip was full— Amanda had her laptop and phone charger plugged into it, plus the master power cord for hers and Tim’s computers, plus the cord for the police scanner. 

“Shit!” she shouted, attracting the attention of a few people whose desks were close to hers, and Tim’s. She immediately knelt down and ripped the power strip out of the wall, then started unplugging the individual cords. 

Tim stood up immediately, stepped over, and crouched down beside her. The strip was empty now, dripping with light brown coffee. “I’m so sorry,” Amanda said, looking at him. “I’ll get some paper towels.”

“There’s gotta be a spare power strip somewhere. I’ll go check the utility closet?” 

“That’d be great,” she said, still cradling the power strip, spilled coffee running down her hands, at a loss of what to do with it. Her eyes darted around the room, and she ended up just setting it on her chair so she could make it to the bathroom and collect paper towels. 

The bathroom was just out the door of the newsroom and down the hall, and instead of taking a few handfuls of paper towels Amanda took the entire stack. The power strip was likely gone forever, she thought, but she can hope and pray that the cords could be salvaged, that they hadn’t been plugged into it long enough to have shorted out themselves. She picked one up— the cord to Tim’s computer —in one hand and a paper towel in the other, and started soaking up the little droplets of coffee that clung to it. 

She estimated that fifteen minutes passed before Jenna came up to her, phone in her little hand— Amanda had cleaned off three of the five cords, at least to the best of her ability, before she realized someone was standing over her.

Jenna was wispy and slight, with short auburn hair and brown eyes and very small hands— pretty in a plain-faced sort of way, someone people would not at but wouldn’t make heads turn, the kind of face that required a moment of thought from Amanda before she recognized the girl. She was an intern, a student at the community college a few towns over, and not in the main newsroom— she worked in the audio-visual department, lugging equipment around for the reporters who recorded zoning board meetings and shot B-roll footage for the local TV news. 

“Did you see this?” She held her phone out, and Amanda noticed that her hand was shaking, just a little bit. “I thought you should—”

Amanda took the phone and squinted down at the screen. Twitter was open. It was the county police department’s account, a single tweet in all caps filling the screen. BREAKING: CLAYTON COUNTY SCHOOLS ON LOCKDOWN - SHOTS FIRED AT CASEY CREEK MIDDLE SCHOOL - POLICE &amp; EMS EN ROUTE. 

“Are you okay?” It was Tim, holding a power strip in one hand. His voice sounded very, very far away. She looked up at him, mouth open slightly, blood thundering in her ears. She doesn’t remember very much after that— the tapes of her memories would, right at that instant, click over to the During. 

She blinked, and they were in a car. It was Amanda’s— the cheap, ancient black Jetta she’d driven her entire life, complete with a Raggedy Ann air freshener that she hadn’t changed in at least a year. There was a little tear in the seam on the steering wheel where her left palm sat as she drove. Tim was in the passenger seat— whole body shaking, his mouth moving but no words coming out, no words that Amanda could hear. She had one of the cameras— one of the good cameras, that the real photographers used, that she had no business using —around her neck with no memory of how it got there. One of the windows was down. There was a soft breeze.

She knew, logically, in her head, what must have happened. She and Tim, being the two most senior people in the newsroom, would have gone to scope it out. In the first minutes of a major crisis, the protocol was to delegate the entire newsroom out to focus on different aspects—in the first minutes, usually statements from the police, trying to find out what had, exactly, happened. There were probably a few more reporters, in their own cars, a few miles behind. 

They were supposed to simulate and do drills for this— a major storm, a mass-casualty attack —every few months. Amanda couldn’t remember the last time they’d had one. 

Amanda blinked again and they were there. There were frames missing in the tapes by then, and what was left was just the still images. The school in front of them. The ambulances— a loop of red, blue, and white lights flashing. The caution tape, strung up between lampposts in the parking lot. Amanda could see a strip of the sky, deep blue and cloudless, too perfect to be real, over the trees in the distance.

She saw them, standing next to the car, the caution tape a few feet in front of them. Amanda’s breath caught in her throat, and everything she had ever learned about journalism left her brain in one flash. Tim’s legs buckled, then gave out completely, as he dragged her to the ground with him. 

It took Amanda a long time to realize the screaming she heard was her own. "

I applied to a few dietetic internships for the Spring match this Sunday (yikes!) and was curious about the UCSF average GPA of acceptance for the DI? For most of the programs I have applied to, I have noticed that there is typically a GPA average of they tend to take (for instance a program might say you need a GPA greater then a 3.0 however on average accepted students tend to hold a GPA of a 3.5), however, I have yet to find anything on UCSF. UCSF is my finalized top choice, but as of now I am anxiously weighing my chances of being matched into this internship, and I was wondering if anyone was accepted into the internship or is familiar with the UCSF internship has an estimate on this? 

I am a recent dietetics grad with a 3.6 overall GPA, with extensive research experience as a paid research assistant in both clinical research and community nutrition. I was also a tutor in college for nutrition, biochemistry, organic chemistry &amp; physiology, as well as a volunteer for a RD at a local elementary school district, helping her with programs like breakfast in the classroom and the FFVP. I feel fairly confident in my research experience, however, I am slightly nervous about my GPA because although generally competitive.....it is UCSF after all. 

Any advise helps! "

62rngm,8,2017-04-01,Panera Legal Department Memo: Defamation Law and You.,Doctor_Peckhaz,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/62rngm/panera_legal_department_memo_defamation_law_and/,"Like the Frank Sinatra song goes 'Love and Marriage goes together like a panini press and threats of legal action from a tranny fucker'; that's why Panera legal has tasked me, their newest intern (a 3L law student) with giving all you artisans a general run down of defamation law.

&amp;nbsp;

As of late a certain pissy eyed fellator of boy clit has been ignorantly throwing threats of lawsuits around; so here is some information to help you out when crafting a fine joke. Keep in mind: this is not legal advice and I am not an attorney, this is just a general overview of what the law is in regards to defamation. 

&amp;nbsp;

**New York Times v. Sullivan (1964):** The Actual Malice Standard is established for public officials.

*In a defamation suit where the P (Plaintiff) is a public official, the P must prove that the statement was made with “Actual Malice” (knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not). 

&amp;nbsp;

**Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts (tsssss) (1967):**The court extended the actual malice requirement to PUBLIC FIGURES in additional to public officials.

*Thus meaning, if you (Defendant) say something about a radio personality that happens to have a face that looks like it is where the Kaiserschlacht took place (Plaintiff), the P must prove that you made that statement with 'Actual Malice'.

&amp;nbsp;

**Hustler Magazine v. Falwell (1988):**Jokes, satire, parodies, fictional accounts of a public figure or official are not defamatory unless something is made as, or contains, a statement of fact and was made with actual malice.


**Jokes/Parody/Satire: Generally speaking, an individual is not liable for a joke/parody/satire. The standard is whether a reasonable person would understand the joke/that it was a joke; if they wouldn’t, then the speaker might be liable.**

*Essentially what this comes down to, is whether a reasonable person would believe whatever you said to be  true; thus, the more fucked up or over the top you make something, the less likely you are to be liable, as it is less likely that a reasonable person would believe it to be true.

&amp;nbsp;


**'Libel Proof' [Partington v. Bugliosi]:** This occurs where an individual's reputation is so badly tarnished that nothing thrown his way can be considered defamatory, even if it is false and made with actual malice.

*In this case, the P was a Mobster and it was determined that his reputation was so shockingly bad that he couldn't sue for being depicted in a movie of having committed a murder he didn't commit, because his reputation couldn't be damaged any further. Rumor has it he was a raging alcoholic, racist, and woman beater, amongst 'other things'.

&amp;nbsp;

**Being Called 'Gay' is Not Per Se Defamatory:**Anthony is a faggot.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Dead Cannot Be Defamed:**Any defamation claim dies with the potential claimant; thus, neither his family nor his estate can bring such a claim in his place (however, there is potential for an Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress Claim from family; you don't really have much to worry about there though and they would likely lose).

*Joe Cumia Sr. was a serial public masturbator who routinely drank the spittle of children.

&amp;nbsp;

**When a person becomes a public figure:** There are generally two ways

1-Pervasive:Where a person attains “such pervasive fame” that they are public figures for ALL PURPOSES and in all contexts; or, as is more common,

2-Limited:People who are public figures with regard to a particular set of facts or circumstances; meaning they are public figures in relation to a LIMITED number of issues (Those particular facts or circumstances).

&amp;nbsp;

**Involvement in a Public Event:** In general, once a person becomes involved in a public event, even if involuntarily, they lose their right to have their identity and fate (what happened to them) kept confidential at least in regards to that particular event.



**Evidence of Opie's Stupidity:**Thus, by going on national radio and talking for hours about his wife's sex tape with with Bam Margera, Opie made his wife a Limited Public figure for the purposes of discussing her sexual relations and filmography with Bam margera; so discuss away, gentlemen.

&amp;nbsp;

**THE TRUTH IS THE ULTIMATE DEFENSE**: If some big titted dunce or sub-saharan ginzo does end up suing you, just remember that the Truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim.

&amp;nbsp;

**In Closing**: Peckaz."
62rzpl,17,2017-04-01,"Debunking: CipSoft's ""April's Fools""",Rodrigorazor,TibiaMMO,https://www.reddit.com/r/TibiaMMO/comments/62rzpl/debunking_cipsofts_aprils_fools/,"First, start [here](http://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=4009&amp;fbegind=2&amp;fbeginm=3&amp;fbeginy=2017&amp;fendd=1&amp;fendm=4&amp;fendy=2017&amp;flist=11111111) if you haven't seen their latest post on Tibia.com.

&amp;nbsp;

Now you might be thinking: ""Yeah, that's their April's fools. Nothing to debunk there."" 

Not so elementary, my dear Watson. It appears that fractions of that post seem to be true, while other are clearly April's Fools. Wait, is it **that** clear? Let's see:

&amp;nbsp;

    There has been some speculation on a certain website about our new intern CEO. He is rumoured to have been in charge for a few months now and for being responsible for all the improvements in Tibia during this time.
    We decided to look for this mysterious man and were able to catch him in-between meetings. He agreed to answer some questions.

Well, this might very well be an April's Fools joke on itself. We all (from this sub) know that there isn't such a thing as a ""new intern CEO"". It was basically a joke that started on a thread in this very subreddit back at when they announced some exciting changes to the game (such as BattlEye). Ah, of course: it also proves that Cip is between us, which is just amazing considering that our (yet) small group is being heard. *Cip, by the way: ignore that pool on ""which client people are using"", as some poorly-loved soul clearly manipulated the results. We don't have over 2k people here and I'm certain that 1300 of those wouldn't be playing on Tibia 10. Thanks.*

&amp;nbsp;

      What do you think about the technical integration of BattlEye so far?
    I think it's quite promising. There were no major issues after the technical integration.

This is probably true. I don't see why they would lie or make a joke about this. More like: ""Calm down, guys. Everything is fine and BattlEye will be kicking some botting asses very soon"".

&amp;nbsp;

      This has enabled us to start gathering and analysing the data that we need to ensure a smooth activation of BattlEye. Even though we still have a lot of data to analyse, you could say that I'm quite happy with the results so far.

Again, it seems reasonable to assume this is the truth. Very few people had problems with BattlEye and I would say that most of these problems have been or will be adressed already.

&amp;nbsp;

     We have received reports from players not being able to emulate the Tibia 11 client on their Mac operating systems anymore due to the integration of BattlEye.
           Oh, if that's the case, that’s definitely not cool! Thanks for mentioning it. 
    Let me think about it...
    Well, I haven't told anyone yet but I've been working on a private project because I play Tibia on my Mac as well [...]

This seems to be a prank, but it would be hard to tell. Could be just them giving a hint that a generic Mac client is on the way? About the ""new intern CEO"" playing on Mac himself, well... that just sounds like plain BS. So cruel if not true. Poor Mac players.

&amp;nbsp;

     and Adobe Flash is nearing the end of its days. 

This is true and has already been said on this subreddit several times, by several users. Flash Player will be gone. Not because Cip wants to ~~(well, maybe they do)~~, but because Adobe is about to finish Flash support for good.

&amp;nbsp;

     This project is not yet fully developed but I guess under the given circumstances we could start a public testing phase of my Mac client at the end of April. Yes, that's how we'll do it!

If this is part of the joke, it will be the meanest April's Fools joke since [Google's failed attempt to be funny in an April's Fools](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/01/google-disables-april-fools-joke-gmail-mic-drop).

&amp;nbsp;

     This is fantastic news! You said you play Tibia yourself, may we ask which game world type is your favourite one?
          That's a good question! In my opinion, every type has its very own pros and cons. Nevertheless, I consider myself more of a competitive player. I've played Retro Open PvP as well as Hardcore PvP and I loved the competition I experienced in wars against other guilds and players. Ha, good times! Some players produce really cool videos about these fights. Great content if you ask me.

Well, considering the whole ""new intern CEO"" is a character, this is still part of the joke.

&amp;nbsp;

     There's this one guy in particular who explained in a video why he thinks that Retro Hardcore PvP game worlds would make a great addition to Tibia. I really liked that one!
    The more I think about it... 
    I mean, his arguments are solid, I guess...

Wait, are they talking about Eric? Did he make such a video? Anyone has source? Is it someone else other than Eric that they are talking about here? Have I been fooled? NOTHING MAKES SENSE ANYMORE.

Edit: the video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0iy9jvA32Y). Thanks /u/Enzemo for the link!

&amp;nbsp;

     You know what? Let's give it a try! The summer update will be the perfect opportunity to launch Retro Hardcore PvP worlds. I'll talk to the rest of the team to set everything in motion and start planning right away.
    Thanks for your input! Unfortunately, I'm on a tight schedule today. You'll have to excuse me, I need to go now! Give my regards to all Tibians out there! Bye!

If Cip is listening to its community as of late, I don't have any reason to believe this is not true. Well, maybe the part about this server going live on the Summer update. If you asked me, I'd say this will happen, which is great (for people who like Retro and Hardcore PvP worlds).

&amp;nbsp;

Did I let anything escape? Please, share if you guys think something is worth of attention/doubt and explain why. I'll add it to the original post. Thanks! :)

**TL;DR It appears that fractions of CipSoft's April's Fools post seem to be true, while other are clearly just jokes.**"
62seld,669,2017-04-01,"[Story] ""Never tell me the odds.""",action_lawyer_comics,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/62seld/story_never_tell_me_the_odds/,"I just got myself into a really good internship and wanted to both share my happiness here and illustrate how the odds often aren’t nearly as bad as they seem.

I had already been through higher education once. I got a worthless 4-year degree, started working in restaurants, got tired of foodservice, tried a few things but the jobs I found were all pretty low-paying. I started to think of getting qualifications so I could get a better job. I looked at a few options, getting an apprenticeship, going to trade school, etc, when my wife emailed me an opportunity that sounded perfect. I’m keeping the details anonymous, but it was a paid internship plus they would pay for the first year of a two-year degree so I could get a well-paying job in an underserved field. The internship was already half again what I was making at my current job, and it was similar to the job I already have and enjoy.

Here's the part that worried me. They mention that they are specifically looking for candidates from underrepresented backgrounds and people who haven’t had as many opportunities for success. The only qualifications are a high school diploma or GED. And while my current job pays horribly, I do have a degree and my wife makes good money. I’m also white and in my mid thirties. So on paper, I felt like I wasn’t what they were looking for at all. And they would only take 40 people into Phase 2, which was a 12-week emotional intelligence class. After that, they only had 20 slots for the actual internship and scholarship. But while on paper, I wasn’t the ideal candidate, I knew that I was a great candidate for the final job, since I was already in the workforce for ten years, had a professional mindset, and already had a background in a similar field. So I applied, even though I knew it was a log shot.

There were over 400 people who applied for these 20 spots. By the time of the first aptitude test, we were down to less than 300. Not because a hundred plus people didn’t pass, but because they didn’t even show up for the test. Maybe those people had good reasons, maybe they just lost hope, or they got better jobs, or they didn’t check their email. But for whatever reason, my odds just got a whole lot better, and all I had to do was show up.

After that, the organizations involved made some decisions, and I made the cut to Phase 2. I got the call kinda late, so I think there were a few others who were placed higher than me, but they also declined or failed to respond, so I got bumped up again because other people dropped out. 

Once in Phase 2, all we had to do was go to a class once a week. No homework, no tests (well one test but we’ll get to that later), all we had to do was show up and participate every once in a while. Still, we went from 40 to 30 just from people dropping out of class. I want to make one thing clear. I don’t think that I’m better than those who didn’t stick it through. Making time to come to a class once a week for no pay can be a big barrier for a lot of people. I was friends with my classmates and I was sad to see some of them not advance. But at the same time, I was there to get the job, and if by sticking it through when others didn’t is what set me apart, then so be it.

We did have to take a college placement exam to make sure we could enroll in community college, and some people didn’t pass. However, the organization that hosted this program was eager to see everyone succeed, so we were given two chances to pass. In between, we were given access to tutors to help get our scores up. But a lot of people who didn’t pass the first time simply did not show up for the second test.  Who knows whether they would have passed or not. But I know two people who were very nervous about the test but still showed up. Both of them passed and are now in the program.

 In the end, the organizers didn’t have any tough decisions to make, because only 19 people showed up for the test and passed. So out of a starting pool of over 400 candidates, we ended up with 19 winners and one scholarship that may go unclaimed. And even though I wasn’t the ideal candidate because of reasons beyond my control, I got the position through the things that I can control, by showing up and trying my best. I applied for the scholarship less than six months ago and I'm already making more money in the internship than from my ""regular"" job. Once I get my degree, I'll have doubled my old earnings and have tons of chances for growth and promotion I wouldn't have otherwise.

It’s easy to lose hope when the odds seem so bad. And it can be scary to work on something without being 100% certain you will succeed. But the odds often aren’t as bad as they seem at first. And the willingness to show up and participate is a highly underestimated tool. So if you see your dream opportunity out there, reach for it. The odds might not be as bad as you think."
62ttk3,1,2017-04-01,26 [M4F] Billionaire + College Intern [Rough / BDSM],dirty-daniel,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/62ttk3/26_m4f_billionaire_college_intern_rough_bdsm/,"First off, the roles can be reversed if you're in a particularly dominant mood. Second, I ask that you list a few kinks in your introductory message so that we can better shape our scene together. 

**Scene as follows.**

My father started Black Diamond Enterprises, a defense contractor for the government, when he was in his early twenties. At first business was slow but quickly took off once he began landing bigger and bigger contracts for the military. He married my mother who turned out to be a trophy wife when they were both relatively young. They had their first and only son shortly after they wed. 

My parents traveled frequently for work and I spent most of my childhood raising myself. My father began teaching me about the business in my teenage years because he eventually wanted me to take his place one day. 

Growing up without much supervision naturally led me develop some serious sexual proclivities. Simple spanking and hair pulling soon turned into much, much more deviant activities. As time passed, there was nothing I wouldn't experiment with. Finding eager partners was never an issue either. Heir to a billion dollar fortune, obedient women would find me. 

Graduation day would change everything. My parents were both on their way to the ceremony when their plane suddenly crashed while landing. I was left without any family members but I was left a company to run. I would spend the next few years learning the ropes and building the company even larger than when I took the helm. 

Now, I'm 26 and looking for a new secretary. This wouldn't be any ordinary position, it would pay better than almost any job a college graduate would find elsewhere. I was looking for a true confidant. Someone I could really trust with my life. 

I figured the best way to do this would be through the internship program. Essentially using a trial-and-error strategy. I've had three interns over the past three semesters and none of them were hired full-time upon graduation. I was still looking for the right fit. 

Today I'm conducting interviews for next semester's college intern secretary. I'm sitting in my office which is located on the top floor of a downtown Manhattan skyscraper. The blinds are open and floor to ceiling windows overlook Central Park. I'm wearing a dark suit, white button up dress shirt and a grey tie. 

""Come on in"" I call out from behind my desk, awaiting the next interviewee. "

Your fingers are fumbling with my belt buckle as you cradle the phone against your shoulder. You've been on the phone this whole time and I honestly can't tell the difference between fact and fiction anymore. The past five minutes have consisted of one little white lie snowballing into a downright avalanche and a half-assed over-the-pants handjob. The slick fabric of the expensive dress slacks I'm wearing are doing most of the work for you while you convince your boyfriend that you're just working late tonight. Moments ago your perfectly painted lips were pressed to mine, your teeth finding purchase on my bottom lip. After a little tug you'd pull away and give me the dirtiest little grin. Unfortunately your cell phone rang and we had to backtrack to dry-fucking against the table in the conference room while you chatted so casually. It didn't seem like you were in any hurry. Deep down I think you got off on the thrill.

""My boss asked me to stay late again,"" another small lie. ""We're being audited and he promised I'd be at the top of the list when it came time to bring an intern on full-time.""

Your breath catches as you finish, my wandering hand has found it's way between your stocking-clad thighs. For now it's just drawing little circles on the tender flesh of your inner thighs but we're both eager for more. That devilish look  eyes tell me all I need to know.

""Joshua, you're being a pervert. He's almost ten years older than me.""

That's never been a problem for you before, I think you actually appreciate the age gap. I stand between your lightly parted legs, I can't help but wonder what surprise lies beneath this rather modest pencil skirt. On Fridays you usually don't even bother with panties but you'd recently discovered my infatuation with expensive lingerie and my willingness to lend out my AmEx Black card. Your boyfriend has probably never seen one, but I'm sure he's got other great qualities. Making bold, unfounded accusations should probably be left off that list though. I don't even need to hear his side of the conversation to know where his mind went next. Of course I'm trying to fuck my gorgeous intern.

""Where is this even coming from? You've never even met him."" Not entirely untrue. ""He's not even here tonight, okay? You think the COO works late on a *Friday*?""

We both start to grin, that's an easy sell, I'm usually out by two o'clock. My Porsche is parked in the executive garage under the building, he wouldn't see it even if he got suspicious and drove by. Each time this tangled web of lies grew, so did the swelling member barely concealed in my slacks. The fact that you would so eagerly lie to your boyfriend just for a little private time with me was a massive turn-on. 

""Oh, I just had dinner, babe.""

 As if to punctuate that last word your hand slid right down the front of my trousers and your fingers wrapped around my manhood with a little squeeze. 

""Thanks though, that's really thoughtful of you.""

The chump must have bought it because you had a renewed sense of desire and it seemed he was backpedaling. Nobody wants to be the jealous boyfriend. A few pumps along my length had my boxer-briefs straining to contain me. The front of my pants was starting to tent quite amusingly, almost touching that sensitive spot on your thigh where my finger had been dancing about only a moment ago. Your eyes meet mine and then head straight down to my lips, I don't need to speak, you can read them perfectly. 

*Say goodbye. It's my turn to have fun.*

62udjx,233,2017-04-01,SaR Part --,searchandrescuewoods,StairsintheWoods,https://www.reddit.com/r/StairsintheWoods/comments/62udjx/sar_part/,"This is my favorite time of year. It's not quite spring or winter. It's somewhere in between. It's too wet to camp, too dry to ski. People stay inside. I'm always grateful for that.

I’ve had a lot of people express concern about outdoor sports. It’s a fair question. Are we really safe out there? They want advice. How do they keep their loved ones safe? I tell them I don’t know. How do they avoid the stairs? I don’t know. I really don’t. It’s frustrating to have nothing to offer. If I knew how to keep everyone safe, I’d have solved, arguably, one of our biggest problems in this country. The only things I can stress are what anyone else does: don't go alone. Carry a GPS locator and phone. Be prepared for anything. 

There's no pattern for this kind of thing, at least not one that I can see. There's commonalities, sure, but everyone's experience is different. This winter was quiet, mostly, but sometimes we're so overwhelmed it's all we can do to tread water. These are some of the things I've dealt with in the past:

* A buddy of mine up at Crater Lake remembers the disappearance of a young man there about twenty years ago, never found. This past winter, he called me to ask for advice on a new, eerily similar case. Jack B., his wife, and two children were snowshoeing on a very, VERY well marked trail. He was in the lead, the wife was behind. That's what we know. The wife said he crested a small hill, she lost sight of him for less than a second, and in that time he fell off the face of the earth. His tracks ended in the middle of the trail. There was no where for that man to go. And yet, in a literal blink of an eye, he was gone. They've been searching for him again now that the snow pack is melting a bit but I'm sure they won't find him. That area is wrong. Something about the way the wind sounds. 

* About four years ago a new recruit came to our Park to do an internship with one of the senior Rangers. He was a really nice kid, his name was Darren, I think. He actually got really lucky, timing-wise. A lady had a diabetic crash and we had to help get her out of a tricky area. Darren was so hyped up about it, and he was one of those guys who you know is just gonna do great. He's friendly, he loves the job, he's everything you look for in a Ranger. But Darren had a problem with listening, because Darren was a very devout Catholic who believed that the Lord would save him from any danger. Darren didn't believe that what we'd seen was anything to be frightened of. The only parts of Darren that we found two years after he vanished during a routine trail-walk were a quarter-inch thick slice of his left thigh and the cap of his skull.  

* Very early on in my career, I used to have a thing with kids who vanished. It broke me up really bad. I was always the first guy to volunteer. I couldn't stand the thought of another kid growing up alone, with that kind of burden on them, that invisible second life. And I had a very good track record. I had this kind of sense that almost always lead me in the right direction. So I started getting called out to other parks to help in search and rescue groups. One of the ones I brought back was a little girl who was skiing up at a popular resort I was familiar with. I still remember her name, actually, it was Anna. Her dad, John H., was on ski patrol, I'd met him a few times, and he was absolutely wrecked by the whole thing. It was a familiar story: he'd been watching her ski down one of the easier slopes, following along behind. He lost sight of her for just a second and poof, she was gone. I happened to be in the area during that time, so of course I went to help him out. By that point she'd only been gone maybe half the day, so I was confident we'd be able to get her back by nightfall. We split up to cover more ground and I went into an area that I know is full of really large boulders and cliff faces. Sometimes you find kids in places like that. It was unbelievably eerie that day. The sky was totally overcast but smoke from a freak fire up north had turned everything a really strange orange color.  It was dead quiet, too, like the animals didn't know if they should be awake or asleep. Something about the light made the shadows look wrong, too, like they weren't in the right places. Probably a trick of the light but it was very disorienting. By pure luck, I found her tucked into a tiny little crevice at the foot of a big boulder. I got her out and it was almost like she'd been drugged. She was missing her shoes and coat but she was warm, almost hot to the touch. I got her back down to the lodge safe and they took her to be examined. There wasn't anything in her system, she hadn't been harmed. Oddly, though, she appeared to be suffering from severe dehydration. She'd lost almost three pounds. She'd only been gone a few hours; none of it made sense. It was so bizarre that everything basically got swept under the rug in favor of cheerful stories of her return. I reconnected with John a few weeks later to see how she was doing. The first night back, he said, she woke up shrieking in the middle of the night. He couldn't comfort her. She kept saying that she didn't want to go back to the orange place. He got her to sleep and by the next morning, not only did she have no memory of the dream, she had no memory of the event at all. He politely asked that I not call again, and I obliged. I do think about her a lot, though. I wonder if she remembers now.

* My boss woke me up in the middle of the night one summer and had me run out to a campground out at the edge of the park. He said a woman had called him absolutely frantic, insisting that there was some kind of large animal outside her tent. The cops were on their way but I'd get there faster. I grabbed my personal gun and headed out to see what was going on. She'd set up camp in a pretty isolated area, so I had to park the truck and walk a ways out to her. On the way there, this smell started to become first noticeable, then almost suffocating. It was something very... primal. Musky. And angry. It set my teeth on edge, and I had my gun ready. Nothing in the forest was moving, so whatever it was was predatory. We don't have bears up here, but that's not to say one couldn't have somehow wandered down from up north. As I got closer to her tent, I could see how badly this thing had torn up her camp. Her stove had been thrown up into the trees almost twenty feet. The fire had been stomped out, the coals scattered. One side of her tent was shoved in, and I could see the outline of her inside. I called out, and as I did something on the other side of the tent moved. I froze, gun cocked. In the weak light coming from her tent all I could make out was a huge bulky shape and two tiny white pinpoints where no head should have been. She started to come out of her tent and I told her to stop. The thing made a loud chuffing sound and suddenly seemed to dissolve and melt into the ground. I fired a round into the trees where it had been, but it was gone. I examined the ground and the only trace of it was slight singeing of the dirt. It's not the first time I've seen that thing, but it's the closest I've ever been, or ever want to be.

* I saw it the first time outside of my house, in the middle of summer. It was very late, and I couldn't sleep. I was thinking about a little boy who'd gone missing; we hadn't found anything except one of his Power Rangers shoes. I was at my back door, staring out over my backyard. I was exhausted, on the edge of passing out, but I felt guilty. I didn't deserve rest while that boy was out there. I was staring at nothing but when something moved at the edge of the lawn I noticed it and focused my eyes. It looked like a very tall deer. I watched it closely. It didn't move. I couldn't tell if it could see me. I bent down to grab my binoculars for a better look. When I looked up, it was pressed up against the glass. It covered over 100 feet in less than two seconds. It was all black, covered in disgusting, rotten-looking fur, and in the middle of its chest were two tiny white eyes. It was looking right at me. It wanted me to open the door. It wanted me to come closer. I broke away and ran to the bedroom and locked myself in the bathroom, where there are no windows. I heard it tapping on the glass until the sun came up.

That's all I can stand to think about right now. I'll update again soon."

Chapter One: The Envelope/The Coffee

----------

Memories of the During would come back sometimes as if they were on an old VHS tape, left playing on fast-forward, or in a time lapse— the beats of the story still visible, discernible even at this high a speed, but the minutiae lost in the shuffle of the changing scenery —and Amanda would think about the drive from the office to the school, watch the ruffling leaves and feel the steering wheel in her hands. Sometimes the memories would come back like a stack of pictures, too bright and vivid to be real— when Amanda could breathe in and smell the blood-tinged air, hear the crunch of little shards of glass from the blown-out windows underneath her feet as she walked, when she could feel Tim’s weight against her as she struggled to hold him up before he sank to his knees in the parking lot just behind the caution tape, when she could feel the camera strap digging into her neck and the sinking in her gut as everything she’d ever learned about being a reporter left her brain—

Sometimes the memories wouldn’t come back at all. Sometimes she wouldn’t think about her life as a Before and a During and an After. Those were good days. 

She remembered the During in fragments, flashes of what she’d been able to reconstruct with notes and pictures and stories she had to write, and she remembered the After as the long waking nightmare, the slow-motion car wreck or hurricane or just a disgustingly human evil, that it was. 

Before— before it began and before she and Tim pulled up to the school in her beat-up Jetta, white-knuckled and shaking— she remembered the envelope, and she remembered the coffee. 

The envelope was small, yellow, the kind that would come with a grocery-store birthday card— she’d seen it in Lauren’s hand out of the corner of her eye as the woman crossed the office, before she’d even arrived at Amanda’s desk that morning. Without even looking away from her email, Amanda said “Absolutely not.” 

“But you haven’t even heard my pitch yet,” Lauren had said in response, tossing the envelope onto Amanda’s desk. It skittered across the desktop and settled next to her elbow. Amanda still didn’t move. 

“I specifically and repeatedly told you I didn’t want or need these tickets. Look, it’s… I really appreciate the effort you’re putting into this, for whatever reason.” She stopped typing and turned to face Lauren, picking up the envelope and holding it back out to her. “It’s not happening.” 

Lauren didn’t take the envelope back. She sighed instead, tucking a curl of dark hair behind her ear, and reached for the spare chair that Amanda kept next to her desk. The chair was usually occupied by a reporter hunting for a story, or whatever beleaguered intern had drawn the short straw that week and had to compile the police blotter, so that they could crank up the volume and listen to the police scanner that lived on the shelf above Amanda’s desk, in the little alcove that she generously called her “office.” It was still early, she remembered, though, not quite eight-thirty, and the rest of the news staff was still trickling in after oversleeping or supervising school drop-offs. 

“These tickets weren’t cheap,” Lauren said, once she had settled in the chair and Amanda had gone back to her email, putting the envelope back on the desk in front of Lauren. “And you’re getting them from me for free! It’s perfect.”  

Amanda couldn’t help but think about the one other time in her life she had been set up— during her sophomore year of college, when one of her roommates kept insisting that her ex and Amanda would be perfect for each other. Tyler’s hands had been clammy, she remembered, and his grip was limp. They’d had nothing to talk about besides the weather, and even though they had gone to the cheapest greasy spoon in their tiny college town and planned on going Dutch, he had dropped his wallet somewhere on the walk from her dorm into town and she’d ended up using the last of her paycheck from her info-desk job to pay for them both. 

The idea of a date with Tim, she knew, was a pleasant one. She tried very hard not to think about it that way.

“The only people,” Lauren continued, “who don’t realize you’re perfect for each other are you two. Face it—” she snapped her gum “—your life has become a bad sitcom. Accept it, and accept that the next logical step is an office romance.” 

Amanda squeezed the bridge of her nose. “One, I don't date coworkers, just as a personal rule for myself. Two, I really don’t want to be at the mercy of Shannon from HR because I broke some obscure non-fraternization rule. Three, I don’t even like him that much anyway—”

“Bullshit,” Lauren cut in at full volume, then covered her mouth dramatically, mockingly, at Amanda’s “not-in-the-office” glare. “You’d need a chainsaw to cut the sexual tension in this office.” 

“—and even if I did, four, I would never tell you because, lest we all forget, you are trying to hook me up with your brother.”

Lauren laughed out loud, throwing her head back. She was not the type to do anything halfway— not gestures (stubborn bruises dotted her arms and legs from constant flailing), not her writing assignments (she was technically a talented writer, but insisted on reproducing the entire court report in her column down to every eye movement and intake of breath), and certainly not gifts to encourage her coworker to start dating her twin. 

“You actually think I care about that?” Lauren asked. “I’m trying to set you two up, for Chrissake. Seriously.”

“Also, five, you have an article you should be working on.” 

“Seriously.” Lauren slid the envelope back toward Amanda. “I'll watch Avery that weekend and Timmy’s big dirty secret is that he’s a nut for classical music. You two’ll have fun.” 

“First-date things are— y’know. A bar. Lunch. Maybe a movie. Not dinner and the fucking Philharmonic. That’s… that’s like an anniversary thing. A special occasion.” *The kind of date that has to be perfect,* she thought, too much pressure for someone who hadn’t been on a real date in eighteen months. 

“You two are well past the coffee stage at this point.” Lauren suddenly looked up, and her face twisted into a sickly gleeful smile. “Ha! He’s carrying two coffees! I knew it!” She flailed her hand at Amanda, which must have been an approximation of “I-told-you-so” pointing. 

“Please leave before he gets too close and hears us.” Amanda exhaled loudly and rubbed her hand across her cheeks. She couldn’t help it. This— turning into a sixteen-year-old band geek with the football captain awkwardly flirting with her, instead of the thirty-one-year-old woman she actually was who thought herself above a schoolgirl’s crush —was par for the course when Tim came up in conversation. Even after four years of seeing him almost every day, eight months of sharing the alcove-office since she became co-editor of the news section of the newspaper, and alternating bringing each other coffee every morning, he could still set her off if the situation was just right. 

He had never gotten her (admittedly complicated) coffee order wrong in that time, was the most patient man she'd ever met, absolutely devoted to Avery— there were, by Amanda’s estimation, about ten million pictures of her taken at various points in the last thirteen years on his side of the alcove —which she thought was incredibly attractive, and, yes, okay, he had a jawline that could cut glass and the bluest eyes she had never seen in a human being. Every move that he made screamed “husband material” and their age difference— he was forty-two —was the only thing that gave her pause, but not even a big deal in the grand scheme of things. 

Ninety percent of the time, Amanda could function completely normally around him, as if he was just another coworker, another friend, just her officemate, and the playful smacking and beer-drinking and knee-bumping at their monthly dinner with a big group of work friends was just playful. The other ten percent— and fuck, Lauren was right. Her life had become a bad sitcom.

Tim was in their alcove-office by the time she snapped back into reality, smiling at her and murmuring a greeting. Lauren had disappeared, but Amanda noticed the yellow envelope was now tucked underneath her computer keyboard. Tim put the drink tray down on his desk and took off his computer bag, leaning it against the drawers under his desk in one fluid motion. Amanda’s face had probably returned to its normal color by now, but she could still feel her skin prickling, something wriggling around inside her stomach. She brushed a speck of dirt off of her skirt to distract herself and leaned back in her chair.

“Can you believe,” he was saying, holding out a cup to her, “that it’s almost seventy degrees at eight-forty? And sunny! In April!” 

“Global warming is real,” she replied and accepted the cup. Large iced coffee, two sugar packets balanced on the lid, a splash of French vanilla creamer to lighten it, ice only up to a certain point— God, he’s good, she thought with a grin. This was the summer coffee order that she hadn’t indulged in since the middle of September, when the temperatures started to drop off and stay that way. “Thank you.” 

He sunk down into the chair and shook his mouse to wake up the computer screen. “I couldn’t remember if it was two or three sugars, but—”

“It’s two. This is perfect.” She took a sip. “Thanks.” Behind her, the computer chirped, the sound it made when an email arrived. Amanda swiveled around in her chair.

----------

(When the memories would come back, Amanda couldn’t help but think of a chain of maybes. Maybe— no, definitely —she would have known earlier if the police scanner was working, and maybe she would have been able to do something, to do more than stand slack-jawed and shell-shocked, watching Tim keeled over on the pavement next to her. Maybe if Tim hadn’t gotten stuck at the red light at Blossom and Malone, maybe if he’d laid out his clothes the night before, maybe if Avery’s bus wasn’t two minutes late. Maybe he would’ve gotten to work forty-five seconds earlier, maybe she would have put the coffee down before the email came. Maybe if she would have turned the other way. Maybe if she hadn’t spun around so forcefully. Maybe if her hand was a little higher. Maybe the scanner would have kept on working, and the little voices would have told her before Jenna brought over her phone with Twitter open on the little screen.) 

----------

None of that happened. Instead, the bottom of the cup hit the lip of Amanda’s desk, and she lost her grip. Once it made contact with the cords sticking up from the power strip on the ground below, the cup exploded in a shower of ice and plastic and milky coffee. The strip was full— Amanda had her laptop and phone charger plugged into it, plus the master power cord for hers and Tim’s computers, plus the cord for the police scanner. 

“Shit!” she shouted, attracting the attention of a few people whose desks were close to hers, and Tim’s. She immediately knelt down and ripped the power strip out of the wall, then started unplugging the individual cords. 

Tim stood up immediately, stepped over, and crouched down beside her. The strip was empty now, dripping with light brown coffee. “I’m so sorry,” Amanda said, looking at him. “I’ll get some paper towels.”

“There’s gotta be a spare power strip somewhere. I’ll go check the utility closet?” 

“That’d be great,” she said, still cradling the power strip, spilled coffee running down her hands, at a loss of what to do with it. Her eyes darted around the room, and she ended up just setting it on her chair so she could make it to the bathroom and collect paper towels. 

The bathroom was just out the door of the newsroom and down the hall, and instead of taking a few handfuls of paper towels Amanda took the entire stack. The power strip was likely gone forever, she thought, but she can hope and pray that the cords could be salvaged, that they hadn’t been plugged into it long enough to have shorted out themselves. She picked one up— the cord to Tim’s computer —in one hand and a paper towel in the other, and started soaking up the little droplets of coffee that clung to it. 

She estimated that fifteen minutes passed before Jenna came up to her, phone in her little hand— Amanda had cleaned off three of the five cords, at least to the best of her ability, before she realized someone was standing over her.

Jenna was wispy and slight, with short auburn hair and brown eyes and very small hands— pretty in a plain-faced sort of way, someone people would not at but wouldn’t make heads turn, the kind of face that required a moment of thought from Amanda before she recognized the girl. She was an intern, a student at the community college a few towns over, and not in the main newsroom— she worked in the audio-visual department, lugging equipment around for the reporters who recorded zoning board meetings and shot B-roll footage for the local TV news. 

“Did you see this?” She held her phone out, and Amanda noticed that her hand was shaking, just a little bit. “I thought you should—”

Amanda took the phone and squinted down at the screen. Twitter was open. It was the county police department’s account, a single tweet in all caps filling the screen. BREAKING: CLAYTON COUNTY SCHOOLS ON LOCKDOWN - SHOTS FIRED AT CASEY CREEK MIDDLE SCHOOL - POLICE &amp; EMS EN ROUTE. 

“Are you okay?” It was Tim, holding a power strip in one hand. His voice sounded very, very far away. She looked up at him, mouth open slightly, blood thundering in her ears. She doesn’t remember very much after that— the tapes of her memories would, right at that instant, click over to the During. 

She blinked, and they were in a car. It was Amanda’s— the cheap, ancient black Jetta she’d driven her entire life, complete with a Raggedy Ann air freshener that she hadn’t changed in at least a year. There was a little tear in the seam on the steering wheel where her left palm sat as she drove. Tim was in the passenger seat— whole body shaking, his mouth moving but no words coming out, no words that Amanda could hear. She had one of the cameras— one of the good cameras, that the real photographers used, that she had no business using —around her neck with no memory of how it got there. One of the windows was down. There was a soft breeze.

She knew, logically, in her head, what must have happened. She and Tim, being the two most senior people in the newsroom, would have gone to scope it out. In the first minutes of a major crisis, the protocol was to delegate the entire newsroom out to focus on different aspects—in the first minutes, usually statements from the police, trying to find out what had, exactly, happened. There were probably a few more reporters, in their own cars, a few miles behind. 

They were supposed to simulate and do drills for this— a major storm, a mass-casualty attack —every few months. Amanda couldn’t remember the last time they’d had one. 

Amanda blinked again and they were there. There were frames missing in the tapes by then, and what was left was just the still images. The school in front of them. The ambulances— a loop of red, blue, and white lights flashing. The caution tape, strung up between lampposts in the parking lot. Amanda could see a strip of the sky, deep blue and cloudless, too perfect to be real, over the trees in the distance.

She saw them, standing next to the car, the caution tape a few feet in front of them. Amanda’s breath caught in her throat, and everything she had ever learned about journalism left her brain in one flash. Tim’s legs buckled, then gave out completely, as he dragged her to the ground with him. 

It took Amanda a long time to realize the screaming she heard was her own. "

    &gt;I loved Elon so much, I had all the SpaceX hoodies and mission patches.
    &gt;I pray to Elon every night before bed, thanking him for the life I’ve been given.

    &gt;""Elon is love"" I say; “Elon is life”.

    &gt;My dad hears me and calls me a space bro.
    &gt;I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Elon.
    &gt;I called him a shill for the oil industry.
    &gt;He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep.
    &gt;I’m crying now, and my face hurts.
    &gt;I begin writing to ease the pain.

    &gt;”Dear Elon…
    &gt;From the moment I met you, all those years ago at Code Conference, not a day has gone by when I haven't
    thought of you. And now that I'm with you again... I'm in agony. The closer I get to you, the worse it 
    gets. The thought of not being with you- I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the Model 3 blueprints that you
    should never have given me. My heart is beating... hoping that will not become a scar. You are in my very
    soul, tormenting me...what can I do?- I will do anything you ask.”

    &gt;I go back to return to sleep, dreaming of a day when I will be taken away into another world.
    &gt;I lay in bed and it’s really cold.
    &gt;Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me.
    &gt;It’s Elon.
    &gt;I am so happy.
    &gt;He grabs me with his powerful engineer hands and whispers into my ear. His voice is warm and husly like 
    dark melted chocolate fudge caramel… or something.

    &gt;“My desires are … unconventional.”
    &gt;“So show me.”
    &gt;He drives his Boring Company deep into the underground.
    &gt;He launches his rocket up into the Hyperloop.
    &gt;He lets his advanced AI link with my neural systems.
    &gt;My very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba. I flush at the waywardness of my
    subconscious - she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.
    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

    &gt;He flies me away to his secret rocket facility.
    &gt;”Aren’t you hungry”, he asks.
    &gt;”No.” I didn’t feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full - of butterflies.
    &gt;”I would let you drive this Falcon 9 V1.2 Block IV Fullerer Thrust but friends don’t let friends drive 
    drunk.”
    &gt;”Drunk?”
    &gt;”You’re intoxicated by my very presence.”
    &gt;We arrive at SpaceX.
    &gt;We touch goodbye. His fingers were ice-cold, like he’d been holding them in a snowdrift before the 
    flight. But that wasn’t why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an 
    electric current had passed through us.
    &gt;He bids me goodbye and says we will meet again...when I am ready.

    &gt;Fast forward, the year is 2194.
    &gt;The smoldering remains of planet Earth are being ruled by Chancellor Trump XXVIII, victor of the Great
    Resource Wars. Meanwhile I am stationed on the Dagobah System, hunting down any criminals that exploit the
    environment and harvest its fossil fuels. After years of peace and prosperity, it has been rumored that a
    dark presence has re-appeared.
    &gt;I wake up in my cryo-chamber. As I slip into my SpaceX hoodie, I glance towards my robot companion. I load
    my REI credits into the 370N-XFEM-4000 and a frozen yogurt portion pops out.
    &gt;I give her a kiss good-bye.
    &gt;I put my Ray Bans on and head off to work. Outside the door, I pass a group of interns has returned 
    from their weekly trip to Space-Aspen. A tear rolls down my cheek as I fondly remember the Days of
    Learning. Away in the distance, I spot a group of liberal arts majors being led away. 
    &gt;Their fates lie in the sarlacc pits now.
    &gt;The central bell chimes. Everyone stops in their tracks and recites the morning pledge.
    &gt;”I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE,” we all chant in unison.

    &gt;I’m on my way to see the All Knowing One. He wants to speak with me privately. 
    &gt;I traverse the hill and arrive at the castle at the top.
    &gt;At the end of the Great Hall, the head of Jeff Bezos lies on a solitary pike. Below it, the God-Emperor 
    sits on his throne, made out of the un-reusable boosters of his vanquished enemies.
    &gt;Elon: “I have been watching your career with great interest, Michael.”
    &gt;He gets off his throne and pulls a curtain, showing an artifact behind him. I recognized it as one of the
    forbidden fossil fuel objects – a preserved Dodge Neon.
    &gt;A sense of shock envelops me. How could he be seen with this abomination? How could he go against the
    teachings?
    &gt;E: “I sense great fear in you. Do not be afraid of the Dark Side. It is a pathway to many abilities 
    some consider to be…unnatural.”
    &gt;Me: “You’re the oil sheikh we’ve been looking for! I have to inform the council at once.”
    &gt;E: “I do not fear the fossil fuels as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to 
    my new empire.”
    &gt;M: “YOUR new empire? My allegiance is to affordable electric vehicles. To developing a cost-effective 
    method of space exploration.”
    &gt;E: If you’re not with me, then you’re my enemy.”
    &gt;M: “You were the chosen one. It was said that you would destroy the oil companies, not join them!”
    &gt;At that point, I felt as though my limbs had been hacked away. My entire body and soul felt charred. How
    could this be? He had made affordable electric vehicles for the common consumer and a cost-effective energy
    solution that would solve all our problems and bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Was it all a ruse 
    to gain power and fame for himself?
    &gt;E: “Look into your heart, you know this to be true. Join me and we will rule together.”
    &gt;I knew. 

    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

    &gt;I lay in bed and it’s really cold.
    &gt;Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me.
    &gt;It’s Elon.
    &gt;I am so happy.
    &gt;He grabs me with his powerful engineer hands and whispers into my ear. His voice is warm and husly like 
    dark melted chocolate fudge caramel… or something.

    &gt;“My desires are … unconventional.”
    &gt;“So show me.”
    &gt;He drives his Boring Company deep into the underground.
    &gt;He launches his rocket up into the Hyperloop.
    &gt;He lets his advanced AI link with my neural systems.
    &gt;My very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba. I flush at the waywardness of my
    subconscious - she's doing her happy dance in a bright red hula skirt at the thought of being his.
    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

    &gt;He flies me away to his secret rocket facility.
    &gt;”Aren’t you hungry”, he asks.
    &gt;”No.” I didn’t feel like mentioning that my stomach was already full - of butterflies.
    &gt;”I would let you drive this Falcon 9 V1.2 Block IV Fullerer Thrust but friends don’t let friends drive 
    drunk.”
    &gt;”Drunk?”
    &gt;”You’re intoxicated by my very presence.”
    &gt;We arrive at SpaceX.
    &gt;We touch goodbye. His fingers were ice-cold, like he’d been holding them in a snowdrift before the 
    flight. But that wasn’t why I jerked my hand away so quickly. When he touched me, it stung my hand as if an 
    electric current had passed through us.
    &gt;He bids me goodbye and says we will meet again...when I am ready.

    &gt;Fast forward, the year is 2194.
    &gt;The smoldering remains of planet Earth are being ruled by Chancellor Trump XXVIII, victor of the Great
    Resource Wars. Meanwhile I am stationed on the Dagobah System, hunting down any criminals that exploit the
    environment and harvest its fossil fuels. After years of peace and prosperity, it has been rumored that a
    dark presence has re-appeared.
    &gt;I wake up in my cryo-chamber. As I slip into my SpaceX hoodie, I glance towards my robot companion. I load
    my REI credits into the 370N-XFEM-4000 and a frozen yogurt portion pops out.
    &gt;I give her a kiss good-bye.
    &gt;I put my Ray Bans on and head off to work. Outside the door, I pass a group of interns has returned 
    from their weekly trip to Space-Aspen. A tear rolls down my cheek as I fondly remember the Days of
    Learning. Away in the distance, I spot a group of liberal arts majors being led away. 
    &gt;Their fates lie in the sarlacc pits now.
    &gt;The central bell chimes. Everyone stops in their tracks and recites the morning pledge.
    &gt;”I FUCKING LOVE SCIENCE,” we all chant in unison.

    &gt;I’m on my way to see the All Knowing One. He wants to speak with me privately. 
    &gt;I traverse the hill and arrive at the castle at the top.
    &gt;At the end of the Great Hall, the head of Jeff Bezos lies on a solitary pike. Below it, the God-Emperor 
    sits on his throne, made out of the un-reusable boosters of his vanquished enemies.
    &gt;Elon: “I have been watching your career with great interest, Michael.”
    &gt;He gets off his throne and pulls a curtain, showing an artifact behind him. I recognized it as one of the
    forbidden fossil fuel objects – a preserved Dodge Neon.
    &gt;A sense of shock envelops me. How could he be seen with this abomination? How could he go against the
    teachings?
    &gt;E: “I sense great fear in you. Do not be afraid of the Dark Side. It is a pathway to many abilities 
    some consider to be…unnatural.”
    &gt;Me: “You’re the oil sheikh we’ve been looking for! I have to inform the council at once.”
    &gt;E: “I do not fear the fossil fuels as you do. I have brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to 
    my new empire.”
    &gt;M: “YOUR new empire? My allegiance is to affordable electric vehicles. To developing a cost-effective 
    method of space exploration.”
    &gt;E: If you’re not with me, then you’re my enemy.”
    &gt;M: “You were the chosen one. It was said that you would destroy the oil companies, not join them!”
    &gt;At that point, I felt as though my limbs had been hacked away. My entire body and soul felt charred. How
    could this be? He had made affordable electric vehicles for the common consumer and a cost-effective energy
    solution that would solve all our problems and bring peace and prosperity to all mankind. Was it all a ruse 
    to gain power and fame for himself?
    &gt;E: “Look into your heart, you know this to be true. Join me and we will rule together.”
    &gt;I knew. 

    &gt;Elon is love. Elon is life.

I am currently looking for car rental since I will be commuting everyday for my summer internship. I found USC Transportation has the partnership with Enterprise and there's actually an on-campus branch at PXE. I've checked the price by logging through the link on USC website (https://legacy.enterprise.com/car_rental/home.do), but I am not sure can USC students get extra discounts? 
Anyone has experience in renting cars from that Enterprise? What percentage discount can we get? Thanks a lot!!"
62w266,42,2017-04-01,"My Nmom knowingly crosses boundaries. When I get angry and ask her to stop, she laughs and gaslights. How should I handle this?",red-cloak,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/62w266/my_nmom_knowingly_crosses_boundaries_when_i_get/,"My Nmom and I have a rocky relationship; it wasn't until I discovered this subreddit that I was able to confidently say that she is a narcissist. 

I am in my late-20s and live at home, because I had a set back throughout my teens up until my mid-20s. I am working hard to get out of my current living situation: I earn my degree in May, I have an internship lined up in the summer, and I'm entering graduate school in the autumn.

My Nmom knows what it takes to get under my skin. She slams doors, talks loudly on the phone, turns the volume up when she's watching TV late at night which disrupts my ability to sleep, she antagonizes my brother and my father with incessant nagging, she hypes up the dog which causes her to bark, the list goes on. She is aware that all of this unnecessary behavior annoys me, because we have had countless talks about these issues.

I have politely asked her to stop doing these things because they are bothersome. Now, I just get angry because we have been over this **so** many times; she no longer has any excuse. I know she does it on purpose. When I confront her about it, it's always the same reaction: there's a smirk on her face and she claims she doesn't know what I'm talking about, or that she didn't do anything wrong. 

The most recent example is this: she turned the TV to Animal Planet at 2am, which my dog saw. She started barking, which woke me up, and I asked my mom why Sammy was barking. My mom started laughing and said that she didn't know. She saw that I was furious, because I had to be up at 6am (I'm taking six classes and work two jobs) and had a long day ahead. She kept saying, ""What? I didn't do anything!"" 

In extreme cases, whenever I frustratingly ask her to stop doing something that's disrespectful, either because I have to focus/study or sleep, she'll use my failures against me; e.g., ""Don't get angry at *me* because you don't have a girlfriend anymore!"" or something to this end.

I'm reaching out because I am miserable. I am always tired and it's hard to get work done at home. Some days, I just want to relax in my bed and not be disturbed by unnecessary drama. I need some days to myself to recharge my batteries; I am always busy and stressed out.

Is there a way to live in peace while under this roof? What can I do to make my life a little happier?

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to your replies. "

A friend and I have internships in Minneapolis this summer and are looking for a 2BR to stay in from about Mid-May to Mid-August. Our price range is about $1400 - 1900 total for rent. We were looking in the Downtown / Roseville areas as those are close to where we will be working. Thanks all!"
62w61l,21,2017-04-01,Tell me everything that is wrong (or isn't) with my plan to send $200 worth of dildos to an ex using his own debit card.,womanscorned0912,myevilplan,https://www.reddit.com/r/myevilplan/comments/62w61l/tell_me_everything_that_is_wrong_or_isnt_with_my/,"So I broke up with my ex about a month ago. We were together for two years and lived together, and I paid all the bills for six months while he was unemployed. He owes me about $600 at this point.

I moved to do a yearlong internship. He was super supportive and took over our lease and told me repeatedly that we'd move in together again when I came back, which meant I didn't have to relocate any of the furniture, all of which was mine. A week before I left, he changed his mind and told me he thought he'd like living alone better. At this point, I couldn't afford a moving truck, and my parents, who are keeping my car while I'm away, didn't have enough room for my mattress, couch, TV, kitchen stuff – basically, everything he'd need to have a cushy life in our old house.

He already has a new girlfriend who posts tons of photos of the two of them daily. I blocked her as soon as it started happening because who needs to see that, so she made sure to follow all of my friends, which seems pretty pointed. I've since removed him from every form of social media as well and have zero good feelings for him.

Which brings me back to the money. He swore he'd start paying me because he knows I need that $600 to support myself while I'm a shittily paid intern. I mistakenly believed he was still a good enough person to hold up that part of the deal. It's been a month, he's seen my reminders, and he still hasn't sent a penny. Obliviously never going to happen.

I just discovered that his debit card is still saved on my Amazon account, which he used to borrow to make Prime purchases. I can't ship myself anything useful because I'm abroad and don't want to pay customs, but I sure would like to send $200 (the amount he has in his checking account after payday) worth of nonrefundable dildos to our old house in his name using his money so that he can go fuck himself.

What could go wrong? How could this come back to bite me?"

It's my first fundraiser event (ever). The only thing I haven't been able to get in place are volunteers. I am in desperate need of a few volunteers to help at the raffle prize booth, craft table, or washing dogs if you choose. You will be provided a free lunch. It may be a fairly low-key event as I don't know how many people will for sure come.

Even if you're not able to volunteer, please come out to the event! I've got some awesome raffle prizes and the kids will be making balloon doggies. Message me or visit our FB page for more information: https://www.facebook.com/events/1932760276947653/

.....Please help me. 

Edit: Also the Humane Society is planning on bringing out their mobile adoption van. So if you don't have a dog you can come get one!

62xtct,4,2017-04-02,Confusion About Lost Love,Msmith68w,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/62xtct/confusion_about_lost_love/,"We met in the Fall of 2014. Two intellectual introverts, lonely and looking for love. Despite being senior undergrads on a campus with more than 40,000 students, we both felt isolated, misunderstood....alone, but in what seemed like an instant, we had each other. It was us against the world and we fell in love. Life was perfect, except for one thing....I wasn't sure. She seemed all in, and I played along, but a part of me didn't feel right.

We were perfect on paper. We got along great, she was so smart and beautiful, the sex was fantastic, but a part of me felt it. That feeling when you're making a mistake. That gut instinct that we so frequently ignore. It was nearly silent but ever present. 

We moved in together near her family. She an intern and I a graduate student, we lived low but stayed happy because we had each other. It still felt like us against the world, like I could take on anything with her in my corner. She was like a rock to me and I to her. Always reliable, always steady for 2 years, but then, seemingly as quickly as she came into my life, she was gone. Her gut was louder than mine and she couldn't keep ignoring it. She couldn't move forward towards a marriage with these feelings locked inside...so she left. 

I sit here now, nearly a year later, in a house forever stained by her essence, stuck in my head, wrestling with thoughts only too much bourbon can bring me to write. Still brought to tears at the thought of her with him. 

It was only a month. A month after the break that she found him. I don't know his name and couldn't pick him out of a crowd but I know he exists, the man now fucking the woman I love. But why do I love her? Why is the wound not healing? I had my own reservations. Why can't I seem to move on? Am I destined for this torture, the knowledge that my own reservations lost me the best woman I've ever known. Why wasn't I all in? What was I waiting for? I still love her but why do I still love her? Do I really love her or am I still just in love with what she represented? Attempting to answer these questions leads only to more questions. 

I find myself stuck in the middle, unable to move. Unable to pursue her, for fear that I will succeed, only to break her heart if my reservations still exist, yet incapable of moving on. The middle is lonely, but familiar. I've spent most of my life lonely. Watching other singles date and at least have semi-functional sex lives, and watching couples do all the wonderful things I used to be able to do with her. Now I have neither. 

I don't feel loved, but that's not my immediate problem. I don't feel desired...more important...I don't feel desirable. Intellectually this is ridiculous, outside of being a tad short (5'8""), I am reasonably handsome, in good shape, well dressed, and well spoken, but emotionally...I feel it. The decade of rejection by women I felt to be my equals or less who didn't even know the first thing about me. It has been so long since I've felt someone lust for me. She did...in the beginning. She was one of the few who ever showed it, even if only slightly. 

I feel different from others and I am acutely aware of the fact that that difference is what keeps me lonely. My experiences have aged me prematurely. I relate with people 15 years my senior, and not at all with those just 2 years my junior. Why can't I be young, dumb, and happy, instead of young, jaded, and lonely?  

I feel weary. This journey has been so long. The past year has been but a continuation of our regularly scheduled prime-time programming of isolation and misery. I don't know how much more I can weather. Another rejection, another woman who doesn't call back, another who flakes on a date, how much can I be expected to take? I just want someone to touch me, to show me that they want me, that I have value outside of my career and my ""inherent value as a human being"". I want to be someone's priority again, even if just for the night."

Chairs recognizes the chair on the committee for government action,
Councilor Flaherty.

This past monday march tweivet 27th, regarding the reduction of
plastic bags, the matter was assigned to the committee in 2016 and was
reintroduced january 11th of 2017. In attendance was carl specter and
susan casino director of recycling. Additionally we had experts in
both fields, environmental workforce, expressing their views on the
matter, including some of the topics discussed was how the retail
industry would be impact ed. How seniors would be impacted and how the
legislation would work here in Boston compared to how it's working in
other cities and towns. Defer to lead sponsor if he chooses to speak
but would like to keep this matter in committee until further
notice. Thank you madam president.

Thank you Councilor Flaherty. You are recognized to be heard.

I thought it was an important working session on monday and six or 7
of you participated on staff and virtually everyone was there. Council
president you have set the tone and having as robust and public a
process as possible, I want to thank my staff who has put many meeting
minutes up online after each meeting, we'll continue to do so. There
was particularly compelling testimony from an 11-year-old girl
representing the Dorchester girl scouts, ask that echo the call to
remain in committee and look at having a bill that we can vote and
hopefully pass unanimously on this body. Thank you.

Thank you Councilor O'Malley. Docket will remain on the committee for
government regulations.

Docket Number 0134 order for a hearing to review and discuss the fy18
Boston public schools' special education budget and identify solutions
to ensure equitable transitions of bps youth.

Chair recognizes the chair of the committee on education Councilor
Jackson.

Thank you so much, madam president. This is the fourth hearing of its
kind and I want to thank Councilor Pressley for her leern in this
space many Councilor Pressley was obviously present, Councilor
Essaibi-george and Councilor O'Malley was present for an informative
hearing. I want to turn it over to the lead sponsor so she can give
her indepth input on this matter. Thank you so much.

Thank you Councilor Jackson. Councilor Pressley you have the floor.

Thank you madam president I'll be actually pretty su singt today but
we will be producing a more complete committee report on this. As the
chair referenced this is fourth hearing that I've sponsored in this
space relative to ensuring equitable insurance that our students sever
services in this space, postsecondary into workforce and into self
sufficient independent lives. I have used this quote a lot, thanks to
the partnership and the advocacy of spedpac, mass advocates for
children, carolyn from spedpac, said inclusion is more than a seat at
the table, it is an experience. We're going to continue to be vigilant
to ensure it is a good experience for our students receiving special
education services. A couple of stats to share many 4115 transition
age stoournlts enrolled, 4115. The graduation rates for students with
disabilities have been steadily rising. Which is encouraging
news. However, the postsecondary enrollment for students with
disabilities has been relatively stagnant. We continue to be more
focused on these statistics and we have seen a rise in fiscal
investment and transition services. And so we just want to continue to
make sure that those dollars are being leveraged effectively to ensure
a more quibble transition. So moving in the right direction, again I
want to thank spedpac mass advocates for children and bps for being
intentional advocates in this space. We are a lot less defensive and
acknowledging where there have been deficits and where we need too
improve, and we've seen that happen, basedden the vendors and the new
contract of services of folks that are coming on board. We're
encouraged in the direction we're moving in and more work to be
done. When we've done that there will be a report.

Thank you, Councilor Pressley. Councilor Essaibi-george you have the
floor.

Thank you to the maker for holding this hearing. It's the second I've
participated in and for me it was a little bit of an anniversary sort
of hitting that hearing, was very important for me. I asked during the
hearing those that were on the panel, what was the model school in bps
that worked on transition the best. And the answer from carolyn from
spedpac is we don't have one. I think it's really important to
celebrate that we're recognizing as a district that we're not doing
this work, we don't have a model, that's why we brought in great
partners to help us with this work and that we're going to work
towards going-becoming a leading district. I want to say as much as
that was disappointing to hear it was positive that we recognize that,
as a district, and incredibly promising that we know that we weren't
able to do the work so we brought in the right partners to help us
with that. So I think contrary to what I say about bps, I'm excited
about sort of the future and this hearing continuing through the years
and to understand the progress, and to get to a point where we can
point to not just one program in bps but transitional services, but
that all of our transitional programs are doing them incredible and
they're the model and they're the schools that are visited from
outside districts. Thank you.

Thank you, Councilor Essaibi-george. Docket Number 0134 will remain on
the committee on education.

Docket Number 0199 order that the committee on healthy women, families
and communities will host a series of policy briefings related to key
topics in early education and childcare.

Chair recognizes the chair of the committee on health women's children
and neams. Councilor Pressley.

Thank you, and I want to thank again Councilor Wu for initiating,
coming up with the spirit of this idea. It's been wonderful to work
with all of my colleagues on this issue. I want to thank Councilor Wu,
Councilor Essaibi-george, Councilor Campbell for their input last
night. Last night was specifically focused on support for community
based providers of community support and care. Little over three hour
hearing, very informative and very compelling, we had a panel of four
amazing experts, ann douglas from the institute of early education and
notification, and sahari craft founding executive director of smart
from the start, and vital village network at Boston medical center and
I'm still honestly digesting the hearing because there was a lot of
information that came out of it but just the big things that I think
are important to reiterate here is there is no debate about what we
all want and that is for childcare to be accessible, to be affordable
and to be quality. And in order for this care to be quality, we have
to invest in this workforce. This is a workforce that is not been
invested in. It has not been professionally developed. It is not being
compensated according to the very important work that they are charged
with doing. They are charged wet welfare the well-being and the
welfare of our children and we know that that foundation is a
predictor and indicator for everything else, every mitigation of
aspects of and health outcomes it all starts right here. So one of the
things that came up throughout the hearing is we certainly do want to
commend the mayor for expanding prek, not only are we struggling to
meet the demand for early education and care to stabilize our families
to grow our workforce and our economy but we are at a deficit when it
comes to care for children zero to 3. Kids don't spontaneously come
spontaneously combustand end at age 4. There is a lot of talk about
need for data and suppose that the city of Boston be the clearinghouse
for this data because we know best how to leverage that data and where
to push for these types of investments. Just to share with you the
contrast and the disparities, early childhood care and providers are
making 21 to $27,000 annually. And our Boston public school district
those educators in contrast are starting at $40,000. These are people
that we are charging with the development of our children. So they
have got to be respected, we need to approach them and challenge this
deficit thinking and have an asset-based approach because they are
assets. Not only because the work that they do is critical, to
developing the best foundation and launching pad for our children, let
us not forget that they are small businesses. They are startups. They
are entrepreneurs, and so we need to treat them as such. So I'm very
excited and appreciative of the cooperation of all of my colleagues in
this space. And looking forward to making the investment in this
workforce, in this industry that we know will yield the greatest
return on investment. And that is more quality care or the our
children and a better future for all of us. So thank you. Fest.

Thank you, Councilor Pressley. Anyone else like to speak on that?
Docket 0199 will remain on the committee on healthy women families and
communities. Motions orders and resolutions.

Docket Number 0482. Councilor Jackson offered the following: order for
a hearing to address recovery service beds at the southampton street
shelter.

Councilor Jackson you have the floor.

Thank you so much, madam president. This is a very important topic and
issue and I just want to be clear that this is the loss of 40 beds and
the reason why it's the loss of 40 beds is yes the city is saying at a
they're repurposing these beds for emergency shelters. But the south
hampton sherl was the only dedicated recovery shelter that
accommodated hiv-positive patients. I think that's critical. We know
there are over 300 hiv-positive homeless residents in the city of
Boston. So those repurpose beds are for emergency shelters, which
means those folks are coming on a day by day by day basis and we know
that people do better in supportive services and we know that outcomes
are much better in supportive services. These are the most vulnerable
people in our city and we must do better. This body voted and approved
a budget, an operations budget last year that included a $15 million
infusion of dollars to the morgan avenue bridge, $15 million on a
bridge that could have came from a capital budget but came from the
operations budget. The administration knew for two years that these
funds were going to be cut. This should not have happened abruptly,
there is no surprise here, and what does this happen to the
individuals that are being supported here, it puts the most vulnerable
individuals in our city into flux. And so I think it's really critical
that we look at how we restore these services, listen to the
advocates, listen to the patients who are being served here. This is a
potential public health crisis, and it's something that we need to
roll our sleeves up and really think about. First long island, now
this. We dmolt allow the Boston public health commission to put us
into a situation where they're making decisions abruptly with the most
vulnerable individuals in the intoft. I look for an expedited hearing
and I look to hear the voices that are not being heard with the
communication that has come out. Thank you so much, madam president.

Thank you Councilor Jackson. Councilor Essaibi-george, you have the
floor.

Thank you madam president and thank you to the maker. Councilor
Jackson consistently speaks out on behalf of the city's most
vulnerable urging us to do better and do more. And that is certainly
what we need. Hoaxlessness is a tough and persistent foe, our state
and city governments have been battling it for decades. We know this
is a crisis for individuals and families and one thing we also agree
on is the permanent solution to homelessness is housing, shelters is
not the solution, they are a stopgap for people in crisis. What people
really need is permanent supportive housing. In recognition of this
fact the funding landscape has been changing. Hud is shifting its
sights to a rapid rehousing model that helps people stay stable in
their own homes. That's what we're doing in Boston. The safe harbor
program has used hud funds for 40 transitional beds for the last 25
years. In 2013 when the bridge to long island was deemed too dangerous
to use the program was relocated to southampton street shelter. The
Boston public health commission is currently creating individual plans
for each guest impacted by this change and is working to stabilize
each individual into permanent housing. Fest rapid rehousing is a
proven model that creates long term stability. Stability rather than
continued crisis. Fest we are working to move people experiencing
homelessness into their own homes. Many people for the first time in
many, many years. Just imagine what that would be like. I look forward
to continuing to work with my colleagues on the council and in the
field to help more people move into real homes and safe and supportive
environments. I hope that this be assigned to the committee I chair on
homelessness mental health and recovery. We hope to expedite a hearing
to support the continued work of rapid rehousing. Thank you.

Thank you Councilor Essaibi-george. Anyone else like to speak on this
docket? Docket 0482, will be assigned to the committee on homelessness
melt health and recovery. Could you add Councilor Essaibi-george to
the Docket 0482, please add Councilor Campbell, Councillor Mccarthy,
Councillor Ciommo, Councillor Zakim, Councilor O'Malley, please add
the chair's name, Councilor Baker. Okay and again Docket 0482 will be
assigned to the committee on homelessness mental health and recovery.

Docket Number 0483 councilors wu and pressley offered the following:
order for a hearing regarding the fenway cultural district.

Chair recognizes the lead sponsor Councilor Wu.

Mr. President, I'm going to defer to our colleagues who know this
particular issue best because she's been advocating for a long long
time. But essentially the outline of the hearing order is that the
fenway cultural district which has received tremendous success in
Boston really been a landmark and history-making district in so many
ways is up for renewal after their five years. So I'll defer to her
but before then I'd like to make a motion to suspend rule 12 and add
Councillor Zakim and Councilor Jackson as co-sponsors.

Are there any objections? Seeing no objection we'll add Councillor
Zakim and Councilor Jackson.

Thank you Mr. Vment.

Chair recognizes Councilor Pressley.

Thank you, council president wu and Councillor Zakim, I would also
like to thank, I'm sure he's watching former city Councillor Michael
ross, with Councilor Jackson and myself back in 2011, I don't know if
kelly was here, hopefully she is watching too, are from the fenway
alliance. I would like to express my thanks for the role she played in
getting this district created and ensuring the success of the
district. As Councilor Wu alluded to the Massachusetts cultural
council acquired the district, to be reauthorized five years after
they were first created. This affords us an opportunity to make a
quick look back and to celebrate the wonderful things that have
happened in this district over the last five years. I should also say
they were sort of the pioneers in Boston not in the commonwealth but
districts designatebut the fenway was the very first cultural district
designated for Boston. Now with the support of everyone, we have a
second one being created. Hope there will be many more to come. As far
as the fenway is concerned, based on the research brought together by
the fenway alliance, the fenway institution he bring more than 4
million visit oorgs to the fenway cultural district each year and they
employ over 20,000 people and they educate more than 60,000 students
and this cultural district has really been a catalyst for the city
being able to successfully preserve institutions sich as the
huntington theater slated to carlos last year, and public by design,
to highlight the district and artists abroad and at home. And last
year this public by design, they were able to partner the medicine
wheel, it was a public installation with an internationally known
artist from ireland, our very own michael doweling. Close to the
annualed the x fenway, wide range of topics, and this is only the tip
of the iceberg of what they've been able to accomplish in five years
and I look forward to learning even more and to seeing even more in
hope that we can support this reauthorization in the
affirmative. Again I think all of my colleagues for their partnership
this this endeavor and congratulations to the fenway cultural
district.

Thank you, Councilor Pressley. Chair recognizes Councillor Zakim.

Mr. Vice president I want to thank council president wu, Councilor
Pressley, and Councilor Jackson. Including this hearing order I just
want to echo the words of my good colleagues that this has been a huge
positive impact in the fenway neighborhood for residents for visitors
alike for people in Boston, outside of Boston, contribute to our
economy the vibrant culture and the thriving community we have here in
the city of Boston. I obviously hope we will move swiftly on this, for
the benefits of becoming a cultural district.

Chair recognizes Councilor Jackson.

Thank you so much, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to note the greatest part
of about this whole process is looking at the riches that we have in
the city of Boston, and so the coolest part about sitting through
these meetings is just looking and connecting with all of the people,
institutions and wealth and commonwealth that we have in the city of
Boston, and I want to give kudos on the literary district and I'm
really looking forward to the approval of a roxbury cultural district
also. And I would say to all of my trends on the council, and
particularly the district councilors it's an amazing process going
through this because it actually really does provide the connective
tissue, have everyone sit down and as Councilor Pressley brought up
earlier, thinking of assets rather than deficits. And connecting folks
and bringing people often the same page in the same room. So I really
look forward to having a third but also renewing this one. I believe
if I'm not mistaken this was the first.

Right.

So I think it's also notable that Boston again was first in -- when it
came to cultural districts in the whole state of Massachusetts. Thank
you so much Mr. President.

Thank you Councilor Jackson. Ill you please add Councilor Flaherty
madam clerk, also add Councilor Campbell, Councillor Ciommo, Councilor
Es essaibi-george, Councilor Lamattina, Councilor Linehan, Councillor
Mccarthy, Councilor O'Malley and add my name madam clerk. With that
Docket 0482 will be assigned to arts culture and special events.

Docket Number 0484 Councilor Wu offered the following: order that the
city council hold biannual urban renewal progress update hearings
until 2022.

This one is just a quick refile on behalf of the entire council,
following our urban renewal imream that we voted on with the bra and
as part of that agreement as you all know the council has six months
oversight meetings with the bra, this will be the second that
Councilor Linehan will host but because our dockets were cleared at
the end of last calendar year this is just a refile to get it back
into the system. Any comments or questions on that one? Great
disoblght 0484 will be assigned to the committee on planning and
development. I'm informed by the court there are no late filed matters
today to add. So we'll move to the green sheets. Would anyone like to
pull a matter from the green sheets? Councillor Ciommo you have the
floor.

received a unanimous second reading.

Thank you madam clerk, Docket Number 0388 has received a unanimous
second reading and has been passed. Any other takers for the green
sheets? Okay. We'll move on to any announcements or
statements. Councilor Jackson, you have the floor.

Thank you so much madam president consent to make a brief
statement. Unanimous consent. So I just wanted to note and I didn't
hit my button fast en enough. Rapid rehousing doesn't work for
individuals who are addicted because you must and need to take care of
that addiction. I believe prior. So I think it's really important that
we continue to have these supportive housing services that wrap around
in the city of Boston, so I think that should be one of the things
that we think about. And so we face many individuals who have been
placed in housing and then actually were tossed out of their housing
losing their voucher and not able to apply until several years
after. I think it's really critical that the city of Boston
knowledgeably and thoughtfully take care of this very vulnerable
population in particular with the only beds that help and serve
hiv-positive patients in the city of Boston. We know that there's only
40 beds here and we know there are over 300 individuals who have hiv
who are homeless in the city of Boston and that is our charge, to be
able to take care of those patients. Thank you madam president.

Thank you Councilor Jackson. Councilor Pressley for what purpose do
you rise?

Thank you madam president. One of the hardest things about this work
is that change in life is northwest of inevitable but that doesn't
make it easy. I would like to rise to celebrate the contributions of a
member of my a team, james southern lin. Lyn. Rooney I'm coming for
you, that he's -- but in all seriousness it has been incredible to see
to have him a part of our team and to see his growth and development,
james started with an intern with us at emanuel college and in seven
years time he has gone from being an intern to being a neighborhood
liaison, to being our liaison in all development issues, to our
research director, he originally was a student at emanuel and
recently, now has the title of dr. Southerlin having received his
ph.d. At northeastern university, daring that committee to say no. He
is decent and brilliant and we will miss him terribly. We are so proud
of him. And I got to say good luck to our softball team guys because
he was our pitcher and our ringer. I don't know where we go from
here. I want to say congratulations to bay village residents, lifetime
a team member dr. James southerlin and we will miss you, thank
you. [applause] ftc

Councilor Essaibi-george for what purpose do you rise?

I want to respond to Councilor Jackson's comments about rapid
rehousing. Most of my comments focused on rapid rehousing and for no
moment in time are we to misread rapid rehousing, it is to its core
what rapt rehousing what it's all about. Not only are we responding to
the needs of the homeless individuals but also their specific needs
and case. I look forward to an expedited hearing where we will talk
about this no doubt but it's incredibly important to note the answer
to homelessness is creating permanent homes. Not increasing -- well
increasing opportunities for emergency shelter no doubt but we have
too many individuals and too many families who have spent too many
nights in shelter. They need housing, and that's what we need to work
towards as a city, thank you.

Thank you, Councilor Essaibi-george. So I just -- I appreciate the
spillover of passion from the Docket Numbers but at this procedure I
want to remind you all that this time is not space for going back and
reviewing the various dockets. So both the order of the council but
also for confusion of viewers. So I did want to allows the second,
just because we already started down this path but Councilor Linehan
if you are pressing to talk about rapid rehousing I'm going to --

But they were both out of order and that is not the time and the place
for this and I appreciate the comments that you made. That you know,
this is a special moment in our agenda where you have an opportunity
to say something on behalf of the council that was not previously
discussed, nor a omatter on the docket, so thank you.

Thank you Mr. Former president for that reminder. Again my faults are
not pausing long enough on the previous docket and just a reminder in
the future. I will insert a requirement that is not related to any
other docket. Just a note I will send an e-mail out but we are still
making progress on the council accessibility project of lifting up the
floor so we will no longer need to create issues for folks with
mobility challenges. The next meeting is monday april 3rd right they
chamber at 11:30. You all are welcome, please come, we will be talking
about design and bid schedule which to my knowledge is still on
schedule to happen this summer. Please come and/or send a rep. Anyone
else? Okay great, at this time, oh apologize there are two late file
matters for the consent agenda which needs to adopted, chair moves
consent agenda adoption, all in favor, say aye, opposed, say
nay. Please rise. Today the council will adjourn the meeting in memory
of the following individuals, for Councilor Essaibi-george, hattie
mckay. For Councilor Lamattina, saccary joshua holmes. For Councilor

62zowb,1,2017-04-02,19 [M4A] Latina Celebrity Long term Roleplay - can anyone fulfil my craving?,tamrieltory,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/62zowb/19_m4a_latina_celebrity_long_term_roleplay_can/,"Good afternoon, everyone.

Today, I am searching for some long term roleplay surrounding my favourite group of celebrity women - Latinas!

I have a variety of women that I'd love for you to play, and a number of story ideas that they could fit the role of. I must stress that I prefer longer term roleplay, and can write as little or as much as you.

Without further adieu, my list of favourite Latina women:

- Penelope Cruz

- Salma Hayek

- Shakira

- Sofia Vergara

- Vanessa Hudgens

- Selena Gomez

I also have a variety of story ideas on offer. We could go with the standard romance for the bottom two ladies, or I could be an intern for one of the top four. As another alternative, with the top four ladies being a bit older, the age dynamic of a romance plotline would be really hot to me.

Alternatively, we could go back in time, and enjoy some medieval roleplay, with yourself as a Spanish Princess, or Queen, and myself as an English Prince arranged to marry you. Arranged marriage plotlines are always great fun, and with girls like these, it should be even better!

My absolute favourite idea - though it is admittedly niche - would be one in which we move between scenes with all the women, both romantic and not, as the English Prince enjoys all the delights of Spain. Perhaps Salma could be Queen, Vanessa could be the princess that he is arranged to marry, Selena, Sofia and Penelope could be maids at the castle and Shakira could be an escort that the prince enjoys especially?

My kinks include feet, dominant women, women in power, romance, public sex, and mild race play.

I hope to hear from you soon!"
6305s0,8,2017-04-02,"I feel stuck, can anyone offer advice?",AstronomicalPhenom,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/6305s0/i_feel_stuck_can_anyone_offer_advice/,"I'm 24 years old, going on 25, graduated with my bachelors in Civil Engineering spring 2016, I kind of squandered some time for the past year or so.  I passed my Civil FE, but have not received my certificate, I think all I have to do is send my transcripts in to the board, but I'm not sure, my board said I need to send 100$ with an endorsement form(which requires me to have a EIT in another state???). I don't want to send the money if I don't need to, it'll compromise my survival while i'm currently unemployed.  And now I don't know if I could even get it without having to retake the FE that I took approximately a year ago.

I received a misdemeanor in 2015, which made it near impossible for me to get an internship near the end of my curriculum.  Now it's more or less cleared up, went through a program and all charges are nolle prosequi.

My favorite routes in my Civil curriculum were in the routes of structural, water resources, and geotechnical, which geotechnical is by far my strongest suit.  I have worked in several programs, and am proficient with AutoCAD, Excel, Word, WaterCAD, Visual Analysis etc..  

It's just to this time now, I feel like my luck is running short.  I haven't had an interview in 1.5 years, I've applied to at least 100 job listings through indeed, and it doesn't seem to bring results.  I'm about at the point where i'm running a debt, and am at risk of not being able to live comfortably. 

I just don't know what to do anymore, and my mind is getting pretty rash.  I don't want to accept any other form of work at the time being, I just got out of the service industry and do not want to return, I can't handle it like I used to.  I feel like I'm about to spiral into a crash and want to do what I can to avoid it at all costs.

Can anyone offer any advice?"
630dcq,1,2017-04-02,Need some advice :(,Jdmc1710,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/630dcq/need_some_advice/,"I've been on and off with NoFap for a few years now. It has escalated to some pretty sick stuff that I am really ashamed off. Right now I am about to finish a Foundation Degree in Software Engineering with the plan to take the next two years off, (1 year to save up money and the next year to go to Australia) but I am not sure I want this for my life.

At the end of the year last year, I turned off my pc and only went on it two or three times for 4 months. During this time, I trained (boxing) and worked. I will not lie, I was the happiest I have been. With the need to be on the computer, I always end up going to porn. 

I am not fussed with the fact that it will take me 6 years to get a full degree (I am 20 so I will be 26 before I get it), however, I am fussed with the fact that I will be spending the rest of my career sitting on a pc. It is not just the porn that annoys me with this, as just the general fact of sitting infront of a screen seems to be a waste of life. I am decent at my course, especially when I put my mind to it, so it is not like I have learned nothing.

I guess it is a matter of wealth over health. I am currently doing an internship away from my home country so I have gained real experience the last two months, and it last for another two months. I do enjoy it but I am no where near as happy as I was with the time I spent away from my computer.

The advice I am looking is, should I stick to the plan of becomming a software engineer, or should I start to think of another career?

Next year, I will be taking a boxing course. This course gives you a small qualification that allows you to coach. I do not care about the qualification as the idea behind doing the course, was to be able to know how to look after myself while being a software engineer. During this time, I plan on not using my computer and focusing on my health. The next year, I will not have a computer as I will be doing the agriculture jobs such as picking fruit while in Australia.

I feel very lost at the minute. I am sure that people can relate to me. Although I probably could have worded this all better to make more sense.

Tldr: Should I stick with the career choice of software engineering, and always be around computers with easy access, or should I start thinking about another course."
630so8,4,2017-04-02,26 [M4F] Billionaire + College Intern [Rough / Dominant],dirty-daniel,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/630so8/26_m4f_billionaire_college_intern_rough_dominant/,"First off, the roles can be reversed if you're in a particularly dominant mood. Second, I ask that you list a few kinks in your introductory message so that we can better shape our scene together. 

**Scene as follows.**

My father started Black Diamond Enterprises, a defense contractor for the government, when he was in his early twenties. At first business was slow but quickly took off once he began landing bigger and bigger contracts for the military. He married my mother who turned out to be a trophy wife when they were both relatively young. They had their first and only son shortly after they wed. 

My parents traveled frequently for work and I spent most of my childhood raising myself. My father began teaching me about the business in my teenage years because he eventually wanted me to take his place one day. 

Growing up without much supervision naturally led me develop some serious sexual proclivities. Simple spanking and hair pulling soon turned into much, much more deviant activities. As time passed, there was nothing I wouldn't experiment with. Finding eager partners was never an issue either. Heir to a billion dollar fortune, obedient women would find me. 

Graduation day would change everything. My parents were both on their way to the ceremony when their plane suddenly crashed while landing. I was left without any family members but I was left a company to run. I would spend the next few years learning the ropes and building the company even larger than when I took the helm. 

Now, I'm 26 and looking for a new secretary. This wouldn't be any ordinary position, it would pay better than almost any job a college graduate would find elsewhere. I was looking for a true confidant. Someone I could really trust with my life. 

I figured the best way to do this would be through the internship program. Essentially using a trial-and-error strategy. I've had three interns over the past three semesters and none of them were hired full-time upon graduation. I was still looking for the right fit. 

Today I'm conducting interviews for next semester's college intern secretary. I'm sitting in my office which is located on the top floor of a downtown Manhattan skyscraper. The blinds are open and floor to ceiling windows overlook Central Park. I'm wearing a dark suit, white button up dress shirt and a grey tie. 

""Come on in"" I call out from behind my desk, awaiting the next interviewee. "
631emt,1,2017-04-02,"I [22M] like this girl [23F] who lives in a different state. We're both moving to CA this Summer, but I'm not sure if I should tell her how I feel before then.",crome66,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/631emt/i_22m_like_this_girl_23f_who_lives_in_a_different/,"Okay, so here's some background.
Last summer I was in LA for an internship and was in the middle of a long-term relationship. The relationship ended once I returned home, after some problems arose that had been festering for a while. 

While I was in LA, though, I met a girl that I really liked. I made no advances on her, and had 0 intentions of doing so while out there, because I was in a relationship at the time, but I couldn't deny that I had some sort of feelings for her.

After I got home and went through the break-up, I stayed in contact with the girl I had met in LA, and we now talk very frequently and Skype once a week, for up to 8 hours at a time.

We both plan on moving out to LA for our careers (we both just graduated with degrees in animation) this summer, and when I get out there, I plan on telling her how I feel about her.

I'm a bit nervous, though. Should I tell her now? I think she may like me (we've started up a collaboration for an animated series recently) but I'm not sure. This whole time I've been flirting but not saying anything direct because I feel like it would be awkward to do so on Skype. But my friends are telling me that if I don't tell her soon, she'll become disinterested in me.

I've been out of the dating scene for a while, so this is all new to me again, and I'm just very nervous. I've given myself time to heal and move past my ex from last year, so I think I'm just about ready to give dating a go again.

Also, disclaimer, I am not moving to LA for a girl. I'm going out there for my career, since that's where all the jobs are, and I really enjoyed being out there for my internship. It's just really convenient that she's moving out there too. I also have some friends moving out there as well.

TL;DR I like a girl who lives in a different state and we Skype every week for hours. We're both moving to LA this summer, but I don't know if I should tell her how I feel before then. Advice?"
63257s,2,2017-04-02,I want to be selfish for once...,throwawayforthenotok,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/63257s/i_want_to_be_selfish_for_once/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm using an alias...just in case...

So, I have a problem. I've had this problem for a long time now and it's the fact that my life is extremely polarised. I'll try to explain everything thoroughly, so it's going to be a long wall of text. I'll add a tl;dr at the bottom, but I'm not sure it'll get the proper message across.

When it comes to academic and professional achievements I believe that I have performed very well. I am about to finish high school with top grades. I have offers from several top-ranked Universities abroad and I'll be studying Computer Science a year from now. I have several years of experience as an intern at a Software Development firm and, as far as I can tell, my boss is very happy with my performance. I have placed well at several national algorithm programming contests. I feel absolutely competent in most academic and professional work I do and when working in a team I tend to outdo my peers by a lot. This is pretty much what my parents raised me up to be. Also, I do believe that I'm fairly healthy - I make sure to bike around at least an hour a day, shower often, almost never eat junk food and get plenty of sleep. I'm fairly skinny and physically feel fine. But with all those good things there needs to be compensation.

And that compensation is my social life. Over the entirety of high school I was known as the ultimate computer nerd. A guy who spends 95% of his free time on his computer writing code, playing video games, watching movies and anime, etc. I also feel that I was the least attractive among my peers. As a result, I didn't get bullied per se, but I got humiliated and mocked a lot throughout high school. I didn't care at the time and thought that they would never get to me.

But a house is built brick by brick and thus I eventually developed a complex. Seven years later(high school here starts early) I have absolutely zero self-confidence in my appearance, my actions towards others, etc. I feel like I'm the lowliest scum of the Earth and that any time someone wastes on me I have to pay back tenfold. I have also ruined my posture from all the computer usage. The saddest part is that those same people that gave me these problems also always asked me for help...and I complied. If you look at it from a practical side, I shouldn't have helped them, but I've learned to cherish those moments since those were the only real social interactions I had because that's when I felt useful. And, at the same time, I felt so betrayed when they joined their group later and mocked me again.

This lack of self-confidence and social interactions got to me deeper, though. Right now it's really difficult to hold a normal conversation with me. For example, when I talk about something I know a lot about, I speak about two times as loud as when I speak something I don't know. Or my ""uhm, achtually"", never being wrong attitude. I could probably count 10s of these ""defects"", but I do them all completely subconsciously. I feel like I either annoy the other person or make the entire discussion awkward. That's why I've resorted to mostly using email and chat at work.

As a result of these things I never even got to ask a girl out. ""Why would my crush ever like me? I'm awful at boyish things like sports and cars and crap, we have no common interests and I'm ugly as heck. I'll just bother her or she could tell me on the others and I'd get mocked even more. And even then, I don't have the time. I need to practice X for the next competition. As long as I win, I will have a good CV, go to a good Uni and succeed in life...right?"" 

To add to that I installed Tinder a couple of months ago and I swiped right for months without a match. Another strike to my ego. I finally got a one, but she had ties to other people I know and my genius logic kicked in again: ""Wow, she's cute...so she might like me...but she didn't respond right away, so she might be getting just another match among hundreds. Also, I'm graduating soon and in a year I'll be leaving the country to study. A long distance relationship won't work. This is pointless, I'm just wasting her time. Even if I wanted to initiate a conversation what do I say? Dammit...wait...I can't let our common acquaintances know about this...shit...delete the account now!"" I then proceeded to lay in bed the entire rest of the Sunday wishing things were easier. I haven't tried getting into dating again.

The reason I'm writing this now is that I notice that my emotional state is affecting my work and education...well...more than usually. I don't feel like doing anything most days and it's extremely difficult to get myself to get out of bed. I've started being constantly late and can't focus as hard as I did before. I've mostly been eating healthily but I've started to eat too much chocolate and drink too much coffee to cope. The internet has become my biggest addiction and sometimes I spend hours on end on Reddit and Youtube, mindlessly checking feeds instead of getting work done...I mean...I did that before, but now it's a lot more than usual. This has been going on for months and if it continues when I enter University I'll surely fail, so I have to do something about it. I know that I'll meet new people there, but still, I hate the way I've been feeling for so long and I want it to end. I shouldn't be thinking like this, but if the rest of my life is like this I don't really feel like living it. I feel that society has taken a lot more from me than it has returned.

I need help. I want to ramble with someone about the things I care about without feeling guilty or like I can be mocked. I want someone to waste his time on me. I want to be selfish for once...

TL;DR Overall I'm doing well professionally and academically, but my social life is a misery. I've had a bad time at high school and have developed some psychological complexes and communication defects. I'm scared shitless of dating. I overvalue other people's time compared to mine. My emotional state ruins the things I've worked so long for. I need help.

Thank you for reading my ramblings. I hope the time you spent reading this has been worth the time I spent writing it. \^_^"

- is Wustl engineering putting you in a good position to get hired?

I'm a second year computer science student. 
Recently (actually it's been a year) quit my fast food job because college kinda overwhelmed me. 

Now I know how to manage my time a bit better and was thinking I should get a job.

If I want to make it only about the money, the Amazon job is better because it pays slightly more per hour and I only get taxed once. (The TMobile job is out of state so I would get taxed twice)

But if I don't want to make it about the money, maybe TMobile would be better for me in the long run (like since I'm a computer science major, maybe I'll meet people that are pursuing a degree alongside and I can make connections. I'm not sure, I've never worked in this type of environment)

My main goal upon attaining my masters would be to find a career in industry. The problem is that the program I am going to be attending is just one year, which doesn't leave me with a spare summer to try and gain experience. I currently have no research / TA / internship experience whatsoever. Nor do I really have any programming experience. I want to do whatever I can now to maximize my employability upon graduation. What can I do now and in the summer that will benefit me most in the long run?

&amp;nbsp;

1. Learn programming. Seems like learning R or Python would benefit me in the long run. I don't exactly know where I should start though. Is it better to learn through a book, or should I take some online courses on coursera? Any certifications that would look good? Should I attempt to learn both R and Python or focus on one? SQL? SAS? Excel? Any specific recommendations on the path to picking up a certain language? 

2. Look for an internship. Honestly it is a bit late, but I am sure there are still some opportunities If i look hard enough. Problem is I am not sure what type of internship I should be looking for. And I guess a bigger problem is that I don't really have the necessary skills to land any useful internship. Seems like any relevant internship position requires proficient knowledge of a programming language or excel. I want a chance to learn, but I don't see myself landing any position w/o having any skills. Are there any options I'm not aware of here, or should I write off trying to grab an internship at this point?

3. TA position. Not really sure how TA positions are granted but would it be worth it to try and ask about a TA position for one of the summer courses at my current undergraduate institution? How about a different school? 

4. Research assistant. Same as above I guess, but I don't even really understand what a research assistant would do. Would there be any benefit into emailing professors from my university? How about other universities?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks!

I want to share with you what's going on with my life.  I'm 23 years old and I'm a gay male going to college.  I also have a love for nature and that's the fundamental driver behind what I want to accomplish in my lifetime job wise (Conservation and research but that's for another subreddit).  So here's my story.

I first started experiencing feelings and 'urges', etc. for guys when I was in junior high and hitting puberty.  By the time I was 15 and in high school, I was convinced I was gay but only my closest friends knew because I come from extremely religious parents who I knew wouldn't take it well.  I had a friend of mine who was very supportive of me and my sexuality and she convinced me to come out to my parents.  And so I did.  My parents hit the roof. They told me that they'd kick me out on the street or send me off to some military school to be straightened out but that they'd never allow a gay in the house.  They screamed about how this was just a choice and that I was an abomination and an embarrassment to the family.  So they gave me my option: apologize and swear that I was just confused by the devil and my past trauma (lots of physical and verbal/emotional abuse from students and a particular teacher of mine back in junior high.  It caused my first diagnosis of major depressive disorder) and that I was going to pray to God to make me straight again, or I could continue ""down this path"" and have them do whatever it took to purge me of it, either by getting me out of their home or by being sent off to get fixed.  Well, I took the ""easy"" route and capitulated.  I felt it was my only option at the time and I think I actually believed them that I had been confused and screwed up because I had been through such a rough time in school.  They wouldn't send me to a counselor or any type of mental health professional because a) they don't believe in mental health issues and b) they feared a counselor would convince me I was gay.

A few years later at 19, I was in college at a junior college getting my basics out of the way and figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.  I had long forgone any idea of me being gay.  I convinced myself that I was straight and that I'd just never found the right girl.  I believed that my lust for men was Satan tempting me and I had to overcome such things.  Well, I was naive and stupid and didn't clear my browser history on my laptop and one day while I was at work, my mom snooped through it and found gay porn and freaked.  Cue the first failed suicide attempt.  They stopped me from harming myself when I got home and laughed at my suicide note (""We don't have funerals for people like you."").  My laptop was taken away.  I was only allowed to use the car because I had classes at college and when I needed to use the computer, I had to sit there with my mom looking over my shoulder.  Now I'm sure some of you are wondering, well at 19 why didn't you just get out of there?  Well, my parents owned everything.  They provided the phone, car, clothing, food, etc. And they were quite clear that if I ever did anything that made them doubt me being straight, they'd revoke everything and kick me out on the street.  So I proceeded with my life.  I finally figured out what I wanted to do with my life and moved to a university that's far enough away from home that I had to move into the dorms.  But still, they maintained control.  I had more freedom but I couldn't make any big life changes.  Any mentions of me getting a good enough paying job in order for me to move into an apartment were met with harsh criticism and disapproval from my family and so they kept me on a leash for a few more years.  

Now I'm 23.  I've spent the past two summers hundreds to a thousand miles away from home interning in my career field and I loved it.  I loved the freedom.  I currently live in the deep South and my last internship was up in the North surrounded by Yankees (no offense intended, I promise.  I love y'all) who didn't care in the slightest about my sexuality.  In the months before I left, I had finally broken down and accepted myself as being gay. I came back after a summer of being totally supported for who I am and I was miserable.  I almost committed suicide while I was up there simply because I never wanted to return to home.  I came back and was on a fairly regular cycle of ups and downs, with the downs including close calls with suicide.  During this time I discovered the Trevor Project who were wonderful when I was feeling so suicidal.  I also have been going to counseling through my university the past year or two and that helps.  I got a tattoo of a rainbow flag on my thigh (easy to hide) with a black semicolon and the words ""this too shall pass"" to remind me that one day I'd escape my hateful and oppressive family and live for myself.  

I realize this is a long post.  Sorry.. I'm really long winded.  Plus, I'm leaving out all the shit my family has said to me over the years that made me so miserable and afraid of them (no physical abuse though so yay for that).  A couple weeks ago, I posted a picture of a beautiful serpent I'd found on social media and an argument broke out between my mother and some close academic friends of mine (they were totally polite btw.  she's an asshole).  My parents called ranting and raving as usual and said some pretty awful shit to me.  And something clicked in my mind.  No more.  That very day I had spoken to my counselor about how I was still continuing to deal with them because of the financial support they offer but that I knew a day would come when the bad would outweigh the good and it'd be a breaking point.  That day was my breaking point.   

I stopped responding to my family's texts and calls.  When I did, we fought some more and I told them that unless some things changed and they apologized for certain things they'd done recently and in the past, that we were through.  They demanded everything back: the phone, car, etc.  I had a friend follow me home and drop off those things while they were gone and I've not spoken to them since.  In the midst of all of that, my mother called me and yelled about how this all went back to junior high and me being ""a queer!""  I suppose it does.  

I have found out how wonderful some of my friends are.  One has been so fucking amazing to give me rides around town to take care of business like making a new bank account that my mother can't access and he's bought me a phone and a lower end plan so that I'll have a way to get in touch with people besides my laptop and messaging/emailing them.  He's potentially going to help me get a car over the summer.  Another friend has offered me their spare room at their apartment so that when the semester is over, I'll have a place to stay (rent free until I have a job).  Another friend has lent me their bicycle to get around on since I don't have a car.  

My nails are painted sparkly blue.  I had my right ear pierced this weekend ( a helix).  And I am happier than I have ever been.  I may be broke without a car and scrambling to find a job that's within walking/biking distance and dealing with financial aid without parental support.  But damn it, I'm me.  I don't have to be afraid of them throwing me out anymore because I don't submit to their parameters for my life.  They are some of the most racist, homophobic, cold hearted, hateful people that I've ever met.  And I'm free now.  

Thanks for reading all the way down.  I just don't have the knack for telling things in a brief manner.

634dys,1,2017-04-02,[27/m] wondering if the reason i'm distancing myself from a group of long time friends the right thing,korr2221,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/634dys/27m_wondering_if_the_reason_im_distancing_myself/,"Hello all, I'm [27/m] wondering if the reason I'm distancing myself from a group of long time friends is the right thing for me. 

A little backstory to my situation, these guys grew up and went to the same high school as me. We're not entirely close, but we do see each other a couple times a year to do various activities and birthdays.

We're not as close since I went to college and I'm one of those introverted guys who needs a lot of time to himself to focus on their studies and life. So I prefer to go out whenever I have the energy for it.

Getting to the point on why I feel I should distance myself from my group of friends. After completing college, and some graduate school. I found myself in an IT technician/help desk position. Realizing that this field didn't need a degree. I saw it was a great opportunity for those  who didn't even finish their community college degrees that his could be a great field to get into. Fast forward, they were able to get into a program ran by a non-profit in the city which trained them to get into IT, paid for their certifications, and landed them in some great internships for a lot of the larger companies in the area. Eventually they landed some great jobs and have some potential to a long career ahead.

As this is going on, I also found myself slowly being left out of the group on a lot of things. Initially I wanted a network of friends in IT to help each other out if we had issues. We were all in the same field but they were studying and exchanging knowledge amongst themselves without me and keeping me out the loop. Totally, not what I wanted out of this. I'm introverted and don't want to go to all their social events but didn't see it being a problem.

That being said, what do you guys think? What should I do?

Honestly, I think I'm going to just live life and keep doing what I do. But am I being butthurt or do I have a legit reason to just distance myself?

634kej,1,2017-04-03,Good places to practice Python for specific use,thekingofthejungle,Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/634kej/good_places_to_practice_python_for_specific_use/,"So I'm a freshman in college, over halfway done with my first intro to CS class and absolutely loving it. I'm hoping to switch to CS a year from now (my college makes it so hard to transfer and I didn't realize I wanted to until after this semester started. Sucks.) We have been learning Python in my class and so far I've been getting good grades and like I said, loving it. 

Now in order to get some extra experience, there is a chance I will be able to get an internship at a pretty big tech company around here. They primarily do work in telecommunications. If I do happen to get this internship, I will be using Python and working under someone to write scripts that, for example, tests new pieces of chip hardware.

I'm just wondering if there's anything I could do to practice this kind of coding in Python as my class has mostly been practicing the basics (think Codingbat.com problems) but I'm sure I'll need to know a lot more about Python in order to succeed in this position."
634yr5,10,2017-04-03,"Chapter 3 : A House MD fanfiction. What if Allison Cameron, had started life as Allison House, Greg House's daughter? How tragedy and a crush break a good man's resolve with his very young daughter. [incest] [MF] [Mg]",funkinkkid,Ageplaystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ageplaystories/comments/634yr5/chapter_3_a_house_md_fanfiction_what_if_allison/,"*This chapter has light spoilers and section of dialog from Ep. 1 of House MD (the part where Cameron asks him why he hired her). That’s all David Shore. I lay no claim to it, and I doubt he’ll wanna lay claim to anything I’m doing with it. But the idea that House’s actions all through seasons 1-3 are his attempts to stomp out his and Cameron’s desires for an incestual relationship is an interesting one. At least to me. And hell, in that context so many of their dialogs make so much more sense. Otherwise, really, why the hell wouldn’t he tap the hell out of her stunning little ass?*

**Chapter 3: The Birth of Allison Cameron**

I did solve the case, and for months after I was hired I waited for my father to invite me to his home. To ask me about my life. I could feel the heat in the way he looked at me. So, I was so eager for him to finally lay claim to my body. Yet he never did. 

I was sure that he knew. The look he exchanged, the lust mixed with panic, before Wilson had walked in on us was all the proof I’d needed at the time. However, as time passed, I teetered nearly daily in my faith he knew I was his Allison. Not a Cameron, but a House. 

He was so broken, it nearly crushed me. Yet, I couldn’t corner him on it. He was at best a trapped and wounded animal. If he didn’t know for sure, I at least made him think about his past. Made him think of the things we’d done. But he seemed resolute in just going on as if I was just another pretty girl he could ogle and tease. 

After about six months I worked up the nerve to ask him why he hired me. It was just after he’d hired Eric Forman. It had bothered me that he’d hired Forman because of his criminal past as much as his doctoring skills. It was killing me. I needed to know why he had hired me. Was it because he knew me, or because I was really the best. 

I had always thought that I was really hired by Wilson, but House, as I now made myself think of him, did have that final say. And who’s to say he didn’t just float my CV to the top. I was plagued with self doubt, and so I asked. He looked at me like a father for once and said “The only thing that matters is what you think. Can you do the job?”

There was no way I was letting him off that easy. “You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.”

He just smirked. ""No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy. I just saw a doctor with a juvenile record. I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call. I hired you because you are extremely pretty.""

As a little girl, he had always told me I was more than just pretty. That I need to use my brain, like him, and use it to get ahead in life. That, there were men, that would do just about anything to get in my pants and offer me the easy way, but I shouldn’t take it. He was testing me now -- seeing if I could stand up to this game.

Or maybe he didn’t know. Either way, I decided to answer him in a way I thought would make him proud. I acted outraged, though a large part of me craved for him to rip off my pants and fuck me over the conference room table. ""You hired me to get into my pants?""

He smiled (I almost melted inside, but I stood firm) and continued his explanation. ""I can't believe that that would shock you. It's also not what I said. No, I hired you because you look good; it's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby."" He’d seen the momentary flash of lust in my eye, and he walked from the conference room toward his office, in a weak attempt to get away.

That really did hurt. I became defensive and followed. ""I was in the top of my class."" 

""But not the top."" By one point and three years ahead of everyone else in my class, but I couldn’t argue, since he was right. I was not the top.

So I took a different route. I knew he’d missed the internship at the Mayo Clinic himself, so I played dirty, hoping it would somehow make him proud I’d outdone him. ""I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic."" 

""Yes, you were a very good applicant."" Now he was treating me more like a baby than he had when I was one. A pat on the head was never his way to show respect.

""But not the best?"" I pressed, suddenly needing a father’s approval.

He sat in his chair and I stood before him arms crossed and he sighed, ""Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty, not some genetic gift of intelligence?"" He knew the answer and that pissed me off even more.

""I worked very hard to get where I am."" I nearly yelled.

And he moved in for the kill. ""But you didn't have to. People choose the paths that grant them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's the law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you. You could have married rich, could have been a model, you could have just show up and people would have given you stuff. Lots of stuff, but you didn't, you worked your stunning little ass off."" 

He was good at this. He enraged me to the point that I questioned why I was even here, trying to make this relationship between us work. Then he tells me the answer I really wanted to hear. He pushes me to a safe distance before he dares compliment me. Later I would realise he’d manipulated me like this so I didn’t have the chance to be grateful which might have melted his resolve to keep our relationship platonic. In that moment he had me right where he wanted me. ""Am I supposed to be flattered?"" I spat out.

He turned the knife more. ""Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?""

He was going there, but I never felt abused by him, regardless what society and convention dictated. There were always exceptions to every rule. I knew we were one. He was no real pervert and I wasn’t a victim. ""No."" 

He pushed me more, ""Sexually assaulted?"" 

""No."" God no. At least not in the bad way. I longed to have his mouth assault mine again. 

He gave me this look, that was almost sad. I knew in that moment that he still was overrun with guilt, because that’s how he saw the things he’d done to me. Things I knew he’d done with love, his mind screamed were wrong. ""But you are damaged, aren't you?"" 

My eyes held his. He was right. I was damaged. But it wasn’t for the reasons he thought it was. I came close to moving forward. I wanted to take his hand and assure him that his loving me had not broken me. But my damned pager went off and my flicker of courage with it. “I have to go.” I told him and turned and walked out. I saw him smirk, because he thought he’d won -- thought he’d pushed me away to safety. 

Of course, he also checked out my ass. 

Damn him. 

It was in that moment I realised that the only way I could win this was to play the game with his rules. I needed to stop trying to get him to see me as Allison House and, instead, fully become Allison Cameron. Even better than that, just Cameron. The only way I was ever going to get him past his demons to acceptance, was to let him fool himself into believing I wasn’t his little girl at all.

From then on, he would be Dr. House to me. When I touched myself thinking of him, I would call out Greg, though my mind was still thinking Daddy. I would transform in the hopes I could help ease his pain. I wanted him to be happy. I wanted to be happy. We were broken, but only because we were each half of a whole and that the only way for us to be fixed would be for us to be together.

After my mother died, House began to spiral into depression. I would later learn that she had been the only woman he’d ever been with and that they’d been sexually active together on and off more or less since they were 10 or 11. Both had bonded to one another out of a desperate need for love. As a way to survive their equally harsh home lives. 

House’s father, my grandfather, who I’ve only met once in passing and who never learned I’d even been born, thanks to the protection of my parents, had abused him most of his childhood. Not only that his military lifestyle had him moving constantly. It kept him from making any real male friends. His family would always return a few months out of the year to their primary home. His father and he would fight constantly and often, as punishment, he was locked outside to sleep for the night. It was during those times he’d run to my mother to find comfort in her touch and she from his.

House was sure that his father didn’t believe he remembered the sexual abuse. John House had stopped that particular brand of abuse when House was around 4. But he did remember it all to well and it haunted him. It made him feel dirty and it was a big factor in his inability to accept that it could ever be healthy for a child and a father to engage in sexual affection, even though, I stand as testament that it can.

I’d come so close to fixing him before. But he just couldn’t allow himself acceptance of the taboo acts we’d begun to engage in. He fought himself daily for almost a year. Nightly, during that time, I crawled into his bed and reassured him that I wanted this. That I needed it as much as he did. “Baby, Allison, it’s not right for your Daddy to be sexual with you. You need to explore with someone your own age. I know you are young, but it’s all okay if you have a friend who is curious about their body too. But I shouldn’t help you explore your body. It’s not how it’s supposed to work. When you grow up I don’t want you to be screwed up like I am.” His head would hang in shame and I would put my hands on his cheeks and pull his lips to my for a gentle kiss.

“Shhhh, Daddy. It’s fine. I’ve read about it in your books.” I may have been 8, but I was an 8 year old with an I.Q. of 150 and who had already skipped a grade in school. I had read his medical text books on sex. I knew the inbreeding dangers. I also knew that I wasn’t old enough to get pregnant and that there was no way he would escalate to intercourse before I was more sexually matured. He was a doctor after all. He knew he could hurt me and he would never harm me.

His penis was much larger than average and he was a reluctant participant in any of our play. Truthfully, at the time, the idea of putting it in me seemed painful anyway. So I was content to just stroke and suck him and to receive the same from him. 

So, I continued to reassure him. He needed that. He’d never gotten that from anyone but my mother and he was starved for it since her death. “You know as well as I do that what we are doing can’t get me pregnant. And that’s the only real reason we aren’t supposed to show our love in this way.”

I’d also read in some of his books that it was a natural urge for daughters to have sexual desire for their fathers. Because of this, I felt like after my mother died, it was my duty to step in and fill the void she’d left for him sexually. I admit now, it wasn’t exactly what Freud was going for, but I was still 8 and lacked any real world experience and Dad’s logic and reasoning, like most men’s, drained away as the blood flowed from north to south. 

And dear God, as it did I loved his body. I loved his cock. I loved the looks of pleasure on his face as he gave in and let me touch him. I loved how his hips moved to meet me as I sat just on his hips and stroked him with both hands. I loved how it pulsed in my mouth as I sucked on the tip and flicked his head with my tongue. And oh how I loved the way my name sounded on his lips as he fell over the edge.

Then he’d beg me to sit on his face and I’d scoot up and squat over him. “You made me feel so much better baby girl. Now Daddy’s going to make you feel good too. Then he’d lick me slowly, reverently. He’d suck on my clit and flick it with his tongue. He’d pick me up and turn us over. He’d kiss me so I could taste everything. Our tongues would duel and then he’d move lower. He’d suck the tiny nipples on my flat chest. He’d scrape over them with his beard and nip with his teeth. 

He’d make me whimper and beg him “Daddy please. Please daddy make me come. I need to come so bad.” 

He’d slip a finger in then and given my size, it might as well have been a dick, and he’d fuck my tiny vagina with it as his mouth sucked my clit again. His large hands would hold my hips still as he pushed me over the edge and sometimes he’d push me again and give me another orgasm for good measure.

He was 28 then, just barely older then than I am now. And at my age now, I can understand why he felt guilty. How every morning after he struggled to look in the mirror. I don’t think I could ever have sex with a child. Under most normal circumstances, I agree with convention. But we weren’t normal and it really wasn’t his fault at all. I had always initiated. I had always broken his resolve. And I suppose some part of me is as guilty as he is because it was me that made him feel that weak. But pandora’s box had been opened and now we are where we are. And right or wrong, I knew the only way for either of us to find happiness again was to embrace our depravities and just be together as man and woman.

Allison House, the daughter of Greg House was dead. I was truly Allison Cameron now, daughter of Dan and Janet Cameron. His employee. Just another woman. Maybe the only woman that could save him from himself."

Got really sick and friend cleaned me up. Felt super guilty and kept getting offhand comments about it. Relapsed. 

This weekend I went up to a friend's cabin to get drunk, goof off, and have a good time. Friday night things started off great. Had a couple of light drinks and a shot. After being in the hot tub I took a shower and made the mistake of using a shower gel that wasn't mine. An hour later I felt sorta funny but put it off to the alcohol not mixing well. 30 minutes after I went to bed I woke up puking and ran to the bathroom. I have never had such a bad allergic reaction in my life. My best friend was an absolute trooper and got me and the room cleaned up before crashing out on the couch with me. 

The next day I was much better after breakfast and decided to close my eyes for a bit in the living room. I didn't fall asleep, so after about 30 minutes I hear my friends start talking about the previous night. My best friend started talking about how gross it was and how she couldn't get back to sleep for almost 2 hours because she was afraid I was going to puke again or die on her. I don't like causing my friends trouble or worry so I felt horrible. Then some other friends started talking about how much of a trooper she was for 'putting up with me'. 

I felt really guilty, so I spent the whole weekend trying to make up for it. I did everyone's laundry, made the bed we shared, cleaned up the cabin, made a kickass dinner and breakfast, and I didn't drink Saturday night, opting to bartend instead. And yet I kept getting offhand comments about that night. 

So in order to release some of my guilt I grabbed my knife and cut myself. My hands were super shaky after and when I got home I cried for a good hour. 

I can't believe I cut myself again and I really want to tell someone, but I don't know who and I don't know how. I was doing so well too. Got my grades up in school, I have an interview on Tuesday for a summer internship, I started to get out a little more, and my mom and I were finally getting into the same page. Then BAM. Now I feel like crap and I can't sleep. "

636632,7,2017-04-03,Leaving a job after four months?,jobhuntingdilemma,AskUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/636632/leaving_a_job_after_four_months/,"I seen a post similar the other day and I can't find it now.

I have just accepted and started working a job that is good but not my dream, I was desperate and they give me a chance after a period of unemployment.

Out of nowhere, my dream job on a  graduate scheme which offers a 33% salary increase and guaranteed pay increases in future has offered me a job, months and months after I first was involved with it and I had lost hope for it.

What should I do? If I leave after four months I'm scared I'm opening myself to looking and acting like a real arse and really putting a stain against my name, particularly as they will have rejected other candidates and really helped me out for me to only leave after a bit of time shorter than an internship.

I'm also aware it will look crap on my CV and like I job hop and if the graduate scheme doesn't work out I'll never be able to get a reference from the company.

I'm just wondering what other people would do? I have family saying it's how the world of business works but I am aware how inconsiderate and inconvenient it is for both the company and for my colleagues and manager who really give me a chance.

Any advice welcome.

636aio,44,2017-04-03,"Graduating college in 40 days, am I budgeting properly?",IHazGoodName,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/636aio/graduating_college_in_40_days_am_i_budgeting/,"So I am just finishing up my last semester of school and I am just trying to make my prospective monthly budget after I graduate. Hypothetically speaking I should be earning $40-45k when I move from my internship to the full-time position. But I will just be conservative and use the $40k in computing the budget.

$40,000/12 = $3,333.33 pre-tax take home

30% = $1,000 Rent w/utilities

30% = $1,000 Student Loan Payments

7.65% = $255 Withheld Taxes

6% = $200 Groceries

6% = $200 401(k) Contribution

6% = $200 Personal Expenses

1.5% = $50 Gas

12.85% = $428.33 Savings

Thank you! Edit: Formatting

Edit2: If this isn't a good plan could anyone suggest a better budget? Everything can be subject to change except rent. Paying $1,000/month on loans should be paid off in a little over 2 years.

Edit3: Redoing my budget and asking my personal finance professor that I took a class with a couple of years back to ask if he can review my budget. If anyone is still interested I will make a new post when ever I finish meeting with him to review my budget.

I have kind of gotten used to it, but I feel like just having at least one person I could talk to would be really nice! If you are looking for common interests, here are some below:

- Computer Science (college major)
- Philosophy (college minor - I think way too much and am pretty interested in existentialism)
- Videogames: Don't play any currently, but I used to be into MMOs or multiplayer games I could play with friends (LoL recently, and Runescape waaay back in the day)
- Anime/Animated Movies: I try to keep up with movies and good series. I'm a sucker for anything with a really good plot (romance, mystery, anything really)
- Traveling: I'm currently in the foothills of the Himalayas in India working on a project with some classmates. Going to be doing a summer programming internship in Hong Kong afterwards, then back to my home in the USA to finish college!
- Music: I listen to pretty indie/alternative music, some favorites: The Strokes, Artic Monkeys, Cage the Elephant, Twenty One Pilots (I could go on..)
- Reading: If you have good book suggestions for me, please tell me! I have been struggling to find my niche. My favorite book right now is The Name of The Wind, but I haven't liked any other fantasy series I have tried

Honestly, I just want anyone that is more or less open minded about life to talk to. Sorry for the long post, pm me if you are also looking for a friend!"
636sl2,37,2017-04-03,Can we put a stop to the people hijacking our student government for their personal vendettas?,lolop2,USF,https://www.reddit.com/r/USF/comments/636sl2/can_we_put_a_stop_to_the_people_hijacking_our/,"Before I begin allow me to say this:

**I DON'T CARE ABOUT ISRAEL VS PALESTINE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ISRAEL VS PALESTINE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ISRAEL VS PALESTINE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT ISRAEL VS PALESTINE.**

*I don't live in Israel, nor Palestine, never have, never will. If both nations turned into Wonderland tomorrow, I would care more about making my coffee than whatever is going on over there. Last I checked, I lived in the United States, with too many of my own issues and domestic problems to worry about 2 groups of extremist nationalists more in common than they are different who have been hating each other since the beginning of time.*

It is for this reason that I am tired, as I am sure many if not most of the rest of the student body is, of watching this never-ending showdown between Palestinians and Israelis or Muslims vs Jews or green soldiers vs tan soldiers or whatever else seems to be the issue, manifesting itself in our student government: an organization meant to provide mock political process for students as a form of internship and extracurricular activity, and to provide amenities to students that benefit THEM at THEIR SCHOOL (not random countries half the planet away).

I'm sure many have not noticed what has being going on in SG, considering most students are too busy doing things such as studying, going to class, enjoying their college years, and working to pay attention to every detail of student government. Which, to be frank, is an organization most of the student body ignores/doesn't care about/ it isn't a part of their daily life. This is why such a small percentage of the total student population votes on any SG election; people have better things to do with their lives and imagine that SG is there to give clubs funds, plan fun events with free food, give free prints, and allow future wannabe politicians to play pretend their dreams. Most people wouldn't imagine SG is using up their time and money doing things such as ceaselessly, without rest, year after year, trying to force bills, referendums, and petitions which involve USF in international politics.

I am writing this article for those who haven't noticed what is going on at SG . A group of Palestinian nationalist students, aptly titled ""Students for Justice in Palestine"", have made it their personal mission and vendetta to use USF's student government as a way to give the state of Israel a big ""f*%@ you"" by forcing USF to create a ""ethical divestment committee"" (of course what is ethical is what they decide is ethical) which would tell the USF Foundation to stop making money through diversified fund accounts that, they believe, do bad things to Palestine. 

For example, although Caterpillar simply makes construction vehicles and sells them to whoever needs to do construction, these people argue that Caterpillar is part of a Jewish conspiracy to demolish Palestinian structures because a small amount of criminal Israeli settlers have use Caterpillar vehicles to do construction in Palestine. Similarly, HP is part of the Israeli League of evil because although it makes computers for everyone in the world to do whatever the user decides to do, because HP is used by the Israeli military, it means HP is actively trying to destroy Palestine. Guess by that logic, that means HP is also actively molesting kids since I am sure there are many child predators who use HP computers to commit crimes against children. Kind of how it's apparently Beretta's fault that someone who bought one of their guns pointed it at someone and killed them. USF Foundation invests because it returns profits which, believe it or not, provide money for many things such as the new, improved, costly, modern student housing in North campus. 

For the last 6 years, SJP has organized its members to vote in other members of its organization into the student senate. In fact, a significant amount of student senators, particularly in the college of arts and sciences, are also members of SJP. I'm sure I will be referred to by someone as a racist or bigot or whatever other buzzword for pointing out the fact, but it doesn't change it from being true. Most of the student body does not participate in the SG election process, because most of the student body doesn't care about SG. Which leaves it susceptible to certain groups, as can be seen with SJP, to rally like minded individuals to vote in a bunch of people who share one common goal and effectively hijack the organization for their own purposes. Those who DO vote in the election tend to care only about the president and vice president, while ""filling in the dots"" for the legislative and judicial spots. However, those who want to vote in their like-minded buddies vote in symphony with each other which secures the seats for their buddies. 

We have many issues and opportunities that SG could fix and take, to make students lives better, improve the campus and the student experience. But instead we have a judicial branch which seems to spend the majority if not entirety of its time forcing and forcing and FORCING and *FORCING* this same issue year after year after year, when it has been made clear, by the USF foundation, by USF staff, by the rest of SG, by the executive branch, by many of the student body, that, metaphorically, nobody gives a flying F*&amp;@ about divestment, the Israel Vs Palestine Super Smash Brothers Conflict, or the personal vendetta of SJP and certain members of the USF SG senate. People want better amenities, better food in the dining halls, more resources, more access to tutoring, more security in the parking garages, more opportunities for internship and networking. Not giving Israel a big ""Ha-ha, F you"" to make a group of Palestinian nationalists feel accomplished.  

So what can we do about it? First of all read WTF you are signing. If you see a referendum, or petition, or poll, or whatever else, that someone is getting you to sign in front of the library, read the damn thing, ask yourself what it has to do with you or the university of the students, and dismiss the bogus as bogus. Don't just sign because it sound edgy and rebellious and you want to get your latte faster so ""get this person out of my face"". Second, pay attention to who you are voting for. Actually RESEARCH the candidates, not only for president, but ALSO, and especially the senators. Read their platforms, find out what they are involved in, what their interests are, what they propose for the school. Don't simply leave blank or christmas tree the senators; or worse, not vote at all. Third, vote in the election. Most of the student body does not vote in SG elections. USF Divestment, a child facebook page of SJP, announced in a video (where they also feature a former SJP officer shouting at Judy Genshaft while walking to her car), that 89 percent of the student body voted for divestment. This is BS. Only around 14 percent of the student body even voted in the election. The rest didn't give enough of a hoot to vote. Of the 14, 89 percent voted in support. This means somewhere around 13 percent of the student body has demonstrated that they even care about divestment. Small voting turnouts allows these organizations to claim that they have huge support when in reality a majority of their supporters voted in the election, not a majority of students support them.

To conclude this wall of text, I again reiterate that I don't care about this whole conflict in the middle east. I am concentrating on SJP and Palestinian nationalists because it is them that are causing this big ruckus and using our SG as a medium for their vendetta. I don't see Israeli nationalists proposing bills to divest in X or Y because X and Y made a product that killed a Jew once. If they were, I'd be calling them out too.

USF is a university, a place of research and innovation, and frankly, a place where you complete the requirements and pay the tuition needed to get a diploma that will help you gain the qualification, skills, and network to land a job and put food on the table. It's not a goddamn PAC. I think its time we as a student body pay attention to the BS being perpetuated in SG and start calling it out for what it is, and stop allowing these political activists to use a STUDENT government to deal blows to their opponent in a international conflict that will never end."

The home we are looking at now will have a rent of $950 and $250 in utilities so we will  be spending around $1,200 total or $400/mo per person. We will be meeting with the home owners in exactly one week to check out the house. Currently I only work a low wage job, but once I move to the city I have an internship at least starting above $11 per hour.

Some of our questions consist of:
What should a first time renter be aware of?
Things we should look for in the house which could be a problem?
When would we sign the lease? And can we secure the house before summer? 
Would we immediately have to start paying rent if we're not looking to move in until the summer?
What are some general tips for first time tenants? "

I was accepted to USC class of 2021, and I am interested in pursuing computer science in college. USC is ranked in the top 20 programs nationally, but I was wondering if I could get a current student's view to help me answer a few questions.

Are the courses largely practical or theoretical? 

What percentage of classes taught by professors and what percent by TAs? How have you found the availability of said professors?

How diverse is the program in course offerings? I understand that there are different programs for games and business, but I was wondering more along the lines of depth of application to subject areas such as AI, wearable devices, etc.  

How have you found the offerings for internships and other kinds of summer employment? Essentially, how desired are USC CS students?

What would you tell yourself before entering the program?

These are just a few basic questions. If there is anything else you think that I should know about the program, or school in general, I would love to hear it. Everything which I have been reading about the school makes it look like an amazing community of which I would love to be a part, and, if the computer science program gets favorable reviews, I think I may commit to be a Trojan next year. Thanks in advance."
637q9d,9,2017-04-03,"My senior year, regretting my soon to be BS in materials engineering- I want to work in a field focused on the planet- animals, the environment, climate. What options do I have?",OhMy8008,AskScienceDiscussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/637q9d/my_senior_year_regretting_my_soon_to_be_bs_in/,"I've been struggling with this for the past year or two. This is year 6 without an undergrad degree. I switched my major after my first year, took a year off and then transferred to a different school, losing almost a years worth of credits. I've been at a standstill for a long time. I realized last year that this wasn't my passion, but I couldn't imagine switching degrees *again* and spending even more time in school, especially because of the debt and having to rely on my parents.

My GPA isn't great, 2.7. Honestly I'm not worried and that isn't the point of this post. I never went into this for money, I just really love science and wanted to learn as much as I could. Originally, I wanted to be an astronaut, and then when i realized that this is a fantasy, I decided I wanted to make parts for rockets and satellites, so I went for materals. I've been looking at jobs and am preparing to start applying but, putting aside the fact that my GPA is bad and that it wont be easy to find one, none of the positions that I see or that my peers are applying for seem like something I can be passionate about. I havent had internships because I havent looked- Ive spent my spare time working on political campaigns and climate related issues. Didnt follow up on an intership opportunity because I thought that being at Standing Rock was more important. One way or another Ill find a job if I try,  make money, pay my debts and move up internally (Im very good with people, and smart, once my GPA isnt a discussion I dont foresee any issues)...but I dont want to do that. I want to apply science to benefit the world.

I wasn't sure which sub to go to so I'm hoping this doesn't break the rules, but I need advice on where I go from here. Materials is awesome, it's a cool field and there's a lot that goes with it...My first passion for as long as I can remember is space. Im growing out of it; still love space and would love to work for NASA, but... the last year or two I've spent a lot of time researching topics relevant to our evolution, archaeology, geology, environmental science, climate change- basically anything that is directly related to our planet. Im starting to look at our home instead of whats lies beyond it, and I want to apply myself accordingly. I don't want to sit around making gadgets during an extinction event or when I could be looking at the history of our planet through a lens. I want to do something that is related to conservation; there's a massive loss of biodiversity, our oceans and atmosphere are being polluted, deforestation... so much going on, so much that's worth doing and so few doing it. I want to help people and help the world, and fabricating a stronger steel or a faster cell phone isn't going to cut it. I've been telling myself that my interests in this sort of stuff can serve as side projects or hobbies, but I don't want to sell myself short- I can do just fine as an engineer if I follow my head and do what I'm supposed to (this sounds so cliche) but I know that I can do great things if I follow my heart, and its telling me that I need to do my part beyond just recycling and volunteering for political campaigns. I love animals, I love earth, I want to do something that will honor that connection. If I had realized this earlier I would be at the top of my class, excited for the future and ready to dip my feet into a more worldly field. Unfortunately, I feel no different than I would have if I were graduating with a business degree and preparing to work in a cubicle.

I do a lot of reading about the topics I listed above, but recently I watched a documentary about Jane Goodall and I felt miserable afterwards- the things she's done, the things she's doing, not just with the chimpanzees but even further, conservation and human rights, advocating for the environment, ""speaking for the trees""- I want to follow that sort of path. Seeing her work is so inspiring (not unlike the inspiration I draw from Pauli or Einstein, but somehow a more rewarding type of inspiration). 

Is there any way I can apply my engineering background to something related to this? I want to travel to the places where I can make changes hands on, to apply my knowledge of science, to be a part of a more sustainable future. I know that there has to be an outlet for me, my senior project is related to wind farms so I know that the path is out there, but I want to go further than just working at a wind or solar company. What sort of career can I look into? 

I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I figured readers on this sub might know more about what's happening out there in other fields and if there are opportunities for someone like me. Also, I apologize for the formatting- I'm on mobile."
637quy,2,2017-04-03,19 yo college student working out short term housing for summer,KeroseneEnvy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/637quy/19_yo_college_student_working_out_short_term/,"My partner and I are college students in Virginia. I have an internship in Wilmington, DE over the summer and he intends to live with me and find employment there. I’ll be making $21/ hr, 40 hr/wk and he’ll have to work it out when he gets there. Because we will only be there in the summer, I’ve been looking into short term leasing.

Unfortunately, the options there are very limited and often there’s a heavy cost increase for short leases. One option I’ve considered is taking on a year long lease and canceling it.

**For comparison of cost** between the two places that are most similar:

**Place A:** Year long lease at $875/mo, $302 bond (non refundable security deposit), 2 months rent to cancel early, unfurnished

**Place B:** Four month lease at $2050/mo, unknown security deposit, furnished

For Place A, it is also cheaper to have a year long lease and cancel than a 6 month lease.

Are there downsides to canceling a lease other than the payment penalty?

Would there be any good places to look for short term housing?

Thanks for the help."

I was long time a lurker on reddit. My mother tongue is not English so forgive/correct my grammar mistakes. My problem is complicated that’s why I can’t make a TLDR, sorry for that. But I will try to keep it as short as I can.

I broke up with my 1 year and 5 months LDR GF 2 months ago. We met on tinder while I was on my internship abroad in Japan on Dec/2015 (She is Japanese (24) and I am from Germany (27)). After being together for 2 months I had to go back to Germany to finish my studies. The initial plan was her to come to Germany after I graduate and find a job. This should be in the end of May/2017. She came in February with her mom and sis to visit me. But shortly before leaving Germany back to japan she brought up a topic about my brother. 

My brother is mentally ill (spastic and autistic). In our first month I told her about my brother and asked her if she can live with him, since I am going to take care of him if something happens to my parents. That time she agreed. But before leaving Germany she told me that she cannot do it, because she saw him (He is having once in a month a crisis where he cannot control himself and where I have to hold him so he won't be able to hurt himself). She told me that she cannot take the responsibility over him and gave me this situation, I either choose her or my brother. Even though I love her deep from my heart I cannot give my brother to some facility. He is like a child he needs love he needs a family. I could not do it and we broke up. I have to add that on the first they of her trip to Germany with her Sis and Mom I proposed to her and she accepted. And one week after we broke up. Well it was not a complete break up after she went back to Japan we tried to figure it out I tried to convince her. The health care system in Germany is insanely good developed. People like my brother work in some facilities which are only designed for them. So she would never be alone with him. So I told her that it looks like that she is just looking for a reason to break up and letting me do the work to finish it. After this discussion we completely broke up. 

Somehow I always hoped she will come back and tell me that she changed her opinion and wants to try it with me, but it never happened. So yesterday I saw on her FB that she is in a relationship with someone else. She had this guy on her FB Friends list last year on December and I just randomly asked about him, she told me that he was a teacher when she was back in the states for her English language school and after that she deleted him.
So they are in a relationship since 12 March one month after she left Germany. We didn’t completely break up that time our final brake up was on the 22 March. 
I am so confused, I feel like she lied to me, I feel like everything what she told me was a lie. Fuck guys I am really messed up, I never felt like this before. I feel like she just kept me warm in case it won’t work out with this guy. I don’t think the topic with my brother is a valid reason to finish a relationship. I know that if it’s true and she is in a relationship with this looser, I shouldn’t be sad, but I can’t forget her, I barely can work. Today I almost cried at work.
Can you guys give me any advice, how to get over her?  If not just any words to make me feel good would be enough either. If you have any further questions don’t hesitate to ask please…

I started at community college and later transferred to university after sorta getting my shit together. During that time, I was still living with my aunt and uncle and their children (and still do). The problem is, they're really dirty and I have to clean up after them almost everyday, cook dinner, and take the kids to violin, along with doing my homework, projects, and trying to start a career and maintain my internship. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful about the things I have in my life, but this is my senior year of university and I'm taking 19 credits because I need them to graduate...and I honestly want to die. It's soooo much shit it's amazing. I thought I could handle it, but turns out I played myself. I'm so miserable that snorting coke seems more appealing than doing my work. I've had a lot of part time jobs in the past from wrestling coach to package handler, and right now I feel like they've all gotten me nowhere. I'm still a broke ass intern and trapped in the bs known as college. 

And trust me, I'm trying. Dear god, I am trying to stay in there mentally and get through everything. But admittedly I've been slacking. My manager for my internship called me out on an assignment that was done innocently and is probably mad at me. There's projects due all this week that I still haven't done. My kitchen is disgusting from everyone messing it up and I need to clean and cook for my family. I'm trying to find a job for after graduation and I just got accepted to a masters program that I'm having second thoughts about cause I hate school so much now. 

I'm tired, I'm borderline suicidal, I can't take it and I feel like no one is here for me. 

I'm religious (neo-pagan), and that's been having some affect on me not downing a Prozac and vodka cocktail, but overall I'm just miserable. I just want this to be over, but it feels like school and being a broke helpless intern is a purgatory I'll forever be stuck in. Figured this would be a better place to voice my grievances instead of at the top of a bridge before I jump onto the concrete below.

I'm a hopeful NYU 2022 and I was wondering, do GLS students have nice opportunities when it comes to internships? Specifically the politics, rights, and development concentration. 

Is double majoring in GLS + something Public Policy, Metropolitan Studies, or Social + Cultural Analysis manageable? I really want to do that and think that's the path that I'll do. 

I posted a chance me a while ago, if any of you wanted to help me see if I could get in, that would be great. 

Thanks for the help. "

My interest in Computer Science is Cybersecurity. 

* How is the CS program? 

* How are the CS professors?

* How is the social life? I'm a little concerned about the gender ratio.

* How are the dorms and the dining plan?

* How are job and internship prospects?

Thank you very much.

639cqv,1,2017-04-03,"My [25F] boyfriend [27M] of 8M has rented the same house for almost a decade, just learned he has to move next month. How do I balance supporting him while also dealing with my own stressful situation?",stressed39355299,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/639cqv/my_25f_boyfriend_27m_of_8m_has_rented_the_same/,"It's only been eight months but we both agree that this is the happiest either of us have been in a relationship. My past boyfriends didn’t respect me and it’s been nice being with someone who’s mature and understands how to respect a significant other. We’ve only had two real arguments which were worked through in about an hour or less and we’ve had a few bickerments. We don’t stress over the small stuff in our relationship, no jealousy issues, we listen intently to eachother and value the fact that we’re both two individual people. For both of us I think it’s the most mature relationship we’ve been in. It’s really refreshing to be with someone who wants to spend a majority of the time being happy and not stressing over useless drama.

My relationship before this one was emotionally abusive. The emotional abuse created a lot of resentment, so I was never really expected to support my ex through hard times because he knew that he was an asshole and didn’t deserve it. The whole relationship was a shit show, and we were codependent on eachother that’s why we were together for so long. That was six years (18-24) and during my formative years so it’s a part of how I handle things. It’s also made me super aware of my current relationship and not letting either of us get into codependent territory. My boundaries are strong and I make sure that my expectations of him don’t get unrealistic because that’s unfair to both of us.

The only other relationship I’ve had other than that was in high school, and everything was so hunky-dory, we never fought and life was handing us good cards, so there weren’t any difficult times to deal with. Because of this I've never really had to emotionally support anyone before. I can do it on a small scale but have never really helped anyone close to me through a seriously difficult time. I also never learned it from my parents, they weren't very good at dealing with conflict and I had to deal with my own stress by myself.

Moving on to the situation at hand now that you know a bit of my relationship background.

My boyfriend moved out at 18 into a house with three other high school friends. At the same time he got a really good job through a family friend as a machinist working with mills and lathes. And that's how his life has been since, for almost the last decade. Because of this he has no credit, his plan was to live at this house until he was in a position to buy his own. It's also important to mention that we live in Denver, rent is reaaally high. I pay $1,100 six miles away from downtown. He's been paying $300 a month and is about two miles away from downtown. So his situation is pretty prime, they’ve been living in their own little oasis since they’ve become adults.

The guy that owns the house is old and I don't think he is aware of the value. Either, he does now or he's sick of renting because he's putting the house up for sale the second week in May. 

When it first came to light about what was happening I don't think I handled it in an ideal fashion. I had been doing school work all weekend so Sunday around 3 after I finished a few assignments I decided to start drinking and playing Rory McIlroy PGA tour, my boyfriend joined me. Around 9, we're watching The Amazing Race, I made a joke and he just stared at me. I said, ""what?"" and he held his phone up to me. It was a group conversation with all his roommates, the first message said something like, ""Well folks we've had a good run but I just talked to Mike L and he's putting the house up for sale on the 15."" The second message was from another roommate saying, ""of May?!"" and the first roommate said ""Yes may 15.""

I had been drinking for six hours I was confused and told him something like, ""wait is this serious? Do you normally get really important living related texts at 9 o'clock at night on a Sunday?"" he agreed and said maybe it's a late April fools but he was still visibly concerned. I was completely taken aback, in denial, was convinced it was a joke. He heard the roommate that started the group text out in the living room, he went out there and confirmed it wasn’t a joke. I didn't know what to say, I still wasn't convinced to be honest. They've lived there for almost a decade and they only get five weeks notice? Unbelievable, like I literally could not believe it and in a way I still don’t.

It was just me and him in his room and even though I was drunk I could tell that he was taking this really seriously and was extremely concerned. There was tension that I could feel and his general vibe was very tense and worried. I was literally speechless, had no idea what to say to make him feel better so I just said, “You want another shot?” He replied immediately with a yes, definitely. I get up from the bed, go over to the desk and pour us some shots. I turn around and he’s sitting on the edge of his bed looking absolutely miserable and defeated. So I put the shots down and just hug him tightly. I rub his back a little bit and I can feel tears well in my eyes but I don’t want him to see that, I figure I should be the strong, optimistic rock that handles it calmly and rationally even if I don’t know what to say.

So we drank more. He has to wake up around five for work so he usually goes to bed around nine anyways, that's late for him. After the episode of The Amazing Race ends he plays the next one, and the next one, and the next one. I tried to stay up and keep him company, I'm sure he didn't want to be alone with his thoughts and that's why he was binge watching. But I had been drinking for so long and couldn't keep my eyes open anymore even though I really wanted to be awake just in case he needed me, I couldn't. I have no idea what time he went to bed, I would guess close to one, or later because he finished the season.

He tossed and turned all night. When he woke up for work he was almost in tears holding onto me in bed and me rubbing his back telling him to just relax and that it'll be ok. He got up, got ready and came back to say goodbye to me, his face was still really concerned and on the verge of tears. I hugged him, kissed him a bunch looked him in the eyes and told him I loved him. I felt so bad that I couldn't do anything to take his pain away. It's not just the stress of having to move, but that he's lived with three of his best friends from high school for almost a decade. I would be heartbroken knowing that was probably coming to an end, and so soon. He had the rug taken out from under him and it’s hard to watch that happen to a loved one.

I got up and went to school this morning and as I’m walking to class he texts me saying something along the lines of, “Babe I can’t stop freaking out.” I told him that I know it’s scary and uncomfortable but this is something that everyone has to deal with sometime in their lives and it’s normal to be stressed. He said, you’re right, it’s just so new that I can’t help but think about it. I told him that I loved him and that I wanted him to tell me if he needed anything. 

We've talked about the future hypothetically. I said that the next person I live with is going to be my future husband, he agreed saying that he feels the same way. This was a while ago, closer to when we started dating, so we don't have to worry about that coming up which is probably the only good thing. 

Moving on to my stressful situation. I'm in my second to last semester of college. I'm taking 22 credits and the program that I'm in requires a lot of work outside the classroom. There's five weeks left in the semester so pretty much everything's coming to a head in all seven of my classes right now and continues, if not increases, through the end of the semester.

I’m also at a point in my schooling where staying focused is very important. I’m dealing with decisions regarding my upcoming career and other important adult/life choices that could change the course of my life. I also need to get A’s and B’s in these last two semesters to save my GPA because when I started college I was in a major that didn’t fit me so I have three F’s on my transcript bringing my GPA down. I’ve also started looking for an internship for this summer or this fall, and we all know that job searching is a job within itself. I also write for the school newspaper and have two out of town field trips coming up, one of them is overnight. I’ve also noticed that I do better on my assignments the more time I spend alone. All of things have been encouragement to be firm on my boundaries, but this situation makes it a little more difficult, I don’t want to not be there for him, that’s not what should happen in a relationship and I wouldn’t like it if he did it to me.

I'm already really feeling the stress from his situation though and I'm worried about giving support and not crumbling under literally everything that's going to be happening during the next five weeks. I’m one of those people who can get really caught up in taking care of someone else that I end up neglecting my own needs. But also when I get overwhelmed I have a tendency to run away, physically and emotionally. 

I don't want our stresses leaking in and causing strain in our relationship. I want to make sure I, or both of us, take preventative measures so we don’t get to the point of snapping at and disrespecting eachother. I love our relationship and I know that one unfortunate situation can be telling. It can change the trust, respect and outlook of the whole relationship, I don’t want him to think that I’m a shit partner who can’t be there for him when he needs it. 

I haven’t talked to him about any of my feelings because this is all still very fresh, the information is less than 24 hours old and it would be shitty if he told me these less than ideal things are happening and I reply with talking about myself and my concerns on how it’s going to affect me… The timing could not be worse though. The week before he has to be out of his house is my finals week and I could throw up right now just thinking of the stress involved. 

Should I tell him my concerns? I feel like I want to deal with it on my own and not make it something that he has to worry about. I should put my own stressors before his, right? Where’s the line in supporting someone and how do I show him support? How much do I let it affect my life before putting my foot down? I have a history of putting my needs second and I don’t want to do that anymore but I don’t want to be a shitty partner to the man that finally deserves my love.

TL;DR

My boyfriend just found out that he has to, somewhat, hastily move out of the house that he’s been living in for almost 10 years. But I’m soo close to graduating college that I need to stay focused on my life, and cope with my stressors as well. I also don’t have a good history, or much experience with being a part of someone’s support system. Wondering how to approach this delicate balancing act.

639gsv,1,2017-04-03,millennial,no1nolife,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/639gsv/millennial/,"I am a millennial of 1990s. I grew up with an okay family. I was partially raised in the ghetto. I was bullied and a bully at a young age. During my teenage years starting at 16 I transferred to a better high school. At the age of 18 I was forced to choose a career path. If I didn't do so I would be looked down on by my family. So I decided with graphic design because I have always love to draw and deal with computers. Anyway, I was accepted into a 4 year university with the graphic design program. I went, took out loans, studied, and finished. During my last year at the Uni I was very stressed and depressed about finding work. I worked day and night for my portfolio. Even though most of my projects was student work I still tried my best. I tried my best to make many friends in school as well but in the end I still ended up being a nobody with no real friends or have people stick to my side. I have done more for my friends than my family. After graduation I had multiple design interviews for internships. I have no prior work experience in any design field and I have only worked at a retail store for one summer. After graduation countless applications for any type of job was sent out. I refined my resume &amp; cover letter over and over to make sure it was perfect. I searched all over the internet for anything design related. After a few months of applying I finally get a response. Appeared at the interview and the place was extremely sketchy. Their computers barely worked and everything was just not right. The environment was out of town. Eventually I still wanted it but was rejected. I applied to custodial, overnights, cleaning, any kind of jobs out there and yet I was still rejected. It is very close to one entire year now and my loans are already due. I have to postpone them but now the postpone is now almost up too. I am still unable to find a job and my family and friends look down on me for not having a job. Employers look down on me because of my year gap. people look down on me because im unemployed. they look down on me because of my art degree. im useless. I was not able to become the person that people expected me to become or what i expected to become. I don't know what to do when my $50,000 loan(partial private loans) is due in a couple of months. I contemplated suicide a lot of times knowing my parent have my life insurance so things would just be easier that way. 

TL:DR
Grew up in the ghetto in the early years. Moved to better school. people tell me college will make my life better. went to college. now in debt. no job. no friends. no family that cares. no one. contemplating suicide because i have no realistic goals to achieve and cant find any fulfillment in life."

They agreed it seemed suspicious but because they had 1 missing link (If he was actually going to ship stuff out) they would put a detective on it to see if they even exist. I am to send all the money out and not keep a dime, and keep all paper trail between me and them so it  doesn't bite me back in the butt. I am to close the account down as well once a bit of time passes to see if the items were indeed genuine.

**PRE-UPDATE**
I'm strapped for cash because of tax season so I took to Craigslist (I know, I know) and the second ""gig"" was someone who needed an eBay account to sell stuff.
They are a moving company and sell things left behind that the owners didn't want, sold to the company for whatever they bargain for. All I would need to do is keep track of the items and account for the fees while I take a small commission. It seemed like an ok idea since the person was also a mover and didn't have time to do the accounting, even though I ended up automating it in a spreadsheet.
I'm trying to get out of it, but at this point I can't cut off all ties because money has already been made ($800+), and if they decide to leave without a trace, I could be stuck with who knows how many people on my account bidding on items I don't tangibly have.
The reason I'm trying to get out of it is because with tax season in mind, if it looks like I'm making all this money but am only taking a small percentage of it, I'm going to be railed by it come next year if I don't report it. They said eBay sales are losses if you use them as deductibles with the receipts but now things are seemingly fishy to me since it's all under me.
I learned my lesson about fast cash and have been applying to jobs everwhere, but in the meantime I have to get out of this mess.
I'll appreciate any help.

Note: I changed my password and gave them access to it, the guy has 2 ""interns"" listing everything for me. The only thing I do is see what sold, tax my cut, send the rest their way from my paypal account (linked to eBay).

**TL;DR** Selling a moving company's stuff on my eBay account, I'm making small commission and sending the rest to the company, I don't want taxes to be a nightmare because it looks like I'm making all of it. Trying to break ties.

I want to go into data science/machine learning without much industry specific preference. Several problems though:

* Low GPA. I'm graduating with 2.8 cumulative most likely unless I do really well this semester. This disqualifies me from a lot of listings.
* Lack of internships. I did one my sophomore year as a QA intern. I then had to work tech support to support myself for a few years before moving to my current role as a Udacity project reviewer.
* Lack of references. For whatever reason I never really developed a relationship with my professors and didn't like a lot of them. I can't think of a single one of them who I'd want to approach about references or recommendations.

I was considering trying to get into Grad school and use the year to shore up on skills and refocus myself academically with a clean slate but I'm running into similar obstacles with grad school applications which want 3.0 minimum and 3 letters of recommendation.

I'm guessing I really need to lower my sights but I'm super discouraged and have no one to blame but myself. I've been working really hard this semester and will probably get a ~3.8 GPA but that's not going to make up for 4.5 years of wasted undergrad. Has anyone been in a similar situation? Am I just fucked?"

This is my first post here. I was diagnosed with Crohn's just over three years ago. I'm on mercaptopurine, which mostly keeps the Crohn's under control, but leads to all the fun infections I'm sure you've all encountered too. 

It's my biggest desire to be a researcher. I applied to do my PhD from September this year, but found out today that my scholarship application will likely be rejected because I don't have enough research experience. The reason why I don't have more experience is because I was never able to study and intern at the same time like my classmates could. I tried. I tried so hard, but while my classmates were working and interning and going to conferences to give presentations I was congratulating myself for managing to make it to the bathroom to throw up. I let so many opportunities pass because I simply couldn't cope and now I feel so lost and angry that my body has taken this from me. The biggest irony is that my PhD research would be looking at how bacteria influences the immune system and brain of being with gut issues. It's almost comical how much this sucks. 

Normally I can cope with Crohn's and how much it takes from me. I have an amazing boyfriend and a best friend who also has an autoimmune disease and they are being incredibly supportive. But right now I feel alone and so angry. 

Please someone tell me why I should keep trying. "

63bus6,1,2017-04-03,I [25F] am having horrible anxiety when thinking of the future with my boyfriend [27M] of 3 years,adognamedzac,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/63bus6/i_25f_am_having_horrible_anxiety_when_thinking_of/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm a longtime lurker of this sub and I'm often blown away by the insightfulness of some of the responses. I'm hoping I can crowd-source some perspective, especially since I don't feel comfortable talking about my issues with my friends or family because I feel protective of my boyfriend and don't want them to see him in a negative light. Please excuse the ranting post; my thoughts just feel so jumbled and urgent that it's hard to sort out the necessary sentences from the rambling.

I'll start from the beginning. I started hooking up with my boyfriend, who I'll call J, in early 2014 after meeting through a college club. I had a lot of issues with depression and self-esteem throughout high school and partway through college, and 2013 was the year things started to turn around for me. I figured out my medication, got an internship in my field, had some things finally click in therapy, etc. Because of my mental health issues I had next to no romantic interaction with men up until I first had sex with a rando about a month before J and I got together. I'd get approached but was convinced I was unloveable and did some pretty ridiculous mental gymnastics to explain away any attention I got. I was also really shy and couldn't figure out how to flirt back (I mostly mumbled), so I was also pretty unapproachable.

When J asked me to be his girlfriend after a month of hooking up and hanging out, I hesitated because I wasn't really into him like that, but went ahead and said yes. I'd had so many distortions about men and dating that I figured it was time to force myself out of my shell. Besides, if anyone deserved a chance, it was this guy. He made me feel really safe and unashamed of my body, made me laugh, and was always checking in with me to make sure he wasn't pressuring me or making me uncomfortable. Looking back I feel pretty dumb for ignoring my gut, but I didn't think we'd ever be so serious.

There have been a few points in our relationship since then where I start to feel really doubtful about being with him. In winter 2014 we started talking about where we would go when we graduated, and J really wanted us to end up in the same place. I felt pretty apprehensive about this, but just went with my top job offer and figured that if he ended up in the same area then that would be cool. He ended up at a school about 1.5 hours from my job, so we continued our relationship, living near our workplaces but visiting each other every weekend and often once during the week. Then in winter 2015, he's asking about moving in together and I keep putting it off. In early 2016 I admitted to him that I wasn't sure I wanted to move in together at all and we took a one-week break. It was supposed to be for a month, to give me some air, but ended because I was feeling really unsure about my choice when he texted me telling me how broken up he was and sad. I figured the relationship would be too broken to salvage if I didn't fix it now, because he was really upset and hurt and didn't believe in breaks, so I went to him. Admittedly I also felt pretty guilty and knew I had the ability to make him feel better. I felt really responsible for his sadness.

Now here were are and I have been having awful, awful anxiety for about 4 months. It started when we went to a family wedding and his relatives brought up our getting married. I should've felt excited, but all I felt was this pit in my stomach and fear. J and I normally talk about everything, but how could I tell him about this? I'm in therapy and my psychiatrist prescribed me some Ativan to use on my worst days. I've taken 5 since I got them 2.5 months ago. They take away that panicky feeling of doom, but not the sadness and confusion.

I feel like I've 'slid into' every level of this relationship and I feel so awful. I'm an idiot. I'm a coward. I want desperately to want to be with him the way he does with me, but I don't know how to make it happen. I want to logically understand why I can't feel for him but I can't. During our break last year I made a checklist of things I want in a partner, and he checked all the boxes except the attractive one. Our relationship is so easy and I feel like I can be myself around him without fear of judgement. I trust him and feel deep platonic love for him. He is my best buddy and I love hanging out with him. The way he is with our dog makes me think he'll be a great father. The sex was fun when we first started dating, but I don't have much attraction to him now (but then I'm not attracted to many males anyway) and recently with my anxiety I don't enjoy it much at all.

To make things more complicated, J has been relying on me pretty heavily emotionally. He's having a tough year with grad school and the death of a friend and is from a culture where you don't talk about your feelings or mental illness. He recently admitted to me that he's feeling depressed. He tells me often that he doesn't know what he'd do without me, or that I'm the perfect girl for him, or that I'm the best part of his day. I wish I could say that he'd be better off with someone who was sure about him, but I'm just not sure that's true because he seems pretty darn happy to have me. I'm a little concerned he would drop out of school or something if I left him.

One final thing is that I think I have a few traits that are attributes of Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. It's really really important for me to make choices that are 'right'. It's hard to explain but it feels very black and white, where only the best possible choice will mean that I haven't failed. What if I'm just having major commitment issues because I'm scared that J is not the 'perfect choice'?

I guess what I want to know now is how do I make this right? If I could wave a magic wand I would either make myself want to marry him or I would go back in time to last year when we had our break and just stay broken up.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm in deep platonic love with my wonderful, loving, sweet, hard-working boyfriend. I am pretty freaked out by marriage and can't tell if it's cold feet or a romantic incompatibility that I won't be able to get past. How do I know if should marry someone? Is there a way to grow romantic love? If he's not for me, how do I break up with him at such a stressful point in his life when he depends on me so much? Has anyone here who is very perfectionistic about decisions had this problem too?"

I'm permanently fucking up my life. I just need some advise because I'm not comfortable talking to anyone I know about this.  I don't know if I'd go as far as to say I have depression but I've completely lost any shred of motivation I had. I've become a lazy loser and it frustrates the hell out of me but I can never seem to make myself do anything about it. I started out the year at a university with decent grades and an awesome internship and but as the semester went on I lost all interest. I couldn't make myself go to my math class after failing the first few quizzes because i'd just sit there and feel like an idiot and I could've asked for help but I guess I just felt too lazy. I ended up quitting my internship so I could focus on school and work but my grades didn't get any better. I dropped out and am going to a community college, telling my parents it'll only be for a semester so I can figure out what I want to do but just the thought of returning to the university is overwhelming. Anytime I try to think about the future and how unprepared I am I just get tired and want to take a nap.
 It's almost the end of second semester and I'm still failing because I keep skipping class; sometimes I drive there fully intent on going to class and just end up going home. I know how stupid that is and I don't know why i do it, I just can't make myself go in. Everything is just moving too fast and I feel like I'm getting left behind. I just wish my life could slow down so i could have time to figure some of this out before i screw it up even more. 
I've become so distant with the few friends I have left and feel like I have force myself to hang out with them. It's exhausting because I have to put on this facade that I'm doing/feeling great which freaks me out even more because it makes me realize how shitty I'm doing. I think I've always struggled with this because my teachers would always tell my parents that it was frustrating to see how much potential I was wasting, but I always managed to get by with average grades. I'm so annoyed and frustrated with what I've become but most of me just doesn't care. 
tl;dr: I'm screwing up my life and I'm too lazy to make myself do anything about it."

I would be fine on family trips and the like for a few days, and based on what I'm feeling​ now that must've been because I knew I would burn one again the moment I was home. I graduate in a month with my BA, on schedule for having held a job down alongside my studies as well as a few internships, and I've got a great relationship with both family and a girl I love. I'm quitting now because post graduation I will need to be looking for a real job, and real jobs for the most part drug test at least on hiring. My problem is my own thoughts. I spent so much of my days provided with the free distractions of mind that come with a fat dab. Now as I lay in bed not only can't I sleep, but I feel as though I'm trapped in a brain so used to taking random thoughts and creating worlds around them that I grow bored and annoyed with the lack of variety provided by my own imagination. I feel as though I am only slightly more irritable, which compared to how laid back I consider myself when stoned all day isn't all that bad, but when I'm alone I find it so difficult to engage my own thoughts and create the distractions for myself that I am so accustomed too. I have faith these will pass in time as my brain adjusts to the lack of THC stimulation on a near hourly basis, but right now I just wish I could think myself to a peaceful sleep the way I'm used to. It's comforting to type this out and give myself a clear understanding of these feelings, and I appreciate the struggle of all those here."

63cr99,1,2017-04-04,35 M4F - Pick Your Scenario,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/63cr99/35_m4f_pick_your_scenario/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as *the intern gets a special offer *staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

*edit2* nope still fucked

The season popup on login is tedious but the game joining general chat every time and crafting being stuck on 'have materials' is super annoying.

Anyone know a fix for this? 

Curious if this might be related to switching to 32bit last season due to frame lag, is 64bit usable (vs saxtris, kulle etc) now?

ps. which Jay Wilson intern thought we would want to see popups of currency/mats we just had to click on to pick up; sure if they enabled auto pickup for that it might be nice..."
63dd7y,1,2017-04-04,"I'm not an engineer, I now know I'm not a salesman, but I sure do feel like a quitter...",audifanatic2510,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/63dd7y/im_not_an_engineer_i_now_know_im_not_a_salesman/,"Just for some background info, I was never like this before. My entire academic career, including college, I excelled and was always at the top of my class. I played the game right and by the rules, so they say. I went into a STEM field (computer engineering and applied math double major). I've never used (or even tried) drugs, never even got drunk before until I was in my 20's and I only lost my virginity last year. Not because I couldn't get a girl, I'm at least better looking than Shrek... but because I was struggling with my sexuality and couldn't get a guy as a result; it probably doesn't help that my personality, demeanor, and mannerisms make me appear straighter than a 2x4.  

I enjoyed my time in school and I liked my major. I found it interesting at the time and I was very good at it. I was involved in engineering clubs on campus, everybody knew me, etc. You'd think I'd be heading in the right direction.

So around the time of my first internship, I landed a software engineering role with a large semiconductor company. That should've been my first hint that I didn't like the field, but I attributed it to the job location and the nature of the work itself. So I continued on, I was going into my senior year of college at that point, it's kind of too late to turn back.

Then, the following summer I landed another internship with a small, mom &amp; pop defense company and while I didn't love it, I thought it was better than the last place. I felt like at least I could help them modernize a bit. And the internship went OK. Again, I didn't love was I was doing (patching really bad software), but my boss was nice and it was 10min from home rather than 5 hours. 

Come the end of the summer and I started my last semester in school. I figured I'd go back to school for a month and then assess whether or not I could go back to work part-time while I finished my degree. Eventually I did that a few weeks into October. I was still enjoying my classes at school and during the intermission, but I met this gorgeous guy (I'll call him Ryan) in one of my classes and we started talking. Just about when we started to get really close (which didn't take too long, it felt like we had known each other for years, but it'd only been a few weeks). I'm sure he didn't know it at the time, and I doubt he knows now, but I was falling madly in love with him. We shared many similar interests and were able to have some pretty deep conversations fast. So when I found out he was interested in being close to the hardware and that he came from a military family, I didn't hesitate for a second to polish up his resume and hand it off to my boss. 

Graduation came and went and Ryan disappeared for a month. Normally I am prone to depression upon major doors in life closing. When I graduated high school, I wouldn't leave my room most of the summer unless it was work. College graduation was no different and most definitely worse (I'm still in the depression); not only was another chapter of my life ending, but I had my first meaningful crush  going on, and I knew that nothing separated me now from the ""real world."" 

Nonetheless, I went right to work, having been offered as full time position at the company I was interning for. And that's when I took a trip to the DEEP south. Obviously, now that I was a full-time engineer, more responsibilities were placed on me and the work wasn't as fun (or any fun at all, not that there was much fun to be had in the first place). The pay was much lower than I had anticipated, all my friends were being paid at least $10k more than me. But the people weren't as nice to me anymore and some were bordering on downright abusive an by no means professional. The only thing keeping me there was that Ryan got hired as an intern. Of course now I felt like shit because the place that I thought ""wasn't so bad"" ended up being like Hell on Earth once I received that sheet of expensive and uncomfortable toilet paper that we call a diploma. I was too stupid to follow my dick instead of my brain and I involved a friend (and crush, no less) with business. And while he enjoyed the work (and still does last I spoke with him over a year ago) I didn't and I just let it drag me on and it obviously got worse. Within that span of time, the depression just got worse and worse; I had no idea who I was anymore. By the time late April rolled around I had had enough and I was just about ready to kill myself. I had some ammunition on my bed and I was about to grab my gun from the closet while I tried to figure out if I should write a note. The only thing that stopped me is something I can only attribute to as divine intervention; I'm not particularly religious, but if I had to make a case for God, this is it. I received a phone call from a (different) friend, who had no knowledge about what was going on; his only reason for calling was to tell me how awesome of a friend I am and how much I mean to him. Needless to say I cried like a baby for a bit after hanging up, put the gun away, and started searching for psychiatrists (in addition to my regular therapist who I'd been seeing since my high school depression). As much as I hate being on medication, I knew I couldn't fool around anymore. And then come the end of June, I put my two weeks notice in, told Ryan I was sorry for bailing on him, and quit.

I went back to my pre-engineering job as a lifeguard and swim instructor for a day camp. I figured I should go back to basics and get engineering off my mind for a bit before trying again. I certainly got my mind off it, but my dick grabbed the wheel again when I fell in love even harder for one of the camp counselors (Jake). I immediately friend-zoned Ryan and did just about anything a closeted guy could to get in Jake's pants (legally and non-invasive of course). And he seemed to be pretty reciprocative to it and honestly appeared to be doing the same thing back to me (he poked me, pinched me, tickled me, ripped hairs out of my legs, tried unsuccessfully pushing/pulling me in the pool many times, gave me a back rub for several minutes while I sat outside alone eating lunch, etc). Unfortunately, as well as that seemed to be going, didn't make the smartest decision when I needed to vent after a bad weekend which (among MANY other things including my puppy drowning, dad ending up in the hospital, and my first ever speeding ticket) involved breaking up with the girl I had been dating at the time. His response (forgetting about the puppy and my dad) was simply ""WAIT, what girlfriend?!?"" and of course I just had to facepalm and slap myself. He seemed to forgive this for a while, but kept a bit more distance. But drama continued. About 5 weeks in, we were at a staff BBQ and we were just hanging out with the other counselors, one of whom was openly gay (Mike) and whom I happened to be friendly with (but I had no interest in him). As the night drew to a close, Jake hugged the girls goodbye, gave Mike a big hug, and then got to me, threw his arms up, and said ""I've got nothing for ya..."" Needless to say, I was pissed and so I stopped talking to him for a few days and instead talked to other counselors, mostly Mike because I just happened to be most friendly with him. By the time my steam finished blowing a few days later, he let his anger show back and stopped talking to me for the remaining weeks of camp. I was so distraught that I ended up coming out to Mike just so that he could try to help figure out what was going on. Shortly after, I came out to my now ex-girlfriend (who asked to get back together) and eventually my mom, I figured I was on a roll already and I might as well keep it up. But unfortunately, Jake and I never spoke again, to this day.

But at least I had landed another job lifeguarding and teaching at the local gym thanks to a fellow counselor who recommended me. In the meantime, I let the steam from Jake blow off for a month before I decided I ought to get back into engineering again. I was picked up by a head hunter and started work again by the end of October (while maintaining my job at the gym a few nights a week, mostly for the free membership). This company was a medium-sized, publicly traded company again in the semiconductor business. The people were much nicer, the product was more interesting (most importantly, it wasn't used to kill people), I got a $25k salary bump, and the people were more intelligent and professional. All was good for the first couple months, give or take one bad co-worker (David) and a short-lived crush on a mechanical engineer a few cubes over. Just my luck though, my original project involved working directly with David and only David, whereas the other new engineer who started the same day was able to ask for help from the whole team. David was a very difficult person to get along with. If I breathed wrong, he'd flip out at me. If the code I wrote wasn't done exactly the same way he would have done it (as though he thought I was a mind-reader), he'd blow up. I was shopping for a new car on my lunch breaks (which I desperately needed, my transmission went) and so he suggested I look into Infinity. Myself, being partial to German cars, Audi in particular, thanked him for the suggestion, but said I had it narrowed down to Audi or BMW. Like a madman with Tourette's, he blurts out ""BECAUSE YOU THINK JAPANESE CARS ARE CRAP?!?"" I said that wasn't the case, but that I simply already knew what I wanted to a degree, and he snobbishly dismissed me before munching on a bag of Doritos. This went on for quite a while until another member of the software team left and so, since my boss knew what was going on between David and I, he allowed me to fill the now vacant position. 

Around this same time, I got a random email from *[insert search-engine behemoth which rhymes with 'frugal' here]*  asking me to come in for an interview. Since I was a contractor and in contract, I couldn't just leave, so I declined the offer and told them they could ask me again in several months when (I thought) the contract would be over. For reasons outlined below, the contract dragged on for a year, but *Frugal* was persistent and kept checking in with me.

And again, things were going well. I had a lot of responsibility now, I was a junior engineer in a senior-level position (no pay-bump, but I was just glad to be away from David) who was responsible for the software and I also assisted with electrical aspects of the project. This particular project was from a different division which was moved from California (and no software or electrical engineers made the move over to NY), so I was really on my own, especially since the project was an upgrade, not new-development. Nonetheless, I chugged through and soon enough I was talking with the customer, researching new parts, and reverse-engineering circuitry which outdated the acquisition and lacked proper documentation. Overall I was proud of my performance and so were they (David was envious of my success, but I didn't really care). And then we hit a technical roadblock where the software wasn't behaving properly. The regular electrical engineer was outsourced from India, so I was the on-site eyes and ears for the electrical end of things as well. We simply could not determine if the issue was software or hardware related (or both, which ended up being the case) due to the lack of documentation and the dead reckoning both I and the EE had to do. This went on for months and the project was considerably delayed. Even before this happened, I was hitting a mental block. The long commute and simply living life in a cubicle was getting to me. But after this fell into my lap, I was a wreck again...

Try as I might, we eventually solved the problem, but it wasn't without me giving up much of my summer (or whatever summer I could have had after sitting in a cubicle all day) putting in extra hours. I got used to staying so late, I accidentally set the building alarm off (I lost my house key) after I re-entered the building at 1am. The stress was taking a toll on me and I kept questioning ""why am I doing this?"" 

I had just felt like a complete workaholic, but I had no choice. Day after day I sat there, nobody could help me because I was the only one who understood the software or the hardware; and it took weeks just to learn that. I kept convincing myself that I wasn't cut out for this and that I didn't want that lifestyle. Even prior to this, the depression had worn me out so much that I didn't know what I liked anymore, aside from boys. All my interests and hobbies were completely gone. Even detaining my car (and now cars), which I used to do so often people thought I'd polish the paint off, fell by the wayside, I haven't washed my car since the summer of 2014. I was work and work was I. My life was simply wake up, eat, gym, work, eat, work, sleep, repeat. Probably the only interest I retained from my former-self is surfing. Eventually, after months of struggling, my boss got David involved again (the only other software engineer with a good amount of electrical experience) and he didn't spare a minute in making me look like a fool and bullying his way into feeling important. 

At this point, I had started taking a Dale Carnegie class, so I just took the abuse and used it as an opportunity to apply what I learned, which, for the most part did work. But I was still beyond drained from the work. I was long-past the honeymoon-phase of the job and it was just as bad as my last place, if not, worse. I was using floppy disks regularly; I never thought I'd even say those words in the same sentence ever again, let alone touch and use a floppy disk. The tech was beyond old; they knew less about electronics than the last place; it'd probably have been easier to redesign the whole thing than keep patching it (David agreed and sympathized with me there); the customer was getting angry and the project managers were too as a result. I didn't believe in the product anymore and it was BORING (especially considering that I was 6 when the technology came out)  Eventually the company realized that it was too big a task for a kid and they put one of the more experienced contractors they used on the project. Even he said that the code was the worst thing he's ever seen in his 30+ year career. I got him to where he needed to be and offered my help should he need it (he was a really nice guy and he did need it ) and then parted ways with the company.

I put some more hours in at the gym to keep myself somewhat busy, ended up taking a week vacation with my family to Italy, and then planned a long 2-month trip on my own down to Australia and New Zealand. I had learned after Jake that if I wanted to take off from engineering, I had to actually take time off, not jump into another job right away. At that point, the depression was so bad that my choices were to go on a sabbatical of sorts, go to a mental hospital, or electro-shock therapy. I opted for the former.

The trip was the best experience of my life. Going Down Under wa smy lifelong dream and I'm fortunate that I was able to accomplish it while I was still able-bodied enough to partake in adventurous activities. I made a heaps of friends, I slept with and/or kissed God knows how many guys (including a straight boy), and I just relaxed. That's not to say I did have some mood swings here and there, and some were really bad, but for the most part I was OK so long as I watched my alcohol consumption (which I believe interacted  with my antidepressants, so I just stopped drinking all together). Most importantly, I let my guard down completely and let myself shine. No, I didn't go around with a rainbow flag up my butt, I still am and probably will always be very masculine and non-scene, but I did let my guard down about my sexual preferences and nobody cared, to my relief. I fell in love with Australia, like I knew I would, to the extent that I want to move there. While I never really quite gained my old-self back, I do have at least one interest/goal now (but once I'm there, then what?).

Now that I'm back, I'm finding myself slipping again. I've been back since the beginning of March and I've been being hounded by my parents to ""get a job!"" (aside from lifeguarding at the gym). I'm trying, but again, nothing interests me... at least nothing that'd be a ""realistic, grown-up and professional"" job that they want me to get. Having gone to college and getting an engineering degree only to work as a postal-clerk seems like a waste and makes me feel like a complete failure (as if I don't feel that way enough already). Frugal is still hounding me and I think I'm just going to turn them down again. I'm not cut out to be an engineer, nor do I want that lifestyle again (no matter how good they may treat their employees). Maybe at one point I was cut out for it, but now I cringe at the sight of code. Not to mention I don't really condone their business practices. That aside, I'll see Facebook posts of friends winning money at hackathons, having fun coding and I just yawn and move on. Speaking of money, it just doesn't drive me as it once did (and by that, I mean the monetary drive was gone a long time ago, before this depression). I've been more into the smaller things in life (tiny houses, traveling/backpacking on a budget, etc). 

Sure I love my Audis, but that's my only vice and Audi is what brings me here today. In searching for jobs on Craigslist, I saw an ad for a sales job at the local Mazda dealer. I don't really know much about Mazda, nor do I like them, but it got me thinking. Of the three things I still enjoy, they're Australia, traveling, and Audi. So I applied to the local Audi dealership and sure enough they were hiring salespeople. So I figured I had nothing to lose, I made up my resume (which has nothing to do with sales, minus my Dale Carnegie training) and went in for the interview. And while the manager was very kind and empathetic to my situation, he pretty much bluntly told me that I'm not a salesman, I'm an engineer and a good one. If anything, he said I'm an entrepreneur and I'm the kind of person that can make a difference, I don't belong in a showroom. And he proved it to me with the old ""sell me this pen,"" test. Is he right? I'd say so. But if I'm going to be this entrepreneur (which is honestly the only way I can ever see myself going back into engineering; I can't work for someone else, even if it is Frugal) I'm going to have to know some sales at least. I can invent all I want, but if I can't sell the product, I'm just wasting space and air.

While I was disappointed and flattered at the same time, I'm probably more lost now than I was before. I grabbed onto one of the last things remaining of my former self for dear life and I got some tough-love from it. Among the many pieces of advice he gave me were that no matter where I work (unless it's my own company) there's going to be something I don't like, which I already knew. But that if I want to change it, I should stick it out and aspire to (and have the confidence that I will) take the manager's/owner's place and then change things how I see fit. While that's all fair and good, I just don't like engineering anymore and now (probably everywhere I apply) I'm afraid I'll get the same advice at other places. It's definitely not bad advice, but not exactly what I wanted to hear at the moment because it's not so much that I saw things I didn't like, but because of those things, in addition to just the boredom of the field itself and the depression as a whole, my priorities are all jumbled up. What's up is down, blue is red, left is right, etc. 

Honestly, if I saw something I didn't like in a place at this point, I'd probably tell myself I'm the defective one, I don't like myself, and I should get rid of myself. The thing is, I don't even have the drive to want someone else's position or the drive to take it from them as he suggested. It's just not me and the thought of managing isn't quite me either. In each and every place I went, my job may have been shitty, but climbing the ladder seemed so much worse. Again, money isn't a driving factor for me, so what fun is there in climbing the ladder? I don't know if it'll make me any happier, but I reckon I'd be happier living in a tiny house in the outback than on millions of dollars a year. "

I would be able to finish college at Buffalo with no debt as they have given me a 5k per year scholarship and I am in state, or I could go to Purdue and, not including internships or working during the school year, I would be 100k in debt.

63dy9v,9,2017-04-04,I need to vent,[deleted],bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/63dy9v/i_need_to_vent/,"I'm having such a hard time right now. I had a pretty bad episode in the Fall that led to me taking a leave of absence for this semester, and I see my psychiatrist through the school, so I'm not allowed to see her anymore. I needed to find a new psychiatrist, but like the idiot that I am, I thought everything was okay and didn't start looking until things got bad in the past week. I called every psychiatrist in my town, none of them can take new patients. I don't have a car. The clinic that has been prescribing me meds can't do it long term, none of them are actually psychiatrists who see patients regularly. My dad might give me rides to the town he works in if we find a psychiatrist there, so that might be taken care of, but in the mean time I feel like I'm losing my mind.


I've been craving social interaction since I've gotten manic (or mixed I think). This always happens. But the few friends I have (I'm an introvert usually) can't talk to me 24/7, not even my boyfriend, everyone gets busy sometimes. I go nuts when I'm not talking to people. But I think I'm mixed, so I have little motivation to do anything besides go on the internet, as usual for mixed episodes, so I have few distractions. This symptom is very frustrating for me.


I have all this pent up energy but as I said, no motivation to do much. Before I got mixed, I realize that in retrospect I was manic, so I wrote like crazy. I took on two internships that require me to write. I haven't been able to do that since the mixed symptoms kicked in. Just zero motivation. Anyway, the pent up energy has been driving me insane, so I try to sleep it off, but I can't sleep and I just toss and turn because I have akasthesia, or however you spell it, I don't feel like checking. 


It was really good before. Good mood, writing a lot (I wrote over 50 poems in one month), picking up instruments again, asking a couple old friends to hang out again for the first time in months. Now it feels like hell. 


I've also been lying to my boyfriend about doing okay while we're apart. I told him last week about my episode because we were together, and he was a saint, buying me lots of food to encourage me to eat (I don't when I'm manic) and letting me use his laptop to keep me occupied since mine is broken and always asking if there was anything he can do. But we live in another town so I'm away from him right now, and like I said before, I really don't want him to worry. I'll see him again this week and tell him I'm still having a hard time. I just feel kind of guilty for lying right now. 


This isn't the worst episode I've had. But before I could always count on a quick adjustment and feel stable again real fast. I think I need to go on another medication, because I'm up to 400mg of Lamictal a day and my last psych told me I couldn't go much higher. I want to try Abilify, if I get the okay from a psych, but I can't do that until I find a new psychiatrist. So I have to lose my mind for now. I'm also worried it will get worse. I'm so fucking scared. Can anyone empathize, sympathize, give me advice, whatever? Thanks for reading all that if you did. "

If you do not have the patience for reading longer texts then turn away now because this is clearly not posted for you. Fair warning so please no ""too long, did not read"" comments.


The Arrowverse has long been expanded beyond just what we saw on the TV shows. There have been comic books (Arrow Season 2.5, Flash Season Zero, Dark Archer) and webshows (Vixen) that filled several gaps between seasons and episodes and significantly expanded several characters stories (For example the redemption of Huntress or the origin of Arthur King aka Malcolm Merlyn was shown exclusively in the comics)

In February 2016 the very first in-canon Arrow novel was published titled ""Arrow: Vengeance"". It was written by Oscar Balderrama (one of the Arrow writers) and Lauren Certo (who wrote for The Flash) and to me this novel is absolutely essential for every Arrow fan - particularly if you loved the early seasons of the show. The novel also reveals a lot of new details, shows various things in a much clearer light and makes you see Season 1 and especially Season 2 in a very changed way. Once I started reading it I could not put it down again and it gave me an insight into various characters and events that have forever changed my experience of Arrow.

The novel itself basically re-tells the story of Season 1 and 2 but not from the perspective of OTA (Ollie, Dig and Felicity) but instead entirely from the perspectives of the unholy trinity from Season 2 - Sebastian Blood, Isabel Rochev and most importantly SLADE WILSON. Every scene in the novel is told from the perspective of one of these three characters. There are many, many new scenes in this novel that we have never ever seen before on the show. Scenes that took place while none of our heroes were present and that shine a much greater light on the actions and mindsets of these villains. The novel explores the nature and effect of the Mirakuru in Slade in much greater detail (There are much more scenes where Slade sees ""Shado"" or reflects upon her), we see several of the key action scenes (such as Slade killing Moira or his final battle with Oliver) from Slades perspective. There are several new revelations about scenes we saw on the show. A lot of completely new dialogue too (While changing nothing from the TV show itself).

The novel makes you care about Blood, Isabel and Slade. It makes you almost root for them because you see things through their eyes. You feel the tragedies they endured to get them to where we saw them and you understand the reasons behind their fall much better. The novel turns them into very tragic characters and you will never see them in the episodes the same way again. Thats where the novels greatest strength lies.  It gives us insights into them in ways the TV show never could. 

Perhaps most importantly the novel shows us things we have never ever seen about these three characters. We see Bloods childhood and how he became inducted into the Brotherhood and the fate he delivered to his own father. We see how a 20 year old Isabel found true happiness with Robert Queen and how she was crushed and humiliated by the Queen family. We see what happened to Slade (and his family) in the 3 years between his battle with Oliver on Lian Yu and Slades arrival in Starling City. We witness the birth of Deathstroke and how he was consumed by the madness of Mirakuru.

But lets start at the beginning as we go through it from start to finish:

PART 1: DEATHSTROKE

The novel begins with the final battle between Slade and Oliver onboard the Amazo - told through Slades eyes. Slade describes how he can still feel the good, human part inside him that does not want to hurt Oliver and wants to listen to him but the Mirakuru consumes him and eats away at his humanity. Slade is actually aware of the fact that its turning him into a monster and part of him mourns that. The novel also reveals what many have always suspected - the visions that Slade sees of Shado are simply the Mirakurus evil and insanity manifesting inside his mind, taking on the form of what he wants the most in order to control him. Its almost as if the Mirakuru is a living, evil entity that seeks to manipulate Slade and tricking him into doing its bidding. Like a devil inside him taking on the form of what he yearns for the most to lure him into its arms of madness. And what Slade yearns for the most (which is seen in much more intense and sad ways in the novel then on the show) is Shado.

After Oliver leaves Slade for dead, the novel reveals what happened to Slade afterwards:

- Slade wakes again and makes it back to the island. He searches for Oliver but cannot find him. He visits the grave of Shado and the Mirakuru appears in her form, making him swear to her that he will ""keep his promise"" (Which is where Slade got this obsession from to ""keep his promises"")

- After realizing that Oliver is no longer on Lian Yu, Slade puts his old mask on a stake at the beach (The one we see in the Pilot episode) as a warning sign for Oliver and then simply starts swimming towards the mainland. He is swimming for weeks and is nearly killed by a powerful typhoon but ultimately arrives in Australia, heavily injured and weakened. An extremely interesting revelation here is the fact that the Mirakuru inside Slade has been neutralized once he arrives in Australia. The more often Mirakuru has to heal someone or is used for great feats of strength, it is depleted and by the time Slade arrives back at ASIS headquarters the Mirakuru had to heal him so often that it basically burnt itself out. This also meant that Slade lost his healing and super strength - but it also no longer drove him insane. Basically he reverted back to his old self. 

- He reports to his commander Wade deForge (who in the DC comics is Slades half-brother but on Arrow he is actually the brother of Slades former partner and best friend Bill Wintergreen) and it is revealed that Slade divorced his wife Adeline about three months before he and Billy left for Lian Yu. Wade has since then become Adelines new lover but once Slade returns home, Adeline chooses to set their old differences aside and welcomes Slade home. Slade is also lovingly embraced by his son Joe (who is about 10 years old) and is overwhelmed by his sons unconditional love for him, something Slade has not experienced in a long time. He ultimately (freed from the Mirakurus madness) chooses to take a desk job at ASIS, working in surveillance and finally finds true happiness again with his son. Even his relationship to Adeline is getting much better again and they live together as a family.

- Slade tells Wade a changed version of the truth about his time on Lian Yu. Instead of confessing that he was forced to kill Billy, he lies and says that Edward Fyers killed both Billy and Yao Fei and that Slade was the only survivor. He does not mention Oliver or Shado. Slade learns that he and Billy were sent to Lian Yu not only to save Yao Fei but also to use Fyers to gain information on ARGUS, who apparently were the ones who had hired Fyers in the first place (We learned in Season 3 that it was indeed Amanda Waller who hired Fyers to take out China White). Slade learns that ASIS considers ARGUS both a dangerous rival and enemy organization, which they wish to find and neutralize. 

- Slade meets fellow operative Digger Harkness (aka Captain Boomerang) and they often spar together. Slade is frustrated that he no longer has the strength of Mirakuru inside him. Slade is tasked to use an experimental special computer program called SIIRA, which is able to track nearly every person in the world using ASIS satellites and technology. Slade uses the program to track ARGUS activity in Hong Kong, where he witnesses the failed assassination of Tommy Merlyn. He also briefly sees Oliver on the footage, which re-ignited Slades obsession with finding Oliver and learning once and for all if he is alive or not, so he can finally leave the island in the past. Unfortunately it is revealed that the Mirakuru is still inside Slade, it just needed a long time to ""recharge"" inside him after it had been used so excessively during Slades escape from Lian Yu. As the years go on, the Mirakuru slowly comes back and starts affecting Slade more and more again. His strength returns but unfortunately he is also slowly spiraling down into obsession again - particularly the obsession to find Oliver. Things become decidedly worse when Slade starts seeing hallucinations of Oliver and nearly breaks his own sons neck when he thinks for a moment that he is Oliver.

- The origin of Slades Deathstroke armor and helmet is revealed. The suit is a custom made prototype, made by ASIS for Slade. The indestructibe metal Promethium is weaved into the suit (and his helmet is also made from that metal), which is why Deathstroke seems to be completely bulletproof when he wears the suit in the show. Nothing can penetrate that armor - no bullet, no blade and no arrow.

- Things ultimately take a horrific turn when Wade sends an ASIS team to Lian Yu to retrieve his brothers (Billy) body and through DNA tests learns that it was actually Slade who killed Billy. Wade learns about Oliver and Shado as well and about the fact that Slade has recently been using the SIIRA program to find Oliver - which was completely unauthorized. Wade confronts Slade at his home in Perth with an entire platoon of ASIS agents and reveals to Adeline what Slade has really done and also tells her about Shado. Adeline is shocked and horrified by Slades actions and Wade wants to take Slade in for questioning. Tensions are running extremely high, when suddenly a News Report on the TV reveals that Oliver has turned up alive in Starling City. This finally makes Slade completely snap and he brutally attacks and kills several agents as he tries to shoot and slice his way through them to get to Starling City. Wade and the agents open fire and a massive fight breaks out. During the fight, Adeline is hit in the head by a stray bullet and instantly dies. This enrages both Slade and Wade even more and Slade ultimately brutally executes Wade by shooting him several times through the abdomen point blank. Too late he realizes that his son Joe stood behind Wade and was hit by Slades bullets as well. His son collapses in a pool of blood and dies in Slades arms. After killing all the agents, the Mirakuru takes completely hold of Slade again and appears to him once again in the form of Shado who tricks Slade into believing that the death of his beloved family is Olivers fault as well, elevating his hatred for Oliver to a whole new level. 

- Slade steals his new ASIS armor and travels to Starling City, where he arrives only days after Olivers return. Which in fact means that Slade was actually already in the city during the entire Season 1 of Arrow ! He begins closely tracking and observing Oliver, watching him , his friends and his family and learning every possible detail about them. Slade also investigates Olivers past activities and learns about all the things he did in Hong Kong and Russia, which convinces him more then ever that Oliver has turned into a ruthless killer, who only hides his true nature behind the facade of the heroic Arrow. Slade swears to expose Oliver for the monster he truly is and make him pay for all his crimes, deceptions, lies and betrayals (This is of course extremely ironic, considering how much this is exactly what Season 5 is currently about as well). 

- Slade spends most of Season 1 gathering intel on Oliver, the people in his life and the city itself while also using his new armor to work as a highly expensive mercenary across the globe, ultimately becoming so effective, famous (and rich) that he draws the attention of ARGUS who name him ""Deathstroke"".


PART 2: ISABEL

The story then continues by exploring the character of Isabel Rochev. While she was mostly hated on the show, the novel turns her into a very complex, tragic and fascinating character and quite frankly even one of the best female characters Arrow has ever had. By the end of it her death actually made me very sad because the novel really makes you feel for her and even rooting for her to find redemption - even though you know that she wont.

- Her Part starts with Isabel learning that Oliver is alive and has returned to Starling - and that Robert Queen is dead. Although it is later revealed that Isabel and Merlyn actually worked together to have the Queens Gambit sabotaged, the realization that Robert is dead still hits her hard.

- The story then flashes back over 10 years into the past to the year 2004 (3 years before Oliver was shipwrecked) where we meet a much younger Isabel who is an intern at Queen Consolidated who is briliiant and ambitious but also incredibly meek and shy. She accidentally runs into Robert Queen who is almost instantly quite taken by her. Robert later invites her to become his protege and assistant (When Isabel later in the present sees Felicity being Olivers assistant, the irony is not lost on her). Isabel spends months with Robert who trains her into an extremely formidable business woman that exceeds his expectations and the sexual tension between them is extremely high. Isabel secretely yearns for him but does not dare to act on it. However it is eventually Robert who takes the initiative and invites Isabel to the Queen mansion while Moira and the kids are not at home. Here he essentially seduces her and they sleep together. This leads to Isabel hopelessly falling in love with Robert.

- Isabel and Robert continue their relationship/affair for another year and she lives in complete bliss and happiness, especially since Robert keeps also telling her that he loves her and wants to be with her forever. He ultimately tells her that he wants to leave Moira for her and start over with Isabel far away from Starling. Isabels happiness is boundless and they board a private jet the next day to start their new life together, with Robert seemingly wanting to leave his family for her. However then Robert learns that Thea is in the hospital and leaves to be with her, promising Isabel that they would leave on the next day instead. What follows is an utter nightmare for Isabel that leaves her shattered and humiliated beyond comprehension. When she arrives with her packed bags at Queen Consolidated the next day, she is informed by Walter Steele that she has been fired from the company and is never allowed to return or bother Robert ever again - who has drastically changed his mind and decided to rather have a life with his children then with Isabel and thus cast her away.

- Isabel is seething with anger and pain and confronts Moira at the mansion, who tells her that Isabel has been fooled by Robert the entire time who has done this to many other women before her as well. Faced with Roberts betrayal, Moiras disdain and the realization that Robert has done this to her in favor for his family, Isabel develops an intense hatred for the Queens and blackmails Moira (as Isabel knows that Thea is Merlyns daughter) into giving her the resources to jumpstart her own company (Stellmoor International). She vows to one day take Roberts company away from him and sit on his throne, just as he once promised her that she would. She later conspires with Malcolm Merlyn in 2007 to sabotage the Queens Gambit to get her revenge on the man who destroyed her heart.

- The story returns to the present where Isabel takes in the confirmation of Olivers return. Later in the parking garage she is approached by Slade Wilson, who offers her to join him to destroy the Queens and everything they ever held dear so they would both get their righteous revenge. Isabel is hesitant at first but when Slade convinces her that she suffered because Robert chose Oliver over her (like Oliver chose Sara over Shado, though Slade never mentions Shado to Isabel) and that he can make her stronger and give her control of Queen Consolidated, a vengeful Isabel, who secretely always wanted those to suffer that Robert broke her heart for agrees to work with Slade.

- Over the course of Season 1, Slade secretely sets up a training facility in Central City where he brutally and relentlessly trains Isabel into a hardened, cunning and ruthless warrior. On the business side he directs her as well, guiding her to buy as many of Queen Consolidated subsidiaries as she can until she controls 45 % of the companys stock. 


PART 3: BLOOD

- This part begins with a meeting of Sebastian Blood and his acolytes from the Church of Blood at the start of Season 2 before flashing back far into the past into the year 1994. This is where it gets really interesting as Bloods childhood is revealed. He was abused by his alcoholic father and even dreamed about him, picturing him as some form of demon in his dreams (Bloods mask is a reflection of that same demonic face from his dreams actually). He ran away from home when he was 10 years old and was found by a teenager named Cyrus Gold , who would go on to become Bloods best friend (Btw in the DC Comics Cyrus later became the indestructibe, undead supervillain Solomon Grundy). Cyrus introduced Blood to a priest named Father Trigon, who was running an orphanage in the Glades of Starling City.

(Trivia: In the DC Comics Trigon is actually one of the most powerful demon lords of hell and the father of DC superheroine Raven as well as a regular enemy of heroes such as Zatanna, John Constantine or the Teen Titans. Arrows writers named Father Trigon after the demon lord as a tribute to the comics character)

- Trigon secretely also was the leader of a cult known as the Church of Trigon and when Sebastian returned home and was nearly killed by his abusive father, Trigon (masked as a ""devil"" - another homage to the comic Trigon) and Cyrus attacked and brutally beat Sebastians father. Trigon then urged Sebastian to kill his father to ""deliver the rightful wrath of god"". Sebastian shot his father in cold blood and was subsequently inducted into Trigons cult as his personal apprentice (named Brother Blood), while Sebastians mother ended up in a mental institution (where we meet her in Season 2). Many years later after Trigons death, Sebastian took his place as leader of the cult and renamed it into the Church of Blood.

- It is also revealed that Sebastian is not really an evil person but someone who loves the Glades and despises the rich elite of Starling City for letting the people of the Glades suffer while they enjoy their luxuries. Sebastian is driven by a strong urge to create a better city and to fight for the people living in poverty and especially for the Glades and he believes that his work as Brother Blood and the lives they take is a necessary evil that serves a greater good to make life ultimately better for all the people in the city, not just the rich. Because of his disdain for the social elite he comes to especially despise Moira Queen.

- It is for this reason and Bloods political influence at City Hall that he is eventually approached by Slade and Isabel during the events of Season 1, who offer him the position of Mayor and an army to take back the city from the corrupt elite and reshape it as he sees fit. However Sebastian does not trust Slade and initially declines the offer, believing that he does not need their help.

- When the Undertaking takes place at the end of Season 1, Sebastian witnesses the destruction of the Glades and the deaths firsthand and after realizing that Merlyn and Moira are behind this atrocity, he calls up Slade and tells him ""I'm in. Give me my army so I can take my city back"". And so the unholy Trinity is complete and the stage for Season 2 is set.



PART 4: REVENGE

This part is basically now a re-telling of Season 2 but from the sole perspective of Slade, Isabel and Blood. There are several new scenes between those three characters that we have never seen on the show that reveal just how much Slade was really masterminding virtually everything that happened in the city. Here are several new revelations from the novel about Season 2:

- It was because of Slades machinations that Felicity and Diggle found Oliver on Lian Yu at the start of Season 2. It was essential for Slade that Oliver would return to the city, which is why he had Isabel threaten to take over Queen Consolidated. Slade knew that when the legacy of Olivers family was in danger that he would come running again. It was Slade who secretely directed Felicity and Dig to Lian Yu and gave them Olivers location. In fact Slade himself was ALSO on the island, watching Oliver, Felicity and Diggle. After the three left the island, Slade went to visit Shados grave (where he also spotted Taianas grave)

- There are several new scenes of Slade experiencing visions of Shado (who are really just manifestations of the Mirakuru and its madness) and its made clear that he still suffers enormously from her loss. He grows frustrated that the visions always disappear again and the Mirakuru/Shado tells him ""Its because of Oliver that I have to leave you"" which only intensifies Slades hatred for Oliver.

- It is revealed that Deathstroke was working with China White and the Triad. He was paying them to steal medical supplies for him, which he then destroyed in order to pressure Blood and make him more desperate to save the city.

- When Isabel sees that Oliver did not kill China White but had her arrested instead, she expresses doubt wether Oliver truly is a killer. Slade however insists that Oliver is only hiding from what he truly is and vows to bring out Olivers true nature and expose him for the violent murderer he truly is behind the hero facade (This is very ironic considering that this is exactly what Adrian Chase has now done)

- The scene where Deathstroke kills Alexi Leonev from the Bratva and then places him in his own office for Oliver to find is shown in detail (The scene was also referenced in a recent Season 5 episode). Also the scene where Deathstroke attacks the Iron Heights prison bus is longer in the novel. It is shown how Deathstroke commands the criminals to come with him and become his army and when one of them refuses, Deathstroke kills him instantly. This also explains why his army followed every one of Slades orders without question.

- Everything Isabel does during Season 2 , especially in regards to Oliver and the company is on orders of Slade, who is directing her and masterminding her strategy and every move. Even when Isabel seems to be sympathetic to Oliver (such as in Russia), she only did so because Slade instructed her to do so. On the flipside Slade comes to view Isabel as his student and (unlike with Blood) is very proud of her. Which is why he later brings her back from the brink of death with Mirakuru after she is shot by Diggle. Because in Slades mind she earned it. There is later also a scene where Slade gives her her own costume and mask and dubs her ""Ravager"" (a name used in the comics by Slades daughter Rose actually), which fills Isabel with great pride. However Isabel later realizes (shortly before her death), that ultimately she was just a tool for Slade when he abandons her to the League of Assassins and his crusade against Oliver had always been a much higher priority for Slade then her wellbeing. Something she realizes far too late.

- While Isabel wants to destroy the Queens and especially hates Oliver and Felicity (she expresses several times how much she wanted to be the one to kill Moira and Felicity), she shows a lot of genuine sympathy for Thea and at one point even mentions how she secretely hopes that Thea makes it out of the city alive.

- Its revealed that Sebastian did not want his friend Cyrus Gold to be used as testsubject for Mirakuru but Cyrus insisted. Sebastian is enormously devastated by Cyrus´death later on, developing an intense hatred for the Arrow and its revealed that it was Sebastian who sought out Count Vertigo and gave him explicit instructions to kill the Arrow (which would later incur Slades wrath)

- It is also revealed that the Arrow copycats killed Mayor Altman due to Slades and Blood machinations so Blood could take over City Hall.

- The novel shows the moment where Slade tells Thea that Merlyn is her father.

- The novel reveals that Slade was secretely listening in on almost all of Olivers communications, including his conversations with Team Arrow and ARGUS. This often allowed Slade to always be several steps ahead.

- During the finale there are new scenes between Slade, Laurel and Felicity. Slade has conversations with both of them before he faces Oliver for the final battle. Slade reveals to Laurel that Oliver kept staring at her picture on Lian Yu and that she has a very special place reserved just for her in his heart. Slade tells her that her death will bring Oliver unimaginable pain (which is of course very dark foreshadowing of Laurels eventual fate in Season 4). 

- When Slade meets Felicity face to face he is incredibly disappointed how such a ""scared, frail twig"" could have won Olivers heart and considers her even a waste for his blade. He does however come to respect the loyalty and inner strength that she displays. When Felicity asks him why he is keeping both her and Laurel, Slade replies that its simply much more fulfilling to make Oliver suffer twice.

- Its revealed that Slade did not know that ARGUS would attack the city. His initial plan was for his army to simply burn the city to the ground. Slade is almost relieved when ARGUS attacks and freed from the Mirakurus madness, in the end Slade really just WANTS to be killed so his suffering can be finally over and he can find peace. He is bitterly disappointed when ARGUS abandons their attack and Oliver refuses to kill Slade as Slade believes that only death can truly free him from what he has become.

63ejev,2,2017-04-04,Looking For Internship In London - Kinda lost!,blueorangejuice,graphic_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/graphic_design/comments/63ejev/looking_for_internship_in_london_kinda_lost/,"Hello lovely stranger,


I'm in my last year of graphic design school in Italy and I'm looking for a curricular unpaid internship in London. (I want to move there as soon as I finish Uni)

So I made a portfolio of my works, a CV, and I started contacting studios. I've sent e-mails to studios that said they were looking for interns and to studios that didn't, I called many of them afterwards to make sure that my e-mail was being taken into consideration, and I was told over and over that I would get answers, or that my application was being processed, but no-one ever replied (Which I understand: it would be a hassle to get back to each person whose application you decline).


I must clearly be doing something wrong, therefore I thought I might ask you lovely people for some advice.


- Am I looking in the wrong places? Is there any resource that people in my situation are using that I'm oblivious of? I went through all the nice studios that I knew of, job seeking sites, LinkedIn...

- I have a feeling that all of those studios that are looking for someone have a graduate intern in mind, so I don't fit the role. Also, my internship should only last about one month and a half, while most ads are for 3 to 6 months.

- I think that there's the possibility that just like my university has relationships with many studios in the area, London's design schools would also have channels of communication between their students and the agencies, so they would have the precedence over me.

- Would people assume that my English might not be good enough for communicating in a working environment?

- Is it because of my portfolio (http://docdro.id/kQGZzTE)? Most of my works are school projects, I surely have a lot to learn still and I really want to.


Is there a chance you're more acquainted with the London graphic design scene and/or have any suggestions or critiques for me? I just... I don't want to give up until I've tried everything!


Thank you so much for reading about my struggles!

Many of our colleges however are only sinkholes for student loans and for the left to push there propaganda.

Why not go back to apprenticeship programs?  People can intern or start at a very low wage and be taught at the same time and the ones who show more promise will naturally excel well the ones who don't will need to move on to something else.

I guess I view colleges as more of a problem then a solution.  Their costs are outrageous and they've become hives of indoctrination.  

Maybe this is a bad idea, I don't know, but I know many people here feel similar and it would be nice to hear what other ideas people may have."

Around the end of June to end of September.

My girlfriend is doing an internship at Stuttgart University and I am basically dipping into my savings and just coming along for the ride.

We currently live in Dundee, Scotland.

The problem is that we don't really speak German. I know a little bit from high school, and it is coming back to me as i research, but that was over ten years ago so its flakey at best.
we are really struggling to find websites or links that can help us locate a flat in Stuttgart.
We are literally looking for anything.
Whether that's a flat with a bunch of party students or a small bed sit, it doesn't really matter as we are keen to make friends and enjoy ourselves but at the same time can easily live somewhere quieter. it doesn't really matter too much.

If anyone can possibly link me to some good sources I would appreciate that. I've been googling for about three weeks now and its really confusing me but then it occurred to me Stuttgart probably has its own reddit page and someone out there might be keen to help me.

anyway. sorry if i have broken any rules of this subreddit but if anyone has any info and time to hook me up that would be amazing.

or even if your happy to take in a friendly, young couple keen to use your home as a base to explore the region.

We are 25 and 30 respectively and can afford around up to é700 rent a month (give or take a few euro)

thanks for taking the time to read this.

I've also Applied for a summer internships which has been hard to obtain.Decided to take the college road since you can't really do anything career wise without a degree now a days unless you open up your own business.

In the end I want to work In a career where I can have a bright future and learn something out of the ordinary everyday.

I've been in the Navy and discharged for a positive urinalysis for THC in 2010 at the age of 18. Moved to Florida then got arrested for reckless driving which is a misdemeanor then another time for a felony charge for carrying a concealed firearm without a permit. Although the judge did let me get a bite of the apple and got my adjudication withheld which means once I completed my probation period which I have done, I can legally put I'm NOT convicted of the charge. It will show up on my background as a charge but adjudication was withheld. I'm not here to sugar coat any charges, I've done the actions and yes I did my time and like I said before I do take full responsibility.

I want to move on with my life and going to college is a HUGE step in my life. I'm wondering if my past will hurt my chances in the corporate world? Or getting a job in the I.T field in the NYC area. I'm a personal trainer now and I work right across the waters from NYC and I get to see all these people walking around after work enjoying their lives, being productive all day, enjoying drinks, nice suits and all that.

I am about a week sober from weed, I am stopping because I got my dream internship this summer and do not want to fail the drug test. The hardest two things for me are that I live with 50 dudes in a fraternity that smoke a lot of pot, and falling asleep without smoking. The first problem is remedied by telling all my friends I'm quitting and they help support me by making sure I don't smoke. But falling asleep was very hard for me at first because for the past year I have been falling asleep while high. Recently to help me fall asleep I have been going on a short run around 9pm. This has been helping me feel more tired and my body knows it requires rest. Hope this tip helps others out there that had the same problem as me! Peace."

I was kind of a fuck up in HS, I was on pace to finish well my first three years, but after an injury messed up my partial scholarship, I started fucking off and doing drugs my senior year. I managed to graduate but did not go to college. The kids who I had known, and who I thought were my friends all but dropped contact with me. Whenever I would try to visit someone who was within driving distance, they always found a reason not to. I get it, college is new and exciting. Whatever, it made me depressed, but I couldn't change how they felt.

I wallowed in self-pity for about a year before having a come to Jesus moment. I stopped trying to get together with my old ""friends"". I ended up taking an accelerated IT program and got an internship after the 10 month class. The company hired me after.

That was in 2004, I have been with the same company since then, and have worked my way up from a grunt to the Director of IT. I started making 6 figures at the age of 29, and just last week got another raise, putting me behind only the owners of my company in terms of pay. I am 33 at the moment, but they are grooming me to take over the reins (25-30 mil a year company)

On the other hand, many of the kids I knew who went off to college have crap jobs and are constantly complaining on bookface. Maybe 1 or 2 are actually succeeding, one is an anesthesiologist and another is a lawyer. And there I am, no degree, just hard work, getting ready to buy a vacation condo in addition to my house, minding my own business. I don't speak to any of them, but it just feels good deep down to know I proved them wrong. "

I am almost complete with my undergraduate studies and will be graduating with B.A. in Biology with concentration in Bioinformatics. Initially I was on a pre-med track but decided medical school wasn't for me. I decided to pursue Bioinformatics after taking an Intro to C++ class. In high school I took Intro to Python and the C++ rejuvenated a lot of the same excitement I experienced in high school. I'm not really interested in doing research, which is a lot of Bioinformatics people I've spoken to do. Instead I'm really interested in the technical side of software engineering. Ideally I'd love to find an internship for software engineering or CS but given my background I'm not sure how to navigate.

Relevant CS courses I've taken are Bio related and not to mention pretty limited, e.g. Perl, SQL. 

I'm thinking I can create a portfolio and be more active on github and stackoverflow. Have thought about graduate school and pursuing a master's in CS but a lot of the programs require a background in CS or mathematics. I've also considered enrolling in a bootcamp post-grad as well. 

I appreciate any thoughts you have!"
63g903,0,2017-04-04,My [24M] girlfriend [25F] is upset about my the possibility of an old ex [24F] crashing at my place for a few nights; feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place...,Greatwhite194,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/63g903/my_24m_girlfriend_25f_is_upset_about_my_the/,"Hi r/relationships, long-time lurker, first-time poster. I'm hoping that the collective wisdom of the internet can help me craft a solution to a problem that has surfaced in my current relationship.


I have been dating my current girlfriend for a little over 1.5 years, and we are very happy together. We actually met while she was an intern at the company that I work for, and started dating shortly after it ended. She is loving, beautiful, kind, and selfless, and I'm very lucky to have found someone so unique and incredible. We are both interested in cultivating our relationship into a life-long partnership, and I am genuinely considering marriage in the next couple of years. I love her so much, it's crazy.


Unfortunately, even strong relationships have trouble and face unforeseeable tests. We both try to provide positive reinforcement and support for each other both emotionally and physically, but my girlfriend suffers from a lack of self-confidence and the associated personal insecurities that go with it. She constantly compares herself with the other people in our lives, and gets depressed when she feel like she doesn't measure up. I have tried to communicate that I'm not interested in comparing her to anyone else, and she has started to see a therapist to work through the jealousy and unhappiness which stem from her insecurities. This is not a quick or simple process, which we are both aware of, but I am hopeful that it will help her to see how amazing she is.


Enter my problem. A few weeks ago, an ex-gf of mine contacted me to ask if she and a few friends could crash at my place, which I share with two friends (25M/26M), for a few days while attending a grad-school based conference in the city that I live in. I have been friends with this ex-gf for over a decade, we dated in highschool and had a serious relationship that ended in college. Although the breakup was a little messy, we have since forgiven each other and moved on to being friends (as much as two people who don't see each other more often than a few days every couple of years can be friends). I feel that I am completely over her; I have no romantic interest in her regardless of my current relationship status, and she is aware of my sentiment and feels the same way. This is why I didn't believe it would be a big deal to lend a helping hand and provide a crash pad in my living room for my ex and her two friends. However, when I asked my girlfriend if she would be comfortable with me sharing my home, she was absolutely livid. Despite the fact that I had made no commitment about offering the space, she was furious that I would think it was okay to even ask her about it, and told me that no one in their right mind would ever even consider something like this. I did not expect this reaction and was taken aback, and told her that I was confused and hurt that she would be so angry and mistrusting when I've demonstrated nothing but happiness and trustworthiness the entire time we've been together.


It's been a few weeks since we fought, and although I have offered a compromise (I would stay at my gf's place while they visit and will not spend any alone time with my ex-gf), my girlfriend is still jealous and upset, and I don't know what I can do other than tell my ex not to come. I have lots of other female friends, and I worry that if I let my gf dictate who I can and can't see now, I'm setting a precedent of giving up friendships or other parts of my life because of her insecurity, not because they are bad for our relationship.

I know this was a long post, longer than I expected it to be, but if you've read through it and have any suggestions or advice, I would sincerely appreciate any help that can be offered.

I went for a semester abroad and didn't have anyone to watch him at my place so I had my stepmom take care of him. She has two other cats so didn't mind watching him for a few months. When I got back, I ended up getting an internship for the summer so she just kept him through the summer. At the end of summer I graduated college and moved back in with my mom. My mom has two dogs who are super sweet but are bigger and love to chase things so whenever I would bring the cat around they would try to chase him and Beans would get scared. This lead to me keeping him cooped up in my room. He didn't seem to mind because he would cuddle with me whenever I was there and sit under the bed when I was not. So as I mentioned I have been living with my mom since around August and felt that I didn't want to keep the cat locked up in my room so my stepmom has been watching him since I initially went abroad (January 2016). However, my stepmom's two cats hate him and hiss at him whenever he is near. I didn't have to work for three days so I decided to take my cat for those days so I could hang out with him I haven't lived with him in over a year. Over the three days he was so happy to see me and was super cuddly. However, I've been thinking lately about keeping him. I wasn't sure if that would be unfair to him by keeping him locked up in my room when i'm not around. I always try to get him to come out but as soon as he sees the dogs he runs under the bed. Would it be a better choice to leave him with my stepmom, even though her cats hate him, because he'd have the entire house to run around in? Or could I keep him with me? he loves being with me but he'd be cooped up in my room all the time"

I've been offered an internship at Cerner and will be graduating soon. I know that if you do a good job they'll ask you for a full time position. I had some questions regarding what to expect in terms of salary and job growth.

I am a soon to be college graduate from a difficult CS/engineering school, I will technically be considered to have zero corporate experience. However, I have 8+ years of self taught programming experience in several software fields, and have done some work on campus with programming for pay through the university.

* 1] What is a reasonable salary for introduction level software engineers? Glassdoor ranges from 38K to 89K, so the data seems a bit skewed. Would Cerner consider my non-corporate programming experience heavily or with a grain of salt in negotiations? Realistically, what is the bottom and top salaries you have personally heard for B.S. CS grads?
* 2] Regarding raises, how often are they to be expected, or not at all?
* 3] Software Architects -- happy with your job? Or stressful business politics? Additionally, what was the merit that warranted you receiving the position? Is there even more room for growth? How long were you with the company?
* 4] Have many people been there in software for decades, or does Cerner try to grab the cheap graduates?
* 5] Easy to get placed into something you want to do? Love networking, security, and low level languages.
* 6] Good managers, bad managers, any stories?
* 7] I see many people do 48 hours a week to keep management happy. Can any of this be done from home?

Any other relevant information would be nice. You don't have to answer all of the questions, I'm a curious fellow and doing as much research as I can. 

Thanks."

**Edit:**

Mein Kumpel hat den Laptop dann zu einem Reparaturladen gebracht. Dort haben sie ihn auch super schnell reparieren können.

This is a follow-up to a previous scenario in which the Republic of China increases bilateral cooperation with Germany and eventually, along with the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires participates in the First World War, leading to a Central Powers victory. This scenario will look at the world following the First World War.

The territorial changes and concessions following the war are as follows:

1. Germany's concessions include much of the French, British, and Belgian colonial possessions in sub-Saharan Africa. Known as ""Mittelafrika"", the goal of this land grab was to geographically link Germany's colonies in South West Africa, German East Africa, and Kamerun, resulting in a near German dominance of the continent. New states are established in the Maghreb, as the Sultanate of Morocco is reinstated as a German protectorate, along with Algeria (renamed the Barbary State). In the Pacific, the British colonies in the western Pacific, including Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and the New Hebrides (Vanuatu), the Australian mandate of the Territory of Papua (southern New Guinea), and the French possessions of New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna are transferred to German control and consolidated as the Imperial German Pacific Protectorate. In addition to this, the rubber-producing island of Ceylon, along with its strategic naval base at Negombo is taken from Britain, giving Germany unprecedented control of the Indian Ocean. In Europe, the Baltic states and Poland are annexed, opening the door for thousands of German settlers. Additionally, a German puppet government is established in Belgium and Ukraine, and Paris and northern France are temporarily occupied. This marks the beginning of Germany's status as a superpower.

2. Austria-Hungary seizes Serbia and the Italian city of Venice. Romania also falls into the Austro-Hungarian sphere of influence. While seeing the fewest actual territorial changes of the Central Powers, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was arguably the most unstable, with ethnic nationalism threatening to tear the country apart even before the onset of the First World War.

3. The Ottoman Empire reestablishes control of Egypt after nearly a century of foreign domination. In Africa, the Italian colony of Libya falls into Ottoman possession, in addition to the northern half of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and Italian Eritrea. The Caucasian states are transferred to Ottoman control, and possession of Cyprus, the islands of the Aegean, and Western Thrace are guaranteed to the Empire from Greece; they themselves falling under the Ottoman sphere of influence, with the eventual goal of establishing a vassal state or reestablish direct control. Nearly a decade of Bulgarian independence is ended as the Empire breaks its wartime ties and reestablishes control by occupying the country, as well as Albania and the former territories of Epirus and Macedonia. The Muslim Turkic regions of Central Asia are also reorganized into puppet states and divided with China as the weakening Russian Empire loses its grip on regional control. While unable to provide support following their withdrawal from the region, the seeds of Arab nationalism planted by the British Empire have sprouted, requiring the attention of the fragile empire.

4. China's involvement in the war had contributed to an early Russian withdrawal, as the invasion of the Russian Far East had drawn much needed manpower from the Eastern Front against Germany, resulting in a near total collapse of Russian resistance. China's territorial concessions include the seizure of all of Outer Manchuria, including the strategic cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, the Ili River Valley, much of the Fergana and Semirechye Oblasts (roughly modern-day Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan), and the Russian naval base at Port Arthur. The return of Hong Kong and French enclave of Guangzhouwan is a point of national prestige, as well as the return of Taiwan from Japan. Parts of the mountainous Shan and Kachin states of British Burma are also seized as a buffer from British incursion. In addition to the territorial concessions, Chinese influence over Korea is resumed after a forced Japanese withdrawal, and the de facto independence of Tibet is ended with the mandatory departure of all British diplomatic and economic ties, with the goal of eventual reintegration with the rest of the country. Although plagued by internal conflict, including regional warlords controlling parts of the country, China's cooperation with Germany and recent victory have made it more militarily and nationally cohesive than in our own timeline. While not a military or industrial superpower, it is significantly less fragile, having held firm against the upstart power of Japan, the Russian Empire, and colonial troops diverted from other theaters such as Gallipoli and the Western Front, including from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and those of the French Colonial Empire.

5. The Italian, British, and French colonies in the Horn of Africa are granted to the Ethiopian Empire in exchange for stronger bilateral ties with Germany. This leads to greater industrialization and a stronger position.

6. Isolated after the German victory seized much of British-controlled southern Africa,  the dominion of South Africa finds itself in a precarious situation. Afrikaner nationalists had always detested British rule, stemming from the Second Boer War (1899-1902) in which Germany provided much support to the Boer cause. Further resentment was caused by the forced entry of South Africa as a dominion of the British Empire against its once ally Germany. Following the end of the First World War, German efforts in South Africa work to destabilize the government, supporting Afrikaner nationalists, eventually leading to the end of South Africa's dominion status and departure from the British Empire. The new South African government quickly took control of the last two imperial possessions of the British Empire on the African continent: the colony of Basutoland (modern-day Lesotho) and the protectorate of Swaziland.


THE POSTWAR WORLD:


GERMANY:

The victory of the Central Powers in the First World War had cemented Germany's ascendancy to superpower status, taking Britain's place as the premier global empire. Its colonial acquisitions in Africa brought untold resources to the country, setting the stage for a postwar economic boom. However, the thriving economy and the seeming invincibility of Germany as the exhausted and weakened rulers of Europe feared German might belied the reality that the seeds of discontent within its own borders had been sown by growing nationalism and the hubris of German empire-building. In the Baltic states, ethnic German minority rule had been a fact of life since the days of the Teutonic Order. However, the German institutionalization of the status of Baltic Germans as a privileged class provided the growing nationalist movements a cause worth fighting for as ethnic Lithuanians, Latvians, and Estonians chafed under German rule. Similar developments in Poland were exacerbated by the plan for German settlers to expand eastward, eventually displacing ethnic Poles in a policy known as ""Lebensraum"" (Living Space), the goal of providing more land for living and food production to feed the German people. The further humiliation of France, particularly after many had hoped for revenge for the earlier Franco-Prussian War (1871), had shattered all hopes for a French revival. This included the annexation of further parts of Alsace-Lorraine, including a majority of the coal and iron-producing regions of the country. Under a plan known as the Septemberprogramm, the German Empire further established itself as the new great power of continental Europe by annexing both Luxembourg and eastern Belgium. Other terms of the plan included the vassalization of both Belgium and Ukraine. Further south, the sheer size of the German megaproject of Mittelafrika meant establishing control would be difficult. Spanning nearly the entire continent of Africa, the potential for far-flung rebellions would stretch the empire's military capabilities to its limit, though the employment of millions of Askaris (native African soldiers in German service) both at home and in its colonies meant manpower was never in short supply. Even after all these developments, Germany remained one of the most stable and prosperous of the Central Powers, often deploying its military to suppress rebellions and uprisings in its neighboring allies' territory.


OTTOMAN EMPIRE:

The Ottoman Empire, though largely secured from outside threats as Britain withdrew from the region and Russia's military projection capabilities had been nearly destroyed, faced internal strife from nationalist movements such as the British-backed Arab Revolt. Additionally, it had become known for over half a century as the Sick Man of Europe, falling into a period of military, political, and economic decline as various powers stripped away more territory from its dying corpse. However, the economic boom experienced by Germany and the bilateral cooperation reinvigorated the empire, saving it at least momentarily from collapse. The military and industrial reforms with the assistance of Germany eventually brought short-term stability and prosperity to the region, cemented by the eventual discovery of oil in the Ottoman territories of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Libya, the Caucasus, and the Arabian Peninsula. With this newfound power and influence, the Empire was keen to reassert its claim over territories lost during its half-century of steep decline. Though nominally allies during the war, the declaration of independence by Bulgaria in 1908 was protested heavily by the Ottoman Empire, as much of its remaining European territory was stripped away during the First Balkan War (1912-1913), including the territories of Epirus, Macedonia, and Albania. With the reintegration of Albania after power was seized by the pro-Ottoman Essad Pasha Toptani, German support of Bulgaria ceased as the Ottoman Empire was viewed as the new rising regional power, allowing the new country to be completely overrun by Ottoman forces. While Greek independence was assured by its capable and experienced military, the country, only breaking free of Ottoman rule a century before, found itself surrounded, and could do little but once again accept the suzerainty of the Empire. Reduced to little more than a rump state as more of its territories were stripped away, its king, Constantine I, was effectively relegated to the role of client ruler, ultimately surrendering much of the government's administrative power to the Ottoman Empire. Torn from the carcass of the dying Russian Empire, the Turkic oblasts of Central Asia were divided between Chinese and Ottoman domination as puppet states were formed, with control cemented by a growing sense of Turkish nationalism. This also allowed uninterrupted overland trade between China and the Ottoman Empire, likened to a new Silk Road. In the North Caucasus, the recognition of the Ottoman Caliph by the Muslim regions of Chechnya, Dagestan, and others guaranteed regional instability. Motivated by the rich oil fields of the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, the Ottoman military presence in the region increased greatly, though the fiercely defiant Najd region, home to the Al-Saud family, remained a constant struggle for control. The stunning victories of the once dying empire sent shockwaves throughout the world, including the introduction of pro-Ottoman sentiments and factions into Balkan politics among the Muslim population, who mere decades before had agitated for nationalistic secession. The Ottoman Empire, in a span of less than a decade, had gone from crumbling relic to the dominant regional power. However, this revival did not completely extinguish the fires of nationalism, as no economic prosperity could erase the centuries of often violent conquest and subjugation in the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the Arab world. Despite the momentary economic success and renewed regional power, the Ottoman Empire would require considerable force to return to the complete peace and stability of its glory days.


CHINA:

China's entry in the war on the side of the Central Powers had been a rude surprise to the colonial powers in the region. China was widely regarded as an ancient and antiquated land locked in time by the power of the conservative Qing court, kept in check by the string of defeats handed to them from Britain in the Opium Wars in 1841 and 1858 and Japan during the Sino-Japanese War in 1895 in what became known as the Century of Humiliation. The German desire to counter British influence in the region in the form of an alliance with the newly industrialized Japan, however, lead to German cooperation with China throughout the 19th century, despite the growing ineffectiveness of the Imperial Qing Dynasty government. When the monarchy was overthrown in 1912, Germany was quick to establish ties with the Republic of China lead by the revolutionary Sun Yat Sen, who championed the values of modern secular humanism. After small reforms to the military and government under the supervision of German advisors, the country seemed increasingly capable of holding its own against the colonial empires, as the overwhelming majority of the manpower and resources of these countries were reallocated to closer theaters such as the Western Front. With a large portion of the army was in Manchuria pushing into the Russian Far East or forcing Japanese forces back towards the border with Korea, it was believed that an invasion of China from the south would sufficiently disrupt the country as to cause an early withdrawal from the war. An invasion force, consisting almost entirely of colonial troops diverted from elsewhere, was assembled in French Indochina. What was originally anticipated to be an afterthought in the Allied road to victory, however, soon developed into an embarrassing blunder as the growing demand for manpower drained vital supplies and troops from more decisive conflicts in France, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. A combination of inadequate secondhand equipment issued to the mainly colonial soldiers, an unfamiliar climate, and the preparedness of the Chinese army ultimately resulted in the total defeat and withdrawal of the invasion force, the majority of whom were either redeployed to other fronts or recalled to garrison duty in Indochina as anticolonial guerrillas had taken advantage of the departure of many of the colony's troops. The victory over the colonial powers was celebrated after nearly a century or humiliating defeats and asymmetrical treaties, as well as nearly 300 years of Imperial domination by non-Chinese rulers, creating a new national identity. Although control over much of the country by local warlords still hindered the complete implementation of reforms, the military and central government were ultimately strengthened by German assistance, allowing the government to keep these regional rulers in check. In addition, the stronger national identity meant that many warlords cooperated with the government in the face of foreign adversity. The cooperation with Germany resumed in earnest following the conclusion of the war, eventually leading to further industrialization and a stronger government able to completely subdue the forces of internal conflict. The additional resources, the manpower, and the growing nationalism within China had once again made it a potentially dangerous foe after nearly a century of foreign domination and humiliation.


AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN EMPIRE:

Austria represented one of the oldest monarchical traditions in Europe. Its very existence into the 20th century defied all expectations after the growth of nationalism and humanism, at odds with Austrian authoritarianism and its multiethnic, yet unrepresentative character. Long considered a great power, its decline had been slow but certain, starting with the end of the rule of the Habsburg Dynasty and the Holy Roman Empire at the hands of the French emperor Napoleon in 1806, both the rising power of Prussia and the growing nationalist sentiments among the many ethnicities of the Empire lead to a half century of waning power, eclipsed only by the decline of the neighboring Ottoman Empire. Perhaps the greatest effects of ethnic nationalism could be felt by the weakening Austro-Hungarian Empire. The First World War itself, after all, had been started by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian nationalists. Even within its own court, its lack of multiethnic harmony was painfully apparent. As well as dissent from other ethnic groups in the empire such as Czechs, Slovaks, Bosniaks, and Croats due to a lack of representation and self-determination, the ruling Austrian and Hungarian delegations often directly opposed each other. The additions of territory from Serbia and Venice only exacerbated this problem. Unlike its neighbor and ally Germany, however, Austria-Hungary lacked the military might and infrastructure to quell internal dissent effectively. In order to appease these calls for nationalist secession and the fragmentation of the old empire, many favored a plan of federalization known as the United States of Greater Austria, conceived and proposed by Romanian lawyer Aurel Popovici in 1906, in which the Empire would be divided into semi-autonomous ethnic states. However, this proposal threatened to strengthen separatist movements as greater autonomy lead to weakened central control. Pro-Ottoman sentiments among Bosnian Muslims and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, particularly after the Empire found renewed economic success in the form of oil, combined with competing Slavic nationalist movements throughout the region, threatened to tear away Austria's new gains in the Balkans. Without a way to appease the growing nationalist movements and maintain order, the empire was destined to become the new Sick Man of Europe, as well as a major headache for Germany, who was often forced to intervene militarily in separatist uprisings on behalf of its ally. Trade with the superpower Germany would inevitably lead to economic growth, but only a concerted effort to bring stability and control to the dying empire would save it from total collapse.


UNITED STATES:

Though an economic giant, the United States was a relative newcomer on the imperial stage. With the Spanish-American War a recent memory, its policy of isolationism was well known. Seeking to avoid a war on two fronts, its involvement was limited to providing aid to Allied countries. While the lack of military investment lead to greater economic development, the realization that being surrounded by two oceans could not keep foreign influence at bay was for some, difficult to fathom. The Monroe Doctrine, written in 1823, stating US dominance of the Western Hemisphere, had defined US foreign policy as one of protectionism. However, it became increasingly apparent that Germany's growing influence threatened the status quo. German foreign secretary Arthur Zimmermann's policy of destabilizing Allied countries was well known; having been involved in such events as the Easter Rising in Ireland and an underground Indian independence movement, he also proposed an alliance with Mexico to contain the United States in the event of its entry on the side of the Allies. Furthermore, the status of the Ottoman Caliph as the supreme religious authority in the Islamic world gave the Central Powers tremendous leverage, opening the door for a potential uprising among the Moro in the southern Philippines, who had a history of non-cooperation and resistance against both Spanish and American colonialism in the region. With the victory of Germany and the Central Powers in the First World War, the looming possibility of the breach of US hegemony in the Western Hemisphere once again became a concern of the Wilson administration, eager to utilize the economic power of the country to flex imperial muscle and bring potential pro-German factions and governments within the Western Hemisphere to heel. Of particular interest was its southern neighbor Mexico, who was the subject of a proposed alliance with Germany. With the First World War at an end, German arms and aid could enter Mexico virtually unrestricted. Eventually, US isolationism would collide with a growing German global influence.


RUSSIA:

Russia's humiliating defeats during the Russo-Japanese War (1905) and the First World War had exacerbated the growing discontent with the Tsar Nicholas II and the archaic monarchy. The almost immediate early withdrawal from the war had shocked many of the other Allies, as the Eastern Front had occupied the German Army, preventing the full weight of German military might from smashing its way to Paris. However, the weakening Russian Empire could not sustain a multi-front war against Germany, the Ottoman Empire, Austria-Hungary, and the Republic of China in the Far East. The massive human cost, the harsh reparations imposed by the Central Powers (including the loss of Ukraine, Poland, the Baltic States, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and much of the Russian Far East), and the growing ineffectiveness of the monarchy laid the groundwork for a growing socialist revolution, which tore through the weakened country, forcing the abdication of the Tsar. In order to facilitate trade between China and the other Central Powers, Ottoman puppet states were established in many of the Turkic oblasts of Central Asia, while the rest were assigned to Chinese rule. Chinese control of Outer Manchuria not only stripped away significant mining and logging resources, but took the strategic city of Vladivostok, essentially ending Russian naval projection in the Pacific. With the assistance of Germany following the conclusion of the war, the socialist revolutionary forces were defeated, and the royal family was reinstated, but not before significant damage had been done to the country's prestige and territorial integrity as other players, such as an expansionist Japan and a growing Finnish separatist movement, took advantage of the ensuing chaos. With the loss of so much of its territory and power, the renewed Russian Empire was very much beholden to the will of Germany as the tatters of the once great country were further divided.  The ineffectiveness of the Tsar guaranteed instability in the region, and would require German support to avoid complete collapse in the face of internal opposition.


BRITISH EMPIRE:

The complete loss of British Africa to the German Empire, as well as the loss of Hong Kong and the reassertion of Chinese self-determination, signalled to many a true end to the Victorian era and was likened to a second Fall of Rome. With unrest growing in India and the overthrow of South Africa's dominion government by German-supported Afrikaner nationalists, the complete collapse of the British Empire seemed imminent. With the events of the Easter Rising in Ireland, even the breakup of the United Kingdom was not unrealistic. Additionally, the failed intervention in France disillusioned many to the idea of foreign involvement and imperialistic militarism; with millions dead and nothing to show for it, the Western Front had been one of the most devastating military disasters in British history. Complete economic collapse was averted only with assistance from the United States. Britain's failure to protect its continental allies, combined with heavy casualties and low economic prospects, proved the catalyst for a series of separatist political movements throughout the remaining dominions such as Canada and Australia. With the loss of both Cyprus and the Suez Canal to the Ottoman Empire, British military and economic projection was nearly impossible, and with the departure of South Africa from the Empire, there was no way to efficiently transport goods and people to and from colonies in India and Southeast Asia, effectively ending Britain's status as a global power. Though coming out of the First World War relatively unscathed compared to its continental allies, the tatters of the British Empire, disparate and weakened, hung by a thread in the wake of the heavy losses and economic downturn following the conclusion of the conflict.


FRANCE: 

While Britain's losses were mainly money, men, and prestige, the defeat of France in the First World War devastated the country. Humiliated by the loss of yet another war at the hands of Germany, there was nothing to stop the complete domination of French affairs. Further loss of territory in the contested Alsace-Lorraine region deprived the country of much of its coal and iron deposits, and under the German Septemberprogramm, the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, eastern Belgium, and the Grand Dutchy of Luxembourg were finalized. In addition to losing all colonies in Africa to the German Empire, the capital Paris was occupied for a second time since the Franco-Prussian War (1871). Both Belgium and northern France were subject to German military occupation, and the strict quotas on military production were placed, removing any possibility for French military revival. France nearly faced the end of its empire, as the last major French colony of Indochina was the sight of the disastrous Allied invasion of China. Prosecuted overwhelmingly by colonial troops, such as from French Africa, Indochina, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, and South Africa, this invasion drained manpower from more vital theaters, as colonial troops were diverted from the Western Front in order to force a Chinese surrender. After penetrating into southern China, the sheer volume and unexpected preparedness of Chinese forces caught Allied forces by surprise, forcing a retreat to Indochina. The invasion was eventually called off after Chinese threats to continue advancing into Indochina after colonial troops had been redeployed to the Western Front. The disillusionment of the populations of France's remaining colonies caused by this failed invasion and their forced participation threatened to tear the empire apart.


JAPAN:

For nearly a half century, Japan had been Asia's rising star. Its defeat of China (the previous dominant power in the region) in 1895 and Russia (the first defeat of a European power by an Asian one) in 1905 shocked the world. Having entered the war in order to satiate its appetite for resources and power, Japan's role in the Allied grand strategy was to keep Chinese forces occupied and away from colonial possessions. The confidence following the last defeat of China would leave Japan with a rude surprise. Though far from the best, China's military had been trained and armed by Germany, the preeminent land power of Europe. Considerable updates since its last engagement with Japan left China significantly better prepared for a conventional war, which Japan learned firsthand. Though Japan, after its rapid industrialization, was militarily capable, the sheer volume of fire produced by Chinese forces overwhelmed the Japanese advance into Manchuria, eventually pushing them back towards the border of occupied Korea. As part of a series of reparations after the war, Japan ceded Taiwan, as well as relinquished all claims to Korea, returning it to the Chinese sphere of influence. Overnight, the Japanese Empire had been humiliated by the loss of some of its most valuable possessions. This defeat had served as a wakeup call to the Japanese High Command, suffering from ""victory disease"", becoming overconfident after their string of past victories. In order to provide for the country and people, it would become necessary for Japan to strengthen its resolve and secure foreign resources, by force if necessary. This loss of prestige and land had lead to a policy of clay-grabbing as the Japanese government took advantage of the chaos in Russia after a growing socialist revolution spread throughout the country. Consolidating its hold over the southern half of Sakhalin to the north, the entire island was occupied at the insistence of the weakened and humiliated Japanese Army, eager to make up for its earlier embarrassing defeat at the hands of the Republic of China. Further expansion into Kamchatka was halted only by a German intervention that defeated the socialist revolutionary forces and restored order to Russia, returning the Tsar to the throne, albeit of a rump state, beleaguered and with no choice but to accept German dominance. With the fires of imperialism once again stoked, the Japanese war machine looked hungrily toward the lightly defended colonies of Southeast Asia, as well as to a strengthened China; that hated enemy who had denied them their right to a proper empire.


SOUTH AFRICA:

British rule over South Africa had always been despised by Afrikaner nationalists, still embittered by the events of the Second Boer War just 12 years before the start of the First World War. The British use of internment camps to detain Boer civilians was condemned not only by the Boers, but the international community. The defeat of the Boer republics of Transvaal and the Orange Free State lead to the creation of the Union of South Africa, a dominion of the British Empire, composed of British Cape Colony, various indigenous political entities including the Zulu Empire, and the Boer republics. The forced entry of South Africa into the First World War on the side of Britain was especially resented, as it meant fighting Germany, a country that had supported the Boer cause. This growing unrest, coupled with Britain's slacking grip on the tatters of its empire, nurtured the seeds of revolution. After the war, the Union of South Africa government found itself isolated and surrounded by a hostile enemy. One of Germany's first goals in the region was to destabilize the government by supporting an armed Afrikaner rebellion, lead by former Boer generals Manie Maritz and Christiaan de Wet. With the British Empire near death and unable to intervene, the Union of South Africa government was overthrown, allowing a German-backed Afrikaner nationalist government to rise. The extreme nationalism and conservatism of this new government quickly became a point of contention to the former British enclaves of Basutoland and Swaziland, occupied by South Africa with the support of the German Empire. The White Afrikaner minority was elevated to a privileged status, growing rich off the vast resources and the cheap labor provided by the remaining population. Although mainly Black and Coloured South Africans were utilized as virtual slave labor, the government sought to deport, intern, or otherwise cleanse its society of its British and Indian elements, the last remaining legacy of British imperialism. Multiple requests for independence from the occupied territories of Basutoland and Swaziland or cession to the German Empire were denied as millions of Black Africans suffered under the extreme racial policies of the far right wing South African government. The attempted flight of many Black, Coloured, and Indian South Africans to either the German territory of Mittelafrika or the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique drew attention to the extremism of the nationalist government, but only after being joined by White, English-speaking refugees did the world consider the situation dire. Eventually, the German support of the far right government threatened to cause tension and strain relations not only with its other African allies, but its own vast holdings as many German Askaris refused to serve alongside those who held them with such contempt. The gradual distancing from the South African government by the German Empire and other Central Powers was made apparent when it responded to Xhosa and Zulu separatist movements with the systematic and often violent suppression of not only the political power, but the language and cultural practices of non-Afrikaners, resulting in the suspension of all bilateral cooperation by the German government. Despite the further isolation, the vast natural resources and large pool of cheap labor accelerated the industrialization of the country, making it ultimately a valuable member of the Central Powers.


ETHIOPIAN EMPIRE:

After defeating an Italian invasion of the country in 1896, Ethiopia rose to international prominence as the only African nation to defeat a colonial power. This fame was not lost on Germany, who offered Ethiopia complete control of the Horn of Africa by granting the colonies of British, French, and Italian Somaliland to the Empire in exchange for trade rights and a military alliance. This further increased the prestige of the country; by not only halting the advance of colonialism, but wresting from these colonial powers control of the fruits of their conquest, many in the West became increasingly disillusioned to what became perceived as a failed experiment. With the introduction of German military and industrial technology, the country began the long process of industrialization. Under the reign of the newly crowned emperor Haile Selassie, the country came to increasingly view itself as the spiritual successor to the Kingdom of Aksum, the early Christian kingdom which dominated the lucrative Indian Ocean Trade and was considered an equal of Rome. Although both ostensibly allies of Germany, Ethiopia would find itself in opposition to the Ottoman Empire, which was granted control of northern Sudan and Eritrea, both considered by Ethiopia to be within its sphere of influence.


INDIA:

Since the days of Antiquity, India had always been a divided land. Even initial British control in the form of the East India Company was more of a collection of subordinate protectorates than a true imperial possession. As a result, British control had been maintained through by exploiting these divisions, keeping supreme power away from any one group. However, this grip was tenuous at the best of times, requiring considerable effort to avoid the total fragmentation of this artifical colonial creation. The true unity and strength of the colony was tested for the first time during the Rebellion of 1857, in which thousands of native soldiers serving the East India Company in the form of the Bengal Native Infantry, known as sepoys, mutinied in large numbers, resulting in the dissolution of the East India Company and the start of direct British rule over the subcontinent. Now, with the forced participation in the First World War as a dominion of the British Empire, including the contribution of manpower on the Western Front and the disastrous Allied invasion of China, resulting in the death of many Indian soldiers in British service, discontent with British rule grew once again. As well as collaboration between an underground independence movement and the German foreign secretary Arthur Zimmermann, who was simultaneously formenting unrest in Ireland and attempting to draw Mexico into a conflict with the United States, the declaration of Jihad by the Ottoman Caliph of Islam Abdulmejid II against the Allies threatened to cause open rebellion among Indian Muslims, who recognized the religious authority of the Ottoman Caliph. German destabilization efforts had already resulted in the overthrow of South Africa's dominion government, and the German imperial machine was dead set on repeating this in India. Postwar Britain was a shell of its former self, losing all of its vast African holdings to the Central Powers. The ensuing breakdown of military projection following imperial and economic decline of the Empire made governing and defending its remaining colonies and dominions almost impossible, and with the growing unrest and rising power of Germany, open rebellion against British rule seemed inevitable. Though British colonial rule had loosened significantly since their defeat in the First World War, India was still seen as the prized jewel in the crown of the Empire, symbolizing the last remaining ties to the glory days of the Victorian era, and the last domino in the chain of British imperial collapse. Hopes that India held both the key and resources to save the Empire and restore it to its former glory made maintaining control a priority of the British government, and the subject of substantial German attention.


MOROCCO SULTANATE:

Thwarting the imperial advances of Spain, Portugal, and the Ottoman Empire, the sultans of Morocco had for centuries fiercely maintained their independence. However, with the technological advance and renewed imperialism of their historic enemies, conflict was inevitable. With multiple colonial powers establishing spheres of influence throughout the country, the complete colonial dominance of the African continent seemed imminent. However, this tradition of defiance would come to define Morocco's course. The German Kaiser's advocacy of Moroccan independence in 1905 following the partition of the country by Spanish and French colonial designs was one of the first signs of the redrawing of the balance of power in Europe. Both the German Count Bernhard von Bülow and the French foreign minister Théophile Delcassé prepared their countries for war over the issue, preparing for both immediate military mobilization and the threatened signature of a German-Moroccan mutual defense pact. Though the dispute was eventually resolved by a conference in 1906, with Germany withdrawing its claims, this event provided much of the tension preceeding the First World War. With the total defeat of France following the occupation of Paris by German forces, however, the sultan of Morocco, once a French puppet, had been reinstated as the true ruler of the country at the insistence of Germany. Immediately seeking to establish control of its former territories, the Sultanate of Morocco sought to expand its borders to that of the Almoravid dynasty that had had reigned five centuries before. With the transfer of both the cities of Tindouf and Béchar to the east and the Tuareg territories of northern French Sudan (Mali), the Sultanate established control of the former colony of Mauritania north of the Senegal River. This dream was finally recognized with the transfer of Spanish Sahara via treaty of cession (excluding the cities of Ceuta, Melilla, and Sidi Ifni), leaving Morocco in control of much of its historic territory. Both the alliance with Germany and the recognition of the Ottoman Caliph as the supreme Islamic authority strengthened the Central Powers' position as the formidable forces of the Sultanate, combined with German arms, helped pacify the region. Though the process of industrialization and military updates with the assistance of Germany ultimately strengthened the country, the historical defiance of outside influence meant strong traditions were maintained, including a tribal approach to warfare which complicated the establishment of a conventional military. The threat of imperial reassertion by the remaining colonial powers, particularly Spain, remained a constant concern for the Sultanate government, but its seat at the table within the powerful German-led Central Powers made this a distant prospect."

They came in the hundreds every day. Thousands on holidays. Lines stretches for kilometres outside the temple. The Oracle tried to hear them all, but there was only so much time in a day. Only so many could be ushered in for a single question, a single answer, and then they were rushed out. Every minute counted.

Of course the more important had their own private matters to discuss with the Oracle. At first, it had been phonecalls with local leaders. These days, presidents and kings had direct lines.  Five minutes, tops, but enough to guide them. The Oracle sometimes refused to answer their questions if they were too petty. It was a waste of time to answer if anyone would find out about the intern in their office last night.  They slowly learned only to ask the big questions. The ones that mattered. For the price they paid, they could not concern themselves with adultery. The Oracle was firm that special access was reserved for special questions.

For everyone else though, the Oracle answered whatever question they thought to pose. The majority of his day was devoted to those who gathered outside the temple. Most waited a day at least. Some longer if they could bear to stay. They welcomed them all, if they decided the wait was worth the question. 

Today, the Disciple greeted one man in the Waiting Chambers just as the sun peaked over the horizon.  He squinted in the sudden brightness.

""Don't I know you? You were here last week. Eager to know the mysteries that await?"" They didn't generally discourage repeat questioners. Unless they made a life of it, in which case they were gently asked to save the Oracle's time for those with real futures.

""Uh... Yes, sir - uh I mean, ma'am. Uh yes I was here last week.""  The Disciple motioned him forward, but he stood mutely.

""The Oracle will see you now,"" she repeated firmly.

""Well, uh - yes, I uh, don't have a question for the Oracle really,"" he stammered.

""Oh?""

""I have a question for... "" his hands fluttered in the air as he trailed off. ""For ... customer support. Does that... Is that a thing?""

""What do you mean?"" The Disciple led him away from the other supplicants towards the hall leading to the Divining Chambers.  Working for a prophet made you a bit wary of the unknown. For the first time, she had to concentrate not to slip on her flowing black robe.

""Well, you see, I was here last week, like you said, and I asked the Oracle if it was gonna rain. Cuz, y'know, I was gonna ask Lucia to marry me. So I came up and I asked just, is it gonna rain on Friday?  I wanted it all to go good, right? And the Oracle says, nope you're good, it's gonna be sunny. So I pay and I leave and I plan it all out. But then you know what happened?""

The Disciple stepped forward and whispered at the man, ""It rained on Friday.""

""Yeah...""  He shrugged. ""So.. I mean... Did the Oracle get it wrong?""

She shook her head. ""The Oracle is never wrong. Are you sure you asked, ""Will it rain on Friday?""  Maybe you asked if the weather would be good enough to ask her to marry you...?""

Now he shook his head. ""No ma'am. I made sure to ask about the rain. Lucia hates the rain.""

""But the Oracle is never wrong.""  She looked back towards the Divining Chambers.  Another Disciple was looking out towards her questioningly. The normally steady flow of questioners had stopped. She led the man back towards the doors.  

""Come with me, Mr. ...?""

""Call me Clarence, ma'am. Are we gonna see the Oracle again?""

""Yes, yes, that will solve everything.""  They entered the room and shut the doors behind them. She saw no other Disciples. The large oval room hummed softly. Some say it was the Oracle's power, but she knew it was the lights to keep the room perfectly lit at all times. Darkness in the Divining Chambers seemed contradictory.

It was sparsely decorated. The Oracle had no need of tricks or awe like a charlatan. In the centre of the room was a cushioned chair and a simple table. White robes flowed onto the floor down from a deep hood. The Oracle stared intently from underneath it. Perhaps with uncertainty? The Disciple always wondered how much the sight extended beyond these walls. Perhaps now she knew. Few had ever seen the Oracle's face. From the beginning, the Oracle had demanded that there be anonymity in every interaction within the temple. It was a great gift to see the future, but it was one that took every day of the prophet's life. If no one knew what face lurked beneath the shadows, then at least one part of the Oracle life remained in control.

Or so she thought. Few talked to the Oracle for fear of hearing too much, or wasting precious moments they had to see what awaited them.

""Great Sage: Seer of Seers, One Who Sees All, May Your Sight Never Rest and Your Eyes Always Wander. I have brought you this question, it is... He is ... he has a problem."" She ended the ritual lamely.  She motioned Clarence to step forward.

He cleared his throat. ""Well, uhm, Oracle sir.. I was here-""

""Hello Clarence."" The dulcet voice filled the room. ""I know why you are here.""

""That uhm, that makes sense.""  The Disciple nudged Clarence and softly hushed.

""You are here, Clarence, because I was wrong.""

The Disciple felt her heart leap.  The Oracle was never wrong.

""I knew that this day would come. That one day my powers would fail. That you and Alyssa would bring me this news. As I age, I knew my powers would weaken.. but I can reassure you, they remain strong. What is a single cloud, over a single park, in a single hour? Perhaps a live changing event for you. But for all of us? It is a mote of dust in a single ray of light.""

Clarence nodded. The Disciple could not breathe.

""I am sorry that I was wrong - I know Lucia will marry you, simply ask. It does not matter if it rains or shines. She truly loves you.  So go, leave here and ask her. Go to your home. She will say yes. Live happily together.""

""Th-th-thank you, sir Oracle."" Clarence tittered with joy. ""I am gonna go do that right away.""  He stepped backwards and bowed slightly. ""I won't tell no one.""  The Disciple followed Clarence and opened the door to let him leave.

""Alyssa.""

She paused, and pushed the door shut after Clarence.

""Yes, Seer?""

""Now you know,"" came the soft reply. The chair rattled against the marble floor.  She turned around to the Oracle rise from the chair.

""I... I am happy it is a momentary lapse,"" she said meekly. 

""You will betray me,"" hissed the Oracle.

""No.. No, I serve the future. I serve you,"" she stammered.

A slim finger emerged from the white robes. It lightly touched the table.  ""Alyssa knows. The man who left knows. His partner will know.""

The room went dark and Alyssa screamed."

I'm emetaphobic (fear of vomiting) and have been for the majority of my life, but I haven't struggled with it in a very long time (since I was about 8 or 9)

I have a wonderful girlfriend, amazing family and so much to be thankful for, but it seems the last 2 weeks or so have just been absolutely horrible. I've felt basically no emotions except for worthlessness and doubt in myself, and I don't want to even have sex anymore and it's starting to scare me into thinking I'm crazy.

I moved to NYC by myself this past summer for an Internship and I had such bad anxiety when I got there that I couldn't leave my room for 3 days. I had a wonderful apartment and anything I would need, but it felt pointless. I started my prescription of 25-50mg of Zoloft about 2 weeks after I got there and by the end of the summer things have seemed to turn around and I enjoyed my internship despite having 0 friends in the city and some minor loneliness here and there.

Fall 2016 started out alright but it got worse each week. I got busier and busier, I slept the least amount I have probably in my whole life, ate less and less and just struggled a lot, but didn't have mental issues or any large amount of anxiety.

It's about a month away from me graduating and these last 2 weeks have been unbearable. I can't even get out of bed a lot of days and the point of living just seems pointless sometimes. My girlfriend is the only one who really gives me any sort of reason to continue, and my emetaphobia has skyrocketed in the last 2 weeks randomly l, causing me to eat even less and be afraid of eating. I've gotten panic attacks atleast 2-3 times a week for the last 2-3 weeks and I can sorta control them to an extent but they're driving me crazy. 

Can someone give me advice? 

TLDR: I'm a college senior who's terrified to graduate, emetaphobia has flared up as well as bad panic attacks and general depression, but have no reason to be depressed. Please give me advice "

I have to do the 90th challange and that's the day I've chosen to begin the most important journey of my life!!

I've been struggling with this problem for like 6 years now but I've begun to fight this 3 years ago. I always thought 'when I get a girlfriend, this will end'. The sad true is that it won't get away. I live with my gf now (yes, we have sex) and still when she's not around I still screw things up. I feel just useless. 

I have 20 yo now and that's the time to change! I'll write everyday and post here my journey to stay more motivated with you guys!

I think my problem with porn is the same as everybody here: I can't face everyday pain. I gotta go to class, I gotta do the homework, I gotta go to the gym, I become frustrated with being a failure and my classmates getting awesome internships, I'm frustrated with my body, etc.

That needs to change right now! I'm taking cold showers everyday when I wake up and I will increase that to two, I'll write a text like this everyday after lunch and I'll stay away from porn by being at the library the whole day studying! 

See you tomorrow guys! Stay strong!"

After years of unsuccessful trials, it's time for me to ask for help on the Internet. This is going to be very long, but please, take the time to read this story and give me your opinion on the situation.

I am 21, penultimate year in engineering school, don't know exactly what I'm going to end up doing in life, but I'll figure it out. Not too worried about myself. Anyway, that's not the subject here. This thread is about my dad.

First, unusual family situation: my parents are divorced since I am 3. My mother lives alone. After an accident that involves a 3rd degree burn on the chest area, she had a mental breakdown 15 years ago that resulted in her getting fired and never being able to find a job again. She gained a ""disability to work"" status (French stuff) that allows her to get very little money from government and not work. She could physically work, but she's too unstable and incapable of handling herself to risk to loose this status by working. If she looses it, it's definitive and she could be homeless. After this divorce, my dad went to live... to his parents' house. Yeah. So, I live mostly at my paternal grand parents' house and visit my mother once a week (we get along very well).

For as long as I remember it, my dad has always been very this very introverted, stay-at-home kind of person. Retrospectively, he has been struggling with self-confidence his whole life, but that didn't stop him from doing some impressive things in his youth and family-wise and despite that, I've always seen him as driven and optimistic (not professionally, but he had something to live for: his passions, friends and family). He might not have been the most outstanding human being out there, but he was pretty decent and has been a great father to me.

As I grew older, when I was about 15, he started to get depressed for apparently no reason. He didn't talk much, saw his friends less. At some point, a few years ago, he totally stopped going to work and was diagnosed with depression. He was really, really depressed, staying in bed all day long. He had bank debts. It stayed like that for a few months, when he finally decided to tell me he had been taking heroine for the last months and was trying to stop. I was shocked but tried to be supportive nevertheless. I found a solution for his debts: we sold a part of our backyard (which was too big for us anyway). Sometimes this supportive behavior worked, sometimes I was so depressed myself that I wasn't supportive at all and yelled at him. He went to rehab once, didn't work. He went to rehab twice, didn't work. I tried a different approach: being fully supportive. It worked! He started undergoing a medical treatment to stop heroine and started to work again! He is still to this day under medication because of that, but he takes very little doses comparing to earlier. And he's still working. Aside from that, since the last three or so years... things didn't change much.

When I ask him if he's okay, he tells me he is, all smiley and stuff. He seems to be okay with his job. Aside from that, he spends 100% of his free time lying on the couch (which has become his new bed) or watching Netflix. He is 5'5"", 200 lbs. His nose is broken from a serious car accident he had when he was in his dark phase (he almost died) and he won't get it fixed. His teeth are disgusting, they have become yellow/brown. He doesn't shave very often. He doesn't cut his hair. He doesn't wash his hair. He changes clothes once every 2 weeks or so. I like to talk with him about my day but it has become almost impossible. Every time something doesn't pan out exactly as he intended it to, every time there is a minor problem, he sits, starts biting his nails (he doesn't even have nails anymore from biting) and adopts this very negative posture, with his arms crossed and his head facing down. Even the smallest problem induces panic in him. Sometimes these problems aren't even problems! Just small challenges. He constantly misses the point to everything, and it's very hard to communicate with him in terms of facts: sometimes he doesn't understand simple things. Example: he's often mad at my mother for being ""unclear."" The thing is... she's very clear. He just doesn't deal very good with a lot of info and gets lost in his thoughts. Yeah and... he's very emotive. He likes to find problems everywhere. A simple conflict of opinion between me and him can lead him into thinking I hate him. It's ridiculous. He says he feel guilty for ""what he has done"" (drugs and stuff), but lately I felt it's more an excuse and a way to achieve self-pity-ness than anything else.

Part of this situation comes from my own responsibility. During this very dark era, I was soooo angry at some things he said (shitty stuff like ""Things are going to change one day in this house, you're gonna see!"", ""You don't like me anyway."", ""Things have always been like that."") that it resulted in me punching him or the wall next to him. I even broke a window that way. I even broke my hand once (it's fixed now).

I don't know what to do. Things have been like that for a few years now. He stopped drugs and started working again, I told him I was very proud of him! But that was 3 years ago. Since then, no change whatsoever. He lives like a total wreck. Things are becoming critical: I'm 21, I will soon get a job and leave the house. In fact, I have an internship abroad and a student exchange program, abroad also, in a few months... and that makes him cry. He ""won't see me anymore."" he says. One day, my grand parents are going to die and he's going to end up alone in this house. And then... anything can happen. I don't want to ruin my life trying to fix his. I've been supportive, but that's not enough... he either says ""you're right"" and does nothing, or tell me ""not now."" whenever I try to have a serious conversation.

Help me. Please."

63neq6,1,2017-04-05,The past 2 days,Arch_Stant0n,99days,https://www.reddit.com/r/99days/comments/63neq6/the_past_2_days/,"Yesterday I stole a bunch of alcohol since cb was gonna be in town for when I have to see her. But I realized I don't want to be drunk me when I see her, I want to be able to think me, although that means anxiety. 

The days before these two days I used way too much kanna and Kratom and caffeine, I've been on the brink of an anxiety attack. 

Since I wanted to go to a movie yesterday so I wouldn't be in the house because I had a doctor appointment at two I didn't feel like going to and couldn't use kkc, I drank. I drank most of the 11 or so ounces I stole before the movie. It felt great. Also, I had Tylenol before this bad ideas all around. 

Movie was ass but alcohol made it pretty fun.

Also, kratoms been getting me out of bed very good at 4 am. Wanna lay the mat next to my bed so I just fall to push up position every morning. 

Cb knows about my probs. I tried telling her about how I was drinking and watching power rangers by myself at 11 on a Tuesday morning but did not acknowledge it at all since I wasn't sensationalizing it. Which leads me to believe she does not give a shit. Which feels shitty. Which makes me miss sunshine. 

So yeah on the topic of her she's a fucking intern at her state senate now and works in a law firm or something what the fuck

Anyways I still haven't started writing a screenplay 

Anyways I drank more on my way home after buying chicken teriyaki 

Anyways I passed out on my bed after all that alcohol and food

At five I left, drank the remainder before I had to meet with a group. All of it ok one day and didn't even see cb hm.

I'm hoping by the next time she comes back I'm actually different, and I won't be worried about what I'm gonna take before I see her, but I hope that every time

At night I wanted to sleep early, which I easily could have done in my hungoverish state. 

But then at 9 30 ish pm a friend I don't think I've ever written about before texts me worried for my wellbeing. I guess my tweets were too much for her that night (my tweets are good as hell). I insisted there's nothing wrong and was hella annoyed I hope cb isn't telling people now gd it cb. But then I started sobering up and feeling the heat in my room so I opened a window stayed up until 130 watching double toasted and then some time after that. I tried using a pic of 🌞 as I have been using for the past few days but it didn't work 4 hours ain't enough. Anyone yeah I miss how much sunshine understood me and genuinely cared did I mention that yet 

Today I get up at 710 and make coffee, feeling the anxiety now. 

Friend who texted last night wants to hang. I really don't feel like it but I don't wanna be a dick 

This morning went on fb, an old friend posted a his website. I nitpicked a bit but his videos show a firm understanding of the medium, potential, and are genuinely funny at parts. My friend who was too short to play basketball now has real rap music. Godspeed. 

Saw a video that made me cry, a guy stopping a fight between two kids. He was interviewed and explained my beliefs perfectly, about being reasonable instead o passionate. He talked about how much their parents had to do to get where they are, and I empathized with that. And I'm sorry to them.

I'm recognizing my flaws more and more. Not opening up last night, recognizing the people that wanna hear about it and the ones who don't,  my bad. Not trying at school, my fault. Not having the balls to pursue a career I like, me. Who has two thumbs and prioritized comfort over change? This guy. 

Hugh jackman posted a pic of a self help book about recognizing your self made problems. When I went to my kindle app to read it I stumbled on a book I bought a long time ago that is the best book on conversation I've ever read. Really explained every idea ive ever had better than I have and had a lot of interesting new ones. 

Anyways, gonna not use Kkc for the next few days. Until Sunday. Unless I see cb. So yeah K and c wds leggo. Don't know how I'm gonna get up tomorrow to work out 

But ya know what I haven't done at all schoolwork 

Oh yeah and my stomach hates me now. Having pains. Poop light. Too much Kratom, alcohol, food. Although I'm suspecting swallowing kanna is what keeps doing this. Because I stared using Kratom again before I was ok last time and I healed up anyway. 

Oh yeah meditation haven't done it at all

I wanna deleted sm again but I'm on it so much now people will think I kms or something 

I wanna get chic fil a 

I got chic fil a 

Saw person from high school that walked past and ignored my existence a few semesters ago when cb was still here. Today she came up and hugged me for some reason. "

63o78l,47,2017-04-05,'I'll visit you when you least expect it',danialene,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/63o78l/ill_visit_you_when_you_least_expect_it/,"Hey, y'all. I'm a long-time lurker of r/letsnotmeet and felt this would fit in this sub. First time posting, so go easy.

This took place a couple years ago in a major metropolitan area where I had been working as an intern at one of the U.S.'s larger circulation newspapers. At the time, I was 21 years old. 

Early into my internship, I was introduced to many of the senior reporters at the paper, including Bret -- he was friendly enough, but he also happened to have the most unsettling voice I've ever borne witness to. It was soft, yet he elongated his vowels. He sounded exactly like a deeper-voiced Salad Fingers, just to give you a point of reference.

The newspaper world still isn't exactly the most female-friendly place. There's an incredible amount of sexism and sexual harassment that occurs in interactions with both sources and coworkers/supervisors. So, to be clear, this was not the only creepy thing that happened to me while I was a journalist -- it was merely the most disturbing of the lot.

Anyway. 

Bret interacted with me a lot throughout my internship. He would often stop by my desk to make idle chitchat about stories we were working on. Eventually, he asked me if I'd like to get a drink with him -- this was not an uncommon thing for reporters to do with interns, as it was meant to be a sort of mentor-to-mentee interaction.

First mistake: I agreed to get a drink with Bret.

We met up at a local bar and ordered a couple cocktails. Our conversation started off innocently enough, mostly just another what-story-are-you-working-on discussion. Then, things took a bit of a turn.

Bret started asking me some personal questions: Did I have a boyfriend? Was I looking for one? Why didn't I have a boyfriend? And then, the questions became more intense: Was I a virgin? Had I had sex with anyone in the newsroom? Would I have sex with anyone in the newsroom?

I skirted around his questions and managed to get us back to a more work-related topic. The rest of the evening went well, and Bret did not return to his personal inquiries.

After our drinks, Bret stopped by my desk more often, mostly to joke around. I reached a point where I actually considered that maybe Bret was a friend, that perhaps I'd just gotten a bad first impression of him, that maybe the questions he asked me at happy hour were merely invoked by nervousness. 

Then came my final week at the internship. At the time, Bret was on vacation; however, he texted indicating he'd stop by the newsroom to say bye to me. For some reason, that didn't throw up any red flags -- in fact, I felt semi-comfortable around my deep-voice-salad-fingers co-worker, at that point.

It was late afternoon-time on a Tuesday when Bret texted me that he was down by the back entrance of our office.

Second mistake: I walked downstairs with only my work badge, which was all I needed to reenter the building after saying goodbye to Bret.

When I got down to the back entrance, I gave Bret a hug and offered a casual ""It was great working with you!"" He started chatting with me about what I planned to do after the internship and asked me to walk him to his car, which was parked in our work parking structure. So I did.

When we got to his car, he told me he'd drive me back to the rear entrance of our office, no problem.

Third mistake: I got into Bret's car.

Bret pulled out of the garage and, instead of immediately turning left into the back entrance bay, he passed it. I made a halfhearted joke that he missed his turn. He smirked, and I'll never forget what he said in response:

'I didn't miss my turn. I'm abducting you.'

As we pulled out of the security gate, I felt my airways constricting and my heart pounding in my chest. I literally had nothing except my badge -- no keys to defend myself with, no phone. Nothing. I remember sliding my badge between my index and middle fingers of my right hand with the flimsy metal clip at the top pointed outward. If I had to kill a man with a piece of plastic to save myself, I'd at least try. A little bit of context to keep in mind: I'm about 5'7"" and usually weigh less than 105 pounds. I'm not exactly an MMA fighter.

Bret was driving southbound toward the dodgier part of the city in complete silence. At the very least, I had the benefit of knowing exactly where I was -- this part of town was riddled with crime, and I happened to be one of the interns who frequently covered cops/breaking news/public safety stories.

He pulled onto a narrow, tree-lined street, still in complete silence. Then, he turned into the driveway of a somewhat dilapidated frame house, which appeared to sit on the edge of some murky pond.

Bret parked, looked over to me and prompted me to get out of the car and go inside. I considered resisting, but I was also very afraid of what might happen if I did. I didn't know what his intentions were and, again, had nothing substantial with which to defend myself. 

As we walked inside, I said something like ""wow, your house is so nice"" (I don't know guys, I was fucking scared) and tried to put some space between us, as he kept getting uncomfortably close to me.

Then, in his creepy Salad Fingers voice, Bret looks at me and said, ""You could live here."" I let out a panicky laugh and tried to brush it off. Putting his face really close to mine, he whispered, ""You could.""

I felt his hand grip my shoulder and jerk me around toward his back arcadia door. ""Let me show you the backyard,"" he said. At this point, I'm pretty clearly terrified. Directing me forward with his hand still on my shoulder, Bret opened the door and took me outside. 

His backyard was essentially a creaky wooden deck that was elevated above aforementioned dank-ass pond. Bret pushed me to the middle of the deck, and then, staring off into the distance as if he was pondering some abstract concept, he wrapped his arm around my shoulders and said, ""Isn't this nice?""

I did not respond, but started to look around for something, anything that I could hurt him with should things turn violent. It was at that moment that I caught the eye of a man sitting out on the deck adjacent to Bret's -- presumably, his neighbor. 

With the most terrified expression I could muster, I yelled ""Hi there! How are you today?"" at the guy, desperately pleading with my eyes for him to help me. At least now I knew that a person could place me at Bret's house should I be murdered. 

'What are you up to, Bret?' the neighbor asked.

I felt Bret tense up immediately. 'We were just on our way out,' he said. And then, by some miracle, Bret guided me back into the house, out the front door and into his car. He appeared agitated and incredibly angry, but said nothing. We again rode in silence, presumably back to the office. By this time, about 30 minutes had elapsed since I first met him at the back entrance.

He pulled wordlessly through the newsroom's security gate, still staring daggers through his windshield and seeming upset. When he parked just outside the back entrance of the office, I wondered why I hadn't thought it was odd that he didn't park there when I originally met him outside.

Then, he glanced over at me, put his hand on my upper thigh, and whispered, 'I'll visit you when you least expect it.'

I said nothing as I swiftly exited the car and fast-walked back into the office. I sat back down at my desk, my reflection in my computer screen a sinister shadow. With shaking hands, I woke my computer up and opened a Word document.

Unbeknownst to Bret, my exit interview was the next morning, and  I was a damn good journalist."
63ofci,2,2017-04-05,Summer Reading Programs and Statistics,NetLibrarian,Libraries,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libraries/comments/63ofci/summer_reading_programs_and_statistics/,"Hello everyone.

I'm interested to get some idea how people collect stats for their summer reading program.

Some background info on my interest:  I've got a very busy summer reading program at my library, we usually see around 500 kids sign up for it over the summer, and the Youth Services area is run by myself and one part time librarian, and that's about it. This year we're lucky to have an intern working with us.

The state wants us to collect information on the # of kids signed up, and this isn't a problem.  They also want to know the # of kids that 'complete' the program, but it's up to me to define what completion entails.

I have found it easiest to run this all with paper, including sign up forms, and small reading logs that the kids can return each week for a prize.  It generally runs for 6-7 weeks and ends in a finale party on a single day, and we would count those who could attend the party or pick up prizes in the following week as having 'completed' the program.

My difficulty with this is that there are a lot of kids who put in a solid summer of reading, and I feel like it does a disservice to both them and my library to not count them because they couldn't make the final party or didn't care about the ending prizes.  As it stands, there are a number of families who don't realize that they're supposed to turn in the reading log each week, and so a lot of people are slipping through the cracks.

Now what I'd like is a simple method to track participation, so I can credit kids who give the effort even if they're busy in that final week. However,  with 500+ kids signing up and 2 staffmembers, we have a VERY busy time over the summer, so I want as quick, simple, and easy solution as possible. Every bit of record keeping I have to do is repeated 100's of times each week for the participating kids, and has to be simple enough that it can be handed off to other library staffmembers for when no youth staff is on hand.

Right now, my best idea involves a checklist with the name of every child, and that's going to take a lot of work and record keeping. Does anyone have any simpler ideas for me? I'm happy to embrace change for a new approach that works well.  Thanks!"

I am a 24 year old male working for a college as a reserve steward ""description is below"", I took this position in December of 2015, I was offered the low end of the pay scale due to a lack of professional electrical and plumbing experience, the reserve managers felt that they would need to assist me in some of these activities, so they were only willing to offer the base of the pay range, I have never asked for a raise before and am unsure as to where to start. Below is what i have planned so far. 

I am currently being paid 22.57$/hr and the pay range is 22.57$-36.00/hr. The pay scale as 20 steps between these pay ranges. 
The  job description I was hired under is
50%		Facilities and Infrastructure Maintenance and Construction
Under the direction of the Resident Director:
Maintain, repair, and remodel reserve facilities, infrastructure, grounds, and roads.
Maintain regular maintenance schedule and records, perform rudimentary diagnosis and repairs, conduct repairs and construction or coordinate out-sourcing of repairs or construction as necessary.

Maintain records of all tasks.

25% 		Vehicle and Equipment Maintenance

5%	Administration

Obtain formal training and maintain certifications/licenses as needed for employment-related tasks.


At my 6mo evaluation I was rated 4/5 ""exceeds expectations, after the 1st 6mo evaluation we are evaluated every year. My first full 1 year evaluation is coming up soon and I expect to be 4/5 or 5/5. On top of this I do multiple jobs outside of my current job description, I manage other people, so far this has included 1 temporary full time employee and 5 interns at the same time. 2 interns recently, and a fencing crew of 20-40 people depending on the day, as you can see from above personnel management is not part of my job description. 
I have also taken over our reserve's I.T needs, upgrading our internet equipment and service, and rebuilding, repairing, or replacing all of our office computers. ""they were from 2002 and still running XP Eeek""

To top this off my bosses are rarely around, and have not assisted me in any projects at all, yet all projects including the electrical and plumbing have been done by myself, and done up to code and properly. 


So, I plan at my yearly evaluation to bring in a copy of my original position description, and to discuss the jobs outside of this that I currently do, as well as my achievements within the normal perimeters of my job, and ask for a raise. 

Upon doing so, is it considered acceptable to ask for more than a 1 step raise? the next step is about a .50$ raise, and I feel that due to me not only exceeding expectations at my normal job as per their reviews, but also taking on responsibilities outside of my job and managing people, that a pay raise into the median of my jobs pay scale is acceptable, around the 28$ range, which would be about a 8 step increase. 

I understand that this is quite the wage hike, but I think due to my responsibilities and undertakings it should be okay, do you guys have any advice/info? I would really appreciate it.

I'm sure this question has been asked before, but if you will be able to help me out that would be great.

I've heard UCB is more competitive, which I'm ok with; however, I don't want to have to pay dues, just so I can make eye contact with a more veteran improvisors. My home theater in MPLS, is a very inclusive, where everybody is welcome to fail and play, which I really dig. It's to my understanding, that the PIT is similar to that, but I fear that the PIT might be too ""nice"" of a theater; Ideally, I want to be a student at theater, where I will be challenged and given honest feedback, but also feel welcome in. With that being said, i'm curious to hear your thoughts on the best fit for me. "

He will be spending this time working on a full time internship while living with his family across the country. 

He brought up the question of what we should do about our relationship in the mean time, since we will have little to no time to spend together. He says he doesn't feel like he would be able to maintain a relationship because he needs to be in contact with his significant other at least a few times a week, and that he doesn't want to hold me back from fully experiencing college while he is away. 

I need some input on how I should approach this. We clearly still have feelings for each other. If we cut off all communication (which would be the best for moving on) we both will still miss each other. If we stay together, we will be sad because of the distance. We aren't comfortable with having an open relationship. 

I think he is being quite reasonable, but how can I cope with this? Any advice for the situation I am in? I really love this guy and I feel like I am also losing my best friend. I don't want to get my hopes up for what will happen when he returns.

He's a Dutch guy, and I'm an Asian. For the first 6 months when I first moved to the new country, I was extremely homesick and depressed because of all the exams and adapting to the new environment. Luckily, I had him. We then quickly became very good friends, as he was a listener and we had many thoughts in common. A while later, he almost got devastated because he had serious family issues. I was there and comforted him, which eventually led to us developing stronger feelings for each other. 2 months later, he collected his gut to ask me out and I happily said yes. At that time, we just wanted to be happy together and did not think too much or too far into the future. For one and a half year, we did so many things together, and shared a lot of wonderful memories. He was a very sweet and understanding guy, and he spoiled me rotten. We attended classes/lectures, helped each other to pass many exams with very good grades, worked in the same department for our internships, discussed/shared work stories/lab experience, made friends, travelled, made stupid jokes, etc. When it was time for us to start a new internship abroad, I encouraged him to go to Boston. He finally got an awesome internship there. I was also very happy to have an internship back in my home country. We were both so excited at first, but not anymore when it came to saying goodbye. Being in two different parts of the world, we missed each other like crazy, which was why we thought we couldn't bear a long-distance relationship. What has to come comes. We had to start thinking about our PhD after graduation. He wants to stay in the US to build his career. But I love Europe and have decided to find a PhD here.
Now we're still apart, and we will meet again in August for the graduation. But we just decided to break up now. One reason is we think that we won't be able bear 4-6 years of meeting each other like twice/year. Another reason is that even if we decided to do a long-distance relationship, it would cost us a very strong commitment as he's not ready to promise anything yet. He thought I'm getting to my 30s (for an Asian like me, I should have 3 children by then) soon while he will be still so young and potential for a bright career in the future. He said that he did not want to lead me on, and that I would be able to find a better person who is ready for a commitment and a family. Although it was our decision, but it kinda came from him for most part.
I have been devastated after the breakup, but kept silent. I just don't know if the decision is made too early, or maybe it would have been better if we would have waited until graduation.  "

I am currently a second-year student at a liberal arts school in the Northeast, and I am currently in a predicament that I was hoping you could help me with. This is a career question, but I feel like the group of people here are better at answering those than other subreddits. So here goes.

I am currently majoring in Business Administration and am on track to graduate a year early (So I will be graduating next spring). I currently have an internship lined up for the summer as a Policy Intern at a state agency in my state, and that's how I had hoped my career would go. I had hoped that I would go into a career in public policy and maybe go back to school for an MPA (Masters in Public Administration) or MPP (Masters in Public Policy) later on. I was always interested in a career in public service and felt this was the right path for the past few years. But, recently I started having second thoughts about this career path. I began to feel like in this career path it is tough to make a good living and with the federal hiring freeze, I've heard from people in the policy realm who work for federal agencies or think tanks that the job opportunities are drying up. While state-level opportunities are still around, they are getting harder and harder to get due to increased competition caused by the federal hiring freeze.

Okay, so here is my predicament. I was recently informed of an opportunity by my advisor at my school that the school offers this 3-2 engineering program. The program allows me to graduate from my school with one degree in 3 years and pursue second bachelor's degree in engineering at a different school for two years. Along with an option to do another extra year for a master in whatever discipline of engineering I choose and my financial aid package would carry over to the new school. I was attracted to this as I am fascinated by building things, and I love science. In fact, my best grades in college are in science and math. I would only need to take a two more classes to meet the requirements for this program, and my schedule is open enough to accommodate the classes next year. If I were to do this, I would likely either major in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering as my second bachelor's degree.

So r/PersonalFinance could you please help me decide if this is the right thing to do and what sort of considerations I should make before taking this step. Also just so the mods know, there are some financial considerations to take in like salary potential of either career, the missed earning while I'm getting the second degree plus new student loans and 2-3 years of interest. I have 15K in student loans so far, and I am extrapolating that if my financial aid carried over, I would owe 44K with the second bachelor's degree as compared to the 24K if I stop after my first degree.

Thanks for your help guys, I really appreciate it!"

**MILF**

Your young son is having a Sunday evening pool party and invited half of his class, so the backyard is pretty packed! As all the kids had fun outside, you watched from the kitchen as they took turns jumping off of the diving board, chasing each other through the yard and playing kickball. Although there were dozens of kids, your eyes constantly followed one boy in particular. He seemed pretty average compared to the other boys but something about him made him stand out among the crowd. Every time he climbed out of the pool, his water soaked swim trunks would hug against his body like a skintight wetsuit, revealing the outline of his enormous, underage cock. This boy has been blessed by god and you would be damned if you weren't gonna take advantage of it. You walk outside and call his name, claiming that his mother called and needs to speak to him, when in reality you just want to get him inside. you highly doubt he'd say no, fresh out of puberty. The only thing running through his mind is probably the thought of himself rubbing his fat, throbbing cock between your massive, milky tits...or is that the thought that's in your mind?

**New intern at work**

3 weeks ago, my boss brought in his niece to help with data entry and some book keeping. She's so young and sexy. She gives off a hint of ""naughtiness"" that I can't get past. Some of the clothes she wears, the way she carries herself.

My wife didn't seem to be too happy when she came to visit me for lunch a few days ago, and saw Kaley (the intern) for the first time. Later that night, I explained some things to my wife that put her at ease.

The main thing that put her at ease, was when I told her that Kaley was only (??) years old.

Who would like to play as Kaley? The young, and very eager intern who knows exactly how men see her and loves it. 

**Managers' girlfriend birthday**

You took the photo quickly before heading out to a party. This party had a scavenger hunt giving you challenges to complete in different bars, which you had to take a photo of. Your team won (of course!) but everyone expected to come last (cause apparently you are a liability?!) and wanted to see the picture proving you had done each challenge. You shove this picture in the face of your manger and your team leader, feeling pretty pleased with yourself to a moment later having them burst out laughing uncontrollably, before pointing out it may have been the wrong picture ;) . This party also happened to be for the birthday of my managers girlfriend!

**browser history**

I've just come home from a long week and decided to get off on the family computer. You had forgotten to close out your browser when you went to bed. My heart races up with the rush of adrenaline I get by the shock of accessing all of the dirty porn you had been watching... (you can add some more flavour by choosing the type of porn and eventually we end up doing the same type of naughty things)

**Swimming teacher**

Since young your parents decided to keep you in swimming lessons. Now that you are older (we can discuss ages in PM), you have became a very good swimmer, lately it has become a bit too boring....Until this new teacher arrive, who kept you motivated and interested since he is rather funny and passionate guy, ready to deliver the best and amusing classes...and some say sometimes overenthusiastic with teaching ""hands-on"". He does occasionally let's everyone play dolphins 5 minutes before the end of the class, sometimes he brings some music from the popular Tv shows soundtrack and makes everyone dance on it in the water...sometimes he even takes suggestions from students...all in the name of good amusement... (I'll leave this open to what type of kinks you want to add in apart from swimsuit/waterplay)

**centaur(petplay)**

(can be played with different monster) After assembling your ingredients you start the summoning ritual, step by step you follow the instructions hoping that all will result in the one creature that can grant your desires .... as you add the last ingredient and recite the profane words a small flash, enough to blind you for a few seconds, and a bit of smoke appears from the centre of your prepared ceremonial site (you can pick a place)

in front of your eyes a way taller creature appear, with half body human half body horse...his human skin is dark and his horse part is black. ""who summons me? Krys the centaur god?""

the idea would be a demonic summoning. you or me would would have read/heard about the powers the centaur have and for that reason aspire to use him/her for self interest...not knowing that in return that involves sex. I'm also happy to play the reverse as you being the (female) centaur and me the human

--------------------------------------------------------------

I am a kink focused roleplayer, so I can't stress out the importance for me to know what kinks you like and what kinks of mine you are happy to tap into. In that regards, I would let you know some of **my favourite kinks** are: name calling, girls that like to corrupt or be corrupted, flirting mixed with loads of subtle (""accidental/unintentional"") teasing , tight/skimpy clothes (cameltoe, nipples poking, lingerie digging in hips, etc.),name calling, spanking, lingerie (cheap or expensive), thick hips/big ass

I'm flexible to RP variations from these prompts with your kinks or even with your prompts. When you pm me **please** do include the type of kinks you enjoy together with your name and age. I will need your character description and

This might seem really weird but I really hope someone can help me out.

So about a year ago I tried alcohol for the first time. I was with my ""friends"" and I ended up throwing up a lot and I blacked out. Interestingly, when I woke up, I thought that I remembered everything but it appears that I didn't as my friend was telling me  about all the stupid things that I said the night before. I also didn't have a hangover that morning. We also barbecued up some chicken and steak that night which turned out to not be completely cooked (more on that later). I had pretty bad anxiety for a week after the incident but all in all it wasn't that bad. Fast forward a couple months and my life starts getting very stressful. I decided to do part of a uni year while still in high school and I tried to get an internship. All this stress started to effect my grades. In this time I was (and still am) always worried that my cognitive performance has declined due to having too much alcohol. I started getting really bad headaches when I got stressed. I have always had a fear of parasites and combination of having the not fully cooked meat and having headaches lead me to believe that I had parasites in my head. I ended up over dramatising my symptoms to my doctor asked if I could get an MRI to check if there was anything wrong. The scan came back normal which relieved a lot of anxiety of me. My headaches eventually went away as I realised the problem was that I would clench my teeth and move my jaw around constantly as it was very stiff most of the time. In the holidays everything went a lot better as I didn't have the added stress of school. 

I am now nearly a semester through uni and all the anxiety came right back. Everything that I do stems back to my traumatic experience.    For example:

- In a class, I am always comparing myself to others and thinking about how the traumatic event has hindered my learning capabilities.

- I get very bloated and gassy after some meals which makes me worried that I have parasites which makes me worry that my progress in the gym will decrease. 

- I feel like I'm not good enough to make new friends in uni so I stick with my friends that have a bad influence on me. 

I am currently a couple weeks into therapy and while it has helped me a bit with social situations it has not really eased my fear of not progressing and parasites. 

Has anyone experienced anxiety from a traumatic event? 

How do I get through this?

63s7w4,2,2017-04-06,Reaching out...,feldmaus1992,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/63s7w4/reaching_out/,"Hi folks. 

I've never been formally diagnosed with depression but have been seeing counselors and taking SSRIs per nurse's orders for about two or three years now (first Citalopram and for the last six months or so, Sertraline 100 mg at HS). 

I'm a little over a month from graduating with a BA in Psych and a BA in German, but lately I just feel hopelessly lost. I haven't been sleeping or eating well for a week roughly - not being able to sleep till dawn and then staying in bed all day. Lately I'll eat maybe once in a day if I can manage it.  I have let my schoolwork slip by me and have not been going to class because I've felt guilty about not doing my work and/or struggling in classes, which is a vicious and self repeating cycle.  

I've just been wanting to disappear lately. Not die by any means, but just... not exist, though I have had some intrusive thoughts of suicide. I briefly flirted with self-harm a few times a couple years ago and have had urges to try that again, too. 

Mainly I'm just terrified of failing two of my classes. I have a D in each which is passing, but I'm still terrified of failing one or both and not graduating like I'm hopefully doing next month. My whole family will be here, and I don't know if I could handle the shame. 

I don't really know where to go from here - I feel at this point that my professors would just think that I was making excuses, or try to get the authorities involved, and I definitely don't want that, either. 

Also stressed financially since I'm supposed to be moving into a new place next month and I have nowhere near the amount for the security deposit or first month of rent because of unforeseen expenses with my vehicle. 

Finally, I feel guilty for feeling this way when I've had a good life besides bullying experiences from K-9th and bad relationships, though my current gf is a saint (though she's away on an internship).  I feel like I should be happy or excited since I'm so close to the finish line, but I'm just... not.  


Now I'm just rambling. 

TL;DR: stress levels through the rough when I'm about to graduate and I feel very near the edge lately.  

I just don't know what to do..."

Howard says every radio and tv show ripped off his idea when he decided to have bands play unplugged on his radio show. Gary says the Black Crows were on the show and the next day every DJ had an acoustic guitar in their studio.

6/13/2006 **Roasts**. The View does a roast for Meredith Viera and Howard thinks it's funny how everyone is doing roasts now that the show has done them. Artie brings up the fact Comedy Central has made it popular in the last couple years. Howard tweaks his explanation, saying no one roasted staff members until they started doing it. Gary starts to imply that Gilbert Gottfried was a weird choice for The View roast, insinuating they even stole Gilbert even though he didn't fit it in on their show. Howard says he knows he didn't invent the roast, but he thought it was quite the coincidence that they were roasting staff members when no one did that before.

6/13/2006 **Revelation Shows**. Gary runs into the studio to inform Howard that a radio show in Washington did a revelation show. Howard suggests the news team should investigate and find out how many radio dj's are subscribed to Sirius. Gary says “I think people lift stuff and give it a little tiny twist so that in their mind they can themselves believe that it's fresh, new, and theirs”.

6/13/2006 **Shows Where People Talk About Everyday News**. Robin and Howard agree that The View is a ripoff of their show. They agree that the whole concept of The View was lifted from their show.

10/11/16 **Interviewing “God Hates Fags”**. Steve Langford says Tyra Banks is doing her best Howard impression by having the God Hates Fags family on her talk show. Fred groans at the thievery.

10/19/2006 **Flavor of Love**. Howard claims no one had Flavor Flav on anything. Robin chimes in and says he was down on his luck. Mark Cronin, the VH1 shows producer, was a Stern staffer in the early 90's. Howard wants credit for the show.

12/12/2006 **OJ Simpson Jokes**. Jay Leno has Mel Gibson on the Tonight Show after his drunk driving meltdown. George Takai asks if Jay Leno ever had O.J on his show. Robin and Howard claim after they made O.J jokes on their show, Jay started to do the same along with every other talk show.

1/11/2007 **“Politically Incorrect” and any other comedy news show**. Howard says he went to HBO with  the idea of making Robin's News into a show. HBO at one point puts Bill Maher in a show to talk about the news. Now everyone has a comedy news show because of Howard.

1/18/2007 **American Idol.** During the 80's in Detroit, Howard would have 3 record guys come in and critique listeners. Howard is upset because he didn't think to put it on T.V.  Howard names off an award he won for it because it was original.

2/27/2007 **Are you Smarter Than a 5th Grader**. Howard says he would have kids come in and challenge staff in a battle of wits. He had a conversation about concept with a network executive but nothing came of it. FOX then put out their TV show. 

2/27/2007 **Street Smarts**. This show revolved around contestants waging on whether or not a random person on the street knew the answer to basic knowledge questions. Howard says he used to interview people on the street and the show is a rip off of his concept.

3/26/2007 **Are You Hot?** Caller asks Howard when he's going to sue all these shows for stealing his ideas. The TV show Are You Hot is brought up for possible litigation.

3/26/2007 **Virgin with a Pornstar.** During the same conversation, this TV show yet to be picked up by a network is brought up.

6/6/07 **Interns Asking Questions.** Howard goes into a Jay Leno rant, which includes accusations of Jay stealing his bit of having interns asking questions to ordinary people on the street.

6/6/07 **Having Your Mother On Your Show.** Howard praises David Letterman for at the very least acknowledging he had stole this bit from him.

6/6/07 **Moving Lips on Still Images.** The bit that made Conan O’Brien famous was apparently stolen by an ex Channel 9 producer according to Howard.

6/14/07 **Joe Rogan**. Howard and Gary are upset Joe wont do the show. They both argue about how they had Joe on the show when no one wanted him and now everyone uses him.

9/27/07 **The Surreal Life**. Mark Cronin, former Channel 9 staffer and current VH1 producer is invited on the air to get grilled about his alleged rip offs throughout the years. Surreal Life is brought up and Howard claims he had all those people on his show and made them interesting before people cared.

9/27/07 **America's Most Smartest Model**. Mark Cronin is getting grilled on air. Howard is telling him he stole this show idea from him (having hot woman looking stupid answering general knowledge questions) Howard said Gary wrote up proposals for the various networks about possible TV shows based on show concepts and that this was one of them. Mark argues it’s ridiculous that he was aware of such proposals. Mark tells Howard he was a hypocrite because he stole “Win Fred’s Money” from the popular Ben Stein show. Howard says that’s a stupid suggestion because it’s an obvious homage. 

(Unknown Date) **The Osbornes**. Howard claims he would have the family on his show and suggested they should follow them around 24/7 with cameras. Producers, who were listeners, apparently lifted this idea.

(Unknown Date) **Syndication**. Howard invented syndication. When he would tell the upper management how he wanted to syndicate his show, they thought he was crazy. Then everyone started doing it.

(Unknown Date) **Best Of**. Howard claims to have stated the “best of” craze when he did it with his show.

(Unknown Date): **Everybody Hates Chris** – Stolen idea from his unfinished project “Howard Stern: The High School Years”

(Every Other Week) **Don Imus**. Howard claims Don took his shock jock radio shtick when nothing was working for him.

(Unknown Date) **Donald Trump**. Howard claims to have made Donald Trump into the interesting sound byte extraordinaire. He would have him on his show when no one would. Donald would be outspoken about everything and everyone. Then everyone took that bit.

(Every Other Week) **Jay Walking**. Howard claims to have invented the bit where regular people on the street are asked general knowledge questions. Jay Leno says Steve Allen was doing it before both of them.

63tuev,1,2017-04-06,Advice needed: inquiring about summer internship offer?,CurlyChristian,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/63tuev/advice_needed_inquiring_about_summer_internship/,"Hi friends,

I have a question in regards to seeking out a summer internship with the firm I'm currently interning with. The recruiter asked if I was seeking a summer internship back in March, and I told her I was but I needed to check my schedule to see my available times in the summer (I'm taking summer classes). 

A week later, I let her know about my summer schedule and she said she would ""get back to me about interning."" It's been 3 weeks, and so far, she hasn't contacted me since. I've seen her in the office (we are a tiny firm) and we've said hi and been cordial but I'm wondering if this is a sign I'm not getting an offer?

What is the best way to go about this. Do I send her an email? Or is this pushy. Do I just wait until my last day (2 days after tax day)? If it helps, she took a while to get back to me for the spring internship (1 month).

Any input would be greatly appreciated- if I need to brace myself for a rejection, I'd like to know now and not in two weeks.

Thank you!!!!

I am a Junior at U of SC (go cocks) studying Biology. Currently I'm in a pickle with applying to medical school and was looking for some advice from some current med students to get their opinions on what I should do.

Recently I have decided that I have my heart set on MUSC in Charleston, SC. After expressing my sincere interest in the program to some of the admission directors and meeting them personally, I have run into some problems. I was planning on petitioning as an in state applicant (I'm currently a NC resident) after obtaining SC issued documents e.g. drivers license, registration, etc. however, I have the have these documents for *an entire year* before I apply. At the moment I have three options:


**1. Apply This Cycle**

If I do apply this cycle I would be considered an out of state applicant, so my chances of getting in are not as high as an in state applicant. However, I do have ties to the state by going to undergrad here. If I do accept I would be paying an additional **$25,000** in tuition per year. They do not allow students to switch over to in state tuition after matriculating as an out of state student. This means I would be taking an additional $100,000 in loans over my four years there.

**2. Apply Next Cycle**

If I apply next cycle, I would have obtained all of the documents and requirements necessary for me to be considered an in state applicant. I could then apply early decision, which would greatly increase my chances of getting in, especially if they see that I waited an entire year to establish residency *just* to apply to their school. I would save $100,000 in loans, but I would be ""giving up"" a year of my career.

**3. Apply to Other Schools**

I'm honestly not a huge fan of this option. I toured USC Greenville, UNC Chapel Hill, and MUSC and I absolutely love everything about MUSC. My heart is set on that school and, knowing myself, it is not a long shot to get in. 

Currently I'm debating between the first two options. Do you think attempting to apply and accept admittance this year is worth the $100,000 to save a year, or should I just wait to apply after I graduate next year, and during my time off try to get a summer internship in Charleston/get EMT-B, CNA, etc.

Thanks in advance for the advice. I appreciate your time.

63uf8i,3,2017-04-06,"1L with two summer offers, advice?",blankenship23,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/63uf8i/1l_with_two_summer_offers_advice/,"My first reddit post ever, so bear with me. I am currently weighing two summer internship offers and would like advice on what you all think the better option is.

I am a 1L at the University of Wisconsin and am right around top 33% of my class right now. I am on a full scholarship, so money isn't a huge issue right now but of course it would always be nice to be compensated for my work even if it is just a little. I plan to practice business/transactional law upon graduation in either a firm or in-house counsel setting in Wisconsin or the upper midwest.

1) Option 1: Judicial internship with the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The position is unpaid but I think the experience and resume building aspects of working on the state supreme court are extremely high. There is a possibility to take the position for credit but that requires paying summer tuition which would be about $5,500..not really interested in that, so I would most likely be doing it on a volunteer basis. Located in Madison, WI.

2) Option 2: Law clerk position with QuadMed (parent company QuadGraphics, a large Wisconsin digital and print corporation). QuadMed is the in-house healthcare provider for QuadGraphics. This position would focus on contractual negotiation and review, regulatory compliance, other general in-house advising.. This position is paid, however it is lumped together with their general internship program for undergrads so the pay is pretty low at $12/hour, but it's still something. Pros would be that it's in-house transactional work and paid. Located in Sussex, WI.

So what do you think? Right now, I'm leaning towards the Supreme Court for the experience, prestige and location. Would love to hear from those of you who have interned with a Justice and whether you felt it was worth it. My main concern is, what will provide a better stepping stone for securing either a law firm or larger scale company in-house position at OCI this fall.

QuadMed is aware of my offer with the Supreme Court and have expressed that they are very interested in having me and offered to let me work less hours and remotely occasionally to accommodate my schedule. However there would still be quite a bit of commuting as they are a 1 hour and 15 minute drive apart. I currently live in Madison. They suggested I take both positions and that they could ""make it work"". Any additional thoughts on this?
Thanks!

4/25/17: 
If for whatever reason someone cares about the outcome of this post, I ended up taking both. Very surprised that both were eager to be flexible and encouraged I do both, 2.5 days a week at each with some opportunity to work remotely for both. Thanks for the great advice everyone!"

So let me give you a little background. I have been at this job for about 2 1/2 years. I went into it just out of an internship and it was what I wanted to do, for an organization I wanted to work for. Has not turned out quite what I thought, but I still do believe in the organizations mission.

Over the last few years I been taking on increasing responsibility. (i.e Training, Event Organization, and Database Management, All which are not part of my job description) About a year into this position me and another employee were up for a promotion to fill a vacancy. They chose the other employee but gave me a title change, but no raise. About 6 months after that I asked for a raise. I did everything correctly and was even told that I went about it correctly, but no raise. (Reason was tight budget) 

Fast forward about a year to 2 weeks ago, and I was approached by my supervisor to train on the program of the position that I was passed up for more than a year and a half ago. About a week after that we went over the responsibilities and I was supposed to be a last line of defense if no one else in the department could complete this task who could, you would say the emergency option. Now yesterday I was told I will be performing the duties of the advanced position whenever one of the two employees who are in that position are out, or whenever they need help.

Am I wrong to sit down with my supervisor and directors and ask for a raise? Am I correct in thinking that this is more a matter of respecting me as an employee? Is it ok to say no to the training and increase responsibility?

Also in the accounting and finance major I have a 3.5 GPA if that matters. I have volunteered for the VITA tax program this year and am a member of alpha beta phi.

My plan is to currently take classes this summer which would lead me to graduate with 5 years of credits in 4 years (CPA eligible). In addition become excellent in interviews and to add on an additional volunteer activity to my resume. 
 
The downside is I have never had an internship. Will this hurt me so much that I will never be able to find a job after senior year? I was hoping to get into Big4 and I know I would absolutely crush that job, but would they even give me the opportunity to intern even if it is after I graduate? Also if I don't get a big 4 offer should I just apply to get a masters of accounting? I am extremely confused on what to do and would love any advice. I've been stressing out about this for the last month and I am unsure what to do. I am a go getter to the fullest, but I just don't know where to focus this mentality. "
63v4o0,5,2017-04-06,International applicant that got in! Can someone please help me with these questions?,sunbir8,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/63v4o0/international_applicant_that_got_in_can_someone/,"Hi! 

I just got into Dartmouth with 50k aid a year. 
I also got into Amherst College with 57k a year. The other good schools I got into are Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, University of Pennsylvania, and Brown University. I will be in 140k debt if I graduate from any of these 3.

I don't know a lot about these colleges as I'm an international student. However, I have read some stuff online. I want to know how accurate it is.

I want to major in computer science because that is something I really want to learn. I am interested in machine learning and AI right now. That might change in the future, given that I just like the idea of it. I don't have a lot of CS experience at the moment. My ultimate goal is not to be a hardcore programmer. I, rather, want to be in a management position, preferably in the tech industry. However, I wouldn't mind being a software engineer either if this option isn't viable. Now that you know a little about me, here are a few questions:

1. How does the CS department at Dartmouth compare with the other universities I mentioned earlier? Will I get enough resources to learn about machine learning and AI? Should I go for a place like CMU, which is probably the best in the world for CS? Is there a huge difference in department quality? Dartmouth is ranked 40 for graduate CS rankings. Should that be a deciding factor for me?
2. How are the job opportunities for computer science majors? Will Silicon Valley companies want to recruit me? I've heard they look for practical knowledge. Will Dartmouth provide me with that knowledge? If not, how am I supposed to gain it?
3. My parents will spend their entire lives' savings to send me here. So, a job that pays well is as important to me as my passion for CS. Will I be able to dual major in CS and Finance (or whatever is required to get into the finance industry, since that is where Dartmouth's strength lies)?
4. My dad has friends in really high positions (VPs, etc.) at both Goldman Sachs and The Bank of America. Will this be of any help to me while looking for internships? Asking this because I heard connections are vital in the finance industry.
5. Can I get an MBA degree from Tuck School of Business in addition to my undergraduate degree if I decide to spend 5 years instead of 4? Is there any provision for this?


Last of all, my heart was set on UPenn because I heard a lot about the social life there and felt that I would like it. I just generally felt that I would be a perfect fit for Penn. I don't think I would be able to afford to study there. Am I missing out on a lot? I don't think I like the fact that Dartmouth is so far from a major city. But, these opinions about finding UPenn to be a better fit and not liking a small city have little foundation. I don't really know what life in America is like, so all this might change when I actually start attending Dartmouth. Unfortunately, I won't be able to visit any of these schools because of financial constraints.

Please tell me some cool things about Dartmouth that'll make me want to study there. Why is a campus town more attractive than Philadelphia? I like meeting different people. Dartmouth is small. Is it so small that it won't allow me to do that?

If you made it till here, thank you so much for taking the time to read this. I will really appreciate it if you could answer any of these questions.

Thank you!!"
63vbt6,10,2017-04-06,I'm 21 and I think I may be a girl and I'm really really scared.,pineconecollection,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/63vbt6/im_21_and_i_think_i_may_be_a_girl_and_im_really/,"When I was 19, after a summer and early fall with some weird hookups/dates, and a lot of time by myself I came to the conclusion that I must be asexual. I don’t really want to go into details, but at the time it all seemed to add up. I didn’t have the strength to tell anybody about it despite drafting up countless messages and manifestos and going out with friends for the night with the explicit goal of telling them. During this period I had entirely shut out physical encounters almost entirely from my life except the occasional unavoidable hug and everything seemed way better for me self-defining that way. Despite this I always had this pricking feeling in the back of my mind that something wasn’t quite right. I still would watch adult material on a daily basis and no matter how hard I tried I just couldn’t get myself to really identify with other members of the asexual community that I saw online.

About half a year ago I started painting my nails. Idk exactly why. I think I’ve always wanted to and probably talked about it a bunch and my girlfriend (the only person at the time I had told I was asexual) finally just brought over the nail polish and painted my nails. I kept this going through winter break when I went home. I’m not sure exactly what caused it but some mix of having to apply to 75 or so summer internships and filling out the gender box on every one over a couple days or maybe my mom constantly berating my brother and I “You’re both boys though, right!” in response to a bunch of trans news topics or maybe it was some of my friends poking fun at/asking a lot of questions about the nail polish. 

Whatever it was a lightbulb clicked in my head that “oh shit, I think I’m not a boy”. Since then I haven’t been able to get the thought out of my head. It’s been incessant. In addition to painting my nails I’ve started shaving my legs/arms, have been growing my hair out, and have been starting to slowly but surely acquire some girls clothing while donating away the more masculine half of my closet. I’ve told my girlfriend how I feel (she’s bi and has been super supportive) along with four of my other very close bi/trans/ace female friends and I’ve started seeing a school lgbt counselor. I’ve also started realizing all these little signs from my past that I just kind of assumed were things that everyone went through. I’ve always hated looking at myself in mirrors/photos almost like I’m looking at another person and almost can’t recognize the sound of my own voice on record. I went through a couple year period where I was convinced I was a sociopath because I didn’t think I had emotions (lmao). I never actually went through with it outside of drag party themes but for the past couple years I’ve talked about wanting to wear sundresses all the time. Since I first started watching adult videos I was always drawn to ones with trans women or emasculated males. When I work out I’ve only ever done cardio because I’ve been afraid of “getting buff”. And many many more little things.

That all being said I still feel so unsure. Maybe I’m a hypochondriac who just heard enough trans stuff and has recreated a personal narrative that fits. Maybe everyone feels this way and I’m just overreacting. Maybe it’s just a phase. Maybe I just really want to make myself a victim somehow. Maybe I just want attention. Maybe I’m too old to realize I’m trans. There’s a million different excuses I’ve come up with but none of them have really been able to shake this gut feeling I have that somethings wrong.

My life is already fine as it is right now and I’m scared… I’m scared if I do nothing that I’ll be unhappy forever. I’m scared if I go down this path that something bad will happen. I’m scared if I go down this path for a little and realize I was wrong that everyone will think I’m a liar.

If you have any advice that'd be incredible. I feel kinda helpless rn...

Everything started out fine, but MST is a tough school in general and things as of late aren't going so well. I'm also becoming more and more disgruntled with the social experiences here, and the boring-ness of the school and town. I'm originally from STL and applied to UMSL and got in, but decided to go to S&amp;T because a lot of my friends were going here. Now, I kind of hate it here to be honest. I know how to code and have even landed an internship with one of the Big N. At this point, I just kind of want to be done and get my degree. 

To further that, I was thinking of transferring to UMSL. I imagine it's a bit of an easier school all around. Is that necessarily true, and also what's the CS program like?

So I'm going to Seoul this summer and will also be attending Yonsei's summer program and just wanted to ask a couple questions and get some insight from people that have gone! 

Q's:

-I don't see anyone talking about this online or on any blogs, but is a tuberculosis test actually needed for the dorms?? lol 

-If I'm not going on the field trip prior to the program, will I actually have trouble making friends?? (I read a lot of posts talking about how cliques form super quick so I was kinda worried about that)

-Which classes should I take/avoid? What's the difficulty of these classes? (I'm not planning on taking any korean language classes) 

-Has anyone done the internship program and was it even worth it??


If you have any helpful insight on what the program was like and what you got out of it, that'd be great!! 
Thanks in advanced:-)"

This post is mostly just to vent to a crowd that might understand! I am 25 years old, graduated with my masters in mental health counseling last June. I was hired from my internship at an outpatient chemical dependency location immediately and have worked full time there. I began to feel unhappy a couple months ago, because my agency is extremely understaffed and I have had to pick up a lot of slack. We only have 4 clinicians (when we should have around 8) currently, and I am doing 4 groups a week, 2 evaluations, and have a caseload of around 50. 

I started looking for a job around 2 weeks ago, and yesterday had 2 job offers given to me after interviewing! Today I accepted one job. It is working through a huge health agency/hospital that is absolutely blowing up in my area in business right now. It is also an outpatient chemical dependency clinic. I am going to be making 13,000 more than I make right now, and it offers a full health benefits package as well as 4 weeks of PTO. The only thing that worries me is that I have to be on a waiting list to get my clinical supervision hours, but the man who will be my manager said that there are many people who could supervise me. Another con- I will be in the evening position to begin, but am hoping I will be able to switch to day shift within a year. 

Anyways, there isn't much of a point to this, I just feel extremely nervous and anxious about the change. I grew to be really comfortable at my little non-for profit company and I'm scared of being the new person again. I'm worried that due to the prestigious nature of the company, I won't be good enough or something. I just hope I adjust quickly! 

Anyone else have experience with switching agencies and the nervousness that comes along? "
63wlud,2,2017-04-06,Ex who I broke up with still have feelings for 7 months ago is now with my old best friend,senioryearcollege,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/63wlud/ex_who_i_broke_up_with_still_have_feelings_for_7/,"Hi guys,

Second semester freshman year, I starting dating my first girlfriend (first kiss/first love). We dated for 2.5 years and over the summer, I ended the relationship. We are seniors(4th year) in the same major in University and have pretty much taken the same classes so we were always together and now I still see her everyday in my classes. Ever summer, we would be doing internships half way across the country from each other and the relationship wasn't enjoyable long distance, so last summer I ended it, knowing that the chances of her getting a full time offer near me are very slim and I thought that it was better to end it now than later so I can move on faster. 

A couple months after we came back to campus, everything on campus reminded me of her and the feelings came back again. However, a month after I broke up with my ex, I started talking to a girl in the state that I was interning in (California). By the time I realized that I still had feelings for my ex, I was already talking to the the girl in California (l who lives a 6 hr drive/1 hr flight from where I got my full time offer). So I didn't go back to my ex because I didn't think my ex would be closer to me (distance-wise) than the new girl and I didn't want to break the new girls heart after talking to her for 4 months... as I genuinely liked her. My ex ended up moving on and the breakup still stayed on my mind, but I was talking to the girl in Cali every night so it made it bearable. Then my ex told me she got a job in Cali that she was taking which was slightly further away from the new girls place (7 hr drive) so I didn't budge.

Two weeks ago, the girl in Cali who I've been talking to for 7 months called it off very randomly with me citing reasons I cant control (her work stress was too much and she thought that being 2 years older than me wasn't going to work). A week later (last week), my ex who I still have feelings for told me that she is now dating my roommate and best friend from Freshman &amp; Sophomore year; she got to know him well because she pretty much lived with us during that time because she was dating me and then they started talking after me and her broke up.

Now I have nothing. For the last 4 years of my life I was talking to a girl who was into me (first my ex and then the girl in Cali) and now I have never felt so lonely in my life. Whenever I was sad about my breakup, I would look forward to moving to Cali in July and finally make it work with the new girl. To make matters worse, I have to see my ex every day and I keep thinking about how she is with him, a guy who I once called a brother to me. I just feel like it is all my fault because I broke up with her, a girl who genuinely loved me. I mean I broke up because of distance and in 35 days when I graduate, the closest she'll be to me is a 7 hr drive away so it would've still been long distance. But regardless, she's moved on (and dating a guy who used to be very close to me) and I can't help feeling like I did all this to myself. 

Since the breakup, she's seemed to have an amazing senior year and now a new happy relationship while I've had such a sad senior year and am now lonelier than ever."

I'm looking to buy a car to get me to my internship over the summer, and hopefully survives some time after. I've found 2001 Pontiac Grand Am on a local Craigslist in Rochester, NY. The car seems to be in great shape and it's coming from Nevada, meaning no rust or any snow/winter related damages. 

[Here](https://rochester.craigslist.org/cto/6076922825.html) is the link for Craigslist posting. I am meeting with the owner on Sunday to test drive the car and hopefully negotiate the price, so I would appreciate any advice on what to look for/ask any specific questions. 

Since I live in upstate NY, I would also like to know if you have any specific advice on how to take care of it during the harsh and long winters. 

My budget is bellow 2K, since I only need a car to get me through the summer. Anything after that is a plus, but I'd still like to get as much as possible out of this car. 

Any advice is appreciated! "

So I thought lowly of UCSB because of its party reputation, but my entire perspective changed when I visited on a tour and attended an engineering session. The lady who spoke was I think the head of the honors program, and she seemed so passionate about the program here. Topped with the relaxed beach vibes, learning that the engineering school at SB is a top-10 for public schools actually makes UCSB one of my top choices. Compared to what I've heard about Berkeley and UCSD (my top choices before visiting SB) being the land of crippling depression, this place almost seems too good (everyone is undeclared until they meet a gpa req for Berk letters &amp; sciences school and I got in as my alternate major for EE for SD, but got in for my intended major for SB). Currently, the main downside is financial aid, but I'd like to just put that aside for now.  

But as a generally cautious person, I'd like to get some of the raw opinions about cs on this sub since the info I got from the tour may be biased. Could someone give me more details about the CS program here? Internships, student-faculty accessibility, research opprtunities, anything will be appreciated :) Also, I would especially like it if someone could compare SB's program with the other schools I mentioned.

I've been lurking around here trying to figure out my situation and i'm seeing a lot of people who have experienced really similar things to me. I feel like this would be a good place to get some understanding advice. 
I'm a 17 year old female military dependent. Got an NDad and possible NMom. Both were physically abusive from time to time, but the emotional abuse and manipulation has always gone on. But no one ever found out because we have always lived far away from family. Now i get physical threats sometimes and i am still very afraid of my parents, but most of the abuse i get now is in the form of threats from my mom. 
She has my NDad on a leash. Basically she keeps him from harassing me until i'm doing  something she doesn't like, and then she quits defending me and it's full force abuse just like when i was younger. 
Her favorite methods of manipulating me are with guilt, shaming and threats. She believes that because she drives me everywhere and pays for me to go to prom and for plane tickets to see family (maintaining appearances), that has explained to me that because she does everything for me i should know that she ""cares about me.""
As for the shaming she constantly tells me that any opinion of mine that is different than what she believes or is against her is because of my ""weak mind."" She tells me that I will never make it in the world. If i try to explain to her a behavior that  i do not like, even if i try to be as calm and rational as possible, she makes it very clear that my feelings are due to my ""Victim complex"" and that I am too sensitive.
 And for threats, she will choose whatever it is that I'm worried about at the moment. (Ex: seeing my friends, going to college). The worst one lately, that has been the final straw before I decided I would go NC once I move out is her threatening to take away money for me to go to college because she felt that I wasn't doing enough college and scholarship apps, even though i had been working on some and was taking 3 AP classes at the time. (This is money that has been saved for me specifically. ) At first I thought that I must have been really an awful person for my mom to do that, but then I realized that she has expressed a want for that money to go back to school. I realized that she might actually be trying to plan ahead and have reasons to take it from me for herself. And if she doesnt, that money will be just one more thing for her to hold over my head and use to guilt me/control my behavior. 

Well i'm done. I'm sick of her manipulation. I got accepted to college at a university that is fairly inexpensive when i get in-state tuition and i'm going there next semester. If I need to have some loan debt I think that will be fine, I've been researching ways to tightly control my budget and get that debt paid in a timely manner. I think I can make that work. 

The issue is, I feel completely helpless. I didn't realize this until recently but I think that my NMom has been trying to make it so that i'm not independent. I know how to take care of myself, but I have no idea how to drive. I'm 17 and I have my permit but any time there is time to drive she is either homeschooling my brother or she is at the barn with her horse, or she just tells me to fuck off because she doesn't feel like it. 
I don't  have a job yet to save money for moving out because i live far away from town and there are no buses. Plus, i'm drowning in my studies. 

So basically, right now i'm doing a lot of research for:
-how to deal with my NParents in an acceptable fashion while I am here
-how to move out as quickly as possible
-how i can get a good therapist affordably when i am on my own so i can deal with some of these things properly (hoping there will be one at the college)
-looking at any paid internship opportunities or jobs i could get on campus
-seeing how the hell i could learn to drive or something because thats pretty important to independence, even if i wont have a car yet. 
-what i can do right now to help me deal with stress and my situation (im journaling right now. I feel like it has helped me in a few ways pretty drastically and pretty  quickly. )
-learning how to overcome my depression, anxiety, and mild stress induced dermatillomania (which i just learned was self-mutilation today. I knew it was a bad habit but i didnt  realize it was something that could be brought on by abuse.).

I am studying computer science so I am hopeful that i will be able to find a decent career if i work hard and network properly (even though im anticipating ill be doing some crappy job at first just to make money). I even have some family members that can get me into a company possibly. (if my mom doesnt assassinate my character. )
If anyone else has gone through the same thing or has a cent to contribute even from just like, transitioning out of the household and gaining your independence please let me know. If there is anything you feel would be useful to know or do or expect, please let me know. 
I appreciate your time and wisdom; thankyou in advance. "

The doctor walks a patient to the front desk. He turns around and on the next patient's door is a clipboard. What's in that clipboard? 

1) Superbill that he will need to note stuff on for billing purpose of the day's visit

2) Last visits progress notes

3) Most up to date labs/imaging; though they might be in the computer, the staff has either gotten the results to the doctor, or gone and acquired them the day before, printed them out, and put them in one place for the doctor to see

4) Insurance which comes in handy for the doctor if the patient needs additional referrals out or certain meds are needed

Chart is reviewed quickly in the hallway or in the office 1 door over and then knock knock, enter patient room.
From there its rapid and straight forward. Very few surprises in the middle of the visit, minimal interruptions. Orders, med refills, the note, done with the patient in the room. Note is generated. Finish, bring the patient out, and voila, next clipboard outside the next room is ready. By the time the patient is walked to the front desk area, the computer generated note with patient instructions is sitting there, ready for them in case they need reminder of what to do when.
He can crank out 25 clinic visits in 4-5 hour morning blocks.
I compare that to my teaching residency, primary care clinic where 1/3 of the labs aren't uploaded. And I have to chase down the information, putting the appointment on hold. Same with imaging studies. All those screening exams? Gotta find them myself because they're never scanned into the appropriate places. 

So to /u/pagingdoctork, I've seen how incredibly efficient a clinic is....and I'm so frustrated because teaching clinics, at least mine, is so remarkably inefficient. And it doesn't look like resources are being appropriated to addressing the issue.

63yeob,0,2017-04-07,I no longer know how to handle my disgusting emotionally abusive alcoholic father,thosecalidreams,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/63yeob/i_no_longer_know_how_to_handle_my_disgusting/,"Today, I am really hurting. My father has been an alcoholic for basically as far as I can remember. I got the worst of the abuse when I had my eating disorder when I was a teenager. He didn't even know I was throwing up my food every day, dedicated to hating my body so badly that I would do anything to change it, and during those times he would tell me countless times every day how I was stupid, ""fucked in the head,"" a brat, an idiot, the list goes on. He's even called me selfish which is honestly fucking laughable considering how I always put others first. I try to be a fairly level headed person. I am considerate, I treat people well, I am not an asshole but as you can imagine, he brings out the worst in me, because after some time I became so tired of not fighting back, of taking the abuse. I am now 27. I shouldn't be living at home anymore and I hate that I do. At the time it was a good decision I made 2 years ago. I had to leave my current job because everyone at the office was doing drugs, I had to get out of a very toxic relationship, and I myself had a serious drug issue, and all of that had to be corrected and I did. I left the job, I got out of the relationship, I got clean, but here I am, still at home. Sure, I am more level headed now, on a clearer path, psychologically diagnosed and medicated, and honestly medication saved my fucking life but living at home is difficult and so is living in NY. Most jobs won't pay you your worth, even when you have the degree and the years of experience to go with it, it's kind of a joke to be honest BUT I digress. I set aside enough money for rent for a year and now I'm faced with two decisions: Do I invest this money into my business, that I've been working obsessively to create for the past two years (I've already put 15,000 into that) or do I just say fuck it, and move out? The plus of renting a small office space is 1) it's cheaper than a fucking apartment and 2) I could hire an intern or two to help me while I mentor them and teach them everything I know. But then there is the home life, which I will eventually have to return to, which for all these years has not changed. And it's not just that he drinks and falls asleep on the couch. He becomes a monster of a person. Arguments, insults, it's all routine here. I see the devil in his eyes and I hate him. He disgusts me. And honestly if I could, I would never want to see or hear from that man ever again in my life, but it would make the rest of my family, who I have a great relationship with, probably think of me so poorly. He recently left the country for a week. I can't tell you how peaceful it felt without him at home. My mom and I could finally relax. Now he's returned and so has the chaos. I want out but I'm faced with two very difficult decisions and I don't know what to do. These thoughts, this stress has been plaguing me for the past month. I don't like to take my anti anxiety medication often but I had to today, I couldn't relax. I usually split my pills in half but didn't this time. I ended up dozing off while getting a manicure. How fucking embarrassing is that? Apparently it's common for children of alcoholics to have anxiety issues because as they grow up they literally don't know what they're coming home to. I want to have my own life. I want to be happy, I want to feel free, I want to be able to take a deep breathe, not a shallow one. It's impossible to know how to separate this money and what to put it towards. On one hand I could afford rent for an entire year, but after that year, I would just need to figure it out. If that was the ""worst case scenario"" and my business doesn't start to do well by the summer, then it's not the end of the world I suppose but I cannot even begin to express how fucking TORN I feel. Because what if this money invested into the site makes it a success, which in and of itself would provide me the resources to have my own home, my own apartment, my own life. I am living in a state of ""What if"" and it is literally destroying me from the inside out. I want to make a calculated decision but don't know where to begin. I've made budgets, tried to play with the numbers but I am not sure I can have the best of both worlds, meaning having an apartment and sufficient money to invest in the website. I don't NEED an office space but an apartment would be heavenly. The thing though is, with all the money going into the apartment, how much would I actually have left to invest in my website? This all so complicated. Please be considerate and polite in your comments, I have had too much abuse for one day. "

Dragi susținători ai USR,

Susținerea și entuziasmul vostru sunt factorii cei mai importanți care ne-au mânat în lupta foarte grea pe care am dus-o în campanie, dar mai ales, în partea mult mai grea, a adaptării la viața politică din România.

Cred că, pentru ca democrația să fie împlinită, trebuie ca oamenii să aibă putere reală de decizie. Pentru asta este necesar accesul la informație.

Din acest motiv am considerat atât de importantă reconectarea cu voi, în planul informațional și să ne asigurăm că cele mai importante vești din spațiul politic al USR ajung la voi.

Am ales această săptămână și pentru că acum am inițiat Consultarea publică ''[Fără penali în funcții publice](https://www.facebook.com/notes/uniunea-salva%C8%9Bi-rom%C3%A2nia/solu%C8%9Bii-pentru-un-parlament-f%C4%83r%C4%83-penali/1323141687777012)'', primul pas într-un proiect politic esențial al USR, proiect izvorât tocmai din strigătul nostru clar atât din campanie cât și din stradă.

De asemenea, îmi face plăcere să anunț că USR a format o echipă de analiză de politici, devenind astfel primul grup parlamentar care are un think-tank intern, punând resursele parlamentare la comun. Echipa a produs deja patru materiale extrem de interesante:

- Analiza fondului suveran PSD
- UE cu mai multe viteze
- Centura Bucureștiului
- Asistența medicală comunitară

Să ne reauzim cu bine,

63zsu1,4,2017-04-07,Career Path Advice?,mustachepantsparty,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/63zsu1/career_path_advice/,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for some objective advice on how I should pursue the next few days with a couple of opportunities I've been presented with. 

I work in a training department of my company, in a role that I've had since I was hired on over a year ago. Two weeks ago a manager at a different department offered me a position on his team, which is enticing because they are great people to work with, the role seems it will continue my skills development, and he said he'll fight for a promotion for me during the mid-year promotion window in June. 

At the same time I've been contacted by an old internship boss/advisor about a role on his team at a different company, that according to Glassdoor, pays about $13,000 (raise from $62,000-$75,000) more than my current salary.


Since I began at my current company I finished my Masters degree and look to leverage it and advance my career. My current role doesn't seem to care at all, so I have no qualms in leaving them. The internal transfer seemed like a more known-commodity and the timing of the offer with my old internship boss' communications with me made it so I accepted the transfer. The salary doesn't change, however. 

The promotion is no guarantee - it's not in writing and June isn't that far off for a new manager to have to lobby HR for the promotion. At my company the managers have to like ""fight"" for promotions in an open forum with other managers due to limited resources and such, it's weird. The new department had to fight for my to transfer over as well, as there were some serious politicking going on. I felt very caught in the middle at one point, but I think that was more due to my (soon to be) old director trying to cover his ass than anything else. 

My old internship boss is encouraging me to apply for his gig and I'd assume I'd at least get an interview since I'm qualified. But I'd burn some serious bridges at my current company if I left them after all they and I'd been through. I also think there's a chance the skills I'll enhance at this job will make me more qualified for a higher paying job in the future. I do also think if/when I get this non-guaranteed promotion the raise would probably be %6-10 max. 

What do you think would make sense for me?

63zsyk,3,2017-04-07,(AUS) New Graduate Veterinarian Salary Negotiation,Sasinator94,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/63zsyk/aus_new_graduate_veterinarian_salary_negotiation/,"Hi there /r/personalfinance, I'm hoping to get some direction from those who have more experience. 
I am graduating as a veterinarian in November this year, and I have a job interview tomorrow. Typically in this industry we're told

- you need to have a good job with a supporting boss up front
- you need to have a good salary from the beginning and that means negotiation 

The award for graduate vets is AU$43 000 and it increases slowly based on your level. A veterinarian who has been in practice for 10 years must be paid at least AU$57 000. However, some well-paying internships pay $70 000. So it's not uncommon for people to be paid above the award, I just have no idea how much. I understand no one is really likely to be able to tell me but I just would like some strategies to navigate the situation. 

I've heard this employer pays well above-award, the problem is I don't know how above the award they're willing to pay. 
I believe that I've worked hard in this degree (reflected in my grades) and I can definitely talk to people too. I believe that I'm worth more than the average graduate veterinarian but I don't know what that means financially. I have also been encouraged to specialise by almost all my supervisors so I believe that what I'm saying is substantiated. 
I will be saying that I will accept a position if I don't get an internship. 

I am looking for some tips above how to find out what they're willing to pay me. I also don't know how to approach people in this industry regarding finances. I don't want to offend anyone by asking for too much money but I also don't want to undersell myself, particularly if they're willing to pay me more. "
63zx8u,2,2017-04-07,"[39M4F] Oops, it's locked now.",DeepPowerPoint,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/63zx8u/39m4f_oops_its_locked_now/,"Finally, it was here. 


The cute intern assigned to me had brought in the package that I'd been waiting on ever since I ordered it. It looked a little beat up, but it had been taped up along the way and the box seemed to be all right. I closed my office door and locked it, then took the package into my bathroom and locked that door. Nobody could know about this. I took a deep breath and opened the box. 


Inside was a steel loop the size of my waist, lined with leather, another loop that went between my legs, and a small steel tube that hung down in front, with a steel loop behind it. A chastity belt. I shivered when I held it up. It was the top of the line, custom made to my measurements, with a removable steel-and-rubber anal enema plug and a custom made lock to hold it all together. The website guaranteed that you'd never have to actually take it off if your measurements were accurate, and I had been painstakingly careful about mine. They also had a guarantee about the keys being unique to the lock, with no replacements available for them to send you. My entire body shivered as I looked it over. 

I quickly stripped off my suit. When I was completely naked, I stopped long enough to look myself over in the mirror. Not bad, really. Gym time kept the flab off my gut, and although I wasn't as cut as was in college, I still hadn't gotten the executive officer spread. Decent sized cock, nothing huge, but no complaints. Ass still had edges to it. Blue eyes that women said was one of my best features. Not bad. But I needed something more. 


I picked up the lube from the medicine cabinet. It was unlabeled to avoid anyone guessing what it was. Ass and cock both got a generous amount, as well as the interior of the belt. I took one more breath, and stepped into the steel. Everything slid into place smoothly, even the anal plug. God, it felt good. Like a hand calmly gripping my most intimate bits. I snicked the lock closed, and looked in the mirror. My balls were on display, the belt rode low on my hips. I put my suit back on and modeled it. Nothing was visible. It was perfect. But I didn't want to wear it for the rest of the day. I wanted to build up to wearing it constantly, to see if anything was an issue. I had a dull weekend coming up after today, so I figured that would be the perfect time. I reached for the keys, and put them into the lock. 


They wouldn't turn. 


I stared at the lock in disbelief. It was supposed to be a custom built lock, made out of hardened steel, and it was. And the keys were supposed to be the same. But now that I looked, I realized that these keys were made of cheap brass, and not actual steel. They also had a manufacturer's mark on them, whereas mine had been promised to have no mark. Oh my god. These were the wrong keys.


Despite my predicament, my cock swelled a little bit in its cage. After all, this was kind of what I was looking for. I just wished that I had had some kind of option to remove the belt before things had gotten this permanent. I looked at the banged up box. An idea struck me. Maybe the keys had fallen out. Maybe the intern had seen them. She'd have no idea what they were for. I'd go ask.

63zxio,4,2017-04-07,[F4A] The Basic Protocol,Overgrill,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/63zxio/f4a_the_basic_protocol/,"""War"" may be a bit of an exaggeration, but anyone who claims that Western society is living in racial harmony has their head buried in the sand. Just turn on the news, the US, Europe, it's the same story everywhere. It's not anyone's fault, really- we're genetically designed to associate with those like us. But we're also designed to compete and conquer...

Let's introduce the Black Broadcast Capitalist Enterprises. International underground firm that is part of almost every market imaginable. News broadcasting, commercials, auctioning, farming, construction, law, politics, the film industry, sports... Everything. Though they always have cover-ups, ghost companies used to hide them from true sight. Most of the world has slowly been taken over by BBCE, and now they control enough to start moving.

Nearly every employee for the BBCE and their underling companies is of African descent, and the ones that aren't are very attractive white girls. Well, they weren't very attractive white girls at the start, but the BBCE works in the research industry and the cosmetic industry, and also the plastic surgery industry. They are very attractive now. Though they don't date, they deny any man that talks to them. Apart from a black man. And then if a girl talks to them, well, they'll introduce them to that high-paying secretary job at BBCE, and the cycle continues...

Now, however, they can start their original goal. To make the Black Race supreme. They've always been working towards this goal. Money is funneled into interracial porn productions, sent as child support payments to Black men and the women they breed, used to fund tuition for Black students to attend historically white colleges and universities and support the propaganda spewing Tumblr blogs they write filled with smut. In fact, BC Enterprises is the largest source of funding for the advancement of the Black race the world has ever seen- and it's working. Only, they are ready to launch a new initiative.

the Basic Protocol. Designed to target basic white girls, ones that are cute and the ones that are stunningly hot, the goal is that by the end of the year, nearly every white girl will dream of BBC stretching them out and being filled with the superior sperm. Of course, that takes time... And testing. If people suddenly get suspicious of the copious amounts of interracial porn that they can watch, targeted towards them in particular... No, the BBCE got to where they are now by patience and waiting. They were slaves by these stupid white men, now they'll enslave them. Only, they won't realize they are being enslaved until all their women are breeding black children and every job is taken by the superior black race.

The BBCE control everything, as mentioned above. And when I say everything... I truly mean everything! Every market, every business, everything is managed and monitored. If the BBCE want a famous celebrity to go black, for example Kim Kardashian... They start to influence her. Replace her friends' thoughts and let her friends convert her. Whisper in her ear. And then they put down their hand-made celebrity Kanye West to sweep in and finish the job. Now, millions of teens on instagram look up to Kim, and her sexy black husband...

This is only an example. The first step to the project is to pick a fresh target. I am sure that you boys can find a nice picture of a pretty girl who is ready to be tested and moulded into her ideal image! Then, the influence begins. Start replacing boys in her school with black ones, have her watch her crush get beaten up by a gang of muscular black guys. Surround her with pretty black men and... Her friends. Her friends will be converted in advance, on a more... Enhanced version of the protocol. Sped up. Her friends already love black cock and eagerly work for BBCE. They giggle and point out things like how much bigger and more dominant black men are...

And then they steer it towards sexual conversation. Is it true that black men are bigger? Is it true that once you go black, you can't go back? Stuff like this. Questions that keep our target up at night, pondering about them... At this point, we'll begin to convert her family. Take the men of the house out, her brothers and father, replace them with a new black step-father. This is a long process, but the black agent who will play as the step-father will begin to play subliminal messaging and hypnotic videos that are disguised as films. Ones that get her horny as the sex scenes get steamier, the ones that make her close her eyes at night, but not for sleeping.

Then we amp it up after a few weeks of this. After this amount of time, she's into black guys. But still into whites... And that can't do. We'll make her give a BJ or have sex with a white guy and his tiny penis, and then afterwards, a few days later, have her accidently walk into her step-father, or maybe find a beefed out black guy in the gym showers... Maybe asked on a date from the basketball player in school. And they'll get it on, slowly but surely.

She should have her first black cock within two weeks of amping it up. Then, we give her more black cock, and tiny white cock as well. From there, she'll make her choice. We'll get her addicted to the stunning pleasure of BBC, and then the BBCE will give her an internship at one of their prestigious offices, far away from her family. There, they'll pump her up into an airheaded bimbo secretary and... Rinse and repeat. Until they get the formula for the Basic Protocol down.

Then... They can release it upon the world.

---

The best message to me would be starting off the roleplay by writing about one of the girls. You'll play any man that comes up, and the world and how it reacts to the Basic Protocol, but also about the brainwashing and the effects it has on the four girls! So mentioning how they find themselves thinking about black men... Stuff like that. I'm more likely to ignore you if you don't write a response to the roleplay and get stuck in straight away, just because I can see your writing talent and whether we'll be a good match!"

6419gj,35,2017-04-07,Story Of A Friend,zyxw98,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6419gj/story_of_a_friend/,"Recently, I've starting looking for any rp individuals I might not have recognized till now. Which brings me to the story of C. 

C was four years my senior in high school. He was more of a natural alpha. He was the most popular guy of our school. And he didn't even try to be cool. Back then I thought it was because he was too nice. But now I realize he was polite and didn't really care about others opinion.People would wave to him on the streets. He didn't get laid like a warlord but he pretty much had whomever he wanted, whenever he wanted. Part of the reason behind this was because he was really smart too. He wasted little of his time on girls or parties. He went on too study in one of the biggest unis.

However, there is this one encounter I would like to talk about. It happened just as he finished his 1st year. He still excelled in his studies. He got into his uni's famous tennis team. In short, he was still peaking. But I remember a party at his house, where few of us gathered together. As everybody had passed out drunk or high, we were the only ones left. He just looked at me and said that it's tough out there. I didn't think much of it and just said he was meant for great things.

About a month after the break, I see he has got himself a girlfriend. She looked pretty enough but had that dumb vibe about her. An hb8 on her best day. They lasted a few months and at the end of it, he was pretty miserable. Over the next 3 years, I noticed a pattern. Whenever he accomplished something good, be it a scholarship or an internship or any nation wide competition, a few weeks later he would become exclusive. It would end in a couple of months and for a while he would be miserable.

This is the conclusion I've come to now. Accomplishing something is hard. The hardest thing any man has to do is prove his worth to himself. This doesn't mean running away from your problems or drowning them in whiskey. C validated himself every time he accomplished something. However, he couldn't bear to rest on his laurels. And like anything worthwhile, it took time to achieve his next goal. to ease his suffering, he choose to rather get the easy validation of fickle women. I guess they saw the amount of work it took and realized it wasn't that wonderful.

Lesson learned - Don't rest on your laurels. The rp journey never ends."

A little background about me. I became CPA eligible in January of 2017 and started working for a small firm in tax season. I had experience working in public accounting before as an audit and tax intern, so I had a fair grasp of what to do. I had an offer from a small firm and an office interview with a large firm. I ended up taking the smaller firms offer because there was not guarantee I would work tax with the large firm (I hate audit and would rather do taxes).

Little did I know I was walking into a lot of dysfunction at the firm. It was formally a five-partner firm in 2015 until one of the partners walked out just at the start of tax season. In 2016 it became a four-partner firm then one of the partners has been MIA for the 2017 tax season due to personal reasons. Then just before tax season started another partner announced he was leaving to work in another state at the end of the year.
I was told I was going to work in one of their 3 locations and I ended up at another location without an explanation. I asked when I was going to be transferred and she told me “we’ll wait and see.” It ended up in me having to commute one hour to and from work six times a week. I was promised to make a certain amount from hourly wages throughout the year, but I was on pace to make $4,000 less. 

From the time that tax season started, the partners seem to have been behind in processing returns, and the partner from our office even told me ""I'm so far behind it's not even funny"" this Wednesday. The partners being behind is very understandable given the fact a partner went MIA (the most experienced one at that). Her office is full of returns and last week is when I starting getting concerned about the stability of the firm


Meanwhile, as I started doing returns, I was a bit overconfident on how fast I could process the return. Working on multiple clients, one engagement letter ended up being in another clients file, and I was scolded for it by my Partner and the administrative assistant. From that point forward I didn't make that same mistake again. I probably completed just under 100 returns from the start of tax season to now. I got review notes on about 5 of them, and most of those notes came from formatting preferred by the firm (instead of actual errors based on tax law and knowledge). There was one large return that I had bombed on, but it was nothing I encountered before (1065 with multiple properties that required multiple journal entries). With the help of a senior accountant, I did what was done last year, but that wasn't good enough for the partner. She wanted it done an entirely different way since they had acquired much more properties. With the partner's help, I completed the return but she was infuriated I didn't understand some Basic Accounting (debit and credit journal entries). I was disappointed in myself as well, but financial accounting has always been my Achilles heel, so I didn't let it fester in mind too long.

On Wednesday I was told my hours would be cut from working overtime to just 40 hours a week. I was told they were so far behind that there was not point of me working overtime.Then once I left work that day, I noticed that other cars of my coworkers were still there. I called my Partner once she got home if I was supposed to leave at five that day and she said yes and that others stayed longer because they had some ""monthly stuff"" to work on. I asked her about my performance, and she told me that ""mixing up the client's work was a pretty big mistake and she couldn't understand that my thought process on some the returns I filed."" This left worried sick at being laid off so the next day I asked her ""are the mistakes I made redeemable""? She then looked away gave some evil grin and said ""this place is not for you, "" and then we went on to say that the mistakes I made on the large return and mixing up the client's work were crucial mistakes and that I ""made the same mistakes over and over."" I was flabbergasted because I am confident I didn't make the same mistakes and have not gotten review notes stating I did. From what I can tell, she or anybody else hasn't even reviewed 40% of the work I turned in because of the stock pile of tax returns in her office. I asked her for more details on what she meant, and she avoided it by just repeatedly saying that “this place isn't for you but that doesn't mean other places aren't. This is a faced paced environment, etc. , etc.” Earlier this week coworkers were telling me I was doing a good job and that mistakes were made by a lot of first-year employees.  As a matter of fact an experienced staff accountant at the firm told me I recognized much more details in the returns I was given then she did her first year and couldn't answer questions I had about returns 75% of the time. I asked the partner when did she think about letting me know she was going to fire me then she told me after tax season. I then went home and thought about putting a two weeks notice in and having my reason of leaving be because of all the disfunction and lying that went on at the firm. 
When I got to work today, I went to the Partners office and was about to put my two weeks notice in. She then blindsided my saying that she was letting me go today and gave me my pay for the work these past two weeks and pay throughout the month of April. Also, she said she could refer me to a small company as an AP clerk. I was stunned. Sure I was happy I got free money (pay throughout the week of April), but I am no longer in a position to state “left because of disfunction.” I was fired, and she only told be it was because of my performance. However, from what I can tell I was doing good and she couldn’t even specifically tell me what I did wrong (besides the mixing up the information and the giant return blender). 

Most of the returns were simple 1040s with Schedule As, Bs, Cs, etc.. I didn’t struggle with most of them at all. I had done taxes from being an intern beforehand.
It looks to me they were anticipating losing a lot of clients because of late tax returns and a partner leaving the firm (with another one who is MIA who btw has been wanting to retire for years). It seemed like I was the one who had to be sacrificed. Hell, they gave me free money, and a job lead as if they knew they were wrong for what they were doing.

Anyways, I have a couple of months to look for a job now until I become bankrupt. I love taxes, and I want to work in public accounting and continue to pursue that field. What should I put down when stated reason for leaving? I don’t want to be put laid off because of performance because that just doesn’t seem to be the case. It would not only limit my job options, but I would feel that I was lying. Also, I don’t want to lie and put I put in my two weeks because of the dysfunction, because that is a lie and I’m sure they would call the firm and double check. What should I do?

TL:DR The small firm I worked for is seeming to be falling apart (losing partners, not filing tax returns in a reasonable amount of time, liying to me about pay and job location) and I feel I was fired today because they anticipate a loss in revenue. I was told it was because of performance but I have been told by my peers at work I am doing just fine. They gave a month of free pay and a job lead to a AP clerk job which makes me further suspect their guilt. What should I put for the ""reason for leaving"" when applying for other public accounting firms? I was laid off out of the blue right before I was going to put in my two weeks notice in so it looks like I was fired for my performances (which I was) but due to the firms dysfunction and my experience with taxes it just doesn't seem to be the case.

UPDATE 4/9/17: There has been an update to my  “Just got laid off from a crazy scenario in Public Accounting, not sure what to do next” story and I need additional guidance. The firm gave me a reference to a job to be a GL accountant working at a paper mill. It seems like a decent job and more respectable than an AP clerk. They sent me an email stating if I apply they will get the application “in the right hands.” However, at the end of the e-mail they state “ Also, XYZ company hires from within. Meaning if &lt;MyName&gt; takes any job in the Mill, he could get moved or promoted.
My trust with this firm has been tarnished obviously, and it seems possible they are trying to waste my time and lure me into some blue collar work in a paper mill. Also, since they are close to the firm, they may be seeing what I would say about my reason for leaving (if I got fired or I left the hectic environment). I may be pessimistic, but I just want somebody's else's view on this. Should I attempt to take the Paper mill accountant job and risk being fucked over? I'm not in exactly rolling in money and need a job soon.

BTW: The AP clerk job I mentioned was actually the GL accountant job. I guess I misheard her after being let go that morning.I was and still am shell shocked about this entire situation."
642p67,2,2017-04-07,My best friend got the internship,notmyfirsttthrowaway,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/642p67/my_best_friend_got_the_internship/,"My best friend and I found out at an interview that we were going up for the same position. This is at a news station and through a program where it would be a paid internship, plus matching funds for scholarship the next semester. Plus, you continue the internship until you graduate, so it's a guaranteed paid 40 hour a week summer internship. Super important. 

We were told after our interviews that we'd be contacted by the responsible program coordinator within the next two weeks about the follow up interview. I found out today from my friend, who is also my roommate, that she received at least two emails from them (the first I don't know when) and another yesterday, plus a call telling her that she was asked back to interview with the channel some more.

I have nothing. 

I concluded immediately after that I was not getting an interview, and consequently an internship. I cried, and I've been crying for a few hours now. I always knew she'd get it instead of me because she's so much more qualified than me in everything, even though I have more experience in this field it was clearly not enough to match what she has. I'm not sure why I ever tried to apply or even try in the first place. I feel like the worst person for being so angry and sad and hurt that she has it rather than me. I should support her, but I can't right now. I'm mostly upset because she waited to tell me, and she knew while I was clinging on to hope that today was the day they'd tell me at least something. 

I want to completely give up on everything I've hoped to do in the future. I can't even get far enough for one more interview. It's too late to apply for other paid summer internships. I can't even believe I'd want to try for a paid. I'm planning on emailing the program and asking if I can get an answer now rather than wait for the process to be over ,which is when they tell you if you haven't been selected. I feel like an idiot.

It’s a bit long, bear with me.



-----



**Context**


My family situation is a bit weird. My parents have been divorced since I was 7 and my father has never provided any kind of financial support. I am not in contact with him nor do I want to be. They are immigrants. My mother speaks English and works a decent low-skilled job making about $40,000 annually. After my father left, my brother (35M) started making financial contributions to the household, but there is no paper trail of that as far as I know. With his help, my mother was able to mortgage a house for about $450,000. She currently has about half of it paid off and since buying 10-11 years ago. They had a massive falling out years ago and now refuse to speak to one another. My brother moved out at that time and stopped helping with the mortgage.



In this time, my brother has insisted that the financial help he gave my mother was for my sake. I do not doubt this; my brother is not perfect, but he was always a big influence in my life. My mother and I have always had a shitty relationship, and when he was younger he used to lecture me to treat her better. Now that they’ve had this falling out, he curses about her even more than I used to. Since moving out he has told me “do not let her sell the house, half of that money is yours” and he calls her a vampire and a leech. I am still living at home because of school and won’t be graduating for years.


---


**Problem**


Since my brother left, my mom tells me she can’t afford the mortgage on the house. Today she told me was going to sell it and downgrade. She has threatened this before and never came through.


I did once try to get her help with the mortgage. I negotiated with extended relatives with my brother on her behalf for financial assistance, which she refused citing the fact that they’re assholes. I can believe that, but the fact that she insisted on doing it alone when she had an out, coupled with the fact that she has asked me for money and also stolen from me, really pisses me off.



When I got a full-time internship this year she began asking me for money. We had hail damage on the house so she told me to give her $3,000, she would drive me to the bank the next day to take it out. I was about to do it but ended up saying no and we had a massive fight about it. She called me ungrateful and kept bringing up how much money I made at my internship and how I wouldn’t give her any of it and kept wasting it on clothes and makeup.



Any money I give her from my internship would barely make a dent in this mortgage, and I was only employed for eight months. I like to think I am fiscally responsible, I save a lot of my income, get scholarships, took out my own student loans and will pay them off by myself. She also buys clothes and other things, so it’s not as if she lives like a nun. She got an insurance payout earlier this year for another incident and went on a massive Bed Bath and Beyond shopping spree.



She also stole money from me. She cashed one of my scholarship cheques in her name for $1,000 and also took about $1,000 I had in cash. She later paid me back after admitting to it months later, only after I asked her about the cheque. My brother says she stole from him as well.



My mother is in about $10,000 of non-mortgage debt, likely more, and since disclosing that she has purchased a new (used) vehicle since her old one broke down. So let’s guesstimate $20,000 in debt.


We got into another fight about a trip I am going on this summer. I hadn’t told her about it yet but she found out through a relative after my brother told them he bought me the ticket. She said she was sick of my shit, I don’t do anything around the house, etc. That’s when she threatened to sell it.



Admittedly, the house is too large for the both of us and I don’t help her with its maintenance. That’s shitty of me. I haven’t seen the deed to the house so I have no idea if I have a legal stake in it, but my brother seems convinced. The real estate itself matters to me, as this house is likely my only inheritance. I am aware I am not entitled to anything, but I don’t know where to go from here.



Am I obligated to give her money for living in this house and being her daughter? I want to protect myself and my brother’s investment in this house, but I also see my mother’s point of view that if I don’t help her with it she’ll just get rid of it. Should I just let her sell it and fight for a portion of the money? It’s not enough to buy even half of another property, so she’ll just be stuck with a different mortgage. And even if she doesn’t sell it, I still have to live here with her. Do I just continue as I have been, living separate lives, arguing sometimes? Move out? No contact? Or am I being unreasonable and selfish?

-----


Tl;dr my mother has been asking me for money, even stealing from me, now says she wants to sell the house that my brother helped her buy (for my sake). Even if she does not, I am still living here for the foreseeable future. What do?

6435ev,400,2017-04-07,"30-Day Challenge #4: Update your resume, get an internship, keep your wardrobe updated, or ask for a raise! (April, 2017)",AutoModerator,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6435ev/30day_challenge_4_update_your_resume_get_an/,"# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Update your resume, get an internship, keep your wardrobe updated, or ask for a raise**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've completed any one of these steps.

#Why is this important?

A 40-hour work week will take up about 24% of the 168 hours you have available in the week. If you're getting the recommended 8 hours of sleep, 36% of your day is spent at work.

This is why it's important to have a job that provides you with both income *and* personal happiness.

Even if you're gainfully employed and not thinking of jumping ship, you might still want to consider dressing for success, keeping your resume up-to-date, or even asking for a raise.

#1. If you're a student who is free this summer and haven't done so already: get yourself an internship!

Taking an internship or co-op while you're an undergrad is by far [one of the most effective career boosters out there](http://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/04/15/when-a-degree-isnt-enough), and can still benefit you even if it's unpaid. It allows you to network, get real world experience, get professional feedback, and [other important things](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161015025146/http://www.laneterralever.com/the-benefits-of-internships-before-college-graduation).

So if you haven't done so, consider building your resume with intern experience, especially if you're free this summer. Speaking of resumes...

#2. Keep your resume up-to-date and constantly seek feedback

Even if you're not jumping ship, optimizing your resume and keeping it up to date is still important. Here are some good resources for resume building:

* [*Resume Writing*](https://www.rit.edu/emcs/oce/alumni/resume-writing) from Rochester Institute of Technology
* [*Resume Writing Tips*](http://www.resume-help.org/resume_writing_tips.htm) from resume-help.org
* [*The /r/resumes FAQ*](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/faq)

If you have a professional profile (like LinkedIn, professional societies, or trade societies), make sure you update that too!

And one final thing: Don't forget to polish up your interview skills if you're going to go job hunting.

#3. Remember to dress for success

In the workplace, you should keep your hair neat (facial hair included!), your clothes should properly fit, and your outfit should be clean. Appearances and first impressions matter, and one source states ""41 percent of employers said that people who dress better or more professionally tend to be promoted."" ([Source](http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/07/30/cb.dress.for.success/index.html?eref=rss_latest))

If you are out interviewing, make sure your suit or outfit is appropriate for the interview. There is also /r/femalefashionadvice and /r/malefashionadvice to help you on your way.

#4. Consider the best time to ask for a raise or promotion

Remember to **do your research** on this one before acting on it. A lot of raises are dependent on company policy, timing, negotiation skills, negotiation tactics, and several other things.

Here are some good sources on asking for a raise:

* [*How To Ask For A Raise – And Get It*](http://www.forbes.com/sites/learnvest/2014/05/07/how-to-ask-for-a-raise-and-get-it/) from Forbes

643amw,2,2017-04-07,Marriage and all that comes with it.,jeremiah1119,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/643amw/marriage_and_all_that_comes_with_it/,"Hey everyone, thanks for giving this a click. So I am a college junior (month left until school is done, then I will begin my senior year in August) and I am planning on getting married. Our plan is to be engaged sometime this summer, and get married soon after I graduate. She will still have one year left after the fact.

The main thing I want to know is what I should be prepared for and what I need to do research on to be informed. 

Information about us: I will graduate with a  dual degree in Information Systems and in Marketing. I have no health problems and currently work as an intern making $15/hour. She will graduate with a Bachelors in Nursing. She does not work during school, but is applying for positions her senior year as well as during summer since her workload decreases then. Important note though, she has type-1 diabetes so I already know that her equipment is expensive. We both expect to make around $50k/year starting salary based on similar job opportunities in the area. 

When we get married, I understand that we will be leaving our parent's aid, so I want to be prepared for expenses. 

**List of foreseeable expenses.**

- **Car insurance**: Mine is ~$70 through Safeco, hers is ~$200. (she doesn't know as her parents pay. She's only had one accident so I believe the cost is mostly from not shopping around for better rates)


- **Car Payment**: I currently pay my parents for my car, but will eventually sell/trade in when I can. $65/month. Her car is paid off and had a new transmission, so hopefully we're set on car trouble.


- **Phone Plan**: I am with T-mobile (over 10 years) and she is with Verizon on her aunt's account. I have a large family so the family plans were a no brainer, but with only two it's not necessary. Any tips on how to shop around? (she doesn't use much data but I'm spoiled with the ~30gb rollback per month)


- **Student Loans**: I will have ~$35k total (from ~3-5%), and she will have ~$80k(from 4-6%). Frankly I'm not too worried about these at the moment, because they can be easily budgeted for every month. The big thing I'm worried about is... 


- **Health Cost**: Currently I am an hourly intern, so I don't have benefits. But my company wants to create positions for me to move into when I graduate (they have named 3 in particular. I'm not considering it a guarantee since I don't have it in writing, so no need to tell me). Our health insurance (according to a document from 2016) has a $3,000 person/$6,000 family in-network deductible. That seems extremely high to me. But, it says in the common medical event page, ""No charge Diabetic supplies and medications (including insulin)"". Does that mean after the deductible only, and there is no copay?

- **Rent** will probably rent the first year or two until we get some capital to make a down payment. Average would be ~$400-$600/month on rent.

And that's pretty much what I have in mind as far as major expenses. I have a real budget with each transaction/payment I make. 

Now I don't want you to list everything out for me, but basically I'd like to have an opinion on how to budget for big expenses such as medical costs and emergencies, as well as how to simply prepare to be on my own. I'm well aware that my costs will go up since I won't have my parents credit (my parents have excellent credit, her parents seem to have decent credit) to bring insurance down. 

What's the best way to shop around for car insurance? What's with the HSA since we have a HDHP, is that aimed for retirement only? Or help year to year with that deductible. What do you expect to go up? Renters insurance will be a thing, who should I talk to in order to figure out details? I haven't decided if I want to approach with the snowball or avalanche method yet, I feel like I'll start with the highest interest/lowest amount and see from there how to tackle the majority of the other loans.

Thanks for reading"
643ehg,2,2017-04-07,Some life choices,DoctorHL,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/643ehg/some_life_choices/,"I'm at a point in my life that I have multiple things that I want and I can't for the life of me decide which ones to pursue and which to put in the past. 

For some background information, I'm a twenty-two year old college student in Arkansas. That's one of my big issues right there. I started studying Computer Science in my junior year of high school and I've stuck with that ever since. I've worked a couple of internships and jobs in that field over the years and I can't do it anymore. Sitting in an office for eight or nine hours a day with people who I don't have any attachment to other than that I work with them is something I can't imagine doing for the rest of my life anymore. So I've switched my major to welding as of today. A choice my parents aren't happy with because they want me to do what ever they want.

Before I switched my major I was trying for the last year to join the Marine Corps because I've always had a calling to join and have that pride of serving our country. I never did when I was younger because my parents always told me that I'm going to college and that's that. No discussion. I'm a big boy now so I decided to try anyway, but all the recruiters I talked to wouldn't even try for me because of my tattoo not being in regulation and because I've had law problems several years in the past. Now my friend who is a recruiter in another state said now is the best chance for me to try again. I want to, but it can't be that easy.

I have a girlfriend that is really influencing my decisions too. It's pretty serious by my standards since we've been together nine months. (My longest before was maybe four months.) We live together with her two dogs and my one dog. 

I said all of that to get to my main point which is that I don't have a single clue what to do right now. Do I stay in Computer Science to keep my family
happy? Do I go through with welding so I can provide a decent living for my girlfriend and our dogs? Or do I join the Marines and piss off my parents and put my girlfriend through that kind of relationship where she'd be caring for my dog while I'm away for months at a time or deal with a break up if it's all too hard on our relationship. 

Not looking for advice, but there's so much going on in my head and I feel like there's no one else to talk to about it all.

644l8m,0,2017-04-07,[Help] Getting a dog while in college. Advice needed.,Dogadviceneeded,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/644l8m/help_getting_a_dog_while_in_college_advice_needed/,"Hi Reddit, I've been really wanting a dog for a long time now. I'm a 21 year old male at a large public university in Texas. I've finally found my dream dog from a great breeder. He would be ready for adoption late May, after I finish my current semester. This way I'll have more time to focus on raising him for the first 3 months without classes. I'll be an upcoming senior and will be living in a large house with a bunch of roommates and large yard. I've had many family dogs in the past, and last spring my sophomore year I fostered a rescue puppy for over a month. It was a great experience so I definitely have an idea of what I'm getting into. 

However the only thing that is holding me back is my working situation. It's actually almost ideal for having a dog, but I'm still a little worried. It's a start-up company located less than 10 minutes from my house. I'm currently working there part time and will continue until late July/early august. I usually only work 15-20 hours a week, and the shift vary. Usually they are 3pm-8pm or 9am-1pm four days a week. 

Is this a concern? Would it be a problem to let him roam my current house alone? Should I keep him in a crate for 4 hours, 4 days a week? I'll also add that this start-up is very laid back and reasonable. They are also dog-friendly, but I'm a new intern and would feel wrong bringing a new puppy to my job and not getting any work done. I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem to clock out for 30 min mid day to check on my pup. Let me know some thoughts or any similar experience you've had. I'll also answer any questions with information I may have forgot to include."

I'm going to be taking my LSAT in my second semester of my Junior year around the beginning of February, which I will be studying for over the summer and in my first semester of Junior year. 

I've done a lot of research into what law schools are looking for, and what makes a student competitive. Though some of it is repetitive, a lot of sources counteract one another based upon what law schools are really looking for when it comes to choosing candidates.  I am aiming to enter into the NYU law school, and I was wondering based upon the info I've given you guys, if I would serve a chance of getting in. I feel like a 3.6 is good, but I know I could do better; I'm going to kick it into overdrive this Junior year to see if I can bump it up to at least a 3.8. I also do many activities outside and on campus, where I am the President of a comedy club located on my campus and have participated in internships over the summer. 

Please let me know what your professional opinions are regarding my standing to enter into law school. The process has been stressful, and I feel that getting a second opinion from a creditable source can really help me better understand my standing. "

My ex (Sara) always seemed very happy, though stressed with schoolwork. She dumped me when she was a few weeks into her internship in Florida when I was home in Atlanta. 

We had gone long distance before, and while it was hard we always got through it stronger than before. Since it came out of nowhere, I was pretty devastated, but was able to more or less move on after a few months of not seeing or talking to her at all.

We go to the same university though and we share a friend group, so come the fall semester a lot of feelings came back to me when I saw her around campus or in social situations which made it hard. Then she started dating another guy. After a month or so I was able to move on again. A few weeks ago, around four months since she started dating the other guy, Sara texts me out of the blue talking about random stuff like we would when we were dating. Turns out she broke up with the other guy, her aunt died, and she was sad and wanted to reconnect.

She kept saying she's changed, that she misses her best friend (me), her dad hasn't given up on us, and she just wants to be friendly again. Feeling bad because of her aunt, I started talking to her over text a little bit, wary because I definitely did not want to get back together with her at this point, though far down the line I could see it possibly happening if we were both in the right place.

After a few weeks of that, she randomly stopped texting me. The last thing I sent her was asking about if she got her Macbook screen repaired, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't over something I said. I'm thinking she got the attention/pity she wanted out of me and now she's back to wanting nothing to do with me. Now I want to avoid parties/get togethers that she'll be at because I feel used and really angry. Am I wrong to be angry at this? I shouldn't have to replied to her at all in the first place. Any advice is appreciated.

645n7d,3,2017-04-08,I got the internship,nickle54,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/645n7d/i_got_the_internship/,"But I don't know what the fuck to do.

There's a program at my school for engineers that you interview into and if you get in, you're guaranteed 2, 6 month paid internships with 2 different companies. I was chosen for an internship and I was so excited about it... until I found out where it was located. Its a 1.5 hour commute from my house *one way*, and the company itself is in a bad area. If it was just 45 minutes closer to me, I wouldn't mind the latter as much, but because its so far and in such a bad area, I don't have the option to relocate either.
The company is well known, and this opportunity is amazing for an undergrad engineer like me, so it is absolutely killing me that I'm going to have to turn this down because of a fucking physical barrier rather than an ability barrier.

That company wanted me. They picked *me* out of everyone that interviewed, to be a project lead, and the fucking distance is what will make me turn it down.

A good thing about this program is I can reapply and interview in every semester, so its not like this is a one time thing, but I really really *really* wanted to be able to take this opportunity.

I told them I would take the weekend to think about it because the commute was much father than I originally said would be ok in my interview (which I said 30-45 min commute) so I will continue to mull over my options, but my god I'm so upset about this. The fact that this is such a well known company is what sucks, because it would look absolutely amazing on my resume.

Ugh.

As the sub suggests, just needed to get this off my chest."

(PATH is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work for free as ""interns"" for companies) (Opinion piece)",rubblaz,AusPol,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPol/comments/646ai7/are_the_path_internships_really_voluntary_path_is/,"**What is the PATH ""internships"" program?**

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

It is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work as ""interns"" for companies.

--------

**How long does the ""internship"" last?**

Up to 12 weeks.

--------

**Are those ""interns"" paid any money?**

Those ""interns"" are not paid any money by the companies.

The government keeps paying the ""interns"" the Newstart payment and additionally $100 more per week.

--------

**Are those companies paid any money?**

Yes, those companies are paid $1,000 to employ each ""intern"" even if they don't give them any job after the internship.

This program is like paying money to companies so they employ people for free.

--------

**Are those ""internships"" really voluntary?**

The PATH ""internships"" are referred as ""voluntary"" in official documentation by the government:

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

&gt; PaTH internships are voluntary and can be ended at any time, without penalty.

I have read the proposed legislation in the website of parliament and I think that's not true, let me explain it.

The proposed legislation is here:

http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5734

The ""Explanatory memorandum"" of the bill is here: 

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r5734_ems_d5756521-50de-48bf-aca9-2dd011ab2ff4/upload_pdf/496999.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The text of the bill is here:

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r5734_first-reps/toc_pdf/16140b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The proposed legislation says that the Centrelink payment, while undergoing the PATH ""internship"", can be cancelled ""as a result (whether direct or indirect) of a voluntary act of the person that was not reasonable"" (page 9 of the bill), do you see that the wording is very *vague*? ""not reasonable"" could mean anything, if the ""intern"" refuses to do something that the employer wants then to do that could lead to the payments being cut.

The ""interns"" will be afraid that if they do something that displease the employers then their Centrelink payments will be cancelled and they will need to apply again and wait some weeks before receiving the payment again.

And those ""interns"" will not have any savings, because the Newstart payment is very small, so they will be suffering a lot if it is cut.

Please notice, this is very important, that the companies that will be hiring the ""interns"" won't be respectable companies like IBM or Microsoft, no, those companies will probably be very small companies or subcontractors or recruiters, so those companies will not necessarily have a high level of ethics, which means those companies will probably be more prone to exploiting the ""interns"" noticing that the ""interns"" will be afraid of losing their Centrelink payments.

And, this is also important, the Liberal government will probably extend the system to people of all ages later, not only the young, which will open the door of seeing very old people with disabilities being exploited by those companies and without those problems being shown in the media.

Do you have any opinion about what I said?"
646cdq,1,2017-04-08,"I [M, 25] had to move back in with my parents [m/f 60] and nuclear warfare ensued",Aurora921,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/646cdq/i_m_25_had_to_move_back_in_with_my_parents_mf_60/,"So this is rather complicated. I broke up with my GF [w, 27] of 5 years a couple of weeks ago. We were living in a village at the edge of civilisation and I decided it would be best to move back in with my parents short-period (who live in a metropolitan area) and try to find some work for 3-4 months until I move abroad for a Masters at an Ivy league institution upcoming fall. 

My parents have never been easy. My father is a bitter man in a wheelchair, married to a woman with severe schizophrenia. He likes to act like a tyrant and still treats me as a child.

So, a grown man, I naturally do not have as much time as I had when I was a child. I have to take care of my job applications as well as health and pursue other stuff. But for the few weeks I have lived here, they have bombarded me with demands every single day. After I had spent a lot of time renovating my former sleeping and living room, my grandma [w. 90] had some back problems so I had to take care of her hospitalisation as well. Apart from that, my parents have numerous demands which are extremely time-consuming and keep me from working. In other words: For the four weeks that I have stayed here, I had to spend 6-10 hours every single day just taking care of their stuff.

So, I just came back yesterday from a 5 day holiday and in good mood. But the first thing my father said when I entered the house was: Tomorrow morning you MUST do this and that. I told him that I have important appointments concerning my job applications and that I generally do not have time in the mornings. But that was not good enough for him. I even told him that I am willing to take care of the grocery shopping along the way but he insisted on coming along, which is extremely exhausting as well (as he commands me around in front of people we know). So after I said no and offered a compromise, he played his general routine which is flouting and refusing to talk to me. Honestly, seeing this 60 year old man acting like a 6 year old child disgusts me.

Today I tried to tell him again that I am willing to compromise and he again refused to talk to me and took away my car keys because ""he has to look for an alternative driver"". When I tried to explain my point of view he did something he always does, which is just saying ""it's okay, just fuck off"", which is where I lost my shit. I started to shout at him that I cannot accept him scheduling my whole day and not allowing me to live my own life just because I live with him for a couple of months. 

When such situations ensue, no reasonable discussion is possible. He completely shuts down, blames me completely and tells me to move out as soon as possible. He generally is a man that does not take ""no"" for an answer and treats my time with utter disrespect. He also likes to think that having raised me means I am know obliged to do whatever he wants. While I can accept helping out my parents on a reasonable level, bearing and raising a child is not meant to be some cheap way of retirement provision.

The situation, as said at the beginning, is even more complicated because of the numerous illnesses of my parents - my father is in a wheelchair - and the support they need. They do not have a lot of money and are dependent on help. While we have a lot of support from the government and individuals, there is not a lot of options for stuff that involves driving.  I am not denying them that help completely, but it must not negatively affect my own life. That is something my father is not willing to understand. It is not possible to sit at a table with this man and discuss things reasonably, its either his way or the highway. His way of arguing is extremely immature, especially when talking to family members. He has absolutely no respect for my time and he does not see that I am wasting my potential with this, because the timeframe for possible internships is getting tighter and tighter.

I really don't know what to do at this point. Discussions and different viewpoints always escalate like this. Moving out is possible but extremely difficult because I do not have a lot of money per month and living costs are high everywhere.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Extremely immature and ill father tries to control my daily schedule.

6476xy,2,2017-04-08,What do you make of this guy I dated?,musso_kn,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6476xy/what_do_you_make_of_this_guy_i_dated/,"The situation ended a few weeks ago and we haven’t spoken at all since, but I am still confused about why it happened in the way that it did. Perhaps one of you can provide some interesting insight. To be clear, I have no intention of speaking to him ever again, and I am coming to accept that what's done is done and that I should get over it. But I still don't quite get it.

In mid January, a month after breaking up with my long term boyfriend, my friends jokingly set me up a tinder profile. I went along with it because I found it quite funny and told them I probably wasn’t going to use it at all. In the next 24 hours, I swiped left on most guys and the few I did match with came across as creepy. I received a super like from a pretty good looking and seemingly charming (based on his short, but witty bio) guy and swiped right. He engaged me in good conversation from the start and spoke constantly over the next five days before meeting up for crazy golf and dinner for our first date.

Now let me give you a lowdown on what I had gathered about him as a person before we went on a date and a bit about myself. I’m a final year uni student living in Birmingham, UK. He’s in his penultimate year at university in Nottingham and is living in Birmingham while he completes a year long internship as a part of his course. Before meeting him, I had only every been involved with my ex, who I was with for two and half years. My tinder man has had three serious relationships since the age of eighteen, each lasting 4 – 6 months. I gathered in between he had had A LOT of flings. I later came to find out I was girl number twenty.

I was apprehensive about the first date. Given his history and the fact he seemed a little on the cocky side, I wasn’t sure how he’d come across. I did enjoy the banter we had over text – I am a fairly strong character and give as good as I get, so I appreciate a challenge. My ex had a similar personality in certain respects.

However, it went very well. There wassn’t a single dull or awkward moment. We spoke incredibly frankly about our past relationships, our families, our education and aspirations and our interests. We had a debate or two and disagreed in several areas, yet it didn’t bother either of us. He appeared at first to have a lot of the traits I think I look for – ambition, confidence, strong minded, while being fun and open to new experiences. At the end of the date he asked me what I would say to a second date – dinner round at his – and I said yes. He told me later it was one of the strangest first dates he’d ever been on – but that it was also very, very good.

Second date went just as well. Naturally, one thing almost led to another. But I did not sleep with him then and there. I told him I wasn’t interested in casual sex and I a) wanted to get to know someone b) wanted there to be a strong connection and potential for a relationship before sleeping with him. He didn’t push, but he did make a point that it was unusual. Of all his past conquests, he said only one had made him wait more than a few dates and that was his longest relationship – which only ended because she had to return to her home country. He had already told me about her before, so it wasn’t the first I’d heard of her. But he said he respected that.

We met up once or twice a week for the next month and texted every evening. We told each other a lot about ourselves. Every date and every conversation felt as good as the previous one. He didn’t ever sound too unbelieveable (but maybe I was being incredibly naive) but he made his feelings towards me clear: he got on really well with me, liked talking and hanging out with me, felt that we were very similar characters and that I generally understood him, and that there was chemistry. He said he felt comfortable being himself around me and that he could see us in a relationship. There were a few occasions before I finally decided I was ready that he did attempt to have sex with me. After the last one, I told him that I thought I might be ready, but even if we weren’t official, we would have to be exclusive. He agreed. And the next time, I slept with him.

Aaaaaand then it got weird. We carried out talking as normal over the next few days. I didn’t suspect a thing until he asked casually in the middle of conversation if I was sure that I couldn’t just do friends with benefits. I flat out refused and decided I would take it up with him in person during our next date. We went to dinner and then back to his. He told me on the car journey to his that he wasn’t sure he was ready to commit. Why? Well he didn’t want to do long distance when he returned to Nottingham. This was partly because – he strongly implied – he had a reputation to uphold. And he didn’t want to commit fully for the next few months before he went (which I said I was willing to do) because he was scared of falling for someone. He told me he committed in the short term to the girl who moved back to her home country and, having got invested and hurt when she left, he didn’t want to do it again. But he did still want to casually date / friends with benefits until the end of his internship, because he did like me and didn’t think he’d find anyone he’d get on with better while he was here.

I was fuming. We both tried to get our way – I argued he should commit to seeing me exclusively while he insisted we should keep dating casually. Both of us admitted we didn’t want to throw our relationship away entirely. We decided to stay friends. He did imply during this time that there were certain aspects of my personality he wasn’t as attracted to me as he originally made out. As these were directly contradictory with what he had said previously I figured he was either showing his true colours or making excuses for his own behaviour. Weeks later and a few platonic meet ups later, he told me he couldn’t just be friends and didn’t want to see me again. He said he still wanted to keep in touch, although I gathered from his conversation of late that it was rather half hearted. I was starting more conversations than he was. I told him I could see he wasn’t really interested and I wasn’t going to embarrass myself by still talking to him. No words have been exchanged since.

I was – possibly am – more hurt by it than I wanted to admit. I just find it hard to digest he wasted so much of his own time chasing a girl that he probably knew he wouldn’t be able to ensnare in the way he wanted. But I guess that’s the thrill. I do believe he did quite like me – but it was his priorities and lack of maturity that sabotaged any potential. I did say he should keep in touch – but I think I can be sure I probably won’t hear anything now.

So, what do you make of this?"
647eq4,2,2017-04-08,My bf of almost 8 months broke up with me last week,khalisabella,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/647eq4/my_bf_of_almost_8_months_broke_up_with_me_last/,"Hi! It’s my first time posting here. I’ve been round here for quite some time, I knew reddit before but I must admit that I would come here once in a while when it appear on google as a result for my searches. It wasn’t until last summer, that I met the guy who broke up with me a few days back, that I started to come to reddit everyday (or almost).
So, the thing is that last week, this guy broke up with me and he was the one who told me that maybe I would feel better if I just come here and bleed out all my pain. Being here and posing this is very painful for me and, also, I know he might read this as he is an active user (but, to be honest, I don’t really give a rat’s shit).
The story: I met this guy last summer, he was everything I’ve always been looking for. We shared hobbies and have similar taste in music, movies and things like that.  After like a month he was told that he could ask for an Erasmus internship and he had some doubts about it. I told him I didn’t want him to stay just because of me, if he wanted to go he should. We still had 6 months ahead and everything could happen. In case we were still together, we could always talk about how we were going to “survive” that.
Those six months passed and we were really happy together, we had a few arguments about not very important stuff, but everything seemed fine. He found “the perfect place” for him and decided to go for it, because there were several chances for him to get a job there after finishing the internship. I helped him as much as I was able to. I tried to stay positive but 3 weeks before he was moving, I had a very hard time, spent hours at his place crying my heart out, I couldn’t stand the fact that he was moving and I wasn’t going to be able to see him for a long time. He said almost nothing.
 The day he was going was hard but we decided to be positive, to talk whenever it was possible and all that stuff. We even thought about visiting each other or even me looking for a job at the country he is now so that I could be there with him. The first few days seemed fine but…
Like six days later we were talking (I had sent some curriculums and some companies wanted to interview me) and he said he had some doubts about our relationship and wanted to talk to me and know how I was feeling. I told him I was sad but I wanted to be with him. He asked me not to go to visit him or any other thing. He told me he was having a pretty bad time there and hated the country.
Last Saturday we had an argument through whatsapp and he broke up with me. He said he was feeling different about us. Also, he sees our relationship from a different point of view. He also said that it felt like I was asking for a break up as I told him we should have talk about all this before and not now that he is far away. I also told him that I’d rather have a pretty fucked up time without him than knowing he was feeling bad about being with me and make him be miserable by being with me anyways. He never understood that, like he doesn’t know what sacrifice is. It just doesn’t seem fair at all, for either me or him. I was honest with him and told him I’ve been suffering a mild depression for quite some time and it affects me. He offered himself to help me even though he knows he is the last person I might want to talk to. He also asked me to talk to my family (we never talk about anything at home) or my friends (big trouble there, they wanted us to break up from the beginning, they hated him and said we were opposites and a lot of other crap and I know they would try to make me drunk all the time to “feel better” which is going to make it worst).
Since then, my life feels empty, I feel alone all the time. I just want to cry and lay in bed and all I have done is binge watching tv shows, sad tv shows… The rest of the week has been like this:
Day 1. I read something about one of his favourite tv shows, decided to write him so he would know. We talked for a while and everything seems fine. I decided to ask him if it was forever and he said that at this moment, he feels like it is. He doesn’t know how he is going to feel in the future but now he feels like it is forever.
Day 2. Talking to him feels like a drug and I just want to know about him so I asked him how he was feeling and we talked for a while, again everything seems fine until he calls me a nickname, one of those he came up with when we were together. He told me I can write him whenever I want to and he is going to reply when he can, that I’m not bothering him. I asked him if he would come home for a weekend so we could talk about us and he sounded like he was  putting on an excuse (he has tons of work to do and no time).
Day 3. I decided not to write to him and he didn’t wrote me either. 
Day 4. I wrote him asking why this happened to us, why he thinks we might not be together again and all that stuff. He told me then that he didn’t feel like being in love with me or wanting to be with me anymore. He also said that he won’t make that mistake again (second chances) as it never works for no one. He leaves half through the conversation…
Day 5. I decided maybe it was the time to do something for me. I got all his things, presents and all that and throw them into a shopping bag. I wrote him that I had all his stuff apart so if he ever comes, he could just tell me and I would return it and get mine back. I also told him that I don’t hate him, I love him and care about him a lot but I’m sad about how we ended up and about losing his friendship. He told me he would call me when he comes back so we can talk and that he wants us to be friends but some feelings have to pass by first.
Day 6. I decided not to talk to him. I put all his photos from my laptop and phone in a file, upload the file to google drive and delete everything from the laptop and the phone. I keep checking all the time whether he was online or not, so decided to delete the chat also. He didn’t writes…
Day 7 (today). Again, I’m not writing to him but he put a status photo and I looked at it. Worst thing ever, he seems to be sooooo happy without me. I’m kind of sad and mad about the fact that he “wants to be friends” but never writes me anymore. Also, I think to myself that I can write him if I want to talk to him instead of being mad at him. Whenever I try, I can’t stop thinking about that fact that most definitely he doesn’t want to talk to me anymore and that’s why he never writes me. This is driving me crazy.
Also, it’s not helping that his best friend told me that since he moved out of the country he is acting weird. They hardly ever talk and when they do, he seems cold.
I don’t really know what to do now to cope with this. I feel like I have done the worst thing ever to him and I don’t know what it is. Also, I feel hurt by the fact that he wants to be friends and never writes, by the fact that he seems so happy without me and that he won’t come home to talk to me about all this (as it seems not so important for him). I also feel like all this might be just a fake feeling he is having due to the big change, the long distance and being alone again after almost 8 months having me around his place almost every single day. But, on the other hand, I try to convince myself that even if it’s so, the best for me it’s to forget about him because it won’t be worth the wait just to find out he won’t be back with me again, ever.
I might even regret posting this here but really, I need to talk to someone, I need to feel better and have no one to talk to…

6487d8,3,2017-04-08,Mistake,Strixipath,NewMarvelRp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewMarvelRp/comments/6487d8/mistake/,"Once all of the visitors and interrogators had left, one particular glass chamber of the containment wing was silent at last, and the child in the cube was free to stew in regret and fear accompanied by some lovely peace and quiet.  
  
Every few seconds the mangled collection of shards would rattle and an angry sob would be stifled, until even the SWORD agent on watch was looking away uncomfortably and meandering over to the other corner of the wing. Eventually the unfortunate agent (intern, maybe?) assigned to this shift pulled out a cellular phone with earbuds and kept her head low.  
  
*Now.*  
  
The sobbing ceased immediately, having served its purpose. In a quiet flash of light, the frail child materialized and tumbled forwards, landing on his right leg and clenching his jaw to avoid crying out. Wobbly rising to his feet, he brushed the unkempt hair out of his eyes and hopped over to the corner of the chamber. He had to work quickly; there was a very high chance the room was equipped with pressure sensors, and that someone knew he was walking about.  
  
Falling onto his bony elbows and suppressing another cry of pain, the child leaned in as close as he could to the corner of the chamber. Sucking in a breath and falling back onto his knees and shins, he reached out with his arms and made a wrenching motion, as if pulling something into the center of his body. The sound of groaning metal and cracking plaster came from the corner. He rose to his feet again, limping backwards and repeatedly making pulling gestures. The cracking became louder, as did the creaking metal, but the child was quickly becoming exhausted from the repeated exertion. The noise reached a crescendo and the electromagnet was torn through the wall, trailed by hundreds of loops of coiled wire in disarray.  
    
An alarm pierced the silence; a harsh siren accompanied by spoken directions to the affected chamber. In a panic, the child stumbled over and pulled at the heavy machinery. Unable to move the object, he clenched his jaw again and projected another potent aura of magnetokinesis, standing up and swinging it into the air, where it collided with the cube at high speed. Weighed down by the added mass of the dense electromagnet, the metal began to dip towards the floor.  
  
In a flash of light the child disappeared. The crushed cube sprung to life and rotated rapidly to point the electromagnet at another corner. The lights flickered and turned red as the alarm continued to blare and another corner of the room began to splinter apart. With a grunt, the magnetic pull was focused on a single area and another mangled electromagnet was torn from the floor, trailing coiled wire and striking the cube like the first. Both magnets were whipped around to wrench at the other two contained within the lower corners. More splintering of plaster, bending of metal, and crushing of wires.  
  
Armed with four electromagnets the cube turned its aim upwards and pulled with all its might. The child had only a few moments to regret this overzealous decision, uttering a small “wait-” before the ceiling was ripped down and the room collapsed. Hurtling out of the way, the cube-and-magnets combination accelerated rapidly and slammed into the reinforced glass wall, bursting into the containment wing and speeding towards a random doorway. With a fervent scream the four electromagnets were aimed for the metal door and slammed together, bracing for impact.  
    
Ripping through the door and leaving a what resembled a giant bullet hole in the metal, the child continued down wherever this path would lead. Strips of metal from the door now orbited it at high speeds while the electromagnets were arranged in their own defensive ring around the ruined steel cube.    
      
.    
*Faster. Go faster.*    
*You can’t fight them. You’ll always lose.*    
.  
    
Tiles from the walls and floor were stripped away to join each other in magnetic orbit around the steel, the wires, the electromagnets and the convulsing, spiked object occupying the center. The sirens continued. Blinded by terror, the cube slowed to a stop and hovered in the air with all of the magnetized debris revolving around it. It was lost. There was no sign of an exit in this stupid giant sword-shaped building.  
Wait.    
  
.  
    
*Sword-shaped.*    
  
.  
  
Turning the four electromagnets upwards, the cube gave another angry cry and surged upwards, bursting through the ceiling and not stopping. Rising through floor after floor, disrupting system after system, dislocating wires and terminals and at some point ravaging an entire single-occupant bathroom, the churning , writhing mass of steel headed for the highest point it could reach.  
  
--------------  
  
Shattering a glass window, the cube, surrounded by a spherical shield of metal scraps and a revolving ring of electromagnets, emerged violently from the golden hilt of the SWORD and aimlessly wandered out into the palm of the Celestial. Without pause it accelerated for the outskirts of Rogerston, towards the fingers where ships were held.   
  
---------------  
  
OOC: heyo friends of SWORD, now’s your chance to beat up a whirling vortex of steel and death controlled by the mind of an unstable, unruly child with trust issues having a tantrum. Or have a nice chat, because hey, chats are nice. Friends are nice.

# Title

&gt; [REQ] $100 for ticket to prevent losing license. repaid in the amount of $120 on November 20th

# Post contents

---

On August 16th I got an out of state ticket (OH) in the amount of $127 that I was unable to pay due to being in the process of switching from my summer work with Americorps(in WI) to working at home( Rochester, NY). I got notification that if I do not pay the ticket by October 12, then my license will be suspended. I can't afford to lose my license, as my job is 20 minutes away driving, and I drive every day to go to work or my internship. In addition to this, I drive on the expressway and downtown almost every day= passing lots of cops and speeding traps. The costs associated with getting pulled over for driving without a license would be much much worse than paying the ticket, so it is imperative that I pay it back prior to the 12th.

I can provide proof of this ticket/deadline as well as employment if requested.

I will be able to pay back this loan in the amount of $120 on  November 20th(plus any additional fees that may arise from money transfers/paypal), as I will have extra income coming in due starting a second job -I finally finished training for this position, and it starts this week. Please contact me if you have any additional questions. Thank you.

I have an internship this summer and I suspect I might be drug tested. My HR appointment is in a week or so. For the past two weeks, I've used a total of 15 mg - 20 mg of etizolam to go to sleep after amphetamine binges. 

I know that amphetamine clears quick, and I should be able to get off clean w.r.t amp. However, I've never done benzos/thienos and cutting it this close to a test. My HR rep didn't get back to me until the last day of my binge session... 

When I started I had 100 mg in an 80 mL solution. So my dosage schedule was as follows:

From 3/27 – 3/30, I took 1 pill a night. 0.75 * 3 = 2.25
From 4/1 – 4/3, I took 2 pills a night. 0.75 * 2 * 3 = 4.5 
And On 4/6, I took 3 pills. 0.75 * 3 = 2.25 
And 4/7, I took 2 pills. 0.75 * 2 + (0.75)*(0.7/0.5)= 2.55

I'll be staying off etiz. for the next week or until my internship starts. 

Mostly accurate. 
What's your advice to pass my drug test? I am unfamiliar with benzo detection in urine. 

Any advice would be very appreciated! "
64bao8,5,2017-04-09,"My biggest fear in life is having another seizure, anyone else?",accio-lily,Epilepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/64bao8/my_biggest_fear_in_life_is_having_another_seizure/,"I had my first seizure 2 years ago when I was 20. It was during orientation for an internship and I was about 8 hours from home in a small town where I didn't know anyone. The COO and president of the company were all there, and while I was unconscious someone made the interns leave the room for ""privacy"" but the managers and executives just stayed, standing against the wall basically watching it happen and I guess one person calling 911 while an intern who had some first aid training tried to help. I didn't know what was happening and didn't even realize I'd peed my pants until I was already at the hospital. It was humiliating. For the rest of the summer, I had to deal with the fact that the entire office knew what had happened but had been told by hr not to talk to me about it all while trying to figure out how to manage these new seizures and especially side effects from experimenting with different meds and being pretty much alone, unable to drive, and away from my family and friends.

It was awful, but I feel like I should be starting to get over it by now and I'm not. The memory of that first seizure (which to be honest isn't really my own memory, it's more what I've been told because the whole experience is really fuzzy and confusing) still keeps me up at night sometimes and even though I've had my seizures fairly under control for a year (I had a mix of grand-mal and complex partial seizures) and now I know how to recognize my auras and use rescue meds, I'm still terrified of having a seizure in front of people. I just got my drivers license back and I'm about to graduate college and I feel like I live in a constant state of anxiety worrying that I'll have another seizure and be back to square one. The worst part is that stress is one of my triggers so if I start to worry too much I can actually cause a seizure. I don't know anyone else with epilepsy and I feel silly saying seizures are my biggest fear, especially because so many people have it worse, but it's still just really hard. I guess I just wonder if anyone else feels this way, or if it'll ever get better."

But, of course, I'm nervous as can be. I'm a graduate student working on my certification, and I'm trying to go the internship route rather than the more traditional student teaching route. So I need to find my own paid teaching gig, and don't actually have any experience in the classroom. This particular job I'm interviewing for is for a 6th grade math position. I'm confident I will be awesome, and I want that confidence to shine through my inexperience. Should I bring some of the stuff I've done at school, maybe a lesson plan I've created in one of my classes? I've got a few of those to choose from, I really enjoy curriculum design and kind of went overboard during that class. Any advice is welcome!!  

Also, interview attire for women? I'm thinking my black pant suit with a silver/grey scoop neck tank (very conservative cut), black flats, and some minimal silver jewelry. I could go with a pop of color with a blue and lace tank underneath, but I'm not sure.

64c213,1,2017-04-09,Am I [21/F] being crazy or am I actually being taken advantage of from my female friends[21/F]?,throwaway9512903,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/64c213/am_i_21f_being_crazy_or_am_i_actually_being_taken/,"Hello! First time posting, lost time lurker!~ 

So long story short, I'm a super extroverted girl who loves making friends and honestly loves just having a good time (I come from a place where this mentality is very common). I usually hang out with guys because my hobbies / humor is more oriented towards this (i.e video games, memes, etc E T C), so throughout high school I never really got the chance to have like a ""normal high school girl experience"" where you talk about boys and clothes and the Kardashians etc etc. (stereotyping heavily but bottom line never really had people to rely on since guys were kinda dumb AF and didn't know jack about girl stuff). I developed a very niche viewpoint about relationships where everyone in our group kind of hung out together and so I naturally thought that everyone in the world is super friendly and wants to just have a good chill time like me! 


Unlike the rest of my friends, I ended up moving across the country to a large urban city to pursue my dream career and ""make it big in the big apple"" etc. However, throughout my past 3-4 years, I've been riddled with unreliable friends who have only uses me for alcohol, drugs, and parties (I'm very active in this area / am well connected) and honestly been disappointed multiple times / developed a lack of trust towards people in general. I would like to take the time to say that I try very hard to make friends. In the beginning (freshman year), I had little to nothing--had to really build my way up to developing friendships that I actually care about and wanted to pursue further. I can be extremely loyal to these friendships like, if I find a person that I like, I will hook them up with whatever and give them whatever because I think they're cool and deserve it. 


However my main point is that recently (this past year), I've been hanging around more females bc I have a wonderful boyfriend and he doesn't feel comfortable about me hanging around with a lot of guys (who have liked me in the past), but there just tends to be more issues. First off, encountering girls that I actually get along with is super rare--and as a result, I tend to treasure them more. However, I've noticed girls tend to be more sensitive / conniving towards literally everything. Like just tonight (this is what triggered the post), I introduced these two girls (who I introduced to each other mind you..) to some of my close guy friends and everything was so fun--I love introducing people to each other and having a good time. However, I had an intense stomach ache (I'm at the hospital rn) and I thought these girls (who have had my back since freshman year supposedly) were coming with me, but they were just like 


them: ""let me know when you get home safe"" 
me: ""uhhh I'm going to the hospital.. I'm like in so much pain right now...""
them: ""Oh okay! Let me know when you get there""
me. ""....""


Like idk about you, but if one of my close friends, who has hooked me up with countless events, boys, even internships, is hurting, I would totally fucking come right?? I guess I sometimes think it's just for this case, but literally all of my friends do this. They are totally fake and say that they love me etc but just ditch me at the club once they're in. I just hate being taken advantage of and am wondering what's the solution to this? As much as I would love to say ""yeah fuck you guys I'm going to find better friends"", I would literally have no friends except for my boyfriend and his guyfriends and I truly value female companionship because it's so rare to see in my case. 


I guess I came here to say that I'm tired of trying so frickin hard to make friends here and then have girls that take advantage of me just to have a lit time like I guess it's frustrating and degrading to my self image because I'm a girl too.. I want to have those basic brunches, I want someone to critique my outfit, and most of all, I want to just have a great time with great quality conversations, but it's just that these girls always confer with themselves in a group and leave me left out.. 


What do reddit???

  **tl;dr**: Girls are stupid, wondering if this is an internal self-image problem or the girls I've be-friended are actually just assholes. "

I'm currently in college, pursuing a major (Econ/minor in Stat) I'm pretty sure I don't like (and quiet frankly, don't know what I even want to do as a sophomore now) I basically chose this because my dad told me to choose something business related. I have had difficulty being motivated and seeing my friends accomplish things beyond my abilities. I was a mediocre student freshman year and have to catch my GPA up now. I have been stressed out a lot lately in making ends meet with different assignments constantly and other tasks. I screwed up 2 interviews that I really wanted recently (Economics mentor and Financial Assistant for 2 organizations). I get such high anxiety during interviews and I hate myself for it. I jumble words, can't speak properly, my throat completely dries out, lose focus on the question, can't improvise at all for questions and forget things I've prepared myself to say. Overall they are always a mess and I come back entirely mentally defeated. Of-course only to hear back I didn't get it. When something will take a lot of time and prep I push it off which is absolutely awful and more stressful. For example internships, I didn't start applying until only a week ago (way to late for business related internships I believe) and I doubt I'll hear back from any. My friends have already had phone interviews at least and have interviewed for organization's E-board positions which they have either already gotten or I know they will get. I just feel like I'm falling behind and the things I do attempt to do to catch up are just shut down. There were periods of last summer where I literally didn't do anything, I constantly cancelled plans last minute and was sleepy/slept a lot which was terrible, it took up a lot of time, all wasted. I have a hard time doing things without company too, which also absolutely sucks, because most of my friends are pretty independent and not being so seems to be such a negative these days. I don't know what to do I feel like my brain is slowly crumbling. I'm so unsure of my life. I have never been one to succeed well in school, I've always been mediocre or average around a bunch of high achievers and braggers. I just feel like I'm failing and setting up myself for an even more unhappy life. Sometimes I wish I wasn't alive. I haven't told anyone about any of this, I'm more of a, keep feelings to yourself and look put together, ""fake it till you make it,"" type of person (not working obviously). Talking to my parents is hard because we don't sit down and talk and share our feelings, ever. They would also be shocked in a negative way, doubt it would be supportive, sort of like that's not really a thing or feeling that couldn't effect you that badly way. So I'm also nervous about going to our family physician because I wouldn't just be able to hide that. I don't really care to see a therapist. Don't have time, have skepticism about it and I would have to also tell my parents and they would probably have to pay for that. Too much stuff to go out of the way for I won't do. I am open to getting pills though at this point I want it to stop affecting the more important parts of my life involving my interviews and academics. I just can't bring myself to talk to my parents about it and actually go to the doctor to speak about it to diagnose it and get prescribed something. Thanks for reading if you did, I know it was a lot. I just had to get all this out somewhere, because I literally don't talk to anyone about this and it all floats around in my head. 

Thanks again. "

I received some very valuable responses from my previous post and have now made up my mind about switching into the accounting stream at my program. I was hoping to get some insights on a couple more topics, so that I may plan for the future.

After Finishing Undergrad - G.Dip.Pa, Master of Management and Professional Accounting (12 month), or nothing?

It seems my university offers these two programs to graduates of the Bcomm in Accounting. The G.Dip.Pa is a 12 week program (cost ~$10,000) that  covers the first 4 modules of the CPA PEP and allows you to start at capstone 1 upon completion. The MMPA (cost ~$30,000)is a 8 month class + 4 month co op program that says it covers the 5 modules of PEP and allows you to move to capstone 2. In addition, it says it covers the core MBA curriculum, which I would be particularly interested in.

Questions - Do employers place value/recognize these, and will they improve my chances of being hired in my early career (say for Big 4 if I don't land anything out of undergrad), or are they a waste of time and money if I get my CPA?
In particular interested in the MMPA, but I've never heard of it (and it seems like University of Toronto is the only school that offers it). I don't want a degree that's largely unrecognized.

In terms of the G.Dip.Pa, do I save anything compared to doing these courses from the CPA (what does it cost for those 4 courses from CPA)? I know studying full time vs studying while working is a difference, but what else do I gain? 
Do I lose any oppourtunities in terms of costs - ie is it really common for say a big 4 firm to cover the costs of education?
 
In terms of Big 4 jobs:
Would it give me a leg up to do one of the programs above before working, or is it not a popular route? 

Is it true that audit has more stable hours than tax, or is it also the crazy 80 hours during busy season? 
It seems to me from my career goals that working in audit for a few years before leaving for industry would get me where I want to be ($100K by 30, with normal ~40 hours weeks, opportunities for growth). I'd imagine this is the case for a lot of people - does this make audit internships a lot harder to land versus tax?

Thanks for the help!"

The gap is huge.

What I mean by in shape. 

1: low body fat percentage 

2: muscle tone

Just to get the Tyler durden body from fight club takes massive amounts of dedication and highly strict diet. But many men get to that level, most at the gym women barely get to the level where they can squat their own body weight and have some visible abs.

I think fucks up the market place and makes more bitter men than anything else. Most men just want an equal, but for most men this is impossible.

I'd take a guess that for most men finding a women who has an equal level of fitness, education and income is extremely hard. On the other end for women it's most likely extremely easy. This is why most men I know are happy when they find a girl who matches there fitness level and don't give a shit about income or education.

Having spent a year with a friend in Latvia, six months in Japan (where I visited Taiwan and South Korea), a year in South america and a year abroad in Munich this trend is primarily an Anglosphere trend but it looks like it's bleeding out to most western countries. But the reverse is true in Asia and Eastern Europe, As well as Chile and Argentina...the rest of South America is a toss up. Hell Ireland was the worse most women are straight beat.

As for the BMI argument; according to BMI I'm fat. But inreality just standing still I have visible abs and bulking they're visible Ish when I flex, then again I'm deadlifting 315lb for a set of 8...

I'm writing this in my gym right now, a free university gym. It's massive and yet it's 65-70% dudes and the school is 64% women.... 

For men getting the Tyler durden body is 5-7 days on the gym hour to two, a strict almost painful diet.

For women to be fit hot; drop most carbs, stop eating shit (hint if you have a belly you eat shit) and do weighted squats 2x a week and a HIIT/full body day."

64f3ak,3,2017-04-09,[M4F] - Secret Office Antics,PerfectSavage,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/64f3ak/m4f_secret_office_antics/,"The young man hurried out of the sleek elevator and down the hall to his office, hot cup of coffee in his hand while holding onto his briefcase. As he burst into the small office, he was greeted by a surprised squeak from his office mate. She was a young intern still taking college courses but, was eager to get some experience under her belt.

""Morning Rachel"" he said slightly out of breath, even though he was trim and fit. She never said anything about it outloud, but Rachel secretly always tried to sneak glances at his form when he wasn't looking.

""Good morning, Dan"" she chirped cheerfully, quickly smoothing out her pencil skirt before swinging around in her office chair to face the man. He had caught her doing that more and more recently; Always acting flustered and panicked when someone came into the door or when he got up for a break. She was always slightly red in her pale cheeks and very breathy. He shrugged it off for now and settled into his own desk. 

They were forced to sit back to back in their own little room. It wasn't quite cramped, but it was snug. Both of them had large desks with their computers sitting on them and they would always sit and work from nine to five.

""You look nice today"" he said casually, trying to be polite before sitting down in his chair with his back facing the young dark haired woman. His computer hummed to life as he took another sip of hot coffee.

""Thanks"" Rachel said, biting her lip as she smiled, slowly spinning around back to face her screen.

What Dan didn't know about his young office partner was that for the past few days, she had been doing some extra work on the side. Young, innocent looking Rachel had discovered the wide lewd world of camgirls. Girls who would sit in front of a webcam all day and perform depraved sexual acts for the denizens of the internet for money. The sad truth was that most of them made more money than she did in a month. Of course she jumped at the chance. Student loans are no light burden, but she also had to work which meant most of her time spent ""camming"" was right there in the office with a co-worker right behind her, which she used to her advantage. The perverts watching her little show paid good money to see her do naughty things right behind Dan's back. Everyone likes to see a depraved slut almost get caught around every turn.

Today was different though. She was nervous; her flat stomach was fluttering, her face was flushed and hot, and she was already rolling up the sleeves of her blouse and undoing a few buttons. Today was the day she decided to try a new kind of app that the cam sight was sponsoring. This app allowed a high tipper to take control of a vibrator for any number amount of minutes. This vibrator was behind her skirt, under her lacy red panties, and tucked away just on the other side of her smooth shaven pussy lips. The round little pill shaped toy was trapped snug between her pink fleshy folds waiting for the first person to take control.

It was hard not to get noticed, much harder than she had thought. Most of the people who got to control her toy would just blast it up on full power and force the poor office girl to bite down on her lip or cover her mouth to keep from letting her moans escape. Hour after hour she got hotter, more disheveled. Her skirt rode up more, revealing her thigh high stockings. More buttons on her blouse got undone and her raven black hair stuck to the sides of her face. She wasn't going to make it much longer and she knew it, but she was trapped in this office with a man and a webcam hidden under her desk to show off to the thousands watching. They could see her thighs clench and her knees buckle as the teasing little toy slowly drove her more and more insane with lust.

Behind her, Dan was all but clueless. That is, until she let a long shaky moan slip from her lips. For a split second her brain had gone numb and she forgot she was in an office so she just let it out, her eyes rolling in pleasure before popping wide open. She sat up straight, trembling and flushed, hoping Dan hadn't heard. He did though, and he slowly spun around in his chair and looked at the steaming hot brunette.

""Rachel, are you alright"" he asked with genuine concern, thinking she was in some kind of agony which wasn't far from the truth.
""I...I'm fiIIINE"" she squeaked just as someone else took control her little toy.

Her skirt was soaked. Her lace panties were soaked. Hell, even her leather chair was soaked with the juices oozing out of her swollen needy cunt. She couldn't let him know, but this new controller was more devious in that instead of blasting the toy on full power, they were giving her waves of pleasure which tickled her spasming walls at just the right frequency.

She hunched over her desk, gripping it with her fingers until her knuckles were white. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth and her glasses slid down the tip of her nose as she brought her knees together hard. She was going to cum and she couldn't stop herself. She trembled in her chair as her hungry cunt clenched around the vibrating toy again and again. Dan watched with a horrified look on his face as the young girl groaned and drooled on her chest as her breasts heaved and jiggled with her labored breathing.

""Rachel"" he asked, reaching out his hand to touch her small quivering shoulder. She didn't move away from his touch, but in her post-orgasmic bliss she let out a shaky breath and leaned into his touch, letting him get a view down her sweaty cleavage, her skirt bunched around her thighs, and the puddle of sticky pussy juices just now starting to drip off her leather chair onto the floor.

His mouth went dry and his breath deepened as he started to slowly massage the young lust drunk girl's arm and shoulder, his large gentle hand rubbing the thin fabric of her blouse over her damp smooth skin underneath. The still quivering girl had no mind to resist his comforting touch. She folded herself against his hand, relaxing in his palms as his other hand slid along her opposite arm. She was so ready to give herself over to anyone just for the tingling pleasure running up and down her spine the feel of a strong firm hand gave her. But the viewers had no mercy; another tipper assumed control and soon that little vibe was twitching away violently inside her happy slick hole. She gasped and pushed herself into Dan's hands, urging him to keep touching her.

Maybe today at the office would be more exciting than usual?"

I am an incoming specialty surgical intern looking for the same or similar to split an apartment. More generally, I'd like to live with someone who has a similar lifestyle of working a lot, as I'll be working a lot during the week and on the weekends, not necessarily medical. I'm used to living with guys around my age, so I'm hoping to find the same in Chicago. 

Outside of work I am very social and enjoy going out, I'd love to live with someone who enjoys grabbing a beer or having people over when we're both free. In terms of an apartment I would like to have somewhere nice to come home to, despite currently being an indebted medical student. For an easy commute to the medical district I'm looking at places in Wicker Park/Bucktown, West Loop, River North and River West. I'm looking to live in a modern apartment complex, garage parking is a must for me and a nice gym is a huge plus. I'm currently looking at places with 2 and 3 bedrooms (with a third being a shared office) that cost between $2800 and $3200 a month. All in expenses for me are around $1700 including utilities. 

Let me know if you're in a similar sitiuation and think we'd be a good fit, I'll be taking a trip to Chicago in the coming weeks to take a closer look at apartments. 

Thanks!"

I'm a grad student at UAH getting sent out of state for a research project for June and July and I'm looking for someone who will be in town this summer (perhaps someone with an internship or a student between leases or something) and would like a furnished room in my house in exchange for watching [my cat](http://i.imgur.com/0t0JGSj.jpg). He's very friendly, super low maintenance, indoor/outdoor with a pet door, no litterbox, and is either outside or sleeping most of the time. Just needs some food and petting a couple times a day. If you ever need to take a weekend or a few days away from the house during your time here he's fine alone for 2 or 3 nights, so you're not trapped here caring for the cat. He's more of a roommate that you need to give food to sometimes.

The house is in the medical district near Huntsville High/Whole foods, has 2 furnished bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (so you can stay for some of May/August when I'll still be around if needed), a nice backyard/porch, quiet neighbors, good AC, nice kitchen and fast internet. I'm the owner of the house, so we don't need to get in to any weird sublease kind of situation.

If you or anyone you know is interested in this, or if you have any questions, please send me a message ASAP!

EDIT 7:50PM 4/9: Have someone pending for this."

I'll be going back home to live with Ndad. It's *my* house technically (I inherited it when Nmom died), but it doesn't feel like it. If I try and move out I'll end up in the middle of conversations I don't want to be in. I also can't be sure I'll get the treatment I need, either, for some stuff. Because of money and my health mattering less than Ndad having money for cigarettes and lotto tickets.

And even if I do get a job, there's no guarantee that he won't try and get into my bank accounts. He's on them right now so he can deposit money while I'm at college, but I'm scared that the abuse is going to get worse when I go back. He kept pushing me more and more to be like Nmom after her death and take on her responsibilities, which led to me having a nervous breakdown. I also don't think he'll really let me have my doctors' appointments without complaining to me about the cost of them. (There have been times where I've offered to pay and he said no but then made me feel super guilty about it? Money stuff has always been super fucked up for me and I'm happy to go into more detail if that's something that would be helpful.)

Idk. I feel really slimy about going back. Any suggestions on how to better grey rock/deal with life? I feel like a petulant child because I can't just be grateful that he pays the bills and I don't have to work right away when I graduate (even though I'm working 3 jobs now).

Update: a friend offered to let me stay in her apartment at least some of the time over summer break. She's got an internship in a major city in our state, so she won't be using her apartment. I can lie and say she wants me to apartment-sit every so often (or at random intervals) so it looks like someone is still living there. That gets me out of the house and buys me a little time to plan and figure out what I'm going to do. I also asked a friend if she could teach me to drive over the summer, or if her mom could (since her teaching me is *technically* illegal since she's not my spouse and not over a stupid, arbitrary age). So that's a little bit of progress towards independence, even if I'm still largely stuck."

Of course, the anti-establishment types (hipsters in the last millennium) always did like the old ways of doing things. Something about 'making it like they used to.' It seems silly in today's world of neural webs, partial reality experiences, and memory infusions. Still, people seemed to enjoy perusing how things used to work between the limited genders of the past. At least enough to draw an audience to the Historical Society's night of *Participative Past Passions*.

And so it was that Grant#Coolidge.732 found himself pulling on a pair of ancient holo-goggles and loading the first memory crystal. It was going to be a long week of cataloging to prepare the handful of scenes and then find suitable memory mimes to rehearse and log every touch and sensation for public consumption.

I hope some of you can help me out with a problem I have been having. My entire life, I have struggled with performance anxiety. Sports, public speaking, and simple social interaction have always been very difficult for me. Last semester I decided to see a therapist and try to resolve some of this anxiety. Incredibly, I've had overwhelming success. I have joined a fraternity, gotten a high paying internship for this summer after a really successful interview l, and have now found myself a beautiful girlfriend that I have lost my virginity to. 


We have had sex at least a dozen times in the 3 weeks since we've been together. And each and everytime I have no issue developing, and maintaining a rock hard errection and giving her pleasure as well. But every single time I am unable to cum. We've tried numerous positions that result in nothing but her eventually getting too sore and me left with nothing but pre cum in the condom. We've tried her blowing me, jerking me off, and even desperately this morning I tried jerking off onto her after 1.5 hours of sex which resulted in me still not being able to orgasm. I opened up about this with her today saying that it wasn't her fault, and told her about the anxiety problems I have (I cannot pee no matter how badly I have to if someone is in the room) which I even told her about. I normally have no problem cuming on my own, which I do not do often. I also cut porn out of my life completely 6 months ago. Long before I met my girlfriend. 


Can anyone suggest any tips for me to get over my inability to orgasm around my girlfriend? "

2.  I don't like to drive and tend to take public transit when possible.  How good is the public transit system in both Newport News and the greater area?

3.  Similarly I was looking for an apartment with the knowledge that I intend to take the bus to work.  I looked at apartments near Christopher Newport and there seemed to be some solid options.  Does anyone have recommendations or apartments I should avoid?  

4.  Anything else I should know about the area that I wouldn't get from, or my have missed during, my brief visits?

Also, sorry for how long this is. I needed to get more out than I thought I did)

Everyone knows that life isn't fair. You can't always get what you want. But I had hoped that I would be able to, even just for a few months. 

Like a lot people here, I've suffered from depression and anxiety. My first suicide attempt was when I was around 10 years old and tried to hang myself. My last time was when I was 20 and tried to overdose on vodka and my anti-depressants. 

By this time I had just started my third year of university the week before, and I was living with my ex boyfriend who I had recently broken up with. After 10 years of constant struggling that seemed to go nowhere, I couldn't cope anymore. Like most people that try to commit suicide I didn't want to die, I just wanted some relief from the constant nothingness I felt. Luckily I told a friend what I was doing as way of my ""note"", and he was able to contact student services who took me to hospital. 

The next few months were a slog, but I found that I had a great support network of friends. I was still unable to keep up with university though, and had to stop my course the following semester. I began to feel the four tiny walls of my bedroom close in on me in the weeks following, so I decided to pack up everything I owned, leave my flat, and moved abroad on a whim to break the cycle. 

The time I spent abroad was difficult, but exactly what I needed. I was able to return to repeat the year I had stopped with a new, friendlier, year group, and begin to move on with my life. I worked hard, joined societies, and forced myself to make friends. 

The following summer I got an internship where I excelled, and my confidence grew even more. I exceeded everyone's expectations, especially my own, and was told I could have a job there after I finished my final year of university if I wanted. I also met my partner while working there, and we quickly formed an extremely strong and loving relationship, the opposite to any I had had before. 

Once I returned to finish my final year I was doing better than ever with my new found confidence. I received my first A since my first year, and lecturers commented on how far I had gone and how this was my year. 

Things seemed too good to be true. And they were. 

I got the flu on Halloween, and had to take some time off from university to recover. Only a week or so, so I didn't think I'd fall behind too much if I worked extra hard once I was better. Then I had my first blackout. 

I ""woke up"" standing in my bathroom with no memory of how I got there - and it took me a moment to recognise where I was. I put it down to tiredness and got back to bed. 

Then they kept happening - and the memory loss became more severe. I would forget my own name, the month, the year, I wouldn't recognised my partner and would freak when he would try to comfort me. I was constantly confused and lethargic, it felt like I was living in treacle. 

The gp sent me to hospital and in the first couple of weeks I had all sorts of tests that all came back negative. Eventually I was told that I had to wait to see a neurologist. 

As I waited I got worse, I was also having trouble breathing and I would often forget to eat and drink. I could no longer attend university and had to drop out, again. I wasn't trusted to live on my own so I had to leave my city and friends to stay with my partner. I felt like a burden, but had no other choice. 

After four months I saw the neurologist. He didn't seem concerned, and referred me for more tests. When I asked when roughly I would get them, I was told weeks not days.

I didn't mind waiting. Although what I was going through was annoying and I had a poor quality of life, I wasn't in danger and was almost starting to feel better.

After a month of waiting, I was falling asleep one night when I started to jerk uncontrollably. When I tried to speak, all I could make were noises, the starts of words. They didn't stop. Each ""episode"" of spasms would last from around 5-20 minutes, with breaks of varying length in between. After half an hour of ""seizures"" (I was later told they're not seizures for various reasons) we phoned for medical advice and half an hour after that an ambulance was phoned for. An hour later a first responder arrived. Three hours after the initial episode I arrived in A&amp;E. I had more blood tests, and was given medication to help stop the jerks. Six hours after the initial episode, when the tests came back normal and the medication didn't help, I was sent home and told I would tire myself out eventually. One hour later, seven hours after the initial episode, I did pass out from exhaustion safe in bed and in my partners arms. 

To try and cut this rambling story short, the episodes continued the next two days. My partner and I decided I would stay with my parents who happened to be off work for the following week since I now needed 24/7 care, and we would decide what to do after the week was up. They live several hours away from both of us. 

I accompanied my dad to an routine appointment at their local hospital, and while waiting for him I had another ""episode"". The nurses saw, grabbed my dad, and wheeled me through to their A&amp;E department. I've not left the hospital since then and am waiting to see the neurologist here tomorrow (which is why I'm awake writing this at 3am because I'm so wound up about what's going to happen).

Although this may seem like a rant about health and the way I've been treated by doctors etc, it's not. I have a powerful amount of respect for my countries health services and everyone who works for them. 

This is a rant about how this was supposed to be my year. I worked my arse off to get into the position I was in before I took ill this time. I fought depression and won. I fought the against the stigma of attempting suicide and won. I fought against the stigma of repeating a year of university and won. I fought against the stigma of being a female in a male dominated field and you bet your ass I won that and the respect of my colleagues. 

My life was finally coming together. I had a plan, my dream job, and a life within my grasp after so long. And it's been taken away from me. I've done my time, I've been through my hardship, I've fought through the pain. Why did it have to happen again, and why did it have to happen at that point in my life? For the sake of the last 6 months my life is now put back at least another year. 




If you actually read all of this, thank you for listening. I realise it's whiney, and selfish, and oh-poor-me, and there's no real answer to any of it. But I needed to say it all the same."

Things that are important to me:

- Good battery life (I hear the Priv has up to 22.5h? Can anyone verify)

- Good storage (I take a ton of photos...)

- Decent front-facing camera 

- Runs Android (I'm not sure how different the BBxAndroid thing is, and if it gets all the updates or not)

- Reasonably priced (I'll be using for about 8mths? Also I'm a broke university student)

I'm looking for something to use probably for around 8 months tbh, since when I return to my company from school I'll be getting a different work phone and probably going to be using that one exclusively. If it's relevant, I'm from Ontario/ Canada so I'd appreciate any carrier recommendations too!

So, I had to look for some lesser known alternatives and I found SJSU. The location in Silicon Valley seems wonderful but at the same time, its prestige and classes seem questionable. I've been doing a lot of research on SJSU and it seems like a mediocre school in a fantastic place. What I'm worried about is the impacted courses and the fact it's considered a commuter school. I want to graduate in four years and I will most likely be staying on campus (worried about social life here basically). But the internships at these tech giants seem so sweet. I'm really considering computer science or software engineering here, but I'm also wondering if I went to Cal Poly SLO or another 'better' school, I can still have the same opportunities with a slightly more prestigious education.

I have other offers that are still on the table, but I have already accepted this one. I really want to work for this company, but the pay difference in 3 months is nearly 2,000. Any advice?"
64hko1,3,2017-04-10,"Help choosing which masters program to attend (UCSB, Davis, Carnegie Mellon)",MachoEggroll,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/64hko1/help_choosing_which_masters_program_to_attend/,"I am going to be attending graduate school next year for a masters in statistics, and these are the programs I have been accepted to so far. I was rejected from Cornell, and am still awaiting a response from UCLA for a Masters in Applied Statistics and MS in Statistics in Columbia.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are the pros + cons of each school for me.

Carnegie Mellon Masters in Statistical Practice. It isn't a traditional MS degree, so I don't know if that closes any options for me. It seems highly applied which I like, and is only one year long. And most importantly the name of the school seems to go far. But it will be 45K in tuition and I will have to move to Pennsylvania. (I am from California.) Industry placement seems great though but I am sure it will be very competitive.

&amp;nbsp;

UCSB MA in Statistics. This is my undergraduate institution. I am familiar with the campus the area and everything. I love the school. My friends, frat, social circle, professors, family are all within reach to me. I will also be offered a TA position, most likely. I hear the program is highly applied, but the rank of the school isnt the highest. Also people suggest not to go to the same school for graduate school as they did for undergrad so i don't know how that goes.

&amp;nbsp;

UC Davis. Pretty high ranked and it will take 1 to 1.5 years to finish. seems like a strong program and I will still finish before two years and may still have a summer to look for internship. Also in California so tuition is same as for UCSB (About 15K a year)

&amp;nbsp;


All these schools seem to have great advantages. Anybody have an idea of what they think is best?


EDIT: Received acceptance to UCLA MAS too. I can finish it in two years while working part time. And stay in California. WHAT DO I DO THIS IS SO HARD."

* [[Day 167.1 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 1 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVcn6R47pSs)
  * Want to Delve into the Business partners of the Awans, looking for more linkages to Tahir Javed
  * Want to send this out to @raymcgovern Ray McGovern, he's been involved in DC for 50 yrs; CIA expertise... @RT_com @RTUKNews
  * Were the Awans hacking--through a liaison relationship--for Andrew McCabe at the FBI?   Were they doing hacks and wiretaps FOR Hillary Clinton?
  * The key thing is the Awans had Nanoset Technologies-- the Capitol Police say they are stealing stuff from the House of Reps offices and then selling them back to US Government as Nanoset Technology...
  * Andrew McCabe is not involved in this.  You would think this is a matter for the FBI. This is an international espionage case
  * There is a fifth Awan, Mohammed Ali Awan, an intern. {{ SOURCE }}
  * Stepmom recap
  * SSP Syed Pir Mohammed Shah PSP
  * In Springfield CT now, was in Springfield MA yesterday to visit the Imran Rice Mills
  * They aren't there anymore. They've moved back to PK.  But it *is* a convenience store.  Don't know if it's a Javed convenience store.
  * It's one of these places you can get a mailbox, and you can get money orderes in and wire money easily.  Across the street there's a public library where you can get on a public computer, down the street there's a processing center for people on parole, a daycare for latchkey kids next to that.
  * I think Springfield MA is kind of a recruiting hub, I don't know if they are bringing in adderall to go to all the Ivy Leagues, but it does seem to be a hub for drug activity in Springfield MA.  I think you're going to find Springfield CT is the same way but I'll defer that to a later episode
  * Nanoset Tech sold MRI technology to Biophan, which is Michael Weiner in NY, who is a trade rep for hedge funds
  * [There seems to be a focus on] MRI and Cancer.  This technology they sold is for MRI for people who had valves in their heart that wouldn't let them do normal MRI
  * Interesting combination that the Awan brothers would make four Rice orders 16 months apart, at the same time they were making those cutout companies 16 mo apart, planning to fail them for those companies to be shut down every 16mo
  * Narcoterrorism  and so forth, the CIA's favorite tactic is to use the drug profits from a drug sale to then fund their agents for a certain length of time  tour of duty could be 16 month
  * Suraiya Begum recap
  * Operation in Afghanistan is also called ""New Dawn""^^[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War#2010:_U.S._drawdown_and_Operation_New_Dawn)
  * Abdul Hasnat recap
  * Who is Dr. Suraiya Begum?  First question to ask anybody about Bangladesh is do you know [Muhammad Yunus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus)? Some people call him Muhammad kidney, or Muhammed microloan or Muhammed sewing machine for the sewing machines he would endebt people with, to force them into slave labor, and eventually force them into giving up their organs.  So.  I don't know the [answer to that]  But I do know she was involved with these Bangladesh *export zones*, enterprise zones to create new businesses for Bangladesh.  I don't know if that's her mother, which would be understandable, as she is the minister of cultural affairs, or if that's the daughter.  They might not even be related. Who knows.
  * She is also on the board of Biman Airlines which is the national airlines of Bangladesh
  * The MD also writes extensively about hydrological disasters--floods--monitors it using space technology; another article she wrote on monitoring tornadoes with space technology
  * {{ WorkingTheory Tangent: google reddit BP oil spill RRR }}
  * Muhammad Shah -- Blue Sky Iridium Phones recap
  * Abdul Hasnat and Muhammed Shah overlap in terms of activity in Sugarland, Texas
  * Mohamed Shah running that Dyncorp police force also felt it necessary to get involved in Innovative Medical Physics LLC, Las Vegas, Nevada LLC, which is training folks from PK to the US to work on MRI; cancer and MRI
  * I looked for National Science Foundation Grants for medical physics and found that Weinberg Medical Physics was the recipient
  * I would like to know if Suraiya Begum MD being at the Hawkshead Drive location in Lorton VA  {{ with the Awans }}, you would see visitors coming and going--has she ever met Mohammad Hunzla who is an expert in global information grid who worked at Lightbridge Communication, the same Lightbridge Communications where Imran Awan worked at?
  * Do they know where DISA is in springfield VA, have they ever been there
  * For a doctor of gynecology to be involved in this kind of {{ geospatial / intelligence }} imaging is surprising to me
  * Adeel Rice Mills - Border of Punjab/India Kashmir, LET; TEVTA state support
  * This is a state supported rice company from those export regions.
  * They are receiving government funds for this.  So what is the relationship between them shipping rice to that Springfield location that seems to be a bunch of PO boxes.  Strange set of circumstances
  * Suriaya Begum is an expert in the modern space satellite imagery--does she have any knowledge of these cubesats, the nanosatellites? Her company is called ""nanoset"", does she know anything about ""nanosats""; is she familiar with PALANTIR at all?
  * Has Begum met any of the 31 different democrats--the employers of her roomates/biz partners?  Is she aware of any of burglaries and that they were under probe for theft of equipment fromthe house of reps?  Does she know Tahir Javed?  Has she ever talked to him about any of his business dealings?
  * If McCabe released this info we wouldn't have to pry it {{ from everyone involved }}

  * People have asked to make a Colombo edition after part 1, just wanna ask you one more thing
  * Everyone says, 'if New Dawn corporation called 2001, why is it not incorporated in 2011'?
  * If you are right George and you've been saying that HIllary hads been importing rice with Tahir Javed since 1999, you should have that corporation started in 2001
  * I will point you to Nanoset Technologies starting in 2001, and I'll also point you to the fact that HRC had a very strong relationship with NATO since 2001 being a Senator on the Senate Arms Foreign Relations Committee along with McCain and Graham in determining what NATO does with it's planes and satellites.
  * The four rice orders: interesting path if you drill down into the orders.  They come from PK but instead of going directly through a US Port, they go through Belgium, then from Belgium to Maryland; interestingly enough they clear customs in EU; and it's going to turn out to be a NATO customs.  They don't even clear regular customs.  You would need a friend in NATO who had both control of air and satellite: satellite to manage your ratline and air to transport [along] your ratline.
  * Let's look at NATO.  Remember General Bouchard, the guy who led the air invasion of Libya 2011?  Current CEO of Lockheed?  Good friend of Comeys? Funnelled R&amp;D to Subcontractors for Lockheed for the F35.  Remember Valerie Plame, remember Chendalon--died recently--treasurer of expenditures near Belgium, near SHAPE which is the EU HQ for NATO command center?
  * Remember Gladio B? and what I say is C now which Gulen running in the US.  Gulen is Gladio B.  Gulen ran Gladio B and now he's running C.
  * **And Chandelon knew about both**
  * It's going to be Gen Bouchard that gave HRC access to the NATO satellites and the C130s in the NATO force.
  * You're going to find him also stopping near Bosnia, NATO bases along the way coming back from NATO missions
  * Here is Gen Bouchard at a high tech conference.  The same high tech conference that Dir. Comey was involved with: Bridgewater, several years after *he* was CEO of Lockheed.  It's all going to come back together.
  * Carl Bildt doing the famous Albanian email toppling different governments in Europe for NATO

  * On Hill House avenue at Yale
  * Hill House is the head of Jackson school of Global Affairs
  * Professors hold seminars in Global affairs
  * Eric Braverman is probably asked to do a seminar on {{ stupid world projects that won't get done but will extort money from well intentioned people }}
  * George going to cafes to find out more info on Braverman

* [[Day 167.4 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 4 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mssW2ABUZT8) **The 322 EDITION**
  * With the sound of bells in the background, George approaches the Tomb of Yale
  * The Center of the History of the CIA, begins here, the tomb the famous Skull and Bones {{ 322 }}
  * {{ Yaaarr so begins the Pirate Party }}
  * Does it begin here?  Yale may have been named after an agent of the British East Indian Trading Company
  * I think most of the money that paid for Yale came from the opium trade.  I believe the opium trade was...
  * George Bush used to say they'd buy a tea chest in Bangladesh or E. India for 2 dollars a tea chest and sell it for 10 in China.  It's amazing how much money you can make on 8% markup {{ he misspoke, meant 8 dollars markup or 500% }}.
  * {{ I think George is saying they take Indian Opium and put it in the tea chest because China never needed India's inferior assam tea when it had its own jin xuan winter sprout wulong (lastfrost milk oolong, the best there is) }}
  * That's number 43 that said that ?
  * I don't know if Harvard started out Unitarian.  John Wintrop sitting on a hill, America is a rebirth: another chance for Europe
  * And maybe Yale was a stopgap;
  * Maybe Yale was to try to put a hierarchical stop to that by giving away half of Massachussets to make CT and make Yale.
  * Maybe it was a move by the crown to end the expansion of this new America, this enlightenment, these coffee shops, Francis Bacon and the Scientific Method and remind everyone that they were still under the thumb of the crown perhaps?  Who knows?
  * In part four you get my philosophical waxings, on 1,2,3 it's typically more reporting
  * Look at Western Reserve which became Case Western Reserve which became Case Western for surgeries, for organ donations.  That was started...it came from Yale
  * So...{{{ Tomb view fade to black }}

  * [At the Wellwood cemetary in Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellwood_Cemetery) you may know the cemetary from it's fame: of the people who are buried here.
  {{ Famous Jewish people buried there. }}
    * [Julius and Ethel Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg) were buried here
  *  Some of the Jews in the audience remember the famous scene with George Seagal in the graveyard explaining to the people who died in the holocaust what had happened since the holocaust.  He was trying to summarize in a movie called **""Bye Bye Braverman""** what had happened between the Holocaust and the Moon landing^^[[]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIqZAEYN1gs).  Trying to somehow relate back to that generation
  * The Rosenbergs if you're not familiar with that story were both executed, electrocuted at Sing Sing for giving a small part of the secrets of the atomic bomb to the Russians, through a secret agent, a double agent.
  * {{ Shut up assplane!}}
  * They served their sentence {{ executed }} in terms of capitol punishment for giving secrets of the US to our enemies.
  * ***The same types of treasons are being carried out with the Awan brothers.***
  * We have five, now 6 Awan brothers and the 2 wives.  We have this profusion of evidence.
  * ***I'm not here to celebrate or to say that the Rosenbergs didn't receive just punishment, but what I AM here to say is the people who are doing those same crimes today that have our most sensitive hacking tools from the CIA that are hacking into cellphone systems--we just found out from Wikileaks {{about}} PK mobile networks that are hacking into our US VA networks, that are hacking into individual private hospital systems like Spectrum Health, other government installations.  Those are every bit as much an offense and a treason on the US as the Rosenbergs that are buried here.  Thank you***

* [[Day 168.2 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 2 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5zvyJ6HSpM)
  * Long Island Sound near Jones Beach
  * I talked in previous episodes about the [Long Island Serial Killar (LISK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer) and visited some of the sites where they found the bodies.
  * [Websleuths](http://www.websleuths.com/forums/forum.php)
  * Shannon Gilbert, she has a driver take her to a John's house {{prostitute}}, at midnight from nyc, running from house to house at 5am, makes all these 911 calls, 23 minutes long; but for some reason they can't geolocate her.  They start looking for her body, and they find 5-6 bodies in burlap sacks
  * I've long contended that the folks involved were in the rice business, and those were Basmati burlap sacks.
  * There's a large middle eastern population here, and I do believe those people were involved in the murders and that the sacks were basmati rice sacks
  * For some reason the Suffolk County Police Dept did not want to talk about where those burlap sacks were from.  All the bodies were found in those sacks--that's the common linking element
  * If somebody worked at a Basmati rice factory--and I won't say exactly which one I believe it is--I'll just say I believe the port-of-entry was Montreal; why wouldn't they release that fact?  Why wouldn't they release the picture of the basmati rice sack used in a crime? Why withhold that information?
  * That actually is the smoking gun where the LISK works, and we're talking about at least 10 ppl--young women murdered, that were in the escort business for the most part, but I believe some were just at parties with drugs, very upscale great gadsby type parties, but some were doing individual calls like Shannon Gilbert was.
  * But the Suffolk police dept was involved and acting as a pimp for national political figures, and that members of federal law enforcement were using the Suffolk county Police Dept as a sort of pimping service.
  * A lot has come out from the Shannon Gilbert case.  I believe the mother was murdered.  A lot of odd situations regarding the case
  * There are a lot of questions about how the police has proceeded and there is stonewalling in this case.
  * Records of the FBI need to be released in this case, and it seems to be yet-another-one-of-those-cases where things were shut down from the top and need to be explained.

* [[Day 168.3 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 3 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdBMKAFLc8)  **The Hell is Other People Edition**
  * Why is George so obsessed with Basmati Rice?
  * Well the Ratline goes like this: it comes in to the port of Montreal,
  * **The Hells Angels at Trois Riviere manage that whole thing an Abandoned Army Base with the name of** ***HOCHELAGA***
  * it's coming in on UN containers, maybe Humanitarian aid containers
  * Hells angels troix riviere runs the ratline across Canada
  * I believe the Quebec killings were done byt eh Canadian Hells Angels at the Mosque in January of this year.  I think the kid was just a patsy
  * I've worked on this a long time actually
  * I knew people that were on the other side of the ratline on the Hell's Angels side of the Ratline in NYC
  * If you see the movie ""Coyote Ugly"" it's about these kids moving to NY to follow their dreams and they see this bar ""coyote ugly""--that is actually the base of Hells Angels in NY.  The only part they left out of the movie was that that was the Hells Angels' base of operations.
  * That is kind of like the enforcer level. There are other groups that work with the FBI that are volunteers that help to do surveillance, that have no idea of this underworld that the Hells Angels get involved in.
  * But the riceline goes down to NYC, port of New York and also over land routes through Canada
  * The connection to LISK case, is those women are provided/targetted at the Coyote Ugly bar.  There's a limo service (when I looked at it back in 2003) before the bodies were discovered at Gilgo bay.  There was some kind of Turkish limo service--the girls were promised modeling opportunities, fashion week, etc.  There were these massive parties where they'd rent out these huge mansions for a week. They would totally destroy the place.  The first couple of days my roommate was a server at many of these things.  Jeffery Epstein were some of them.  Massive parities, high end, high scale first two days. Then the next few days would be the gladio units, these people who are kind of involved in--they think they're doing the right thing, they're working for the FBI, surveillance specialist I and II, and there are these women there from NY that are drugged and basically being gang-raped, and at the last 3 days--these are rumors now and I'm on working theory at this point--that's what the ritual, the 'being accepted into the gang' where women are tortured.  For days, not just a few hours, but for days.
  * When you get the {{ duct }} tape over the mouth they would hyperventilate with just being able to breathe through their nose, they'd drill a hole through their hyoid {{ under the jaw }}.
  * Shannon Gilbert I believe had a hole drilled through her [hyoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone); It's not a good way to die.
  * She was being gang raped and tried to get away.
  * The police doctor was named Hacket {{ of course }} He was the one drilling the holes in the hyoids.  He's one of the people involved.
  * James Burke being the Police Chief is one of the people involved.  But this is way more than that.  This was women being provided for parties for oil executives coming into the city of NY, at the CFR, they were the CCC contractors, the Petrofacs of the world.  I do believe that Wabi Raman who is the SOHR, his father was at many of these gangrape parties and I also believe Rahman was also part of it.  I dont' know about the Petrofac CEO.
  * It's like that Eyes Wide Shut thing and you can't believe it's true, and there's just no human who would think that kind of cruelty is possible.  But again if you plant a revenge motive in someone and say somehow this person was connected to a bad family or they did something wrong.  It doesn't have to be true--humans will act on a revenge motive.
  * I've had about 10 Hells Angels buzz me on the way here and about 10 of McCabe's well-meaning bike club guys buzz me and miss me by 1 foot so I thought, well I better get this out and not sit on this any longer.

  * PA, at the Delaware River looking at the USS New Jersey, it saw a little action in WW2
  * These are the ships that take the rice
  * The Scrapings of the opium poppy is the purest opium
  * But I believe in the 1920s they were able to refine morphine from the stalk and bulb of the poppy {{ [poppy straw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_straw) }} I believe those cuttings are what are being transported in the rice basmati bags
  * I believe the New Dawn 2001 corporation that the Awans created was all about the mango express. About getting that lucrative business that India had a lock on with hillary, the Indian mangos, the Mexico mangos that Mexico had a deal on with Carlos Slim.  Very high profit 18 dollar box of mangos being worth $28,000.  If you can build a network of stores like McDonalds or Starbucks on five dollar meals or coffees, imagine what you can do on a 28k dollar box of 6 mangos.
  * I believe that was the New Dawn, the Mango mission, the mango diplomacy--that's what changed everything
  * People ask, well why are you talking about the rice then?  About rice coming into these major ports?
  * Their job before they got that mango express, the Awans' job was managing the ratlines; managing the logistics; the minute-to-minute logistics with those Iridium phones and transponders.
  * The real big change with the Awans is when they moved to this direct flight from both Pakistan and Bangladesh, direct to major US airports, but primarily Chicago Ohare
  * That's it for today, tomorrow WASHINGTON DC

Need some help from fellow CE/CS Aztecs.,SuperKirby64,SDSU,https://www.reddit.com/r/SDSU/comments/64hy5t/prospective_computer_engineering_student_here/,"1) Judging from what people on this subreddit are saying, if you make good with what the teachers give you, you'll do pretty good, and this school is pretty good for computer science and computer engineering. My question is: Are the professors for the most part pretty helpful? Most importantly, is there any professors that I need to AVOID?

2) Would it be worth it to try and double major with Computer Science and Computer Engineering together? How much of a social life would I be losing if I did this (haha)? Also, how much time would it take to do both?

3) In terms of financial status, I'm not really in a good spot. Which is more lenient to pay for, for this school? Rent in general, or tuition? If I were given a limited amount of fin. aid, which part of the total cost of attendance should I tackle ASAP?

4) I'm about like 8-10 hours away from the actual campus itself, (in boring old Central Cali, haha) how big is the campus size? Is walking between classes and apartments fairly easy? Also, would riding stuff be recommended or nah?

5) Any fun places nearby to hang out if there's not much to do? Especially any social events?

6) What are some good internships to get involved with in between  class time and free time?

7) Since I'm a first-year, I'm ""required"" to live on campus. My final question is, ARE you required? Is there any way that I can avoid this because of my financial status? How much of a difference would be made if I switched to an apartment for a year?

Thanks again!"
64i5vi,4,2017-04-10,I want to transfer to Audit from Tax for my summer internship,manhattanbootlegger,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/64i5vi/i_want_to_transfer_to_audit_from_tax_for_my/,"Hello everyone-

I'm reaching out to ask for some advice regarding my situation. I did my tax internship last summer at an international public accounting firm (GT, BDO, RSM) and I accepted an tax internship offer from a BIG4 for this coming summer.

I liked the tax internship but more I think about what I want to do for the next 5+ years, I just can't see myself doing tax whereas I can learn transferrable skills in Audit.

I heard it is better to tell a recruiter as early as possible if I want to change my mind but I'm not sure if it's right to ask the recruiter even before starting my internship. 

Knowing that I won't be likely to accept the full-time offer if it's in tax I really think I should let them know I want to transfer to Audit but I just don't know when to ask them...

Any advice would be appreciated. Please help out this poor kid..


Thanks everyone!

64j61m,1,2017-04-10,M4A/GM - Trap me in my cheating wife's head,dangerboner,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/64j61m/m4agm_trap_me_in_my_cheating_wifes_head/,"My name is Paul, I'm 31 and I married my childhood sweetheart, Chloe when we were both too young. Now we live together, have boring jobs, and, well... she's changed. She's no-longer that innocent, sweet little thing I married. In fact, she now goes to work [looking like this](http://imgur.com/a/SUbBi) every day. Call me slow on the uptake, but I just started to suspect she might be cheating on me. I pretty much know it, I just don't trust her anymore, but I have no proof!

That's why I came to visit you. People say you're a dodgy, conniving hypnotist, that you pretty much deal in black magic and that you're not to be trusted, but paranoia got the better of me and now I'm here, asking for your help. I need to know the truth for sure, I need that proof!

I lay back on your couch, as instructed, close my eyes and inhale as I follow your instructions. When I open my eyes, I'm not in the same place. I'm not even in the same body anymore. I'm a passenger, trapped in Chloe's mind!

I see her naked body in the mirror as the shower runs behind us. I hear her thoughts, I know what she's thinking. The sensation of being in a body I'm not controlling makes me uncomfortable, along with the unfamiliar feeling of breasts as she touches them, of there being nothing hanging between my legs, and being a few inches shorter.

The warmth of the water on her back feels soothing, and the feeling of her fingers massaging her thick long hair start to relax me/her/us. That's when I hear her private monologue and thoughts. Naughty thoughts. Thoughts about that guy in the office she flirts with. Thoughts about that hot new intern kid, ""but no - he's too young - someone might find out, he might brag?"".

The bubbles landing on her crotch give a tingling sensation I've never felt before, which intensifies once her fingers gently start to rub her clit. Cold glass of the shower wall on her bare ass cheeks, I feel her pinching at her own nipple. She closes her eyes and I see mental images, of a muscled, shirtless male torso unbuttoning his jean fly, letting them fall and revealing a frighteningly long, thick, hard shaft.

Her breathing gets heavier and I'm feeling her getting this urge, totally foreign to me, for some reason she really needs something in...

And then she does it. Two fingers slide into her pussy causing me to moan aloud and wake back on your couch.

Chuckling to yourself, you prepare to send me back. ""Thought that was tough, hmmm? We're only just getting started here...""

My eyes close again. Where will you send me next?

***

I'm hoping you can take the role of the hypnotist, and perhaps other characters that you introduce by sending me off to relive Chloe's naughtiest experiences through her body and mind. You're effective a GM, setting up the scene and the behaviour of other characters.

I'll be playing as her, or rather as myself living through her, like the above! You could land me in the middle of another one of her solitary fantasies, or perhaps the intense, sexual build up, where she's being seduced, or doing the seducing. Or just as her bra hits the ground?

I don't like extreme stuff, like scat, piss, vomit, excessive violence, but I'm otherwise pretty flexible."

Second semester freshman year, I starting dating my first girlfriend (first kiss/first love). We dated for 2.5 years and over the summer, I ended the relationship. We are seniors(4th year) in the same major in University and have pretty much taken the same classes so we were always together and now I still see her everyday in my classes. Ever summer, we would be doing internships half way across the country from each other and the relationship wasn't enjoyable long distance, so last summer I ended it, knowing that the chances of her getting a full time offer near me are very slim and I thought that it was better to end it now than later so I can move on faster.

A couple months after we came back to campus, everything on campus reminded me of her and the feelings came back again. However, a month after I broke up with my ex, I started talking to a girl in the state that I was interning in (California). By the time I realized that I still had feelings for my ex, I was already talking to the the girl in California (l who lives a 6 hr drive/1 hr flight from where I got my full time offer). So I didn't go back to my ex because I didn't think my ex would be closer to me (distance-wise) than the new girl and I didn't want to break the new girls heart after talking to her for 4 months... as I genuinely liked her. My ex ended up moving on and the breakup still stayed on my mind, but I was talking to the girl in Cali every night so it made it bearable. Then my ex told me she got a job in Cali that she was taking which was slightly further away from the new girls place (7 hr drive) so I didn't budge.

Two weeks ago, the girl in Cali who I've been talking to for 7 months called it off very randomly with me citing reasons I cant control (her work stress was too much and she thought that being 2 years older than me wasn't going to work). A week later (last week), my ex who I still have feelings for told me that she is now dating my roommate and best friend from Freshman &amp; Sophomore year; she got to know him well because she pretty much lived with us during that time because she was dating me and then they started talking after me and her broke up.
Now I have nothing. For the last 4 years of my life I was talking to a girl who was into me (first my ex and then the girl in Cali) and now I have never felt so lonely in my life. Whenever I was sad about my breakup, I would look forward to moving to Cali in July and finally make it work with the new girl. To make matters worse, I have to see my ex every day and I keep thinking about how she is with him, a guy who I once called a brother to me. I just feel like it is all my fault because I broke up with her, a girl who genuinely loved me. I mean I broke up because of distance and in 35 days when I graduate, the closest she'll be to me is a 7 hr drive away so it would've still been long distance. But regardless, she's moved on (and dating a guy who used to be very close to me) and I can't help feeling like I did all this to myself.

Since the breakup, she's seemed to have an amazing senior year and now a new happy relationship while I've had such a sad senior year and am now lonelier than ever."

I started an internship a little while ago in programming, but I want something else that would pull me through.

I've always found it fascinating about open source projects as well as operating systems. And with this taste comes the interest in contributing to a project, which I really liked was **elementary OS**.

I have never had difficulties in programming (quite the contrary). I've never been to college so I guess I've never really felt the programming as it should be.

All the programming languages I've used so far have been easy, I'm the kind of person who thinks that if you know a language you know all, you just need to know the correct functions for the purpose..

Just to mention, in addition to programming I had classes in networks, OS (servers).
In the classes of OS I was entitled to install services and use it, that made me comfortable with linux. My teacher always used terminal I think I can count by the fingers the times I used GUI. I love linux now because of this teacher.

So I think I'm no pro, but I'm not new to this, i think xD.


Having said that, I would like someone to give me directions to achieve my goal:
&gt;Where to start?
&gt;What I should do first?
&gt;What do I need to read? 
&gt;What is the best order to read the documentation of elementary OS? 
&gt;What languages do I need to know?
&gt;Other things I need to know that no one think of?



I want to thank you now for reading and helping me getting some answers. And sry for the bad english :P"
64m6b2,6,2017-04-10,"Me [30F] with my boss [60s-M] of 1 year, not sure how to handle issues, or if I should just let it go due to circumstances.",throway4e,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/64m6b2/me_30f_with_my_boss_60sm_of_1_year_not_sure_how/,"Hi there, 

I've seen some great suggestions on here on how to approach difficult interpersonal issues and wanted to get an outside perspective on this issue at work. 

A little bit of backstory: I started this job about a year ago. We have a small, highly specialized, team of 3 employees + boss in a large company. 

About 3 months after I started, one of my coworkers got a great opportunity out of state. The details aren't relevant, but it took about 8 months to find her replacement. Her replacement actually just started about a month ago and still needs a lot of training. 

During all of this, my boss' wife was fighting a terminal disease (I never learned the details) and passed away in November.  Unfortunately just a few weeks after, his mom died as well.  Understandably, my boss hasn't really been ""present"" at work in a while. 

So the work fell on my other co-worker (30s M) and I.  It was really stressful being new and having all that responsibility thrust on you (and even worse for my coworker who had to train me while managing all the work) But whatever, circumstances were out of our control and that's just how it was. Coworker and I are really proud of how we held it all together for the better part of a year. 

We are about 5 months out from my boss' mom's death, and my boss is still a little checked out. It's starting to become destructive, and I'm beginning to feel resentful of the position I'm in. 

There are a bunch of things that are similar to the example I'm about to give, but this is what has me writing today: 

For example, last week we had a HUGE project due. It's an annual thing, and usually all hands are on deck.  I was the lead for the project, usually it's the only project the lead is assigned to for at least a month before hand.  My boss assigned me two other sizable projects due the same week as the big project, while my other two coworkers had only small projects + helping me with big project.  I'm not blaming them because they helped me out tremendously, but I definitely was frustrated that I had all of this extra work. 

(I will say that it's my fault for not speaking up - but I have only been here a year and it still feels wrong to tell your boss you can't handle something, you know?) 

The part has me very demoralized however, is a comment my boss made this morning that put me in a frustrated tailspin: 

He took the week off last week (the same week all the projects were due) to fly out cross-country with his daughter (late 20s) so she could interview for summer internships.  

My boyfriend put that into perspective ""He just lost the two people closest to him, he probably doesn't want to be away from kids etc"" which I thought was reasonable, but still frustrating. 

However, he forgot to put an out-of-office email on, and didn't check his email for the entire week. So an already stressful project was made all the more confusing and chaotic since he wasn't responding to emails (he's been there for 20+ years, and people still default to him for things) 

It all got done though, and everything was fine.  

This morning when he got in, he still hadn't checked his emails and asked me how the project went. I told him about the emails, and how chaotic it was (in a ""funny that this happened! but you should let me know if we need to follow up on anything else!"") 

He actually got mad at other people (not me), saying ""Well! I was on vacation so OF COURSE I won't respond!""  And I felt like he just dismissed the situation entirely. 

Then an hour later, he comes into my office a) telling me about a project due next week that he has been working on but wants me to take over, and b) when I remind him that I am going to be out of the office on vacation next week - he tells me I have to be available over email (It's reasonable that I could finish the project this week, and be available over email to troubleshoot in case anything goes awry) 

I've never been more livid. I actually would still probably check my email once a day, just because it makes it easier to come back to work. But being told I HAVE to right after he said it's audacious that people expect him to answer emails on vacation - and completely ignoring the chaos is caused me - really hurt. 

I feel very demoralized, and think I can say I finally feel burnt out. 

I have started to look for other jobs. I do feel bad, because this is a highly specialized field, so I'm in a great position to look for another job now that I have a year's experience.  I feel bad however, because that's what my predecessor did, and it really frustrated my boss to train someone to just have them leave. 

However, I don't know how long I should reasonably give my boss time to grieve. And even if it's been long enough, how do I even approach this? ""Sorry for your losses, but you're really dropping the ball lately and it's making my life more stressful"" sounds pretty crass. 

Thanks in advance for any insight, sorry for the wall of text!

I'm a 3rd year university student and will be doing an internship for 16 months, for which I am gonna need a car. I have looked at long term rental, leases and lease takeovers, and used cars.

My question is, for a private used car sale, how does the e-test and safety test work? I read that I need to do a safety test to get a license plate, but can I do this BEFORE I officially purchase the used car (and have the safety test be in the previous owner's name)? Do I even need to do it if the owner has done it in the past?

And what about e-test, if the previous owner has already done it a few years ago, do I need to do it again? Before or after the purchase?

Do I purchase insurance policy before or after purchasing the car? 

+any other points to look at, please let me know. First time buying a car and it's used, and first time buying insurance. Just not sure about what comes when.

Thank you"
64n17s,1,2017-04-10,Developer Interview: David,mrpood,Frontwire,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontwire/comments/64n17s/developer_interview_david/,"Note: This is our final bi-weekly developer interview. However, don’t worry! In a few weeks we will be introducing our bi-weekly development blog packed full of information about the ongoing development of Galaxy in Turmoil.


In our final developer interview, our community team took the opportunity to abduct and relentlessly interrogate the Audio Director for Galaxy in Turmoil: David Nazario. You can discuss this interview here: CLICK ME!

http://frontwirestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC00439.jpg

(Pictured above: David)


David, go ahead and introduce yourself.


Well, my name is David Nazario and I am the Audio Director for Frontwire Studios. I’ve been working in the AAA video game industry for over 8+ years now and some of the titles I’ve worked on include the Ratchet &amp; Clank series, Resistance 3, Sunset Overdrive, and Titanfall 2.

 


What led you to initially pursue a career in audio directing in the game industry? Was that always your goal or did you start off doing something different?


Well, I started out majoring in Music Recording Technology in college with the intent on working in the music industry as a studio engineer. After doing an internship at a local studio, I began to realize that it wasn’t for me. I still loved audio though, so I was dead set on getting a job that involved my degree; I just didn’t know what that job would be at the time. 
Luckily, I had this class in college where all of the seniors who came back from their internships would speak to our class about their experiences and how they got the internship. Well, one of these seniors that came in had his internship at Sony Foster City where he got to work on some PSP titles. This totally blew me away. I never considered a career in video game sound design before and really was the moment that set me on my path to where I am today.


From there, I did everything I could to try and get an internship at a AAA game dev studio. I heard about the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and booked a hostel and a plane ticket to go there for the week. It was an absolutely amazing experience to meet all these industry veterans.


During my time at the conference, I walked around the career floor and handed out my resume to every company that would take it. Eventually I made it to the Insomniac booth where I told the HR reps there about my interest in an internship with their audio department, and they introduced me to their Audio Lead who happened to be working the booth at the time. We talked for a while about audio things, and he told me that they’ve never had an audio intern before but thought that it would be a good idea to explore. So, he took my resume and said that he would get in contact with me sometime after the conference.Well, a couple of months went by and I didn’t really hear anything back from him and, it was getting close to the end of the semester.


If I didn’t have an internship lined up by May, I would have had to either take an internship somewhere else that wasn’t in a game audio or I would have to add another semester before I could graduate. Unfortunately, the Audio Lead there never gave me his contact information so there really wasn’t a good way of tracking him down. Thus I decided to go through all of the game industry contacts that I had made over the past few years and finally found someone who knew the guy I was talking about. I asked him if he could give me his email so that I could get in contact with him, and he did.
After sending the Insomniac Audio Lead an email asking about the internship, I get a call back telling me that I am successfully the first audio design intern at their studio.

 


I feel I should, on behalf of those less clued-up on the role of audio in game development, ask… What exactly is your day to day job? What is the routine like for you?


Well, currently I am a freelance Sound Designer. Basically, I take contract gigs at companies who are looking for extra audio help for their game. My last major contract gig was with Respawn Entertainment working on Titanfall 2. I also helped out a bit on their recently announced, but untitled, Star Wars project.


Most of my roles are as a Sound Designer which means that I create and implement the sounds that you hear in video games. A lot of the time, sound effects creation is done by taking samples from sound libraries and layering and processing them together into a completely new sound. Other times, it can involve me going out with a mobile recording rig and recording sounds outdoors, which is known as “field recording”, or it can involve “Foley recording” in which I create and record sounds in my home studio using various random objects.
As an Audio Director, my job is a bit different. I will still help out with sound design tasks but I’m mostly in charge of giving direction to the other sound designers in the department. I also make sure that the overall tone of the audio is consistent and that the quality of that audio is the best that it can possibly be.


And, for this project, I will be in charge of the dialogue in terms of recording the voice actors and directing them in the reading of their lines. 
I’m also the spokesperson of the Audio Department. I’m there to make sure that the audio team has all the support that it needs from the other departments so that they can complete their tasks with as much ease as possible.


 

Tell me, when you were approached with the opportunity to work on Galaxy in Turmoil. What made you decide to go for it?


Surprisingly, I was contacted earlier this year by someone from Frontwire’s HR team after they had found my online portfolio. They initially contacted me to come on as Sound Designer to help out with the project but as I was being interviewed they flat out offered me the position of Audio Director which was super surprising!


I guess the reason that I decided to join the team at first was because I love working on Sci-Fi games like this. The sounds are a lot of fun to make so I figured that it would be a good way for me to experiment with new sound design techniques that I had learned while working on Titanfall 2. Then, when I was offered the position of Audio Director, my reason for signing on was because I’ve never really had the chance to run a whole audio department before and this would be a really great opportunity to test out my leadership skills as well as getting to hear what a game that was directed by me would actually sound like. It’s very exciting to say the least.


 

Do you have a specific vision in mind for Galaxy in Turmoil’s audio, or are you happy with experimenting and going with what works?


I do have a particular vision in mind but mostly in terms of how I want to mix the game. In terms of tone, we are still experimenting with that at the moment. I’ve been looking at different games from the sci-fi genre for inspiration. Some of those include Star Wars, Mass Effect, Deus Ex, and Destiny. I’ve also been looking at some sci-fi movies as well that take place in space to get some inspiration for some of the vehicles that will be in the game.

 


What would you cite as the most challenging part of acting as Audio Director?


I’d say that the most difficult part of being an Audio Director is having to keep track of everything. Like… EVERYTHING. There’s having to keep track of how the other departments are progressing so I know when we can work on particular assets, all the things that the people on my team are working on, and then having to review all of it as well! There’s having to keep track of dialogue stuff, and remembering to contact all of the voice actors. Then there’s having to make sure that the tone is consistent in the game as well as making sure that the mix isn’t out of balance and potentially deafening our players. There is so much more to keep track of and it’s going to be a really tough challenge to keep it all managed.


For Titanfall 2, the Audio Director on that project had two giant whiteboards in his office that he used to keep track of everything. They were labeled “The Wall of Pain and Suffering” for Singleplayer stuff and “The Wall of Pain and Suffering (with Friends)” for Multiplayer stuff. I’ll probably have to do that for Galaxy in Turmoil…

 


When working as a sound designer, what was the strangest or most absurd sound you were tasked with creating?


HAH! I know exactly what my answer is for this one without even having to think about it. When I was working on Sunset Overdrive, I was tasked with creating all of the sounds for this one particular mission where you had to go fix a water treatment plant. Well, the designers decided to make this section where the player had to unclog the water treatment pools by shooting these giant balls of poop and making them explode… and I had to create a sound for that. The sound of a giant poop ball exploding. I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to top the absurdity of that sound but I’m hoping that some designer out there will make me try.

 


On a similar note, what part of the job do you enjoy the most? 


I would say that the thing I enjoy the most about my job is the variety of things that I get to work on and mostly having the creative freedom to make it the way that I want. I say mostly because I still do have to answer to the Audio Director or the team (if they don’t like a particular sound I make, they are really vocal about it, hahaha).

 


On the topic of people not liking your sounds, what would you say was your biggest cock-up? Naturally, nobody goes 8 years without the occasional humorous mistake, right?


Luckily, I’ve never really had the misfortune of creating a sound that the whole company has genuinely despised. I’ve had people come up to me and say that a sound wasn’t big enough for the action on the screen or that it was too dull but never anything that started a whole email thread where people bashed my sounds.


As for accidents, there really isn’t anything too major here either. I think the worst thing I’ve done was accidentally forgetting to set the instance limit on a looping sound that was spawned over and over again but never actually turned off. As a result the sound would just stack and stack and stack ‘til all other sounds in the game would start to drop out and then eventually the game would crash. The reason we had such a hard time figuring out what was causing the crash was because the looping sound was playing well outside earshot of the player. So we didn’t hear anything weird ‘til sounds started dropping out of the game.


I will say though that the most divisive sounds that I’ve ever created for a game was the post game UI sounds for Titanfall 2. People either loved those sounds or hated them. There was even an entire article written about them on Polygon!

 


What would you cite as a common mistake made by sound engineers when working on games that you want to go out of your way to avoid repeating?


I would say that a common mistake is not making your sounds big enough, if that makes sense. A lot of newer sound designers that I come across tend to have sounds that are a bit reserved in my opinion, and that can lead to a game feeling a bit empty when it comes to its overall soundscape.

 


If you could put any Easter egg in Galaxy in Turmoil, what would it be?


Oh, I love putting audio Easter eggs into games. I’ve put one into just about every game I’ve worked on except for one. And I have a few planned for Galaxy in Turmoil but I’m not going to give them away because they are pretty damn good, if I do say so myself! ;D


 

It’s customary for us to finish on a more lighthearted note. So, with that in mind, what would you consider to be the most embarrassing moment of your life thus far?


OK, so one time in college, I was driving back to my dorm after visiting my parents. There’s this speed trap that’s set up right as you get into the town the college is in. It goes from a 50 MPH speed zone to a 25 MPH zone, just like that. As I was crossing into the 25 MPH speed zone, a cop clocked me at 40 MPH. Naturally, the cop followed me and pulled me over. Now I’m sitting there, in the middle of campus, pulled over in front of all the dorms, and up walks this female officer. She asks, “Do you know why I pulled you over?” Well, me being nervous but pissed off cause this was to be my first speeding ticket, I don’t think about what I was going to say and just blurted out, “Cause it’s that time of the month?” NOW, BEFORE YOU JUDGE ME, I said that in reference to the police having to meet their monthly quota of traffic stops! She, of course, does not take it that way AT ALL!


Right after I say that, it hits me why her face changed and she looked pissed! And I start apologizing immediately. Like, fumbling over my words and everything.
Thankfully, she has mercy on me and lets me off with a warning, but I was crapping my pants the whole time!

 


And on that bombshell, we bring the final developer interview to an end. Thank you very much for your time, David.

64n9o8,8,2017-04-10,Introduction and request for direction.,teknohippie,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/64n9o8/introduction_and_request_for_direction/,"So I may be getting and internship with a company that basically is using .NET to work with EDI files. As of right now it is relatively unclear what my role within the company will be (probably some technical writing, sys-adminy stuff, database stuff, getting coffee :P who knows) Although I am a computer science enthusiast (in particular Linux) I dont have any background in the field outside of what I have taught myself (basics of Python, some networking stuff, and as I mentioned... Linux). So my ""in"" at the company suggested that I start learning about the .NET framework so that I may eventually get to mash some code (what I would really like to do). He suggested the book: Head First C#, although the PDF that he gave me is incredibly outdated. I downloaded the most current Visual Studios (set up in Windows on a VM) and I am attempting to work through it (albeit slowly) and whenever an issue comes up (due to the book being outdated) Im attempting to research and find my own work around. So basically I just wanted to say hello (maybe I should have prefaced this with: ) if  this is the wrong sub then I apologize, let me know and I'll move towards the correct one. Finally I was hoping for a little insight. Has anyone heard of the O'Reilly books? Does my path seem like a decent one as far as gaining an understanding of the company's product? Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated!

Desert of the thousand crystals.

The night air stung against Antimo's face and neck, as he made his way through the desert expanse, the sands made of intricate puzzle box's who's respective Cenobites had been released long ago. His bright glowing blue eyes looked upwards, not seeing the hammers blunt edge as it slammed down on his head with a loud crack, sending bits and pieces of the biomechanoids head to the ground. Antimo said nothing, he was still processing the sight that was in front of him. 
""Huh, that's interesting. I guess i can tweet a picture of whatever the fuck that thing is... Hashtag, Oscar-the-grouch-is-naked... And sent!"" He sighed to himself, for he was all alone, there was no one to talk with, nothing to fight, no big conspiracy or existential war.
It was just Antimo, wandering the Puzzle Box Desert, tweeting pics of a streaking, screaming, on fire Oscar the Grouch, being chased by Zombies who were failed clones of Donald Trump, and while they did not scream for his soft velvety brain, they were screaming racist comments at Antimo, who they thought was a Muslim.
Antimo was beside himself with boredom. He'd been alone in this place for so long, that he'd begin forgetting the scent of adventure. ""HELP ME, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"" Oscar screamed in high pitched tones, the flames eating away at his body. 
""All alone..."" He thought to himself.
""I'M RIGHT HERE! RIGHT NEXT TO YOU!"" The puppet screamed, punching Antimo in the face as hard as he could with a flaming fist. 
""God, I miss the group..."" He sighed as he casually took another picture of the scene unfolding in front of him.
""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!?"" Oscar screamed again.
""We're gonna build a waaaaall!"" One Trumbie moaned. 
""It'll be such a waaall!"" Another joined in agreement.
""Mexico will pay for iiiiit!"" A third almost sang as he fell into a sarlacc pit.

Antimo sighed to himself again, the little icon on his palm spinning slowly, the rainbow of colors slowly hypnotizing him just a little as he made he way further, ignoring the Trumbies ridiculous moans of Mexico paying for something as stupid as a wall. 
""They'll paaaay, WITH PINATAS!"" A nearby Trumbie roared into the Biomechanoids ear. ""They pay! they'll pay! they will-"" 
""Cannone Egoista!"" Antimo shouted as a four inch patch on his shoulder rose up, underneath, a barrel made of two gnomes fighting over a rotten piece of Salmon shown, the gnomes screaming their heads off as the energy built upwards, a blackening spiral, crossed with bright green metal bolts grew in the dead eyes of the salmon head. 
""It's going to be such a beautiful-"" 
""I'm sick of hearing about your fucking wall you undead piece of shit!"" He screamed at the top of his lungs as the energy release,d tearing off the Trumbies head in a matter of seconds. The trumbie feel to its knees, it's red power tie seeming to fail at its job for the wearer, floating in the wind as the scent of charred flesh and mistaken rhetoric filled the air. The other Trumbies, mumbling incomprehensibly to each other, paused as the scent caught up with them, the morning sun beginning to peek over the hundreds of twelve story tall crystalline structure out of the distance. Antimo smiled, the first he'd let cross his face in a long time. 
""Lights, camera, action as they say... How'd he do this?"" He asked no one in particular, the shoulder weapon recharging at a slow whine while the purple, pink, and greyish red sand shifted underneath his feet.
 ""Right..."" There was a moment, just a single moment where the air changed direction, as if Father Winter had taken a quick break to reap the rewards of eating a shame filled hot pocket, while listening to a shame filled screaming homeless person on a music CD released for kids. In truth it was just Oscar the Grouch, bitching that he was still on fire, still right next to Antimo, and still trying to put himself out while a few Trumbies chased him around, voting papers in their deformed and raccoon fur covered hands. 

A sling shot pellet, filled with the power of the birth of the universe on a microscopic level, slammed into the closest Trumbie, exploding, the shrapnel cutting through the rest with little trouble. 
""Great... And who are you?"" Antimo asked, the two gnomes ceasing their endless argument over the rotten salmon and staring as the newcomer with twin sets of beady black eyes, their bright red pupils glowing slightly in the morning light.
 ""My name is Luke."" The squat, pea shaped being said plainly. ""You got a last name? Skywalker? Ground skipper? Lavacrusher? Metal Pinky?"" Antimo threw out guess left and right, the energy of the shoulder cannon disappearing in a puff of cherry scented smoke. The giant snow pea like being, turned without moving to face the biomechanoid, its blank stare and thin, bright red lips stretched into a taught expressionless slight smile, caused the burning Oscar the Grouch the shit himself. The turd grew arms, legs, and eyes of its own. Upon witnessing the giant snow pea, snapped it's own neck and fell to the ground lifeless. 
""No. Just Luke."" 
""Well,"" Antimo said to no one in partcular, ""I'm searching for some friends of mine, want to tag along?"" 
""Sure."" Luke said, ""Trumbies?"" He asked as he joined Antimo in his journey. 
""Failed Donald Trump clones, once the media mogul realized that he would die one day, as all must, he went insane, using the presidency of the Toilet Licker Club to conduct sick and twisted experiments, most notably, cloning himself millions of times."" The snow pea listened, no thoughts in particular arriving in his mind. 
""Millions of Trump clones? What a joke."" Luke said, as a horde of Trumbies closed in on them. ""Great.""
 ""I'm going to ruuun for presideeeent!"" 
""We're going to get all the illegals out of the country!"" 
""You'll never find a better steak university, ANYWHERE!"" 
""God damn it."" Antimo muttered to himself, ""Get re-"" 
""All ready done."" The trumbies exploded, like severely disappointed party favors at a Mike Rowe impressionist party. Their five thousand dollar suits fell to the ground, covered in green blood and razor sharp teeth marks. 
""Damn, son! you move faster than he does!"" 
""Yeah... It's a thing I do."" Luke said calmly. ""I went through the Merging Existence."" 
""We all did."" 
""I went through it four times."" 
""Oh shit. the fuck did you do to piss S'flowyerphy off THAT badly?"" 
""I stole his girlfriend."" 
""Well, that's not so bad, lots of people have done that."" 
""I also was his cable guy."" 
""And?"" 
""I only gave him basic reception, not high def. He asked for 4K resolution."" 
""God damn... That's funny."" Antimo giggled as Luke stopped in his tracks and turned to him, his tiny arms rose upwards, in a stiff fashion. 
""I was also the cook at his birthday BBQ bash. I left while the bacon was cooking."" 
Antimo stopped laughing, his eyes narrowed, smile turned into a frown, and voice turned angry. ""What did you just say?"" Luke took a stiffly animated step forward. 
""I said... I burnt... His..."", The giant snow pea leaned in real close to Antimo's left ear and whispered the last word with so much pleasure, it sickened the biomechanoid, ""B-a-c-o-n.""
""That's sick! not in the good sick, as in the god fucking damn you sick. How'd you survive?"" 
""I had to go fast. and I kept going faster. Soon I got too fast, and the speed of light seemed like a slow drip of molasses."" Antimo gulped hard, knowing that his speed wouldn't be at Lukes level. 
""Well, four twenty blaze it. Let's go, I don't know how many other Trumbies are going to pop up, and I'd rather not stay to find out.""

The two continued through the Desert of the thousand Crystals, Luke admiring the giant pillars of near diamond like material, and in awe of the trapped lightning coursing through each of them. The pillars almost seemed to hold up the very sky itself, glinted as the rays of the morning sun increased. Antimo took a minute to look up at it. Luke looked at it too, and saw in it something that scared him just a little. 
""I see it too. By the way, that speed of yours?"" He asked, his inner workings gearing up for something incredibly fierce.
""What of it?"" Luke replied, still focused on the object that seemed to be powering the sun. 
""Just how much faster can you go?"" The biomechanoid asked, his eyes focusing in on the object steadily approaching them. 
""Very."" Luke stated, trying his best to sound brave. ""This... this isn't even my final form.""
""Cool, mine neither."" Suddenly, without warning, the sun became swollen, like a balloon rapidly filling with gunpowder and vodka. 
""Well, shit biscuits. And here I thought I was about to miss the grand finale of our little fight!"" A familiar voice called out. 
One that Antimo never wanted to hear again. 
The being in question looked like Morgan, used his voice, but there was something inherently off about him. something dark and sinister. ""Oh, you. What,  you run out of Trumbies to play with? I can always make more!"" He called out, his eyes menacing beyond anything Antimo had witnessed before. 
""God... Fucking... Damn it... Oh, wait, you're still stuck in there with her! Yay!"" He cheered as a swift series of uppercuts and hooks slammed S'flowyerphy's head against the wall and cieling of the cramped Time/Space Prison. the fierce fists belonged to a really pissed off woman, her deep blue eyes wide with rage, her soft pink lips contorted into a most disapproving frown, and her dark blonde hair was frazzled and matted in places from the awesome amount of punches she was landing. 
""Hey, Kim! Kim! It's me! Down here! Kim!"" Antimo shouted joyfully while all she did was glare at him with a moon destroying rage. 
The biomechanoid smiled and sighed, ""That's Kim, we're friends!"" 
She roared as her right hand grabbed the back of S'flowyerphy's head and repeatedly bashed it against the wall, jerking hard this way and that, listening to the bones in his neck snap, crackle and pop. All the New core did was sigh, ""You missed a vertebrae."" He commented, pointing to a bone that was sticking out of his neck. She obliged by repeatedly punching the spot as hard as she could.

""She's gotta go faster."" Luke said, his smile unnerving S'flowyerphy just a little as the New Core finally took notice of the giant Snow Pea like creature standing next to Antimo. 
""And just what the flying fuck is that!?"" He screamed as Kim launched a final punishing series of blows to his head, causing small spider webbing cracks to appear on the walls of the Time/Space prison. The small metal box pinging louder and louder with every punch landed. Kim wasn't even paying attention to anything outside of punishing the New Core that was possessing the only other verion of morgan to escape the Merging Existence in one piece. 
Antimo looked at Luke, then back at S'flowyerphy. He smiled, ""This is Luke! Let him in there and he'll show you something cool!"" 
Luke flashed him a large toothy smile, making the Biomechanoids left eye twitch just a little. 
""I'm gonna go fastest."" 
""You do that little buddy!"" Antimo cheered him on as the spiky haired snow pea bolted towards the sun, the very air around him turning to ash from the amount of friction that just couldn't keep up. In an instant, Luke was standing in front of Kim, and for one glorious moment, faster than she could perceive, he repeated poked her boob ten times. 
""Squishy."" He giggled, snapping his fingers. Kim felt the floor underneath drop out, and she fell the four hundred feet to the soft snow like desert sand. 
""Little fucker just poked my breast!"" She screamed in panic. 
""He's gotta go fast!"" Antimo cheered on. 
""You're not helping!"" She commented, brushing a few strands of hair out of her face. 

The New Core turned around, smiling, expecting Kim to have given up. 
""Ha! I knew you would give up eventu-for the love of Gods shiny hot pants you're in here with me!"" He panicked, not sure how to react. ""I guess I could kill you. Lava."" He muttered under his breath, and at once the interior of the Time/Space prison was filled with hot, molten, liquid lava. 
""This burns, but I'm killing you with my love! My burning, fiery, skin melting love! Remember, this hurts me a lot more than it- Okay, that, THAT WAS A LIE, WE'RE BOTH IN EQUAL AMOUNTS OF PAIN!"" The New Core screamed as the amount lava kept growing, the pressure intensifying, and the amount of room S'flowyerphy had to move around withered to absolutely nothing. 
""You gotta go faster."" Luke said calmly, the lava barely bothering him at all. At once, the lava cooled, froze, and shattered into a fine powder. The floor dropped out from both of them, and the powdered lava rock rained down, building a small sand castle in the process. All that was left was the two of them standing in mid air. 
""Kim, that's Luke, we're friends! Luke! Down here! Luke! It's me!"" 
Luke paid Antimo no mind, only focusing on his assault fon the New Core. Barely moving, with only small whiffs of gentle breeze washing forward, S'flowyerphy was confused as to what exactly was happening. Then he felt millions of small prodding sensations, as if someone were gently messaging him. the force behind the prodding grew and grew, till at last, they felt like trillions of dentist drills stabbing into him from all over. The pain increased, the injuries remained, and holes kept appearing in his form. 
""Gotta go fastest. Get rickety rickety rickety WRECKED!"" Luke screamed, his face going from a placid, emotionless demon from god knows where, to a handsome, sparkling eyed, super model with a chin so chiseled that flakes of light gathered at his feet. Luke grew cheek bones so gorgeous that even the currently screaming New Core, who was about to truly kamehameha wave level shit his pants, cooed for five seconds before exploding into an oceans worth of absolute gore.

""I totally went way too fast. Hashtag four twenty blaze it."" Luke said, smiling and flashing the peace sign and thumbs up with just one hand. 
Kim squinted, grimaced, and nodded in approval. 
""I want to bear his children."" She said with too much determination.

June 17th, 1 AME, 3:44PM
The H.I.V.E.

The Black Syrup slipped through the various honey combing crevices that lead towards a trillion different locations of the galaxy wide octexagonal structure that was situated just outside the edges of the Singular Existence, it slew upwards sank back down, twisted and turned, looped around and finally slammed full force into the ground. ""You've arrived."" Resaec said calmly. ""Four minutes late. What's the latest?"" The clone of the Black Syrup formed, a dark set of cloaks formed just over the body, with flowing, long dark hair covering half of his pale, snow white face.
 ""The latest is that we're fucked. The New Core, S'flowyerphy is dead. Also, Stephen Colbert is back. Also, that car wash we held yesterday only raised four dollars and sixty five cents. Also, I slept with your girlfriend."" 
Resaec sighed deeply. ""He's dead? He's back? Only that much? Also, at this point, we've all slept with her. And of the Lost Wolf?"" 
The clone took a deep breath. ""You know the answer to that as well as I do. We just have no clue as to where he could've gone. All we do know is that he and the Skeletal Angels vanished sometime after the fight, like, completely. There's a link between them, The H.I.V.E. knows this much."" The clone spoke with a sad boredom. 
Reseac turned around, his eyes focusing on the stream of information flowing into his head. ""We have other things to worry about. Apparently, a snow pea named Luke, of all things, has joined Antimo. Apparently, he's gotta go fast."" 
The clone got the reference. ""The Meme Lord has returned after all this time?"" 
""Yes, you know what that means, if the Meme Lord returns, so to does the Forced Meme. Apart, they are destructive in their own right, but should they meet face to face... Well, that is something altogether more dangerous than S'Flowyerphy could've been."" The clone thought on this, knowing that the original was right after a fashion. ""The H.I.V.E.-"" 
""Will not act... We exist only to collect information and share it as we see fit. If for some reason, our interference is needed, we will do so only when the time is most critical."" 
""If we refuse to act based on the need of the situation, lives will be lost! Resaec, why have you chosen to wield the H.I.V.E. in this fashion!? ANSWER ME!"" The clone screamed, his own anger over the situation getting the better of him. 

Recaec turned and met him eye to eye. ""We will only act when the danger will directly affect us. Remember, we are liquid. The H.I.V.E. is liquid. Should a part of either be destroyed, we simply move the rest to replace what has been lost. Our numbers replenish, and we all share, store, and receive the same knowledge instantaneously."" He stated in a precise way. 
""So, this is where you hide yourself when you're not busy screwing other people?"" 
""I think we found the Lost wolf."" The Clone stated with a raised finger. ""Yes, we have. Morgan, how could you have-"" 
""Spatium, Chronositum."" The Lost wolf replied, his green eyes flaring just a little as the right and left arms of both Skeletal Angels came into being just over his own. 
""Of... course."" Resaec stated closely. He turned back towards the massive screen in front of him, there was nothing on it, but it was a direction that he wouldn't see Morgan. 
""We needed you in that battle. You... left her in that thing with him. He probably killed and revived her millions of times since then. You have a veritable army at you're disposal, and you did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO HELP KIM OUT!"" The Lost Wolf screamed, there was definite anger in his voice, a pent up rage that needed to be vented. 
Resaec let him vent, it was his way, and he would calm down soon enough. 
""Yes, I do. I did. And you're right... I didn't."" He replied, his own emotions having long ago been muted by centuries of isolation, surrounded only by shadows of himself for company. 
""What do you suggest I would've done in that situation?"" Resaec countered, ""Compromise my position? Morgan, I don't know how much clearer I'm making this, but I am playing the Long Game. I have... Attained, bits and pieces of information that show that-"" 
""It doesn't matter Resaec, you had a part to play in that fight, and you fucked up badly."" He cut the Black syrup off. ""Why is it... that you only choose to act when it's far too late? why not act premptively-"" 
""I WAS ACTING PRE-EMPTIVELY YOU FUR COVERED JACKFUCK!"" Resaec raged, ""IT WAS ME ALONE WHO GATHERED THE INFORMATION, IT WAS ME ALONE WHO GUIDED YOU! IT WAS ME ALONE THAT PUT EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME! IT ALL WAS ME! I don't know what you think you've accomplished running around as you have, thinking that punching everything is the way to go, but from where I stood, waited, and watched, ALL YOU'VE EVER DONE IS RUN THROUGH A LONG HALL OF OPEN DOORS!"" There was anger in his face now. The long centuries of isolation, of things, plans, information, stratagems, wheels within wheels that had already been set in motion, all of it, broke loose in that moment. 
Resaec was angry, and the whole of the Hive felt it.

""All I did was run through open doors? You're right, but I and my friends had to fucking endure fights and injuries that would've normally killed... FUCK, anyone, including you, instantly. The only thing that saved our asses was the fucking left over energy from the Dream Dimension, the old one, not this new bullshit. You hid away, locked in... this."" Morgan sneered, the depth of the injuries sustained showing in his eyes. The broken bones, lost limbs, entire versions erased. It was all too much for him. ""I can't... keep fighting these things, these threats are just way too much-"" 
""Well, you'll hate this new one."" 
""How big? How tough? How fast?"" The lost wolf replied. There was a tired glint in his eyes, the deep shadows under his eyes, as well as the streak of gray hair on one side of his hair told of the stress he had to endure.
 ""The size of a fairly large beach ball. He's pretty damned tough. And he makes the fastest speed look like a molasses drip slowed down to a stop."" 
""Luke?"" 
""you know of the Meme Lord?"" 
""We... Ran into each other a while back. He's harmless."" 
""He exploded S'flowyerphy. Permanently."" 
""Harmless, sides, he's gotta go fast."" 
""He keeps saying that."" 
""Yeah, it's a thing."" morgan sighed, unable to fathom how everything had swung so sideways.

The Void of Nothingness

Sogno sat back, his mind wandered from topic to topic, unable to think of anything in particular. ""Kim?"" He asked, the woman rising up from the shadows beside his bed. 
""Yes?"" 
Sogno was puzzled, for as long as she had been in his employ, she had never once bothered to use the door, not once. ""You do realize we've got regular doors, right?"" 
""Yeah, but come on, this is the Void of Nothingness!"" She exclaimed, spreading her arms out wide, a golden tinge appearing on the edges of her elbows. 
""She's still fighting S'flowyerphy, isn't she?"" He asked plainly, the golden tinge spreading to the rest of her body, revealing his visitors true form, the Fusions Result. 
""Actually, she just killed the shit out of him, like perma-death level."" 
""Well, the human has some gumption after all! And of Morgan? It's been too long since he was at my Mansion."" 
""I don't know where he is. Probably trying to find some new thing to occupy his time with. I last heard he was making rugs?"" The fusions Result scratched his head, letting a long sigh escape the part of his face that might've been considered a mouth. ""Sogno, how long are you just going to sit there?"" He asked, his eyes, diamond, his pupils the dark matter that separated the stars, focused just a little. 
Sogno hadn't given it much thought. There was a void of power in the seat of the Core of Everything that needed to be filled, and there were sure to be plenty of rivals that would certainly want to claim it for themselves. 
""I haven't decided-"" 
""That's a fucking lie, we both know that ever since the moment your genetics even started coming together, that's all you've ever wanted! Power, unlimited and untold power! Seriously.""

Club of Three

The night club was packed, more so than usual. The bartender seemed to be in a good mood considering the argument he had with his boy friend the week before that resulted in him rooming iwth a friend. But things were working out for him for the most part. He sighed as the music pumped, and watched the club goers dance as if it was their last night. He saw someone walk into the club, and normally, he'd just ignore it altogether, but there was some thing in the new comers eyes, something that just didn't sit well with the bartender. He gave a quick nod to the security guard they always had on stand by in case anything might happen. The security guard went over to the stranger, who was garbed in a series of long, bloodied bandages that were wrapped from his chest, over his head, leaving the arms free. 
He wore a long heavy coat, that seemed to be made of segmented steel plates, linked together by only the thinnest of wires. His pants seemed dirty, not the dirt one would find on the floor, but the kind of dirt you couldn't wash off. The kind that clung to your soul. The security guard walked over to the stranger and tapped on his shoulder. 
""Sir, you're going to need to come with me, we have some concerns."" 
""Well, I hate to disappoint."" The new comer said plainly, and with a snap of his fingers, twin auto rifles sprang into being from clouds of poisoned smoke. No one paid much attention, they were too busy dancing. 
The stranger smiled underneath the bandages, his eye sight, broken from the horrors of the land he had come from, his mind, twisted and shattered, barely hanging together by a thread, finally came apart. The rifles fired off the first of many rounds, the club goers falling to the ground, the lucky few didn't realize what happened until they couldn't. 

The new few, slowly realizing the madness that was unfolding, started panicking, but only after they felt the burning sting of hot lead tearing through their bodies, and they too were on the floor, multicolored blood pooling around them. The bartender was about to reach for the semi automatic he had stashed just under the counter, but the stranger was too fast for him. The next three bullets found their marks, two in the eyes, one in the head. The momentary burning pain screeched through his body, he roared with anger, the final bullet zipping through his head, the glowing blood spider webbing on the mirror behind him. 
The stranger stopped smiling, his mind went emotionless as he went about his work, undeterred by the growing smell of the dead, thoughts interrupted and muted by the repeated bursts of gun fire, by the limp bodies hitting the floor, the lat moments of the recently deceased lives flashing through their brains. Some cried out for their parents, others simply slumped against the walls and slid down, looking like puppets that had their strings cut. 

Finally, the stranger came upon a being that was just as strange, if not more than him. The wooden and segmented look of his skin, the sheen caused by the club lights making him look just ethereal in the night light. 
""So, we've got the madness here too? Let me finish my drink. Then I'll dance with you."" He said, grouchy that his night had been interrupted. 
The stranger cocked his head to one side, then to the other. ""Are you black?"" 
""In a way, yes."" He replied, ""in a way I am."" 
""I don't have a problem with blacks."" 
The being smiled, ""Then you really won't like the fact that in a way... In a way? I'm also white."" 
The stranger grimaced, bothered by the level of disrespect this person was showing him. He raised a hand, both of the floating auto rifles aimed themselves squarely at the beings head, the stranger once again snapped his fingers, and the bullets flew at their intended target. 
""Magia blanca cadena: Ten Ton araña de marionetas."" The being said with a bit of anger. 
""I've killed all these people, you should fear me."" the stranger replied as the various planks of wood that made up the walls, floor and ceiling slowly separated, revealing a blank white space, in the distance in every direction, a series of clock gears and pulleys, faded grey and teal, clicked, clacked, ticked, and tocked away. 
""I should... but I'm not going to. Crush him my pet."" The giant spider puppet landed on the stranger with a hard thud, all eight legs tearing through the Stranger, his screams muffled by the shocking end. ""Huh, that was weak. don't ever come into my Dimensional nightclub again you  peice of shit."" Barney Fife swore under his breath. 
 ""Come on... we've got a long way to go.""  he said to his spider Puppet, his chest opening up as the wooden arachnid came fell into a large pile of wooden planks and strings, retracting into the opening. 

Barney walked for a long time, his aged feautures showing a bit more brightly in the light that came from everywhere and no where all at the same time. He sighed to himself, not knowing exactly in which direction the signal he detected a few nights prior was coming from. He held out his right hand, and a small, semi solid display grew from it. After seeing that Chip and Dale were rescuing the Power Rangers for the fourth time today, he chuckled to himself and kept going forward.

Desert of the Crystal Spires

Kim watched as a piece of S'flowyerphy inched its way across the small patch of sand it had been afforded. Her blue eyes twinkled in the evening light, her pupils contracting just a little as the late New Core's right pinky stopped its journey when it reached the edge of the sand in the jar. 
""What're you going to name it?"" Antimo asked, obviously wanting to talk about something different than the morbid, yet fascinating task of watching a dismembered limb inch its way towards an unknown goal. 
She sighed, ""I haven't decided. Jackass? fucktard? Ass monkey? there are so many options!"" She smiled. Her eyes caught a glimpse of Luke, who was simply standing there, looking off into the distance. ""What's with him?"" 
The question seemed to linger in the air as the Biomechanoid thought about the question himself before answering. ""He... He's a product of the internet. His creator named him after himself, but as far as I-"" 
Luke turned around, a blank, but meaningful stare shot back at Antimo. ""The internet calls to me. My Creator, as it were, made videos on Youtube. I... A version of me, was his channels Logo. Why I was made in this form, I don't know. what I do know was the fact that the pinky's owner, forced Luke and myself, along with trillions of other versions of him, into a last man standing death match. As his Construct, I was duty bound to protect him..."" 
Antimo nodded, he remembered the Merging Existence well, the Highlander Event. Every conceivable and inconceivable version of a person, forced to fight each other till only one person remained.

""Kimberly, may I ask you a question?"" The construct asked politely, walking over and sitting next to her. She blinked, not knowing how to respond. 
""I'll take your silence as a yes. I assume you went through the Merging Existence yourself?"" 
""I did, why?"" 
""Then I have no need to tell you of the absolute horror I felt when I was forced to..."" 
Antimo put a hand on his shoulder, ""There's no need. We all remember thatp lace well. you said the internet calls to you?"" 
Luke nodded, his facial expression unchanged, but his voice seemed excited. ""Yes, even through Dimensions, the Internet, itself, is calling to all of us. Those born of it, hear it's voice particularly well. Those constructed by those who reside in it, doubly so. Something's wrong with it, something is killing the internet.""

Dimension between Dimensions

Stephen and john touch down in the decayed looking forest, the plains around them had large chunks of earth floating in the sky, the warriors bones, encrusted with iron after so many centuries of inactivity, turning them into statues of the dead. John looked worried,  his mind clouded by the voices of the past, from the event that shook the world and changed how t hey saw realty as a species. 
""Ah, smell that fresh air John!"" Stephen shouted with joy, walking up to the remains of a large and fierce looking rabbit turd, wearing the armor of some great ancestor. Stephen looked greedy, the armor reflected his face, and the stark black eyes that looked at seemed to have no effect on the news anchor whatsoever. 
""I'll interview you later on the importance of being earnest."" He simply stated, John was confused was as to why the reflection seemed to scurry off into the distance in the reflective surface. ""This... This was a sacred and mighty battlefield John, a lot of people died for no real good reason. Fuck."" Stephen smiled, his teeth seemed brighter than usual, his hair more perfectly formed, his dull steely grey eyes a sharp and perfect gun metal grey with a blue glow to them. 
""You know what they say john?""
 His friend shrugged his shoulders, as if to suggest he had no clue what to expect. 
Stephen sighed, his mind cleared, a picture formed, and he snapped his fingers. A column of black light shot up through the ground, a Construct formed. 

""Know thyself before you know thy enemy."" The Construct replied, a large collection of contorted construction equipment locked together by a variety of steel cables that looked as though they belonged to a bridge. 
""John, you're new here, so let me clue you into the kind of weird bullshit you'll be facing. Gorgo the dumptruck here, say hi Gorgo!"" The large robot waved a friendly hello towards Stephens friend, the collection of gears and fan belts that formed Gorgo's face shaped into a smile. 
""Gorgo here is a Construct, a being made from the remnants of the old Dream Dimension, basically, if you imagine it, poof it appears!"" 
""This... THIS IS INSANE!"" 
Stephen shook his head. ""No, what's insane is the fact that you all never believed me in the first place. the producers, the writers, hell even the numerous interns that never quite got my fucking coffee orders right, none of you believed me. That is insane! Even after everything we witnessed that day!? And people just went back to being normal as if it never happened! that's insane!"" Stephen raged while Gorgo simply stood there, looking around. 
John thought he got the majority of what his friend was saying. 
""So, getting back to the Constructs?"" He pressed. 
Stephen calmed down, his focus regained, ""Right, the Constructs. Gorgo, how old are you right now?""
 The mechanical being scratched his massive head with what looked like the shovel scoops from several bulldozers. ""I think about ten minutes?"" 
""Thank you, one more question. How old do you feel?"" Stephen questioned the Construct again. john walked up to it, wanting ot take a closer look at the thing. 
""I feel... Like I'm a century old, at the very least."" Gorgo replied, his voice like the revving of an V-twin engine heard from the distance. 
""Thank you. Last question, would you like to go back to the Dream dimension energies?"" Stephan asked earnestly. 
Gorgo thought about this for sometime before answering. ""Yes, but I just got here... There is a natural pull towards wanting to return from whence I came, but I wish to remain here by my Creators side, if that is alright with you?"" The Construct replied with heartfelt enthusiasm. 
""Sure thing, John, is there anything you wish to ask Gorgo?""

John Stewart had so many questions to ask Gorgo, the first one was the most obvious. ""Yes! A thousand times yes! Um, Gorgo, before being called here, what and where were you?"" 
The mechanical being looked at his Creator for guidance, only to have Stephen simply wave him on. ""I was pure energy, dancing and playing among my brothers and sisters, I wish to return, but... I wish to stay. That is the burden we Constructs face when created or summoned. What is your name?""
 John was taken aback, his mind was blown by the politeness and response of this thing in front of him. ""My name is John Stewart, I'm a friend of Stephen's, and for a while, I was his boss."" Gorgo smiled a little, he turned around, sensing something off in the very distance beyond the two humans perception. 
""We must go, there is something happening."" He said flatly. 
Stephen and John looked at each other, ""Lead the way, big guy!"" Stephen said with a heart felt clap of the hand on John's back. 
""As you wish, my Creator.""

Plain of the rising Planes

A C17 bomber's nose jutted out of the ground from the first few moments of spring, the nose cone bent and twisted, as if looking around for any spot of danger, and sensing none, the rest of the planes body ruptured from the ground, it's mighty engines chewing through the many feet of dirt, bed rock, and soil, and spitting out slightly more burnt dirt, bed rock and soil. It landed, the landing gears activating just in time as the wheels crushed a bunch of lowly petunias. The cockpit of the C17 contianing two skeletons of terrorists, their suicide vest bombs still blinking as the bones floated around in the battery acid that served as the C17's digestive system. It hungered, more so than ever before, it circled the plain in a wide swathe, looking for a clear area in which to take off. The first class section of the C17 bomber had several floors of seating, all of which contained the bodies of formerly high profile business executives, zombified by hours of watching every Adam Sandler movie IMDB could stuff into the in flight movie play list, to make the planes digesstion of any living organism in its formidable body even easier, the movies had been horribly cut with Jacob Sartorious message logs in which he begged fans for nude pictures, as well as a clip of Justin beiber falling off a stage, presumably while high on jet fuel.

64o3ab,3,2017-04-10,Anyone here quit/withdrew from the Science Internship Program?,BigButtBrad,uwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwo/comments/64o3ab/anyone_here_quitwithdrew_from_the_science/,"Hey,

So I landed a 16-month comp sci internship for next year, from May 2017 to Aug 2018. I have been talking with some people in the Comp Sci world, and doing a bunch of research, and everyone has said 16-months is way too long.

 I understand getting practical work experience is extremely valuable, but 16 months at one company, receiving an intern's salary, delaying graduation, etc., may be too much. 

I am considering perhaps quitting/withdrawing from the internship after 8-12 months, and perhaps finding another 4-month internship for summer 2018. That way, even though I'd still be delaying graduation, I'd (hopefully) have more diverse work experiences in (hopefully) multiple industries/areas of CS. 

I understand the [policy](https://www.uwo.ca/sci/undergraduate/career_services/science_internship_program/credit__fees.html) says:

&gt; 3 . The student who goes out on an Internship work term and then quits to return to school or quits mid-term - without cause;


&gt; The student receives an ""F"" in Science 3391 and is still required to pay the Internship fee

and 

&gt; 5 The student who is let go due to changes in economy or quits for health/compassionate reasons;

&gt; The student is withdrawn from Science 3391 - but still required to pay the IIP fee.

Has anyone had experience with withdrawing from the Science Internship program during the workterm? Did an ""F"" in Science 3391 affect you in the future in any way? Were you able to avoid getting an ""F""? The internship fee is not an issue I am concerned with -- I am moreso concerned with the ""F"" on the transcript (which is currently very good). 

To everyone else, especially other CS students, do you think I should just remain at the place for 16-months? 

Thank you for reading"

I'm a student at the University of Iowa and I graduate in May. I interned for an accounting firm called RSM here in Iowa City and they basically give their interns the option of moving to wherever they want if they get a job offer (they're the fifth biggest firm in the U.S., so they have lots of locations). I didn't want to live in a big city after graduation but I also didn't want to stay in Iowa, so I visited Sioux Falls briefly, liked it, and decided to start there! All my friends give me crap for it - ""who wants to live in South Dakota? There's nothing there"" yadda yadda yadda. I'm fairly confident that I'll like SF, but with graduation coming up and the realization that ""real"" life is about to start and I need to move there soon, I'm starting to get a little nervous considering I know absolutely zero people in SF let alone South Dakota. I was hoping some fellow SF citizens could relieve me of being nervous and tell me how great SF is. Also I have a few questions if anyone would be willing to answer:

1. Are there many young people that I'll be able to make friends with? Hell, is it easy making friends? That's my biggest concern because I met a lot of cool people in Iowa City and I want to meet cool people in SF too. I can certainly do things on my own but friends always make things more fun.
2. Are there many activities to do in SF? How's the downtown area? I visited it briefly as the firm I'm working for is smack downtown (Phillips Ave.)
3. Iowa City is a population of 68,000ish and i know SF is nearly triple that. My hope is that it will have the small city feel to it but still provide plenty of activities. Can anyone confirm?

Thank you in advance to anyone who responds to this! I am excited to move to the city, but as you can see I'm also a little nervous. I look forward to reading any responses!"
64or3y,5,2017-04-11,"First Server-grade server for home use advice, or back to basics?",Samzebian,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/64or3y/first_servergrade_server_for_home_use_advice_or/,"Hey reddit,

I am doing an internship right now where I'm getting exposure to some real-world use cases for servers, and it's making me realize some of the advanced ways I could be setting up my own home server setup, so I wanted to ask some questions.

I currently run a very basic home ""server"" if you can even call it that right now. It's an old 6-core AMD bulldozer pos CPU, with 8GB ram and a pretty old motherboard. I've upgraded it by adding a raid SATA6 card, usb 3.1 and type-c ports, 2 6TB WD Red drives, 2 2TB WD green drives, a decently fast 120GB OCZ ssd and a couple of other random drives. I use this machine for all of my storage of data, which is backed up to one of the 2 6tb WD red drives, an external 4TB 2.5"" seagate drive, a 4TB external 3.5"" WD drive (one for offsite another for portable copy), along with backblaze for cloud storage. I also use it to torrent ISOs, as an FTP server, for plex, and occasionally to remote in from my phone or tablet to do something on the go with data or that can't be done on mobile. I really doubt this is going to cut it, but I haven't even tried running esxi on this machine. It's a fx-6100 w/8gb ~~ddr2~~ ddr3.

I ideally would love to just buy a decent i7 4770k or something along the lines of that, some ram and a new motherboard and throw it in my existing setup, since I have a dead-silent fractal-design r4 black edition case, and my other pc is silent (plus this would be much much cheaper). If I end up having to get a rack server or something of the like, I'd like to see of a way to make it dead-silent with some crazy CPU cooler or a contained liquid cooling kit, I hate fan noise with a passion. Based on the proposed specs below for my VM's, I think I will need at least 32GB ram, and either a quad-core dual-threaded cpu or 2 quad cores with single threads, I have storage covered and everything else. I would like to keep my budget somewhat reasonable. I don't have a range though because I want to see my options for this application.

My main issue was when I wanted to go to server 2016, my backup cloud service, backblaze, does not allow use on any server OS, instead they wish for you to pay for their enterprise service Backblaze B2. I pre-payed 2 years for backblaze, and I prefer the pricing and features of their consumer service, plus I AM a consumer, I just want to run this on my own home hardware that happens to be running a server OS.


I want to either do 1 of 2 things, build or buy some server-grade hardware, run ESXi on it and virtualize a couple of different OS's and use this to replace my current home ""server"", or build/buy server grade hardware and use my old ""server"" to store all of my data and make it accessible from the real server.

I want to run the following OS's to both use on a daily basis and to learn more about windows Domain controllers, AD, group policy, and other topics.


windows 10 -storage/backup to cloud vm - this will run 24/7
server 16 - dc - this will run 24/7
server 16 - remote access server - this will run 24/7
server 16 - test partition / who know - this will only be ran when I use it.
windows 10 - test os / virus testing center - this will only be ran when I use it.
ubuntu - linux fun - this will only be ran when I use it.
redhat - more linux fun - this will only be ran when I use it.

So basically, I need hardware capable of running 2 win server 16 VM's, a Windows 10 VM and 1-2 more VM's at the same time. so 5 VM's at once max, performing local and cloud backup, being an FTP server, sharing files locally on the network, streaming plex media very rarely to my tv's or phones, and torrenting files maybe 2-3 times a month.

I'm really sure if I run this on my current setup it won't be able to do any of it. I think I can get away with this setup:

windows 10 -storage/backup to cloud vm - installed on SSD, 60gb partition, 12gb ram, 2 cpu cores
server 16 - dc - 20gb ssd partition, 2 cpu cores, 4 or 6gb ram
server 16 - remote access server, 20gb ssd partition, 2 cpu cores, 8 gb ram
server 16 - test os - 40gb hdd partition, 2 cpu cores, 4 gb ram
windows 10 - test os / virus testing center - 40gb hdd partition, 2 cpu cores, 4 gb ram
ubuntu - linux fun - 30gb hdd partition, 2 cpu cores, 8 gb ram
redhat - more linux - 60gb hdd partition, 2 cpu cores, 8 gb ram

If I wanted to run all of this at once, 64GB of ram may suffice, 60GB for the OS's, 4 GB for ESXi, I'd need 2 quad-core dual-thread xeons, and I already have the drive space.

However I don't plan to run all these VM's at once, now nor in the future, so I could run the top 3 VM's with 32GB of ram and two non-hyper threading quad core xeons, or if possible a quad-core dual-threaded i7 if that's compatible (even though I don't believe it's supported) by ESXi. My gaming rig is an i7-6700k with 32GB of ram, but I don't want to have that run all of my server stuff.



I know this was a very long over-detailed post, but I'll use it for my own references while I figure this whole thing out.

TL;DR: Should I upgrade my home non-server grade hardware to a quad-core dual-threaded CPU to run 3-4 VM's at once, or should I buy a real server and just use my existing hard drives, and what should I be looking to purchase for a decent budget rig?



Lastly, I could avoid ALL of this by getting backblaze to run on windows server 2016, but I couldn't figure out a way to do this. Of course that would mean way less control and no fun, but it would be essentially free"
64ox6m,1,2017-04-11,I don't know what to do or how to get out of this downward spiral,reallydiscouraged87,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/64ox6m/i_dont_know_what_to_do_or_how_to_get_out_of_this/,"Fall 2015 I moved halfway across the country to start an MBA program at a top school. I did a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of five and a half years, for a whole year. I got a great summer internship and worked my ass off with the belief that it'd turn into a full time offer at the end of the summer. And when the end of my internship came, they didn't give me an offer.

They said it was because they weren't sure how dedicated I was to being there and if I'd accept the offer, or if I'd renege on it. I was devastated. I'm not a cheerleader by any means, I don't go around saying ""boy I'm having so much fun"" at work every five minutes. But I don't complain either. I staffed myself on so many projects over the summer, that they actually took me off some because they thought I was working too much, even though I was handling them all just fine. They even said my work product was stellar. Everyone I worked with on a daily basis was surprised.

After I didn't get the offer I started freaking out, because of the amount of debt I have and the fact that I didn't have a job. The stress of it put a lot of strain on my relationship, as over the summer my girlfriend moved to be with me (we lived together before). However she couldn't handle the city, and all of the stress of these things culminated in her cheating on me. A girl that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. And we were living together, so I had to watch her for a while get ready to go hang out with the guy she cheated on me with before I finally got her the fuck out. She moved back to where we're from with him.

Here I am seven months later and I don't have a job lined up for graduating. I'm graduating mid-May, but my classes end before that. I was invited to a recruiting cocktail event last week, but didn't get an interview offer. I have a phone call with a recruiter at a company this Wednesday, but I feel so defeated I'm worried it's coming through in my interactions. I've had a few opportunities that I was rejected from since last September, straight away just because I didn't have an offer from my summer employer.

I feel like damaged goods. I'm concerned that I'll graduate and won't be able to find a job in my field. I don't want to have to take just any old job, as that will affect my prospects for getting a job in my actual field. It just won't look right on my resume and the industry is very competitive.

I'm stressed with projects and homework due. I have had zero time to process the breakup in any healthy way. I'm still living in the apartment we lived in together because nobody will rent it. My finances are pretty jacked. I'm having trouble sleeping at night. I feel a constant tightness in my stomach. I just can't calm down. I can't enjoy anything. I'm getting more withdrawn from social events and people, and when I go I just don't feel like interacting. Talking to my friends and family isn't really doing anything. They try to offer solutions like to look at jobs back where I'm from but that just feels defeatist, and doesn't help deal with how I'm feeling.

I just keep getting worse and I don't know how to turn it around. I feel like I'll never have a good job because not getting an offer was a black mark that everyone considers a deal breaker, even though it was mostly just headcount issues and I have senior people there that will vouch for me. I just don't know how to turn around how I'm feeling, I feel like I'm going into a downward spiral. Nothing in my life seems to be mine anymore, I feel like I'm living in an alternate reality or something. All my stuff is in boxes, too, because I need to be ready to move if someone takes our apartment.

I'm just destroyed. I have no idea what to do. IDK where to post this, or if this is the right subreddit. I know practically the way out - apply to jobs, even if it's not directly what I want to do. I know that. I don't need to hear it. That doesn't help. I'm doing that already and it's not helping. What do I do?

And to top it all off all my classmates are going out having fun and traveling and enjoying life. I don't do anything because I don't want to spend too much money. I'm basically a loner at this point."
64pj5o,4,2017-04-11,NC For Almost a Year But Still Guilty,HistoryGal86,BPDlovedones,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/64pj5o/nc_for_almost_a_year_but_still_guilty/,"Hi everyone. I've been reading your posts for a while now, and I'm so grateful to all of you for sharing your experiences. It's been so cathartic and helpful to read your posts and realize that I'm not the only one going through this pain. 

About a year ago, I ended a friendship with a woman who has almost all the hallmarks of a pwBPD. She has always had problems dealing with her anger, and I think she feels pretty powerless in her life, so to a certain extent she saw me as one of the only things she had control over in her life. She claims that she ""doesn't believe"" in therapists, and refuses to see one, even though family members have suggested she seek some sort of counseling. I struggle with depression and have had trouble creating and maintaining healthy boundaries in my relationships. I'm a people pleaser, and I want people to like me, although I've been working on these personal issues for a while now. (I was raised in a fairly controlling/religious household and my mother has some narcissistic tendencies, so you might say I was the perfect target for my friend)

Anyway, she had the tendency to blow up at me when she's particularly upset about another area in her life, or if I'm doing something she doesn't want me to do. One time, for example, I went to visit some other friends out of state and I told her I might not be around as much to answer texts or whatever that week, because I was traveling. This must have pressed several buttons because she exploded in anger and berated me for hours about how terrible a person I was and how I was so inconsiderate to tell her that I was traveling when no one comes to see her, etc, etc, etc. Another time, she didn't think I was being sympathetic enough to her, so she spent the entire evening telling me all of my flaws. Apparently she was angry at me that I made her a Christmas present instead of buying her something at a store, so she spent a lot of time telling me how unacceptable my gift was, and how much better she was because she spent money on me. At the time I was basically working a glorified internship and had to live at home with my parents because I couldn't even afford monthly rent, all of which she knew. After that last argument, I tried to detach, because of how horrible she made me feel about myself. I had (and continue to have) self esteem issues, and I spent a lot of time questioning all of my relationships, because of what she said. In time, she apologized for her actions, said she didn't mean anything she said, and then accused me of being manipulative, because she had apologized and I still didn't want to be around her. That accusation broke down my willpower, and I let her back into my life. (I know, I know, big mistake)

So fast forward to the beginning of last year. In the intervening time, she would blow up at me from time to time, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle, and I took her behavior in stride. But something changed around New Year's, and she started becoming emotionally abusive again. She would begin a conversation by being really passive aggressive, trying to trap me into saying something that would start a fight. And when that didn't always work, she would just plow ahead into a fight anyway. She always claimed she put everything into our friendship, which I did nothing, that she was so much more giving than I was and so on, basically implying I was a terrible friend. I kept on asking her what I could do to improve, what she wanted from me, what she needed from me to make her happy (people pleaser, remember?), and she never had an answer for me. I think she needed attention, and the only way she could think of to get it was to fight. 

After four months of basically arguing with her every other week, I had to let go. I was losing sleep, thinking about our arguments and I knew this relationship wasn't healthy for either of us. So I told her that I had to leave the friendship, that I couldn't handle her behavior and that the constant fighting had been deeply emotionally trying for me. She had basically been emotionally abusing me for a long while now, trying to control me, and punishing me whenever I didn't act how she wanted me to. At one point she even told me that I made her treat me the way she did, because I wasn't like her other friends. I didn't really realize it was emotional abuse at the time, which is part of the reason I stayed as long as I did. 

It's been almost a year since I went NC, and since then she's basically been trashing me to everyone she knows, including writing vitriolic screeds about me on her blog on about a weekly basis. In one breath, she accuses me of being toxic, of being a horrible person who just ignores her sincere apologies, of playing the victim, even though she's the one who can't stop talking about how she believes she's been mistreated. But in the next breath she calls me her best friend and claims she doesn't have any friends and doesn't deserve good friends. I'm torn, because I resent her character assassination, but it's also almost funny how myopic she is, and how everything she accuses me of being is exactly who she is. (Pretty standard pwBPD behaviour)

And I guess I also feel guilty about how things ended. I know I wasn't as diplomatic as I could have been, and I let my pain get the best of me at times. Sometimes I wonder if she isn't right, if I am a really horrible, toxic person. She's the only friend who's ever treated me this way, but I also wonder if I deserved exactly what I got and if I continue to deserve the things she's saying about me to anyone who will listen. Sometimes this seems so petty, and I know I'm happier not being at her beck and call, but the guilt still creeps in and this whole situation still really hurts. I second and third guess myself, and sometimes I even wonder if I'M the one with the personality disorder, not her. 

TL;DR - I ended a friendship and went NC with a pwBPD who  refuses to even consider treatment but I still feel guilty about ending the friendship. Even though her behaviour seems abusive, I still doubt that it was - maybe I'm just telling myself she's abusive to assuage my guilt? I know I hurt her by leaving and I feel awful that I caused that pain. "
64qgta,88,2017-04-11,Grandmother being a bitch to my fiancée and her parents,FuckThisFatCunt,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/64qgta/grandmother_being_a_bitch_to_my_fiancée_and_her/,"Alright, first time even I'm actually posting a story like that, bear with me. Also, I'm from Poland, so deal with the currency :)

Backstory: I am 24 and so is my fiancée. My fiancée's family has a very rough living situation. They all live in a same house, with 2 separate apartments. Upstairs apartment is where my future parents in law (FPIL - great people) live, while downstairs is where my fiancée's grandparents (80yo), 2 sisters of my FMIL with their kids live. First sister has 3 sons (18, 20 and 27 with the oldest being mentally delayed) and second sister has 1 daughter (18) What is more, the sister with sons is an alcoholic and she enjoys the booze with the oldest son (yes, the handicapped one). Grandparents of my future spouse are old and, while being very sweet people, I think dementia is coming and they need a lot of care.

To sum up, only actual adults capable of living a life and being a member of society in this family are my FPIL, taking care of every person living downstairs - in total 8 people.

When me and my fiancée got serious, we moved to a flat (which is 100% mine, but very small, 27sqm), renovated it with my family's money and lived there for a year. I was very clear during all this time that I do not consider money to be a problem (as an interpersonal issue, not the amount - while my family lives a good life, we aren't wealthy). Even though we're 3 years into the relationship, all our finances are done together as I'm the only person earning money as a software engineer, while my fiancée is still studying law. I don't want her to take up a job as a waitress and instead encourage her to take up unpaid internships and take up additional courses. I always make sure that she doesn't feel like she's living on my dime, and she takes up a majority of house chores. She has as much access to the money as I do, and we're very equal.

Now, to the meat of the story.

My fiancée's family got suddenly a relatively big inheritance. Me and my FPIL are close, so we together decided on best ideas to use this money. We settled that in order to get the best use of it, we will renovate the downstairs apartment (ridden with actual bugs, high humidity and fungi), move one of the sisters with the daughter into my little flat (and transfer ownership to my MIL) and buy a bigger flat for me and my fiancée (50% each). Financially, the small flat is worth 80k - 120k PLN, the bigger one we chose for ourselves is 180k PLN (57sqm). With the amount of inheritance, we weren't sure that we will be able to renovate the bigger flat and the downstairs apartment, but I had a little sum saved up and my parents were willing to help as much as they could.

So, this all basically sounds like a great sweet story of people helping each other out, bettering everyone's living conditions and getting through thick and thin together, right? Here's when my grandmother came in.

Me and my family have a tradition that on every Sunday we meet for a dinner, catch up and shoot shit (Me, my brother(34), my grandparents, my father's sister and my parents). I always liked that tradition, as I really loved those people. When we all decided on what to do with the money, etc. etc., we informed everyone on what's happening with me and my fiancée. With a small crutch, that we aren't saying anything about living conditions of my FPIL and this side of the story, as both my FPIL and my future spouse are understandably ashamed of it and for a good reason - they know that people would judge them for it.

While telling them about it, my grandmother interjected with ""I don't think it's a fair deal"".

Now, I knew what she meant by that - that I am getting poorer (because 50% of 180k is 90k and the small flat was obviously worth 120k) but I asked her to elaborate.

I don't remember the exact words in this discussion, but it's basically what I've said above. I was absolutely fuming, but I didn't shout or anything like that, but I was visibly agitated.  
After the heated discussion ended, I asked if anyone feels the same way. Noone did. Meanwhile the grandmother took my fiancée for a walk telling her that it's not about her, and she hopes that it doesnt change anything about them (before that, I never knew that my grandmother is a bitch like that, and fiancée even addressed her the same way I did, like you would your own grandmother).  
My fiancée is very non-confrontational, so she didn't really say anything bad to her, plus we don't like taking radical steps without consulting each other first.

A few days after this situation, after I cooled off, I decided to swing by my grandmother's flat and discuss what the fuck was that about. Turns out, she considers my FPIL (which are fucking saints for dealing with the whole downstairs family for the sake of the kids and my fiancée's grandparents) ""sheep in wolf's clothing"", that she just couldn't bear listening to me saying that FPIL will maybe help us if they manage to get enough money. She also said that instead of renovating their own apartment, they should just do the renovation in our flat first and then think about themselves, otherwise what kind of parents are they, when they don't want what's best for their only daughter?

My grandmother didn't know about the living situation there, so I still tried to give her the benefit of the doubt. I tried to nudge her in the right direction, saying that ""What if they can't prioritise helping us since they need to help my fiancée's grandparents first? What if those grandparents live with bugs or have a leaky roof over their heads?"". Well it didn't matter to her and she kept making excuses. I got angry, shouted at her that she behaves as if she was stupid (which now I truly believe), and I expect an apology no to me, but to FMIL and fiancée at the very least. She said that if she did it, they would laugh at her for apologising. I replied that what she's saying indicated she's an awful person, and told her I don't really want to contact her anymore until she apologises. And I didn't.

This was about 6 months ago? But now I had a tonsillectomy and had very serious complications - I almost died. It's not a big deal to me anymore and it needs to be laughed at (otherwise you just get sulky and shit). But after this situation she called my mother and later me, and we both had the exact same conversation with her:

FatCunt(FC): I didn't know about the operation! Noone told me!  
Me/My mother: Well you didn't ask. You're not asking for half a year now.  
FC: Was I supposed to ask ""Is he getting his tonsils removed? How? I didn't know!  
Me/My mother: You could always ask how is he doing. And you didn't.  
FC: I didn't know!

Now, I'm back at work and have nothing to do really, so I'm venting. First, she tries to conflict me/my fiancée or mine and her family. She fails at it. She doesn't want to apologise. Then, she blames ME for not contacting her and for the fact, that she didnt even ask at least my mother how am I doing. (She's supposed to do all this arguing because she loves me and doesn't want me to be unhappy).

While I don't really want to contact her ever again, my mother, while a great human being, really loves the FatCunt - it's her mother. And me and FatCunt's arguing really break my mother's heart. So I can't really go full NC because there are family occasions where we meet (and she always asks my fiancée - ""Are you still offended? Why?"" on the side when noone hears), I really, really want her to die. I thought about it, I cooled off, I fucking hate that bitch. If she dies tomorrow it's too late, she already wasted more oxygen than she's worth. Instead of traditionally throwing a fistful of dirt on her graves I will pick up dogshit and throw it on the coffin, at least the grave then will have something valuable. Little lying fat piece of human cunt.

So, yeah, I'm venting. I kind of know what to do, but I really don't want to make my mother sad, she's wonderful. So I'm fuming silently whenever my mind wanders off to this whole situation. 

PS. I apologise for language errors (not a native) or storytelling quality (first time ever I do this) or formatting errors (will fix them as I spot them)."
64qzyk,1,2017-04-11,Anxiety over temporarily moving?,Favre99,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/64qzyk/anxiety_over_temporarily_moving/,"So I had applied for a summer internship back in January that's across the country from me. I was mostly excited about it, then; it's a good opportunity and I would be staying with family that's living there. I was supposed to hear back in February whether I had gotten it, so when it was near the end of March and I hadn't have gotten a response, I assumed I wouldn't be going and planned on staying home for the summer.

Well, yesterday, I found out I was offered an internship there. However, instead of feeling excited, I got the worst anxiety I felt in my life. It almost instantly gave me a panic attack, and I had another one when I woke up this morning over it; right now, I'm still very anxious. I honestly don't know why I'm feeling like shit now when I was excited about this not long ago. It might be because this offer is late notice and what I was hoping to do this summer is basically ruined by this, but I'm honestly not sure.

Basically, I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to do. One way or another, I'm definitely convinced to go see a therapist full-time now (only went temporarily before). However, I don't know whether I should accept this internship and move away for the summer or whether I should decline it and stay home. Also, I'm worried about what my dad will think, since he was the one who helped connect me to this internship. Any kind of advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!"
64rfcz,6,2017-04-11,"Having trouble finding a place to live because of my job, it's really bumming me out",laurengore,Strippers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strippers/comments/64rfcz/having_trouble_finding_a_place_to_live_because_of/,"Hey r/strippers,

Sorry for the wall of text but I am in a black hole of despair. I just found out I have until the end of the month to leave what had been an ideal living situation and find a new place to live (through no fault of my own--I always paid my bills on time and pulled my weight around the house; my roommate just up and decided he had no financial incentive to have someone to split the bills with and now he wants to live alone). In the past I have had no trouble finding an informal living situation with friends who know me and know what I do for a living and therefore no need to jump through hoops with a potentially judgemental landlord, but this time I haven't been so lucky and I'm having to go the craigslist route.

Two of my good friends live in a big house with a bunch of people and had a room available; they vouched for me and everyone was fine with me moving in except one guy: this conservative Catholic guy we'll call 'Max,' who rejected me solely because of what I do for a living before he had even met me based on assumptions that I was a drug-addled, unstable mess of a person. They tried to fight his decision to no avail. They assured me that this guy was notoriously shitty to everyone so I shrugged my shoulders and moved on.

Yesterday I went to go see a room in an apartment with two older gay male roommates. I was upfront about my source of income to the one roommate whom I met when I went to go see the room, and he brushed it off and said it was no big deal as long as I was clean and considerate and paid my rent on time.  I texted him later that evening to tell him I was sure I wanted the apartment only to hear back that the roommate that I hadn't met wasn't okay with my job and that I couldn't live there. Cue major disappointment.

It makes me so angry because stripping certainly isn't all I do--I'm using stripping to support myself through an unpaid internship working to help resettle newly arrived refugees, personal creative projects (I draw dumb comics and illustrations), additional volunteer work at the same organization as my internship, and I plan on going to our local community college in the fall to become an EMT. I have a bachelor's degree in English and sociology. I don't do drugs and I barely drink even socially. In my spare time I keep it pretty low-key--I'm mostly sitting quietly in my room reading, drawing, or watching movies. I'd like to think I'm considerate and super easy to get along with as other people have told me as much. I try to sell myself on all these things but people just can't seem to get past how I make my money, even if the high rate of pay means I'll always be able to cover my bills. This totally sucks and I'm so nervous about meeting other potential roommates only to get rejected again. 

How have the rest of you navigated finding roommates while being honest about what you do? I really don't want to have to lie, but at the same time I want a nice place to live and I need it soon. Getting a 'respectable job' for the short term would mean giving up my internship and volunteer work, and it would make it much harder for me to attend school in the fall. My life had been on such a good trajectory (mostly thanks to stripping, given the money and free time) and I feel like everything I've worked for is being yanked out from underneath me. Any advice (or at least commiseration) is welcome. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: Just put a deposit down on a room in a house with a very sweet male stripper/gogo dancer I happened upon on craigslist. We've already decided where we're gonna put the pole. If you're in my situation, don't give up hope--the right person in the right situation will come along!

Some people call him Muhammad kidney, or Muhammed microloan or Muhammed sewing machine for the sewing machines he would endebt people with, to force them into slave labor, and eventually force them into giving up their organs.  So.  I don't know the [answer to that]  But I do know she was involved with these Bangladesh *export zones*, enterprise zones to create new businesses for Bangladesh.  I don't know if that's her mother, which would be understandable, as she is the minister of cultural affairs, or if that's the daughter.  They might not even be related. Who knows.
  * She is also on the board of Biman Airlines which is the national airlines of Bangladesh
  * The MD also writes extensively about hydrological disasters--floods--monitors it using space technology; another article she wrote on monitoring tornadoes with space technology
  * {{ WorkingTheory Tangent: google reddit BP oil spill RRR }}
  * Muhammad Shah -- Blue Sky Iridium Phones recap
  * Abdul Hasnat and Muhammed Shah overlap in terms of activity in Sugarland, Texas
  * Mohamed Shah running that Dyncorp police force also felt it necessary to get involved in Innovative Medical Physics LLC, Las Vegas, Nevada LLC, which is training folks from PK to the US to work on MRI; cancer and MRI
  * I looked for National Science Foundation Grants for medical physics and found that Weinberg Medical Physics was the recipient
  * I would like to know if Suraiya Begum MD being at the Hawkshead Drive location in Lorton VA  {{ with the Awans }}, you would see visitors coming and going--has she ever met Mohammad Hunzla who is an expert in global information grid who worked at Lightbridge Communication, the same Lightbridge Communications where Imran Awan worked at?
  * Do they know where DISA is in springfield VA, have they ever been there
  * For a doctor of gynecology to be involved in this kind of {{ geospatial / intelligence }} imaging is surprising to me
  * Adeel Rice Mills - Border of Punjab/India Kashmir, LET; TEVTA state support
  * This is a state supported rice company from those export regions.
  * They are receiving government funds for this.  So what is the relationship between them shipping rice to that Springfield location that seems to be a bunch of PO boxes.  Strange set of circumstances
  * Suriaya Begum is an expert in the modern space satellite imagery--does she have any knowledge of these cubesats, the nanosatellites? Her company is called ""nanoset"", does she know anything about ""nanosats""; is she familiar with PALANTIR at all?
  * Has Begum met any of the 31 different democrats--the employers of her roomates/biz partners?  Is she aware of any of burglaries and that they were under probe for theft of equipment fromthe house of reps?  Does she know Tahir Javed?  Has she ever talked to him about any of his business dealings?
  * If McCabe released this info we wouldn't have to pry it {{ from everyone involved }}

  * People have asked to make a Colombo edition after part 1, just wanna ask you one more thing
  * Everyone says, 'if New Dawn corporation called 2001, why is it not incorporated in 2011'?
  * If you are right George and you've been saying that HIllary hads been importing rice with Tahir Javed since 1999, you should have that corporation started in 2001
  * I will point you to Nanoset Technologies starting in 2001, and I'll also point you to the fact that HRC had a very strong relationship with NATO since 2001 being a Senator on the Senate Arms Foreign Relations Committee along with McCain and Graham in determining what NATO does with it's planes and satellites.
  * The four rice orders: interesting path if you drill down into the orders.  They come from PK but instead of going directly through a US Port, they go through Belgium, then from Belgium to Maryland; interestingly enough they clear customs in EU; and it's going to turn out to be a NATO customs.  They don't even clear regular customs.  You would need a friend in NATO who had both control of air and satellite: satellite to manage your ratline and air to transport [along] your ratline.
  * Let's look at NATO.  Remember General Bouchard, the guy who led the air invasion of Libya 2011?  Current CEO of Lockheed?  Good friend of Comeys? Funnelled R&amp;D to Subcontractors for Lockheed for the F35.  Remember Valerie Plame, remember Chendalon--died recently--treasurer of expenditures near Belgium, near SHAPE which is the EU HQ for NATO command center?
  * Remember Gladio B? and what I say is C now which Gulen running in the US.  Gulen is Gladio B.  Gulen ran Gladio B and now he's running C.
  * **And Chandelon knew about both**
  * It's going to be Gen Bouchard that gave HRC access to the NATO satellites and the C130s in the NATO force.
  * You're going to find him also stopping near Bosnia, NATO bases along the way coming back from NATO missions
  * Here is Gen Bouchard at a high tech conference.  The same high tech conference that Dir. Comey was involved with: Bridgewater, several years after *he* was CEO of Lockheed.  It's all going to come back together.
  * Carl Bildt doing the famous Albanian email toppling different governments in Europe for NATO

  * With the sound of bells in the background, George approaches the Tomb of Yale
  * The Center of the History of the CIA, begins here, the tomb the famous Skull and Bones {{ 322 }}
  * {{ Yaaarr so begins the Pirate Party }}
  * Does it begin here?  Yale may have been named after an agent of the British East Indian Trading Company
  * I think most of the money that paid for Yale came from the opium trade.  I believe the opium trade was...
  * George Bush used to say they'd buy a tea chest in Bangladesh or E. India for 2 dollars a tea chest and sell it for 10 in China.  It's amazing how much money you can make on 8% markup {{ he misspoke, meant 8 dollars markup or 500% }}.
  * {{ I think George is saying they take Indian Opium and put it in the tea chest because China never needed India's inferior assam tea when it had its own jin xuan winter sprout wulong (lastfrost milk oolong, the best there is) }}
  * That's number 43 that said that ?
  * I don't know if Harvard started out Unitarian.  John Wintrop sitting on a hill, America is a rebirth: another chance for Europe
  * And maybe Yale was a stopgap;
  * Maybe Yale was to try to put a hierarchical stop to that by giving away half of Massachussets to make CT and make Yale.
  * Maybe it was a move by the crown to end the expansion of this new America, this enlightenment, these coffee shops, Francis Bacon and the Scientific Method and remind everyone that they were still under the thumb of the crown perhaps?  Who knows?
  * In part four you get my philosophical waxings, on 1,2,3 it's typically more reporting
  * Look at Western Reserve which became Case Western Reserve which became Case Western for surgeries, for organ donations.  That was started...it came from Yale
  * So...{{{ Tomb view fade to black }}

  * [At the Wellwood cemetary in Long Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellwood_Cemetery) you may know the cemetary from it's fame: of the people who are buried here.
  {{ Famous Jewish people buried there. }}
    * [Julius and Ethel Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg) were buried here
  *  Some of the Jews in the audience remember the famous scene with George Seagal in the graveyard explaining to the people who died in the holocaust what had happened since the holocaust.  He was trying to summarize in a movie called **""Bye Bye Braverman""** what had happened between the Holocaust and the Moon landing^^[[]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIqZAEYN1gs).  Trying to somehow relate back to that generation
  * The Rosenbergs if you're not familiar with that story were both executed, electrocuted at Sing Sing for giving a small part of the secrets of the atomic bomb to the Russians, through a secret agent, a double agent.
  * {{ Shut up assplane!}}
  * They served their sentence {{ executed }} in terms of capitol punishment for giving secrets of the US to our enemies.
  * ***The same types of treasons are being carried out with the Awan brothers.***
  * We have five, now 6 Awan brothers and the 2 wives.  We have this profusion of evidence.
  * ***I'm not here to celebrate or to say that the Rosenbergs didn't receive just punishment, but what I AM here to say is the people who are doing those same crimes today that have our most sensitive hacking tools from the CIA that are hacking into cellphone systems--we just found out from Wikileaks {{about}} PK mobile networks that are hacking into our US VA networks, that are hacking into individual private hospital systems like Spectrum Health, other government installations.  Those are every bit as much an offense and a treason on the US as the Rosenbergs that are buried here.  Thank you***

* [[Day 168.2 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 2 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5zvyJ6HSpM)
  * Long Island Sound near Jones Beach
  * I talked in previous episodes about the [Long Island Serial Killar (LISK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island_serial_killer) and visited some of the sites where they found the bodies.
  * [Websleuths](http://www.websleuths.com/forums/forum.php)
  * Shannon Gilbert, she has a driver take her to a John's house {{prostitute}}, at midnight from nyc, running from house to house at 5am, makes all these 911 calls, 23 minutes long; but for some reason they can't geolocate her.  They start looking for her body, and they find 5-6 bodies in burlap sacks
  * I've long contended that the folks involved were in the rice business, and those were Basmati burlap sacks.
  * There's a large middle eastern population here, and I do believe those people were involved in the murders and that the sacks were basmati rice sacks
  * For some reason the Suffolk County Police Dept did not want to talk about where those burlap sacks were from.  All the bodies were found in those sacks--that's the common linking element
  * If somebody worked at a Basmati rice factory--and I won't say exactly which one I believe it is--I'll just say I believe the port-of-entry was Montreal; why wouldn't they release that fact?  Why wouldn't they release the picture of the basmati rice sack used in a crime? Why withhold that information?
  * That actually is the smoking gun where the LISK works, and we're talking about at least 10 ppl--young women murdered, that were in the escort business for the most part, but I believe some were just at parties with drugs, very upscale great gadsby type parties, but some were doing individual calls like Shannon Gilbert was.
  * But the Suffolk police dept was involved and acting as a pimp for national political figures, and that members of federal law enforcement were using the Suffolk county Police Dept as a sort of pimping service.
  * A lot has come out from the Shannon Gilbert case.  I believe the mother was murdered.  A lot of odd situations regarding the case
  * There are a lot of questions about how the police has proceeded and there is stonewalling in this case.
  * Records of the FBI need to be released in this case, and it seems to be yet-another-one-of-those-cases where things were shut down from the top and need to be explained.

* [[Day 168.3 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 3 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVdBMKAFLc8)  **The Hell is Other People Edition**
  * Why is George so obsessed with Basmati Rice?
  * Well the Ratline goes like this: it comes in to the port of Montreal,
  * **The Hells Angels at Trois Riviere manage that whole thing an Abandoned Army Base with the name of** ***HOCHELAGA***
  * it's coming in on UN containers, maybe Humanitarian aid containers
  * Hells angels troix riviere runs the ratline across Canada
  * I believe the Quebec killings were done byt eh Canadian Hells Angels at the Mosque in January of this year.  I think the kid was just a patsy
  * I've worked on this a long time actually
  * I knew people that were on the other side of the ratline on the Hell's Angels side of the Ratline in NYC
  * If you see the movie ""Coyote Ugly"" it's about these kids moving to NY to follow their dreams and they see this bar ""coyote ugly""--that is actually the base of Hells Angels in NY.  The only part they left out of the movie was that that was the Hells Angels' base of operations.
  * That is kind of like the enforcer level. There are other groups that work with the FBI that are volunteers that help to do surveillance, that have no idea of this underworld that the Hells Angels get involved in.
  * But the riceline goes down to NYC, port of New York and also over land routes through Canada
  * The connection to LISK case, is those women are provided/targetted at the Coyote Ugly bar.  There's a limo service (when I looked at it back in 2003) before the bodies were discovered at Gilgo bay.  There was some kind of Turkish limo service--the girls were promised modeling opportunities, fashion week, etc.  There were these massive parties where they'd rent out these huge mansions for a week. They would totally destroy the place.  The first couple of days my roommate was a server at many of these things.  Jeffery Epstein were some of them.  Massive parities, high end, high scale first two days. Then the next few days would be the gladio units, these people who are kind of involved in--they think they're doing the right thing, they're working for the FBI, surveillance specialist I and II, and there are these women there from NY that are drugged and basically being gang-raped, and at the last 3 days--these are rumors now and I'm on working theory at this point--that's what the ritual, the 'being accepted into the gang' where women are tortured.  For days, not just a few hours, but for days.
  * When you get the {{ duct }} tape over the mouth they would hyperventilate with just being able to breathe through their nose, they'd drill a hole through their hyoid {{ under the jaw }}.
  * Shannon Gilbert I believe had a hole drilled through her [hyoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone); It's not a good way to die.
  * She was being gang raped and tried to get away.
  * The police doctor was named Hacket {{ of course }} He was the one drilling the holes in the hyoids.  He's one of the people involved.
  * James Burke being the Police Chief is one of the people involved.  But this is way more than that.  This was women being provided for parties for oil executives coming into the city of NY, at the CFR, they were the CCC contractors, the Petrofacs of the world.  I do believe that Wabi Raman who is the SOHR, his father was at many of these gangrape parties and I also believe Rahman was also part of it.  I dont' know about the Petrofac CEO.
  * It's like that Eyes Wide Shut thing and you can't believe it's true, and there's just no human who would think that kind of cruelty is possible.  But again if you plant a revenge motive in someone and say somehow this person was connected to a bad family or they did something wrong.  It doesn't have to be true--humans will act on a revenge motive.
  * I've had about 10 Hells Angels buzz me on the way here and about 10 of McCabe's well-meaning bike club guys buzz me and miss me by 1 foot so I thought, well I better get this out and not sit on this any longer.

  * PA, at the Delaware River looking at the USS New Jersey, it saw a little action in WW2
  * These are the ships that take the rice
  * The Scrapings of the opium poppy is the purest opium
  * But I believe in the 1920s they were able to refine morphine from the stalk and bulb of the poppy {{ [poppy straw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_straw) }} I believe those cuttings are what are being transported in the rice basmati bags
  * I believe the New Dawn 2001 corporation that the Awans created was all about the mango express. About getting that lucrative business that India had a lock on with hillary, the Indian mangos, the Mexico mangos that Mexico had a deal on with Carlos Slim.  Very high profit 18 dollar box of mangos being worth $28,000.  If you can build a network of stores like McDonalds or Starbucks on five dollar meals or coffees, imagine what you can do on a 28k dollar box of 6 mangos.
  * I believe that was the New Dawn, the Mango mission, the mango diplomacy--that's what changed everything
  * People ask, well why are you talking about the rice then?  About rice coming into these major ports?
  * Their job before they got that mango express, the Awans' job was managing the ratlines; managing the logistics; the minute-to-minute logistics with those Iridium phones and transponders.
  * The real big change with the Awans is when they moved to this direct flight from both Pakistan and Bangladesh, direct to major US airports, but primarily Chicago Ohare
  * That's it for today, tomorrow WASHINGTON DC

  * Went by Hawkshead Drive tonight and had a good long interview with the current residents
  * It's a military family--both Husband and wife are or have been in military service
  * They were renting directly the 9667 house directly by Imran Awan--he *said* his name was Alex.
  * He rented the property to the family through a military site which I think is a little bit disingenuous
  * All the transactions were through his wife Hina {{ Alvi }}.
  * I have his number. I think I'll work through Lease Stranahan or Luke Rosiak to follow up on the story to make sure it gets mainstream coverage
  * The individual I spoke with is a very patriotic individual.  His main concern was that--politics aside--the best thing for the US occurred {{ Syria }}, and if there was an intelligence breach at the highest levels of our government that that needs to be rooted out.
  * He also said that there was government equipment at the home that Imran Awan left at the home.  Blackberries, as well as four or five laptops as well as some other misc equipment.
  * They contacted the FBI.  They contacted the Capitol Police.  There is an ongoing investigation.
  * But I thought everyone should know that Imran used false pretenses, a false name to rent the house, and he may still be in the US.  As a matter of fact, he may still be in VA.  He may still be within a few miles of me, right here in Lorton VA.

  * Compared notes with Luke Rosiak of DailyCaller thanks to those who set that up
  * Right now Faye Turnbull is trying to help me talk to the DC reporter for RT.com.  Going to meet them.
  * Awans used many locations either for safe houses or for bringing people in--foreign nationals from PK--to work in the DC area.
  * I went to 2 of those locations yesterday I'll go over those right now.
  * First was where the stepmother was held and imprisoned.  She's not there anymore. There are renters there now, wasn't able to get any information
  * The non-Awan person who also worked for Congress was not there.  There was a rumor that he was living in the basement.
  * Police report was filed on Jan 5th of this year
  * But there's also a complaint that the mother signed, that we're trying to get from the police dept--a detailed complaint about all the things that actually occurred.  Want to get some quotes from that, and also publish her picture, publish the picture of the person who is supporting her.  To let everyone know that this woman's husband died and she was cheated out of her inheritance by her stepsons.
  * We don't know if there were weapons used but we know there were listening devices planted around the house
  * Hawkshead five bedroom home.  Was able to talk to the owner.  It's a military family but don't want to say anything more about their identities.
  * Patriotic guy who wants to do the right thing.
  * He dealt directly with Imran in doing the lease but Imran misrepresented himself--called himself Alex; disingenouus dealings.
  * He believes that Hina's van is still at the end of the street and has moved recently, so he believes that they are still there.  Or that Hina is still there.
  * He did say--coming from a US Marine--that Imran had left blackberries, 4-5 laptops.  He also mentioned an external server but that was not at the home, but he did say the FBI made an investigation there, and had made a call there, as well as the Capitol Police, as well as another intelligence agency with the US Armed forces which I won't name.
  * Why the reporting on this has *not* been that the FBI is involved--I don't know
  * **But I believe the FBI and McCabe should announce that they are involved in the investigation because they are covering that up.**
  * Hina Alvi's address and Nataliia Sova address in Annondale; ~~False Church~~ Falls Church location of auto biz
  * Al-Awlaki Mosque in ~~False Church~~ Falls Church where first 2 saudi 9/11 bombers were recruited

  * I believe the Mosques are in a green card biz marrying people off.  I believe Masood was in a failed marriages to get a green card and that's why the car dealer in Richmond was murdered.

  * My Great Grandfather was a Jewish Hardware store owner in Rome, GA he had 11 slaves and his store was confiscated.  He freed his 9 adult slaves and took 2 black kids to war with him.
  * Joe Johnson was here at this battle, but he wasn't with Joe Johnson then. He got captured at Vicksburg and was paroled by Grant
  * Then he joined Joe Johnson at the battle of Lookout Mountain, Kennasaw Mtn and Stone mountain and was shot in the head at the battle of Stone Mountain.
  * Which is good because at those days because most of the body wounds were deadly from infection.  They put a silver plate in his head
  * *Two black kids took him all the way back from Stone Mtn to Rome Ga and he lived.*
  * He couldn't get married to anyone, his store was burned--had but a chimney left
  * Who would marry a Jew with a hole in his head with a burned down store and no assets?
  * Well it was a Cherokee woman.  That's the story of my family.
  * Then he freed the black kids after the war--emancipation proclamation
  * Lincoln said we were baptised in blood forever--born to a new freedom, a new birth of freedom
  * The strange story of where I was this morning with Mahmood, the registered agent of the Awan brothers, sends two MS13 gang members to murder a Muslim car dealer, a prominent member of the community.

**Jon Stewart**

I don't remember the show we did on the tenth at all. We had come back from a two week break, so I would assume I had a pretty good tan going. But it was unremarkable a show as you could possibly imagine. There is no significance other than the fact that we didn't know what was about to happen.

**Ben Karlin** 

I was friends with the guys from the band *There Might Be Giants**, who had done some music for us. On Monday, September 10, they had a record release party for their new album., which was dropping on the eleventh. So, the night of the tenth, I was pretty late at a party down at the Bowry Ballroom. The next thing you know, you're taking a cab home and it's 4:30 in the morning and you just had a steak. That's what happens when you're thirty and you're single. 

I was getting into work at the regular time the next morning. I'd stopped at the Cafe that was right across the street from the studio. The woman working there, a Middle Eastern woman, is listening to the radio, and says, ""A plane just crashed into the World Trade Center."" At the time you're just like, ""Oh, shit, that's really weird"" 

**Jon Stewart**

We were living on West Eleventh Street. I heard the first plane hit while in bed. It felt like a bomb. It rattled the place pretty good. I flipped on the TV.

**Lewis Black**

I woke up with a girl I was seeing. And I was on my way to the shrink. I lived on Forty-Second, the very west end, on Twelfth Avenue, the building on the left. After years I'd been finally able to get a nice apartment. I had a view to the south of lower Manhattan. We'd turned on the TV and the girl I was with said, ""Oh my god, look at the Twin Towers."" And one of them was smoking. Then the second tower was hit, and it was like I had a stroke.

I didn't go see my shrink.

**Chris Regan** 

I lived two blocks from the studio, I didn't have to work until 9:30, so I was getting ready at 9:08, and I remember listening to Howard Stern talking about kissing Pam Anderson. And then he announced that a small plane hit the World Trade Center. They talked about that for a second, then they went back to theorizing if Howard could do Pam Anderson or not. And it wasn't until I got into work, where we had a TV monitor, downstairs, where a lot of the PA's [production assistants] sat, that I saw this smoke coming from the World Trade Center. Then we watched a lot of it from Ben's office.

**Ben Karlin**

I'm in my office, writers are slowly gathering. This is 9:30. The morning writers' meeting starts at 9:30. We're watching a kid of locked-off show of smoke coming out of both the towers, on the big screen in my office There was no banner underneath the news before this.

I do remember standing there with Adam Chodikoff, and I think maybe D.J., watching the towers collapse, and I just broke down in tears and started crying hysterically.

**David Javerbaum**

When one of the towers came down, I was with Ben, and Ben started crying. I thought that was very emotionally impressive, because most people were too stunned to access their grief that quickly.

**Rory Albanese**

These dudes were on my train coming out of the World Trade covered in dust. It was a mess. There was something very safe about us all being together at *The Daily Show*.

Jon was there. I believe Jon was there. I'm trying to think. Yeah. I think Jon was in the office that day.

**Jon Stewart**

I did not go to the office. We had helped Tracey's brother, Chris, move into the city the previous weekend. He lived about three blocks from us, so we went to go get Chris. We were out on the street when we saw the tower collapse. That's when just everything started spinning.

**Alison Camillo, from intern to coordinating field producer, 1998-2016**

Jo Honig, who was a field producer then, came in covered with dust. She lived down by Chambers Street and rode her bike to work. She had Fred, her dog, with her, and he was covered in soot. I was sobbing.

**Chris Regan**

Ben announced there weren't going to be any shows, and D.J., my writing partner, said, ""Well, Chris and I can stay and finish up 'We Love Showbiz',"" which was an *Entertainment Tonight* parody. Ad I snapped at D.J., saying ""No fucking way are we going to do that.""

**Hillary Kun, co-executive producer, guest booker, 2001-2016**

I had just moved back from LA and started work the previous week. My first show guest was Tracey Ullman, on September 11. When I got into the office that morning I contacted her publicist, to say, ""Hey, just letting you know, we are cancelling the show for tonight."" And they said, ""Oh, Tracey got out of New York. She started driving cross-country. She's long gone.""

**Chris Regan**

I went to a liquor store that was open early and stocked up. My apartment was the smallest one-bedroom, a fourth floor walk up, and about a dozen and a half people from the show came. 

I had just gotten a DVD of *The Big Lebowski*, and I announced that I wanted to watch something that hearkened back to a gentler war, the 1990 Gulf War. We would stop it every twenty minutes or so and turn on the news to see if anything else had blown up. Yeah, I really spent 9/11 getting drunk, in my apartment, with a lot of my coworkers.

**Jon Stewart**

Can I tell you the craziest thing? Tracey and I were walking that afternoon of 9/11, or it might have been the next day, in just the quiet of it. We didn't really know where we were going, just walking, and we walked by a building and there was a little street mouse, I don't even think it was a rat, a little street mouse. All of a sudden a dude-I guess it was the super in the building, we hadn't seen him-fucking clubbed it right in front of us. I remember us just both bursting into tears, an we just kind of like...I just remember us bursting into tears on a constant basis as everybody was. The smell is the thing that I'll never forget, just that was...

I try not to remember, to be honest with you. I mean, I'm still not good at it, like I still can't particularly talk about certain things, and I just can't do it, you know.

**Rob Riggle, correspondent, 2006-2008**

At the time I was part of the Marine corps reserve unit, MTU 17. The only Marine Corps reserve unit stationed in Manhattan. the next morning, September 12, we went down to Ground Zero and started moving rubble by hand. We didn't know how many people were under the rubble. Twelve hours on, twelve hours off, for six days. It was no longer a search and rescue, it was a search and recovery at that point.

**Ben Karlin**

It was a few days, I think, before we gathered to talk avout how the fuck we were going to move on.

**Jon Stewart**

I'm talking to Ben and Stew, and the writers, just trying to figure it out. ""Do we even have a show? Is there a show to do here, or do we just...do we tap-dance?"" I thought it was going to be a variety show.

**Jim Margolis**

I'd quit a job at *60 Minutes* to work at *The Daily Show*, and I couldn't have been there more than ten days before 9/11 happened. there was actually a question whether the format should be changed to be a parody of a morning show, and I thought, ""What the fuck have I done?""

**Steve Carell**

I remember Stephen and I sitting with Jon those days after, trying to figure out what to do, what to write, and how to even put on any show. It all just seemed...so irrelevant and small.

**Stew Bailey** 

There was a creative meeting before we went back on air where Stephen Colbert, and Steve Carell, and Jon Madeleine, and some others were all in Madeleine's office and we had looked at the board that we had programmed for what segments were going to be on, before 9/11. Everybody uses those colored cardboard things with the pushpins. It'll be eight thousand years from now and that's how late-night shows will be programmed. Anyway, we looked at the board and we just realized this didn't make any sense to us anymore.

We were all so numb. I remember Stephen Colbert said, ""I am legitimately asking if a pie in the face is still funny. I'm asking because I don't know. He was not joking.

**David Javerbaum**

Our first instinct was, Let's write a bunch of things that are so light and silly. Anything contiguous to the attack, we just can't touch.""

**Chris Regan**

Graydon Carter had gone on about the death of irony and all this other crap. I remember I worked on a piece with Carell, which was a *Crocodile Hunter* parody, where he was in a safari outfit at the desk. We just weren't talking about the big smoking elephant in the room. It was just a terrifying time to write comedy. Not the worst problem to have in New York, but still, it was a very strange time to try to be funny.

**Alison Camillo**

I remember Madeleine said, ""I don't even know if we have a show anymore."" 

**Kira Klang Hopf**

Jon knew we still had a show. He said, ""This is now more important than ever."" On that Thursday, when we came back to work, he came around to everyone's office and talked: ""What should we do?"" He wanted to make sure everyone was on board. He didn't want to go back on air and be a dick.

**Jon Stewart** 

Comedians process our emotions through this peculiar refinery of whatever pins you could come up with that day. You remove that, and it's as though there's a narcotic on the digestive system. You're blocked, it's building up, and you don't know what to do.

I knew that for me, personally, I would have to express..I would have o use the process that I've used to process pain, and discontent, and happiness, and everything else, but in a way that was somewhat anathema to how I would normally approach it. It just had to be direct and I was going to have to do it without my crutches.

It's very hard for me to write without knowing, ""Okay, I'm going to get to perform it now."" I generally can't take myself to a place without knowing what the finish line is. It had to be timed right, because otherwise I will lose my interia. If I don't time it right it'll be there and then it'll be gone, and I'll just fuck it up, I'll ruin it by overwriting it.

That day, September 20, when we were doing out first show after 9/11, was basically me in my office just pacing and jotting stuff down.

**Jen Flanz**

Nobody really knew what Jon was going to say.

**Jon Stewart** 

I wrote the 9/11 monologue on a paper plate. I ate a lot of pizza, so my office had a lot of paper plates in it, from a pizza place. Not the Chinet kind, either. The shitty paper kind.

*On September 20, 2001, Stewart spoke directly into the Camera for nearly nine minutes, tears welling in his eyes, tapping the anchor desk hard with a plastic pen when he needed to pause and compose himself, the studio audience silent except for several brief moments of nervous laughter*

[The 9/11 monologue](http://www.cc.com/video-clips/1q93jy/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-september-11--2001)

**Rory Albenese**

I do remember thinking, ""Fuck, dude, that's pretty heavy for a comedy show."" 

**J.R. Havlan**

Yeah, I wrote that. Every word of it. I had *crying* in parenthesis and everything: ""Really given them the waterworks here, Jon. I think they're going o fall for it.""

I remember being a little surprised just because-the first time you see somebody that you know, who's an adult, crying over something, is a revelation. The one thing I remember is him talking about how the view from his apartment was of the World Trade Center, and now that's gone, he view from his apartment was the Statue of Liberty. And thinking, ""I have to believe you, but that's pretty convenient."" Then thinking, ""Pretty fancy view you got, Mr. Jon Stewart."" And I remember, also, feeling bad that I questioned whether or not that was true.

**Elliott Kalan, from Intern to head writer, 2002-2015**

I remember so well Jon's first show back after September 11 and how much that meant to me at the time. I was a junior at NYU and watched it in my dorm room near Union Square. That episode didn't make anything okay at all, but at least someone was saying the type of thing I wanted the president or the mayor to say.

I remember Jon bringing his dog out at the end, and it being like a really silly thing to do but a really beautiful way to say there's a whole other world of existence that has nothing to do with this political violence.

**Jon Stewart**

I think the end of it was just me holding up our dog, Monkey. An then we all kind of looked at each other like, ""Now what?""

Afterwards I had to walk away from the desk, and I went into the back room and I just bawled. I was just...I was done. It had been an incredibly emotional experience. We all knew people who had been down there and had lost people. It was just the act of getting it out, but it's not like that was the healing, that was just the...it honestly felt like that was, ""Great, I've now vomited it up, but I'm still nauseous, and exhausted."" That first show was not a statement of what we were going to do. It was a necessary draining of an abscess to even become ambulatory."

However, I have no idea which option I should choose, so a little input would be nice. 

I have it down between Duke and UCLA. 

Duke COA: $105k
UCLA COA: $79k

I would like to do a federal clerkship and then work in big law for about 2 years, before escaping to a mid-size firm where I could find some work/life balance. 

I am married and my spouse has an excellent job that he loves in LA. I want to work in LA. I have 5+ years of really good paralegal experience. UCLA's clerkship and big law placement is lower than Duke's, however, I think I could get a good job given my work experience. If I stay in LA, I will have to work hard to graduate at the top of my class, since everyone at UCLA/USC competes for the same jobs. 

The pros of UCLA are that it is affordable, comfortable, and convenient. We have our friends and our life here. UCLA had the best class by far (out of USC, Michigan, Texas, and Duke). I think I could stand out as a UCLA grad and get a clerkship and a good job. I am pretty debt adverse. I would like to buy a home soon. 

Cons of UCLA are a lower rank and higher cost of living. 

Pros of Duke are its statistics and it could set me apart in an LA market. However, I would have to leave my spouse over the summers to get internships in LA and live with my parents. Also, I'm not completely sold on Durham as a good place to live for 3 years. My loans are also $25k more, and part of what makes Duke affordable is participation in a clinic which won't be directly relevant to what I want to do. 

Any thoughts? "

Because of my position, and how hard it is to get a job in the city I currently live without a masters, I've been really broadening my search. 

My boyfriend and I discussed this, and he said I should come first and he doesn't wanna hold me back, but he's scared of what will happen. I try to reassure him but I'm also afraid. I got a phone interview today for a potential job in Texas (we're in the northeast), and I could tell it took him way off guard. I was going to keep it a secret but I figured that was probably worse.

What should I do? I feel like this is the best time to move to a new place, and try new things, but I'm worried about my boyfriend, his feelings, and our relationship. Except I know if I stay where I am now, I'll hate it, and I don't want to end up resenting him.

(PATH is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work for free as ""interns"" for companies) (Opinion piece)",rubblaz,australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/64uqjh/are_the_path_internships_really_voluntary_path_is/,"**What is the PATH ""internships"" program?**

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

It is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work as ""interns"" for companies.

--------

**How long does the ""internship"" last?**

Up to 12 weeks.

--------

**Are those ""interns"" paid any money?**

Those ""interns"" are not paid any money by the companies.

The government keeps paying the ""interns"" the Newstart payment and additionally $100 more per week.

--------

**Are those companies paid any money?**

Yes, those companies are paid $1,000 to employ each ""intern"" even if they don't give them any job after the internship.

This program is like paying money to companies so they employ people for free.

--------

**Are those ""internships"" really voluntary?**

The PATH ""internships"" are referred as ""voluntary"" in official documentation by the government:

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

&gt; PaTH internships are voluntary and can be ended at any time, without penalty.

I have read the proposed legislation in the website of parliament and I think that's not true, let me explain it.

The proposed legislation is here:

http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5734

The ""Explanatory memorandum"" of the bill is here: 

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r5734_ems_d5756521-50de-48bf-aca9-2dd011ab2ff4/upload_pdf/496999.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The text of the bill is here:

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r5734_first-reps/toc_pdf/16140b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The proposed legislation says that the Centrelink payment, while undergoing the PATH ""internship"", can be cancelled ""as a result (whether direct or indirect) of a voluntary act of the person that was not reasonable"" (page 9 of the bill), do you see that the wording is very *vague*? ""not reasonable"" could mean anything, if the ""intern"" refuses to do something that the employer wants then to do that could lead to the payments being cut.

The ""interns"" will be afraid that if they do something that displease the employers then their Centrelink payments will be cancelled and they will need to apply again and wait some weeks before receiving the payment again.

And those ""interns"" will not have any savings, because the Newstart payment is very small, so they will be suffering a lot if it is cut.

Please notice, this is very important, that the companies that will be hiring the ""interns"" won't be respectable companies like IBM or Microsoft, no, those companies will probably be very small companies or subcontractors or recruiters, so those companies will not necessarily have a high level of ethics, which means those companies will probably be more prone to exploiting the ""interns"" noticing that the ""interns"" will be afraid of losing their Centrelink payments.

And, this is also important, the Liberal government will probably extend the system to people of all ages later, not only the young, which will open the door of seeing very old people with disabilities being exploited by those companies and without those problems being shown in the media.

64uqpg,1,2017-04-11,I [20 F] am unsure if I am handling a tough situation with my boyfriend [21 M] and don't know if I should give him a chance or just end it,thisisjustmeposting,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/64uqpg/i_20_f_am_unsure_if_i_am_handling_a_tough/,"Throwaway because my boyfriend has my reddit username. This problem stems from a bunch of incidents but I will try to summarize them and get to the point.

I've been dating my boyfriend for over a year now. We both go to the same university and he is in the grade above me but we are only 3 months apart in age. We've had a great and very close relationship, he even came to visit me for a month while I studied abroad.

However, ever since I got back from studying abroad things have been falling apart. He because very distraught when I was abroad and not talking to him much. I reminded him that he was feeling this while I was on a 2 week solo trip where I didn't have any 4G/cell service, but he still had a bit of a breakdown. I get back and he just can't spend enough time with me.

While I was abroad and just as I got back, he would occasionally ask me if I wanted to move in with him next year. I told him I liked the idea but wasn't sure about it; I still didn't feel settled moving back home and wanted to live with my friends as I reconnected with them. The longer I thought about it, the more these feelings grew.

In general I felt like he was keeping me from my friends. He would tell me that I should hang out with them over him but whenever I mentioned that I was hanging out with someone or doing something with a friend his reaction was like I had let him down, sometimes he would comment ""without me?"" Since I had gotten back I had been with him almost constantly. 

We would switch off sleeping at each other's houses. At first it was nice because I missed him but then it got old. I was never spending time downstairs just hanging out or studying with my friends/roommates, he would constantly ask me to cook food for him which I would just rush up into my room so he could eat it in my bed, and he had zero respect for my room. Every time he spent the night it was disgusting: clothes covering every floor surface, he would just throw his dirty tissues on the ground, spilling coffee and drinks on my white sheets, leaving plates and utensils in or around my bed, not throwing away simple things like ice cream cartons or chip bags... I could go on. On top of this he wouldn't help me put up my shelves or desk, a huge issue I had because I had helped him set up all of the ikea furniture in his room. I became so stressed just having these shelves sitting there and a huge tub of stuff I needed to put away, but only could once the shelves were up.

Needless to say my room was a huge part of why I didn't feel settled. For months I felt like I was still moving in, still being promised that she shelves would go up next week, and still having to clean up one mess after another. Finally I had to decide whether or not to sign the lease and keep my place for next year, or move in with my boyfriend. Even though my rent was going to be increased $200/month I chose to stay at my place. When I tried breaking the news to him, he freaked out. He told me that if we aren't moving forward in our relationship then we are moving backward. He said that we basically live together now so we should live together anyway. He also said that if we lived together now he would stay around another year after he graduates and wait for me to graduate, but if I didn't move in with him now he would just leave right after he graduates. It felt like an ultimatum. I told him how I felt about not spending time with my friends and that I don't feel settled, but he said they were BS arguments to cover up the fact that HE was the issue. 

Don't get me wrong, he was a big part of the issue (messy room) but my main reasons were the fact that I felt insecure about my friendships and wanted to work on them. He told me it was over, but the took it back, etc. We went on spring break (he was on vacation in another state) and several nights he would call me keeping me up until 3 AM rehashing the room argument. I finally told him that if he's going to keep acting this way then YES it is because of him that I don't want to move in. I told hi he made it into a self-fulfilling prophecy by being so mean to me about it. He told me we were over but then the next morning said he didn't mean it.

After spring break things were tense but okay. Then one night he went out drinking with his friends and called me right before I was going to bed asking if we could have sex when he got home. I told him no, that I would be in bed asleep, and he just got angry and hung up. At about 3 AM he stumbles in super drunk and wakes me up wanting to have sex. I told him no and drifted in and out of grogginess. Apparently he had asked me something and being half asleep, I didn't hear him. He became furious and spent the next two hours yelling at me and insulting me and making me cry until he finally fell asleep snoring. The next morning he didn't even apologize, just told me he was drunk and didn't mean any of it. I was so angry and hurt and sad.

About a week after that incident we were sitting down to watch a movie and I had a couple of these candies he bought. He made some snide comment about how he should make me pay for the candies. I was confused because I only had 6 candies. He then explains that he was trying to make a point about this (seemingly insignificant) argument from several weeks ago. I'll preface this with the fact that he is insecure about money; he refuses to get a job and complains about paying for stuff because he's using loan money, and implies that I should pay more because I have a job. Basically, we were making dinner and he bought some groceries, he asked if I could pay half back to him and I said yes. The next day he asked me for a bunch of stuff from the store, the total for that ended up being the same as the amount I was supposed to pay him. I asked if we could call it even and he blew up. He said that I had promised to pay him back so I should follow through on my promise, and that my act of picking those things up from the grocery store for him was just a nice act and therefore he shouldn't have to pay me back. Not wanting to fight I shrugged it off and said I'd pay him back later.

We fought about this again the night of the candy comment. We fought for hours, until 4 AM. I let it all out- that I felt stressed because I couldn't tell him how I feel about our relationship out of fear that he would just get angry at me, that I didn't appreciate him making snide comments and getting angry with me whenever I talked about my housing, that I needed more time with my friends. At 4 AM I told him that I was delirious and had class the next day and needed sleep. He told me that if I went to bed we would be done. I fell asleep.

The next morning we argued again, for such a long time that we both missed our classes. I ended up leaving because I needed to pick my brother up from the metro station since he was visiting me. He told me that if I left in the middle of our ""discussion"" that we were over since I was giving up on our relationship. I tried so hard to tell him otherwise but he was adamant.

Thinking that we were over like he had told me, I tried to enjoy myself with my brother and my friends. It actually felt kind of good to be done. The next day he messaged me begging me to talk to him. In all seriousness I did not have any time to talk, I had class, then I had to go to my internship, then I was meeting family for dinner, then I was going home because we were hosting a party at my house. He told me he was mad that I was avoiding him and I told him that I would talk when I had time. 

When we ended up talking the next day, he told me he regretted everything he said and that he had a lot of time to think and that I was right. He recognized that he had been treating me horribly, that I was trying so hard to be good and nice to him and he was just shrugging me off. One concrete example of this was one night where I didn't spent the night with him and he got angry. I had spent that night painting him a gift for his birthday. On his birthday I even used my own $50 gift card to a fancy restaurant and he got angry at me when I asked if we could split the remaining $50 bill. He told me that he had just realized that the reason I didn't spend the night with him was because I was making his gift, and etc. HE truly did feel bad. We spent hours talking, and for 90% of the conversation I refused to take him back, until the very end. I broke down and said that I would give it more time so I could think it over. What got me was the fact that he was remembering all of these little details that upset me but I never brought it up with him because I didn't want him to get mad. He was finding the things that he didn't even know had upset me and apologizing for them.

So my issue: we are still dating and seeing each other, he knows that we are/will not spend as much time with each other, and that I am still very hesitant. He made dinner with me last night and it was great, except I still feel this strong need to be single and not tied down to him. He had told me that in the long run I'll get tired of being single and wonder what's next, which I do agree with, but I'm not sure if he can really snap out of it so quickly and change for the better. I'm walking this fine line of wanting to believe him and wanting to end it. I've spent more time with my friends these past few days then I have the past few months and it has made me feel incredible, the happiest I have been in a long time. But he has also been so sweet and considerate the past couple days, it is reminding me of the first half of our relationship. I'm so conflicted. All my friends think I should end it but I do want to see what can happen with this ""new"" him.

My question: is drawing this out to see where our relationship goes the right choice? Should I act on my impulse to end it with him while it is still this strong? How do I give him a chance while still keeping a level head about this situation?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Boyfriend has been awful to me the past couple months and breaks up with me claiming that I had been awful to him. After a couple days apart he realized that he was wrong and recognized literally every little thing I had been upset about and apologized to me, promising to be better. I told him I am still unsure of what to do and now we are still together and I still feel an urge to leave him even though he is so much better to me."

(PATH is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work for free as ""interns"" for companies) (Opinion piece)",rubblaz,FreeAustralia,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeAustralia/comments/64uz4z/are_the_path_internships_really_voluntary_path_is/,"**What is the PATH ""internships"" program?**

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

It is the new program that the federal government is commencing to allow young unemployed people to work as ""interns"" for companies.

--------

**How long does the ""internship"" last?**

Up to 12 weeks.

--------

**Are those ""interns"" paid any money?**

Those ""interns"" are not paid any money by the companies.

The government keeps paying the ""interns"" the Newstart payment and additionally $100 more per week.

--------

**Are those companies paid any money?**

Yes, those companies are paid $1,000 to employ each ""intern"" even if they don't give them any job after the internship.

This program is like paying money to companies so they employ people for free.

--------

**Are those ""internships"" really voluntary?**

The PATH ""internships"" are referred as ""voluntary"" in official documentation by the government:

https://jobsearch.gov.au/path/jobseekers/internships

&gt; PaTH internships are voluntary and can be ended at any time, without penalty.

I have read the proposed legislation in the website of parliament and I think that's not true, let me explain it.

The proposed legislation is here:

http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5734

The ""Explanatory memorandum"" of the bill is here: 

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/ems/r5734_ems_d5756521-50de-48bf-aca9-2dd011ab2ff4/upload_pdf/496999.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The text of the bill is here:

http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/legislation/bills/r5734_first-reps/toc_pdf/16140b01.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf

The proposed legislation says that the Centrelink payment, while undergoing the PATH ""internship"", can be cancelled ""as a result (whether direct or indirect) of a voluntary act of the person that was not reasonable"" (page 9 of the bill), do you see that the wording is very *vague*? ""not reasonable"" could mean anything, if the ""intern"" refuses to do something that the employer wants then to do that could lead to the payments being cut.

The ""interns"" will be afraid that if they do something that displease the employers then their Centrelink payments will be cancelled and they will need to apply again and wait some weeks before receiving the payment again.

And those ""interns"" will not have any savings, because the Newstart payment is very small, so they will be suffering a lot if it is cut.

Please notice, this is very important, that the companies that will be hiring the ""interns"" won't be respectable companies like IBM or Microsoft, no, those companies will probably be very small companies or subcontractors or recruiters, so those companies will not necessarily have a high level of ethics, which means those companies will probably be more prone to exploiting the ""interns"" noticing that the ""interns"" will be afraid of losing their Centrelink payments.

And, this is also important, the Liberal government will probably extend the system to people of all ages later, not only the young, which will open the door of seeing very old people with disabilities being exploited by those companies and without those problems being shown in the media.

64v2f2,2,2017-04-11,"Live in 6 year girlfriend going on ""dates"" with some guy",sadpandastatic,Infidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/64v2f2/live_in_6_year_girlfriend_going_on_dates_with/,"Throwaway for privacy.

I've been dating my girlfriend for six years now, I'm mid-thirties and she is upper twenties. We have lived together for years now and our relationship has gone downhill a bit and is definitely lacking some passion in the last two years. Despite this we are very symbiotic and have developed a bit of a best friends relationship with occasional sex and romance. Just to be clear, I love her and our life together but this is not what I have in mind when I think of the relationship that I want.

About three years ago she was pretty burnt out from work and wanted to go back to school and I agreed. Since, she has not earned any money, but due to good scholastic results, she has a very good scholarship that pays for school and gives her some spending money.

She puts most of it towards common costs but it doesn't even cover groceries. We live in an expensive location, and I have a decently paying job, but I barely make enough money and often have to work extra on the side just to scrape by. I have 20k in savings which I refuse to touch and no debt, but I end each and every month at zero.

Her school does not really allow her to work on the side, though if she really wanted to she could work a bit, probably enough to make life easier, but she categorically refuses to. I've come to accept the situation even though it also implies that if any hidden costs come up, I can't rely on her at all, and it is up to me to somehow come up with the cash.

When we first starting dating, I was super active, in very good shape (did marathons/ triathlons) and we did a ton of fun stuff together. I was also pretty social. In the last couple of years, I've come to feel very burnt out. Essentially now, when I'm not working, I play video games, watch netflix with my gf, go to movies with her. 

She has told me multiple times that she wants a more active social life, for example telling me that she wants to go salsa dancing. The thing is that since we started dating, I've put on about 20 pounds, though in reality I've really put on about 25-30 pounds of fat and lost 5-10 pounds of muscle. I feel morbidly self conscious, which she knows but ends up being a bit of a turn off for her. It's a pretty big factor in my lack of motivation and desire for social activities.

She knows it and tries to be supportive, though that support only goes so far, and often turns into reminding me of past failures in losing the weight and getting back in shape. Full disclosure since this is a throwaway and I don’t want to paint her as a horrible person, I do also suffer from very mild ptsd due to several years of active combat duty. I do a decent job of not letting it impact my life or relationship, but at rare times it does make me a shitty boyfriend/someone not easy to live with.  

Long story short recently she told me that she needed space because she didn't really know where she was mentally in the relationship and life. She mainly blamed it on the pressures at school. I told her that that was fine as long as it didn't imply that we were no longer exclusive.

In the last couple of weeks she has been accusing me of not giving her space. I've tried, but at the same time this has often implied ignoring me for the entire day and not answering my calls and texts. I really felt something was up but wanted to trust her, but yesterday she went out for a quick errand at 7pm, then an hour later texted me a single line ""I'm not going to be home for a while"" before going MIA and showing up at half past midnight.

I was feeling super sick the entire time but I really tried to calm down and went for a run to help. When she got home I really calmly told her that I wasn't mad, but that I wasn't stupid and I knew she was seeing another guy and that for me that just wasn't ok. I told her that I didn't want to be in a relationship where that was ok, and that that wasn't part of giving her space. She is going away for the summer for an internship and I told her that we should be civil until then so she could focus on her exams, but that I wanted to use the summer to formalize a permanent separation and arrange a new living situation where we stopped living together.

She essentially admitted to it, but told me that nothing physical happened and that she thought she was going to end it after that night. Then she gave me the “I couldn’t help it” speech and the “I’m in a crisis” speech which really made my blood boil though I stayed calm. Then she told me that she felt bad and clearly wanted sympathy, and when I told her that it was pretty ridiculous that she wanted sympathy after hurting me, she accused me of not understanding her and of forcing the relationship to end.

I really tried to tell her that I wasn’t ending it, but she had already ended it by her behavior, but she told me that I was giving up too easily and that many married couples had had this kind of “little crisis.” She said she wants to be with me but at the same time isn’t sure what she feels.

I tried to roll with that and tell her ok, that’s fine, but after this you have to take steps and prove things to me and make a decision. I also told her that she needed to swear to me that she would never cross this line again, but she is being really evasive and is accusing me of trying to pressure her and give her ultimatums.

I would like things to work out and us to get back on track, but I feel like clearly her attitude is saying that I’m the one who has to make the compromises, which I feel isn’t fair after what happened. The way I feel right now is that she wants the security of having a relationship while to an extent living the single life, but maybe she really just need a bit of time? I mean am I overreacting to something that perhaps was innocuous or was this really a red line that I shouldn’t accept was crossed? (I really do believe her that nothing physical happened) I’m really torn and feeling pretty crappy, so any advice or encouragement could help."

64wos2,1,2017-04-12,My job is to find people interested in learning/developing Chinese language skills by doing internships in China,AsiaIntership,language,https://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/64wos2/my_job_is_to_find_people_interested_in/,"I work as a business development officer with Asia Internship (www.asia-internship.com), a company based in Chengdu, Sichuan, China dedicated to providing affordable and high-quality programs in Asia to students and young graduates from all over the world. We run internships, graduate placements, volunteering and semester exchange programs in Asian countries, especially in China. Our company has been building several international relationships for some time and we would like to search for new opportunities wherever there is interest.

We have lot to offer, since an Asian (especially Chinese) work experience is increasingly valued by employers in the west. An experience in Asia will give an inside view into both Asian culture and business practices. Learning or improving some languages and having a connection with Asian countries will also enhance their employability. We work with companies that offer internship placements in Bio-medical, Engineering, Business, Hospitality and so on.

You can refer to here: http://www.asia-internship.com/internship-in-china , for our detailed rates and inclusions. (We charge a reasonable program fee to cover accommodation, onsite support, career guidance, etc.). We charge certain and reasonable program fees to run/support the program. The program fee we charge is to cover accommodation(40%), pre-departure training, airport pickup, orientation, a placement, our 24/7 onsite support, career guidance, and cultural activities. We are not a NPO and therefore partial program fee is also to cover our staffing and administrative costs. 

We aim to help those who come to Asia for the very first time and aren’t confident enough to prepare by themselves or worrying about what will happen when they land. Our pre-departure/airport pickup/onsite support services would help those people to feel more at ease during the whole period of their stay. 

Of course, for experienced travellers it would not be wise to go through an organisation like us. We even have full-time job recommendations from time to time to people who are more mature and want to experience Asia on their own. These opportunities are free and directly connect to the companies. 

You might also wonder why you would travel to China to do an internhsip in the first place if you lack travelling experience, an ability to speak the Chinese language or if you haven’t had time to do proper research before leaving. The truth is that research can only take you so far, and the number of people who can't afford to be experienced travelers (but who still might wish to experience or work in China) would surprise you. Our most recent arrival, a Swedish student who is doing an internship in business development, has had plenty of experience traveling abroad but has never been to South East Asia or China or had enough time from his studies to learn comprehensible Chinese. He has still managed to settle neatly into his new accommodation and has been described as a good contribution by both co-workers and his employer. The same is true for many others who go through us to do their internships. Some, or maybe even most of them, could possibly have managed well on their own, but we believe its important to help make the transition to a new country and a new culture as smooth as possible. In many cases, that is what separates us from similar services and programs.

As addressed we are here only for people who are in need of the services we provide, and as many companies who are in the service industry, a service fee/marketing consultancy fee is what we live on and support our business. If you need a detailed proposal, just let us know and we will answer any questions you might think of.

Best regards!

My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a vacation to a beach in North Carolina. As appreciative as she was, she thought it would be boring to go with just Dad especially after dark so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers.  I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had the room in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. 

Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who I couldn't help notice was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty while not exactly fading wasn't as fresh as her daughter's.  As we were pulling out of the driveway, Vanessa swore and asked me if she could run back in and get her yoga mat. Of course, I said, while Amy asked if she had an extra that she could borrow.

Vanessa returned with two mats shortly and we were on our way. After 4 1/2 hours, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, picked it up, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated my letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview in person ASAP because the training, which all the interns had to attend together, began in ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane. Vanessa agreed, although she looked disappointed. Amy asked Vanessa if she could step out for a minute so she could talk to me alone.

Of course I have to go, daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without a lot, and this would be the first ""vacation"" she's had since before her dad died. You've paid for the condo. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh, I can catch that flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has two bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird.

I'm looking for Vanessa.... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration. Have I piqued your interest? "

Like something that you usually see in a 'college party' themed clip on a free porn site. Until it happened to me.

First, a bit of back story.

It was my senior year at a small liberal arts college in central Ohio. I wouldn't really call myself a man-whore, but I certainly didn't hurt in the areas of female companionship. I had been in and out of long term relationships for a good chunk of my college years, but was recently single and was really just enjoying having as much fun as possible before graduation and being thrust into a life of actual responsibility. I was in the best shape of my life, about 6'2, 225lbs. I wasn't a bodybuilder, but spent plenty of time working out to keep myself together. No one ever seemed to have an issue about size, uh - down there, but I always thought of myself as average in that department.

I had recently started a pretty great FWB relationship with a perky blond named Ellie. She was a freshman with a brilliant smile, tight body, and about a b-cup. They seemed like the perfect size for her body, which I drunkenly stated aloud one night at a party. She explained they hadn't always been and she had undergone a reduction surgery late in high school. I assured her that they still looked fantastic. She seemed to be a little self-conscious about the scarring, except for the fact that it left her nipples overly sensitive. “I’d love to see how that works,” I whispered to her. She gave me a look and a squeeze on the thigh. Needless to say, I got an up-close examination a bit later that evening. We went on to have several incredible hookups which included me taking her virginity. Perhaps I’ll put those nights to paper at some point.

On this particular night, it was approaching about 10pm and I was in my apartment, laying down and watching TV. It was a week night and I hadn’t really made any plans, especially with Ellie. My phoned buzzed. It was a text from Ellie – ‘What are you up to?’ I clicked back ‘Nothing much. Just watching TV. You?’ Another buzz – ‘Come over’. Ellie lived in the freshman girls dorm with her roommate Holly. I had gotten to know Holly pretty well, as she was a freshman in the same area of study as me. We had crossed paths several times in school settings as well as social. She was a bit of a bigger girl, but still very proportionate. She had porcelain skin, raven dark hair, big brown eyes and massive tits. She loved to flaunt them in low cut shirts or strappy tank tops. I didn’t really feel like heading over to a dorm, when I thought I could have more fun in the comfort of my own room – ‘Come over here’ I sent back.

This time my phone buzzed with an incoming call from Ellie. “Hello?” I answered. “We think you should come over here,” Ellie quipped back. “Who’s we?” I asked. “Me, Holly and her best friend from home,” she responded. I could hear laughter in the background. “And why should I come over?” I asked. “Cause we’re drunk, bored and in our underwear!” Ellie stated very matter of factly.

Well, that’s not an invitation any red-blooded male could possibly turn down. “Ok, I’ll be there in 10”. The dorm was only a couple of blocks away, but I wanted freshen up a bit, not knowing what could be instore. I quickly hopped into the shower, soaped up the important areas, and took a razor to make sure my cock was fully prepared. I began to get hard while shaving, fantasizing about three girls waiting for me in their underwear.
Knowing I shouldn’t waste any time or energy, I finished the rest of my shower at a cooler temp and began to let my raging hard-on subside. After toweling off, I tossed on a tshirt and jeans, forgoing my usual boxer-briefs this time. I quickly walked towards the campus.

I told Ellie I’d meet her at the rear-door of the dorm to not raise any suspicions of the RA. The school is fairly conservative and had a strict visitation policy for members of the opposite sex. I texted her as I approached. The door swung open and proved to me she hadn’t been exaggerating. She stood there with Holly, both in tank tops and thongs. They laughed as I sped up my pace towards the door. Ellie’s tan skin was a sharp contrast against her white tank and baby blue thong. Holly’s matching black set were an equal balance against her pale skin. It was clear neither was wearing a bra as I could easily see the outline of Ellie’s nipples hardening against the fabric. Holly’s massive tits were all but spilling out of her tank. “You weren’t kidding!” I exclaimed. “Not at all.” Holly replied, turning her ass in my direction. Ellie followed suit. The fabric of both panties crept up the ass, covering the interesting parts. The door entered into the stairwell and they begin climbing the steps in front of me. The each gave a giggle and a bit of a shake as they walked ahead of me. Knowing I had clearance from Ellie, I reached up and pinched her firm ass. Coyly she glanced over her shoulder and said “At least wait till we’re in the room!”
We only climbed one flight before exiting the stairwell to their floor. I now realized why they were so comfortable walking in just their underwear. Their room was the first door directly off the stairs. When they opened the door, I was introduced to Holly’s best friend from home, Rebecca. Also dressed in her shirt and underwear, she was a bit more covered. Her sandy blond hair was curly and fell just to her shoulders. Dressed in a blue tshirt that just came to her hips, I could see the outline of a very full pussy held back by neon green panties. “Oh? This is him? I approve!” Rebecca stated. The other girls giggled. An inside joke I clearly wasn’t part of.

It was a typical door room. Two twin beds that were not bunked. Holly’s bed against the back wall, separated from Ellie’s bed by a nightstand they shared. Rebecca was propped up on her knees on Holly’s bed. She had a wry smile on her face as she wiggled her hips, allowing the sides of her tshirt to lift a bit on each side. It revealed more of her hip-hugger panties and a tight stomach underneath. “Come in and take some clothes off!” Rebecca blurted, “We’re all in our underwear, you should be too!”

I was beginning to realize what they may have planned. I wasn’t sure how far any particular girl may want to take it, but I knew it was going to be fun.

“Well, that’s tough, because I’m not wearing any.” I replied. More laughter, but it had turned from giggles to sultry by this point. Holly bounced over and plopped down next to Rebecca, leaning up against the pillows at the head of the bed. She pulled her legs up to her chest. Her curvy white thighs parted a bit reveling the patch of black fabric snug against her pussy. She wasn’t even trying to be subtle. Rebecca reached over and ran her fingers along Holly’s legs. Ellie climbed on to her bed, sitting indian style. Then patted the bed next to her for me to sit. I gave her a look after having witnessed Rebecca’s hands sliding up and down Holly’s legs. She filled me in that Holly and Rebecca were a bit more than just ‘friends’ from back home.

“Yeah,” Rebecca said, “she walked in and got quite an eyeful.” Ellie recalled how when she had come back from class just a little while earlier, she opened the door to find Holly propped up on the bed. Her legs were spread and Rebecca had her face buried deep in her pussy. She could hear them both moaning. Holly’s tits were out and she was rubbing her nipples as Rebecca lapped away at her swollen clit. “That’s when we suggested that she find someone to call to come over and have more fun,” Holly spoke up. Ellie leaned into my ear and whispered, “Of course, I thought of you.” Her tongue grazed the rim of my ear as her hand began to pull up the edges of my shirt. As she tugged the shirt over my head, her hand slid around to the front of my chest. Once the shirt was off, she grabbed the back of my head and leaned in to kiss me. Her tongue probed my mouth and I lightly bit her lower lip, a move I knew she loved. A moan escaped between her lips. I smiled.

We pulled apart for just a moment and glanced at the other bed. Rebecca was watching, having lowered herself, the back of her thighs now resting on her calves. Her knees were 18 inches apart. She was lightly rubbing her thick pussy lips through the neon panties. A wet spot was beginning to form. “Don’t let us stop you,” she suggested. “Yeah, this is hot,” added Holly as she was pulling her tits from her tank top. They were incredibly pale and even bigger than I had imagined. She had large, barely visible areola, but her nipples were sticking straight out. She rolled them between her thumb and forefinger.

Ellie now sat next to me, both our legs swinging off the side of the bed closest to Holly’s bed. Ellie partially reclined, resting on her elbows. Her incredibly sensitive nipples were reacting to my lip biting. They were straining against the thin fabric of her tank top. Leaning into her, I began tracing my tongue along her collarbone, running up to her neckline. Her breathing quickened. I was on my side, my left-hand grazing across her flat stomach. I pressed the palm of my hand flat against her and began to slide my hand up to her perky b-cups. I cupped one and teased her nipple with my thumb over her tank top. She moaned and breathed heavily. My lips were now wrapped around the bottom of earlobe. I hooked my thumb over the top of her tank top and tugged down. Her hard nipples now exposed to the room. The scars from her reduction surgery were quite faded and hardly visible, but were comprised of a small circle around each areola and a center line down the middle of each breast. I certainly didn’t mind them and the benefit of near orgasm-inducing nipple play was always fun. My tongue was now venturing down across her collarbone, I was thirsting to have her nipple in my mouth. Before I could even get a taste, I noticed that she was squirming into a fury. I knew her nipples were sensitive, but I had no idea…..that’s when I heard “Holy fuck she’s wet!”

My head turned to where the voice originated. As I opened my eyes, I saw Rebecca on her knees in between Ellie’s tanned thighs. She had pulled her baby blue thong to the side, revealing her wet, shaved pussy. Rebecca’s chin was glistening with what I could only guess was Ellie’s wetness. As Rebecca slid a finger into Ellie’s tight hole, she placed her tongue squarely on her clit and gave a hard suck. “Don’t stop, either of you,” Ellie said breathlessly. I didn’t need to be asked twice. My head lowered back to her tits, my tongue swirling around one hard nipple. She was shuttering as the combination of my tongue on her nipples and Rebecca’s mouth on her pussy was quickly washing over her.

Suddenly, a hand tugged at my belt and button of my jeans. Holly had positioned herself on her knees next to Rebecca, but she had clearly set her eyes upon a different goal. I warned, “Once these are off, nothing is left to the imagination.”

“That’s what I’m hoping for,” she replied, looking up at me. As she went to work on my belt, I made my way to Ellie’s other hard nipple. This time, I began with a hard suck then transitioned to teeth, nibbling lightly. “Oh fuck!” Ellie moaned. By this time, Holly had sprung my cock free of my jeans. It was rock hard and had been straining for release since I arrived. She swirled her tongue around the head, her right hand grasping the shaft. She began stroking my hard cock and I wondered where her left hand had gone. I glanced down to see it was sliding down the back of Rebecca panties. On her knees, Rebecca had spread her legs just enough to allow Holly’s fingers to caress her meaty lips from behind. She now was moaning hard while still pleasing Ellie’s drenched cunt.

As Holly began to fully suck me, I moaned with Ellie’s tit still between my teeth. She opened her eyes and looked directly at my cock in Holly’s mouth. As she began to sit up, she stated “Mmmm, Can I have some too?” She tucked her legs underneath her body, thong still pulled to the side of her engorged lips. She was perpendicular to me with her head in my lap. Holly took my whole 7 inches down her throat before pulling off and making room for Ellie. With Holly’s hand still around the base of my cock, Ellie lowered her head and began to suck on the swollen head. Holly leaned back and kissed Rebecca deeply, sharing the taste of Ellie’s tight pussy. Ellie took more of my cock into her mouth as Holly began stroking. They certainly weren’t in any hurry, which was just fine with me. A second set of lips found their way to my balls. Holly had broken her kiss with Rebecca and was now lightly taking each of my balls into her mouth. Ellie’s hand replaced Holly’s for stroking while sucking my dick.

Rebecca had now mounted the bed and was positioned behind Ellie. Her left hand was grasping one of Ellie’s toned ass cheeks. Her right hand was cupped, fingers massaging her wet clit and swollen pussy lips. “Fuck,” Rebecca exclaimed, “Her ass is amazing!” I glanced over making eye contact with Rebecca. “You don’t have to remind me,” I replied with a smile. Rebecca grasped the sides of Ellie’s thong and began peeling it down. Ellie adjusted slightly, bringing her legs closer together to allow Rebecca room to remove it completely. Her mouth never left my cock. As she resumed a slightly spread stance, Rebecca remained behind her, hands on each one of her firm ass cheeks. She spread them slightly and begin to tongue Ellie from behind. Not being able to see, I wasn’t sure if Rebecca had begun to play with Ellie’s asshole or still was just lapping up her pussy juice, but I could tell by the vigor of Ellie’s cocksucking that she was enjoying it.

My cock was now being shared by both Holly and Ellie, as they took turns running their tongue up the shaft or swallowing it completely. They had my cock completed lubed with their saliva and occasionally pulled back to stoke its length up and down. I reached back and grabbed the shoulder of Rebecca’s tshirt. I tugged it towards me, wanting to tasty Ellie’s juices on her lips. She crawled forward assuming a similar position to Ellie’s, direct aside of her. She leaned down and planted a firm kiss, thrusting her tongue into my mouth. Ellie’s pussy tasted sweet with a bit of a sour flavor as well. It was incredibly warm. Rebecca was a very aggressive kisser. Her teeth would dig into my tongue or lips, just depending on what she could get a hold of. My hand began to slide underneath her blue tshirt. She was almost flat chested, but with prominent ‘puffy’ areola. They were rounded with small nipples perched on top. I pinched them harder, based on the pressure she was biting me with.

There was no longer a mouth on my cock. A warm, soft feeling enveloped every inch of my hardness. I broke my kiss from Rebecca to see that Holly had wrapped her massive tits around it and was slowly tit-fucking my dick with the saliva gathered on it. Rebecca and Ellie, now both on all fours next to me, leaned into each other for a kiss. Rebecca’s hand reached to the small of Ellie’s back, then gently slid down the curve of her naked ass. She let out a loud moan/sigh when I assume Rebecca slid a finger into her pussy. “Mm, is that how I taste?” Ellie asked. “Pretty great, isn’t’ it?” I smirked. “Glad you think so,” she replied as she rose to a kneeling position. In one quick motion, she lifted her right leg and swung it over me. She was now straddling my stomach. I could see how revved up she was by the glistening wetness that covered her pussy lips. Her clit was engorged and just peeked out between her shaven labia. She began to scoot towards my head. I instinctively wrapped my arms under her thighs, knowing she was going to mount my face. This was always a ‘go-to’ for her when she was ready to cum. Rebecca’s hands were all over Ellie’s body as she began to lower herself on to my tongue. Ellie loved a combo of being tongue-fucked and having her clit sucked. I was happy to do either. As her pussy got closer, a random thought entered my head – she doesn’t have any tan lines, she must tan naked. My thoughts quickly shifted back to reality as I stiffened my tongue and stuck it straight into her waiting hole. She moaned loudly as my tongue slid deeper into her. At the same time, Rebecca was peeling Ellie’s white tank top over her head. Finally, someone other than me was completely naked.

Looking up, I could see Rebecca cupping Ellie’s left tit. She licked around her nipple, being much gentler with it than she was when kissing me. The sensitivity of Ellie’s nipples took over and she began grinding her wet, shaved pussy against my mouth. My hands were reaching behind, cupping both of her toned ass cheeks. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Holly had moved to the head of the bed the 3 of us were on. She had removed her panties, now just wearing her black tank top with her tits pulled over the top. Leaning against the pillows, she bent her legs at the knee and spread her thighs. She, too, was completely bald. Her left hand parted her shaved pussy lips, while her right began to rub her clit in circles. She was enjoying the show of Ellie riding my face, while Rebecca worshipped her nipples.

Rebecca also noticed the movement behind her and let Ellie’s nipple slip from her mouth. She turned to Holly and began to crawl towards her on all fours. She clearly knew what Holly enjoyed. When she reached Holly, her hand slide down her inner thigh and she stuck one finger directly up Holly’s wet pussy. Holly exhaled hard as Rebecca began to vigorously finger-fuck her. Holly’s back arched and Rebecca went head first into her massive tits. She sucked hard at first, then bit down and pulled back, extending her massive tit outward. It seemed like a matter of seconds before Holly was breathlessly exclaiming “Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Her body began to shake and her thighs closed around Rebecca’s hand that was still pumping in and out of her. The two long-time ‘friends’ shared a deep kiss as the waves of orgasm swept over Holly.

As they broke their kiss, they slid off the bed and walked over to the nightstand. Tossing on a pair of pants, they grabbed a pack of smokes and headed outside for a couple drags, leaving Ellie to continue riding my face.
As soon as they were out of the room, Ellie became much more vocal. “Fuck, yes. Lick my clit!” she moaned loudly. She began circling her hips and she ground against my tongue. Her thighs started to tighten around my ears, a telltale sign she was close. My right hand grasped and slowly stroked my cock, while my left remained affixed to her perfect naked ass. A few more hip gyrations and she began to hit her climax. “Fuck! I’m gonna cum!” she exclaimed. My tongue kept hard contact against her clit as her body began to shake. Her hand grabbed the back of my head, pressing it up against her wet pussy. “I’m cumming! I’m cumming!” Ellie exhaled.

Just as she was at the top of her orgasm, the door opened to Rebecca and Holly returning. They quickly closed the door behind them and watched Ellie climax on my tongue. She collapsed in a naked pile next to me after swinging her leg back over my head. “Holy shit!” she shared with the two other girls.

“Well, it looks like it’s just you left,” Rebecca said, motioning to my still rock hard cock. “Which is perfect because I want you to finish in my mouth.” She slipped her pants off returning to her neon green panties. I could tell she was still incredibly wet by the darkened circle between her thighs.

She came over towards the edge of the bed and placed her hands on my thighs as she lowered herself between them. I looked over at Ellie, to see what her reaction might be. She simply smiled at me, opening her legs to give me a glimpse at her still soaking hole. Rebecca slid my cock between her lips and gave one long hard suck. I knew it wouldn’t take much. She began to bob her head up and down, her hand grasping the base of my shaft. Once my cock was again saturated with saliva, she wrapped her lips around the very tip of my head and began to furiously stroke my cock. I could feel the tension in my cock building as a watched her hand stroke from the base of my dick up to where her lips were wrapped around the head. I knew it was coming fast. “Oh shit, I’m gonna cum!” I exclaimed louder than I should have. Rebecca moaned as slowed her pace of stroking.

As I unloaded ropes of cum into Rebecca’s mouth, I looked over to Ellie who still had her legs spread, just an arm’s reach away. She was softly rubbing her shaved pussy lips was she watched me cum down Rebecca’s throat.
A few final sucks and Rebecca pulled away from my cock. I was anticipating her reaching for a trash can, but she suddenly said “Well, this has been fun!” revealing she had swallowed my load. The girls got back into their panties and tank tops and I slid back into my jeans. We talked and laughed a bit about what had just transpired.

Unfortunately, nothing like this ever occurred again. I left for an internship a few weeks later and when I returned, Ellie has begun another relationship.

Still, it certainly doesn’t detract from one of the wildest nights I had."

I will be moving from Croatia to Toronto next month to do a half-year long internship over there.

My hosting student's organization is helping me with everything i.e. they found me a place to stay at.
It's a room in an apartment in Scarborough for $550 a month.

The price is great, but what I'm worried about is the contract I was presented.

First, under Statuatory Conditions, it says the Landlord shall not enter the premises without the Tenant's consent or in case of emergency. They later void that by listing the Landlord's name under ""Other Occupants - in addition to the tenant, the following occupants may reside at the rented premises:"" since the Landlord lives on the lower floor.

Secondly, [here](http://i.imgur.com/LhCX1d3.png) you can see the additional obligations.
Under a) I am now allowed to have any kind of guests (friends or girlfriend(s)) at any time. Isn't that illegal?
Now I don't know about Canada, but I know for a fact it is in Croatia and other European countries. d) and e) is also illegal, but I don't drink or smoke.

My question is, **if I sign that contract, can the 'additional obligations' override the general law? Will I be able to have guests come over to my room?**

I'm a 1L trying to decide which job offer I should go with over the summer. before I get into the choices, I'm really interested in corporate and environmental law. I really want to work for a firm once I graduate. I'm not too interested in public policy or working for the government.

Anyway, I received an offer from a family connection who's a partner at his own firm. It's a small/mid-sized firm with 4 offices. They do PI, PIP, alternative dispute resolution, and other civil litigation. Pretty much a lot of stuff I am not interested in. However, I have heard that working for a firm is good experience, even if its not exactly the practice area that you see yourself going into. Also, this job is close to my hometown, so I would be able to live at home (for free!) and its paid.

The other offer is with an environmental law institute. I would be working with federal and state regulatory and compliance issues. Stuff I am actually pretty interested in. I wanna go into transactional work, and I feel like getting some experience and knowledge with environmental laws could be useful for a variety of transactional deals, especially here in my state. However, its unpaid, not at a firm, and not in my hometown.

Will an employer frown upon working for public policy my 1st summer? Is firm experience better than relevant/interesting legal experience? Ive also heard that corporate firms frown upon PI firms. I know that my 1L internship isn't as important, but i want to do something that will maximize my opportunities for next summer and beyond. Thanks for your help everyone!"

Bit of a strange one really. I recently did a 4 month internship for a digital marketing startup in London and am now going through the motions of trying to get them to pay me the NMW for the hours I worked for them.

When I started they set me up with a gmail account that wasn't a part of their business account and was simply: myname.businessname.co.uk@gmail.com
(Really professional I know).

My question is who owns the email address? Yes they signed up for it, but I am the only one who used it and my name was in the email address. If I signed my partner up for a gmail account, I couldn't suddenly tell her it is my account right?

The company themselves are now claiming that as I tried to access  the account I have myself breached the law and as such will not be  entitled to any possible payment. I don't believe I am in breach of anything, as there was no contract signed but would be grateful of any advice.

Cheers."
64zw54,3,2017-04-12,tax work vs audit work?,ahighfive,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/64zw54/tax_work_vs_audit_work/,"I finished college last May and I have not found a job at a public accounting firm yet, which is my current biggest goal. I have passed the REG portion of the CPA exam and am currently studying for FAR full-time. I am seeking a job in tax, because after taking 2 courses on it in college and spending 3 months studying for it and passing REG, I have grown to like it.

That being said, a contact of mine at a top 10 public firm has responded to me saying that she is ""in the audit department and know they are actively hiring, but am unsure what the availability is like in tax"". 

She asked me if I am interested in doing audit, and if not it's fine and she will email her manager and he would know who to send my resume and cover letter to.

My question is: should i change my path for this one potential opportunity? I have not had an internship or done work in either tax or audit, but the reason I bombed 2 or more interviews for audit positions is simply because I do not know what the job entails and I draw a lot of disconfidence from that. On the other hand, I draw a lot of confidence from knowing what tax is like and having studied it extensively.

Can anyone tell me what audit is like in a top 10 firm, maybe post a link? Or give any insight on how to approach a job interview for which I don't know much about? Maybe some buzzwords? I understand ""confidence is key"" and ""just be yourself"" and all that crap but I am a genuine person and it is hard for me to fake it that I am confident I can do a job I know little about.

The easy option is to respond saying that I am more comfortable with tax and I would like for my contact to find out if there are opportunities in the tax department.

Any helpful and positive insight is much appreciated, good people of reddit"
64zzj1,2,2017-04-12,"Student looking for career advice: becoming a PM, Scheduler, Estimator or going into Environmental Remediation/Green Building Consulting?",Phaggle,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/64zzj1/student_looking_for_career_advice_becoming_a_pm/,"Hello everyone,


New subscriber here! I was hoping I could get some input from people who have been in the industry who may have some advice for myself and my peers as young professionals and soon-to-be college graduates. A little bit of background about me: I am currently a student majoring in a Construction Engineering Management program and minoring in a Communication Studies program who will be graduating with a legitimate bachelors of science degree from my school's college of engineering. I have a year and a half left in school and have been looking forward to getting out into the industry to begin my career. I have been very active with  leadership clubs on campus, which helped me get my first construction internship in project controls at a globally known construction, architecture and engineering company. I have been at this internship since last summer and will be here for this next summer, but I am not sure if the work I am doing now is something I want to make a career out of since it is mainly systems work rather than typical project controls (cost estimating, scheduling, etc.) work. What interests me and engages me are the opportunities to lead and manage people to work together towards a common goal as well as having an accomplishment-driven lifestyle, no matter how difficult or stressful the work.

I have been interested in the positions in my title in particular for a variety of reasons, and was hoping for some advice and input on what these positions can offer. Below are the reasons why I am interested in each position and what questions I have about them. Any input you could give on what you think which position would suit me best is much appreciated!

**Project Manager**

I am interested in becoming a PM because they seem to be the ones who call the shots for a project and because they have the ability to float from being in the office and out on the field. This sort of spontaneity is something I think would keep me very engaged in my work and satisfied with my job. I read somewhere on this subreddit that someone described being a PM as being ""the person who is constantly putting out fires occurring around the project"" which sounds to me like a lot of stress which can produce a lot of satisfaction if handled correctly. Here are my questions about the position:

* Is my understanding of what a PM does correct? If not, what am I missing?

* What is your favorite part of being a PM and why?

* What is the biggest struggle you have consistently had as a PM?

* What are the steps one needs to take to become a PM?

* What sort of career advancement opportunities are typically available after being a PM?

* What is a typical PM salary for a high cost-of-living area?

**Scheduler**

I am interested in becoming a Scheduler because you are able to see the project from a birds-eye view and plan the coordination of the activities of all the different disciplines in construction. Meshing everything together into an effective schedule seems like it will require a lot of critical thinking which is something I love to do. From what I've heard, having a good scheduler for a project is invaluable which means there is always a demand for qualified people. I think coming up with an effective masterplan for a project is something that can be highly satisfying if done correctly or incredibly stressful if done incorrectly. Some questions I have about the position:

* Is my understanding of this position correct?

* What does a typical day include as a scheduler?

* Do you get any time out on the field?

* What has been your biggest challenge as a scheduler?

* Do you ever get bored being a scheduler?

* What are the steps one needs to take to become a scheduler?

* Where can scheduling take you in your career?

* What is a typical salary of a scheduler for a high cost-of-living area?

**Estimator**

What interests me about cost estimating is, like scheduling, you are able to set projects up for success or for failure, but with the tangible metric of currency rather than time. I feel like finding creative ways to manage cost is something a management team will always be looking for, which results in a high demand for this position. The most interesting thing about the position to me is that I think you have the opportunity to really shine and make projects successful. Some questions I have are:

* I imagine working with numbers all day can be pretty boring, is this true?

* How often do you interact with other people in the project? Are you left to your own devices to figure things out or is the position more team orientated?

* What does a typical day as a cost estimator include?

* How does one become a cost estimator?

* What is your favorite part of being a cost estimator and why?

* What is something everyone should be aware of before they become a cost estimator?

* What is a typical salary of a cost estimator in a high cost-of-living area?

* Where can cost estimating take you in your career?

**Environmental Remediation/Consulting**

I am interested in getting involved with working with the environment because it is something I have been passionate about since high school. I feel like the work of being involved with an environmental remediation company is something that would be incredibly wholesome because you leave the job site knowing that the work you did that day is benefiting society in some way. I think being a green building consultant would be an interesting position as well because you get to travel and visit many sites that present unique challenges in being more environmentally compliant or conscious. I feel like both of these positions out of all of the above positions benefit society an incredible amount as well as leave the most room for flexibility in terms of a job description. Some questions I have are:

* Do you think working in construction with an environmental focus is something that is possible? If not, what similar careers would you recommend?

* Do you think a Masters degree in Environmental Engineering would be worth its time and cost to get into this field?

* Do you foresee environmental impacts related to construction being more of a focus for the industry?

* How did you get into this line of work?

* What are things a person interested in this line of work should be aware about before committing?

* What does your day-to-day work tasks look like?

* What sort of salary can one expect for this line of work in a high cost-of-living area?


Thank you in advance for your time, input and suggestions! If you have any other items of information that don't fall into these questions, please don't hesitate to share! I genuinely appreciate your time in reading this lengthy post as well as any guidance you can give."

I can program but it is not my forte, so I am looking for people who would be interested in helping out. I am extremely transparent about everything from marketing to finances to technologies I think would make sense.

As far as my technical background, I am majoring in Computer Science next year at college and I have had several internships (high performance computing research / statistics), so I am although not the world's greatest programmer, I have some technical knowledge. However I would prefer to have some help with development.

Development will likely use Bootstrap / Materialize, some js, and WebRTC."
651539,5,2017-04-12,"Deciding between three very different grad programs in Publishing: Emerson, UAL, or Columbia. Help?",awky_raccoon,publishing,https://www.reddit.com/r/publishing/comments/651539/deciding_between_three_very_different_grad/,"(x-post from r/gradschool)

Hi guys,

Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but maybe some of you can help. I've decided to go to graduate school to study publishing and I've been accepted to the 1.5-2 year program at Emerson, the 15 month program at UAL (University of Arts London) and the 4 week certificate program at Columbia which is held at Oxford. I know some people will say a graduate program in publishing isn't worth it, but I'm 100% sure it's what I want to do.

I am completely torn - these programs are so different but each have their own advantages.

Emerson Masters:

- Near my home town, could save money and live at home, already have friends there

- Longest program, could be completed in a year and a half if I take three classes per semester (which I've heard is totally doable)

- Classes held in evenings, and only one class per class per week. So three nights of class per week.

- Most expensive: would end up being $50k+ when all is said and done

- 40-50 students in entire program

- Aside from three core courses, I would have a lot of freedom to take classes that interest me. Mix between theoretical and practical courses.

- Can choose to take one extra class instead of a final dissertation/project

- GREAT networking for Boston area, where I will likely end up working anyway

- Night classes would allow me to work or have an internship at the same time

UAL Masters:

- In London, which would be so much fun. I also love to travel, so being so close to the Europe would be amazing. But I won't know anyone so I won't have the same strong support system that I have in Boston

- 15 months, only two semesters of classes followed by solo work on dissertation/final project

- Class held from 9-5 on Thursdays and Fridays only

- Cheaper tuition, about $20k for whole program, BUT this doesn't include living expenses in London

- 20 students in entire program, stay in same class with them all year

- No choice in courses, but will be exposed to areas of study I wouldn't have chosen on my own, may be a good thing - all very practical courses

- Final project is very flexible, can basically do anything I am interested in/passionate about

- GREAT networking with UK Publishing houses, which have sister locations all over the world

- Trip to France at end of second semester with entire class (but expenses not incl. in tuition costs)

- I've heard that UK grad programs are more laid back, and I would have time for work or an internship outside of the course

Columbia Publishing Course:

- In Oxford, UK - beautiful old campus, but found the town itself to be quiet and dull (I'm a city person). Probably won't matter since I'll be so busy all the time?

- Not a MA, just a certificate

- Only 4 weeks

- Very intensive schedule: all day, every day, working in groups mostly (I get sick easily when I'm in stressful situations for a prolonged period of time, so this makes me nervous. But who knows, it could end up being more fun than stressful?)

- Cost: $8500 including room and board

- 70 students in whole program

- Focuses only on book publishing - no choice in courses, but learn so much just by doing. I don't know if I prefer book to magazine or digital publishing, so I'm unsure if this would be a good idea, or if it would hurt my chances of getting a job in magazine publishing in the future if I find out that is what I want to do

- EXCELLENT networking with both UK publishing houses and NYC connections - program taught by industry professionals, many people are hired immediately after the program ends

- Have Columbia/Oxford on my resume

All these programs have great reputations in the publishing world, and would help me get internships/jobs. The cost is important, but I will be taking out loans so if I can get a better paying job upon graduating then I'd be okay with paying more. They all start in September, and I have to let them know by May 1st. I love them all and cannot decide which I prefer!

Regardless of what the subject area is, which program would you choose based on the practicalities/logistics? Have you had to make a similar choice? Does it sound like one would be a better fit? I was hoping someone could point out that I seem to want one more than the others based on what I've written, so please let me know if that is the case. Sometimes it just takes an objective perspective to tell us what we really want.

Thanks guys!

**TL;DR**: Can't choose between three very different but equally great programs: Emerson, UAL, or Columbia. Each has different class formats, costs, location, and learning outcomes. I'm completely torn. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."

651bu5,1,2017-04-12,Should I take a full-time offer in Fund Administration upon graduation?,swolepetrol,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/651bu5/should_i_take_a_fulltime_offer_in_fund/,"Recently got a full-time offer throughout the middle of my internship at a small boutique firm dealing in fund administration for private investment vehicle firms specializing in hedge funds, private equity investments, real-estate investment trusts, venture capital investments, etc. The accounting firm does the accounting work for them: bookkeeping, bank reconcilitation, management fee calculations, and other fund administration duties. I found out that I'm actually pretty good at this, I have strong Excel skills and am able to navigate QuickBooks easily. I also understand how some of these complex hedge funds with over 1000s of holdings of operate.

The problem is, I don't see myself doing Fund Admin for the rest of my life. I feel that most of the job requires just sitting at a desk and staring at a computer all day. I'm really into health &amp; fitness and I feel working here full-time will jeopardize my health from sitting down too much. I'd like to be in Internal Audit where I can interact with other firms and do stuff on my feet, and sometimes travel to other locations as well. It seems more interesting. I'm not a fan of the busy season as well, as I've noticed some of the associates there have 50-60 hour work weeks. But then again, I don't want to be stuck in this industry if I do decide to change my career path later on. How well does Fund Administration transfer to other accounting disciplines? I'm graduating after next semester, should I accept this offer or try to get other internships and offers for Internal Audit, which is what I really want to do? The fund admin firm offered me to extend my internship for the Summer so i can work there as an intern with the same pay rate.

Should I just work for them during the Summer since I don't have any summer internships, and then next Fall (2017) try to get recruited elsewhere? Or should I not waste their time at all and just get a summer job elsewhere, as I'll need to save up money for next semester.

If anyone has experience working in fund administration, how would you compare this to other things like corporate audit and Internal Audit? Or even Tax?"

**Location:** Marrakesh Dusk
**Target(s):** ""The Inventor"", ""The Arms Dealer""

Objectives:
 
- *Eliminate* Stefan Lindberg
- *Eliminate* Adrijana Novak

**Briefing:** ""Good evening, 47. Your destination is, once again, Marrakesh; more precisely, the newly-managed Swedish consulate. After the failed coup, the acting chief, Erik Olander, disappeared without a trace, and the Swedish government decided the building needed a change. It has now been converted into part science exhibition, part consulate, with one of Sweden's top scientists as head of the facility; your target, Stefan Lindberg. Lindberg is holding a ball at the consulate, under the guise of a scientific breakthrough, revealing his new ""Stormbringer"". Proposed as a cheaper and safer alternative to fossil fuels, it can, reportedly, take wind energy and, using a special superconductor in the core, create pure lightning. 

The power of God at One's fingertips, shall we say. 

Lindberg, after demonstrating his technological marvel, intends to sell it off in a very cloak-and-dagger exchange with the Serbian arms heiress, Adrijana Novak. ICA sources indicate she is to use it in a major terrorist attack within Serbia, with the intent of bolstering her own financial and political standing; so, our clients, the Serbian government, have hired us to eliminate them both; dealing with the fallout and the removal of the Stormbringer, as long as we can deal with the masterminds.

With the ball being a high-societal event, security will be tighter than usual; but, 47, I do know how you love a challenge. I will leave you to prepare.""


**Map Description:** The consulate looks exactly the same on the outside, apart from a flag that flies the flag bearing an atom in the Swedish colours. It also has some standing signs showing off the ball, and the wall has been replaced by one made of glass. The windows have the same atom symbol on and the front door now resembles more of a hotel, with 2 armed guards at both the turnstile (which is now replaced with a revolving glass door). Outside, you can only access the area up until the arches leading to the market, and those are the exits; it's quite small, like The Icon. Outside, there are some stalls and pop-up bars for tests to relax and smoke, etc. The top floor of the consulate is now laboratories and rooms for meetings, and the downstairs is like the consulate, just more posh. There's a main kitchen, a mock ballroom, a bar, and the offices (which are being used by a group of interns). The labs, meeting room and bio-facility are all staffed by some scientists, and the Stormbringer is upstairs, waiting to be wheeled down on the special track that was built for the presentation. Some experiments are being performed on it, to make sure it is okay to demonstrate.

**Starting Location:** Sitting at a table by a small, pop-up cafe in the courtyard.

**Inaccessible Areas:**
 
- Everywhere but the consulate up to the arched gateways

**Unique Disguises:**
 
- Sergei Oskolyev, Russian FSB spy
- Hans Mattelline, Chief Lab Coordinator
- Oliver Boothroyd, English private investigator
- Mikael Jensen, Lindberg's personal doctor/physician
- Giordino Alliami, Famous Italian violinist
- Georg Hendersson, Facilities Maintenance Officer
- Frederik Mnjak, Hanmjry Jagtak leader

**Minor Disguises:**
 
- Personal Bodyguard (Novak)
- Security Guard (Lindberg)
- Waiter (Lindberg)
- Goon (Novak)
- Intern (Lindberg)
- Orchestra Member (Lindberg)
- Janitor (Lindberg)
- Maintenance (Lindberg)

**Kill Opportunities - Lindberg:**

**The Power Of God**
 
 - ""From the schedule, it seems that Lindberg is eager to present the Stormbringer as soon as possible, but, until he gets the all-clear from his Chief Lab Coordinator, the ball stays on. It is to be wheeled through from its laboratory, onto the stage, and the reception should be a large one. A doting audience and an obsessive inventor? What could go wrong...""

  - Step 1. Find and read the schedule which is in the massage room.
  - Step 2. Get Hans Mattelline’s disguise (CLC).
  - Step 3. Tamper with the safety and overload the Stormbringer (requires screwdriver).
  - Step 4. Talk to Stefan Lindberg.
  - Step 5. Go to the moose drop room and talk into the microphone to announce that it’s time to reveal the Stormbringer.
  - Step 6. Take a seat in the audience and watch the Stormbringer zap Lindberg, making him float slightly and shake, then fall back to the stage.

**The Final Song**
 
- ""According to that pamphlet, the violinist to close the reception is the famous musician Giordino Alliama, a man whose violin skill knows no bounds. He has been booked by Lindberg, personally, to give the final performance of the night. Now, Lindberg has always been noted as a sentimental man, so has asked the violinist to play a famous song from his homeland, With such positive emotions swelling, a hearty congratulations and a toast is sure to follow. Maybe you should polish off your Stradivarius, 47.""
 
 -  Step 1. Obtain Giordino Alliami's  outfit.
 - Step 2. Meet with Lindberg and a group of his scientist's for a short rehearsal.
 - Step 3. Play violin. Well.
 - Step 4. Walk onto the stage to much applause.
 - Step 5. Play violin, again. More well.
 - Step 6. Meet with Lindberg afterwards.
 - Step 7. Poison his drink, press appropriate button to smash violin and stab brutally in neck with sharp splinters, or do the boring thing and not do that.

**Meeting The Rieper**

 - ""The memo on the intern's pad has a meeting scheduled with Lindberg for one Oliver Boothroyd, an English private investigator,  recently hired by Lindberg to investigate a rival company, BioCorp, who is, supposedly, using some of Lindberg's stolen technology to research the infamous castor bean, also known as the bean from which ricin is taken. Maybe we should take a further interest in the horticultural world, 47.""

- Step 1. Find the castor beans in a secure part of the lab.
- Step 2. Get Boothroyd's outfit.
- Step 3. Collect the castor beans and meet with Lindberg in his office.
- Step 4. While he is looking out of the window, drop all but one of the castor beans into the peanut jar he dips his hand into from time to time.
- Step 5. Wait for Lindberg to mindlessly take a handful of peanuts, not noticing the castor beans, and eating them (thoroughly).

 - Note: This is similar to destroying Soders' heart. As ricin doesn't kill instantly, but stop protein production, he will die after you finish the mission, with Diana saying, ""Good work, 47. Lindberg will be dead by sunrise, and nobody will be none the wiser.""

**Kill Opportunities - Novak:**

**A Fall From Grace**
   
- ""A Russian FSB agent? How curious. It seems we aren't the only ones taking an interest in the Stormbringer. With the power that one could obtain from owning the Stormbringer, it's understandable why they're taking some notice. The agent seems to be photographing Novak at any point he can, and I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate it if he were to be caught. Interesting...""
  
 - Step 1. Take Oskolyev's outfit and camera.
 - Step 2. Take a picture of Novak in front of her face.
 - Step 3. Be taken up to the roof and cuffed by her guards
 - Step 4. Press kill button to pick your cuffs, and, as she gets close, put them on her and throw her off the roof.
 - Step 5. Watch her fall, handcuffed, and be impaled on one of the consulate's flag poles.

**Positively Shocking**

 - ""The maintenance schedule shows that the hot tub in the VIP lounge seems to be out of order, and a high priority notice has been placed on it. Novak is to be testing out some of the buildings higher class facilities, and the hot tub is one of them. The maintenance officer is to personally repair the tub. Maybe we should give him a hand, 47.""

- Step 1. Take Hendersson's outfit.
- Step 2: Dismiss the other maintenance engineers.
- Step 3. Expose a wire in the hot tub's wiring.
- Step 4. Attach wiring to water tube.
- Step 5. Invite Novak to try out the hot tub.
- Step 6. Go into the control room and fry dat biatch.

**Shootin' The Breeze**

 - ""47, I have intel. The man in the fur is none other than Frederik Mnjak, the leader of the Hanmjry Jagtak, a Serbian arms gang that Novak is to be meeting with in a very ""cloak-and-dagger"" meeting, sometime during the ball. ICA sources indicate that they are to discuss a new, experimental weapon Mnjak has brought along to the meeting. Interesting...""

- Step 1. Get Mnjak's disguise.
- Step 2. Go to the sentry gun and deactivate its safety code, so that it targets Novak and Novak alone.
- Step 3. Talk to Novak and tell her to meet you upstairs (by the windows that Strandberg stares out of).
- Step 4. 47 will give a talk about the weapon, and the technician will go to activate it.
- Step 5. Novak will press the big, red button and be blown out of the window by the bullets.

Feedback appreciated, as always."

652t95,24,2017-04-12,Sam's doing this on purpose,porsalin,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/652t95/sams_doing_this_on_purpose/,"Heresh thuh deeeeal. Sam Roberts was given one hell of an opportunity by Opie in presenting his own show. With no audience, no expectations and no pressure he turned his show into the place to be for WWE chat. He grew a small but niche audience there and given it was a once-a-week nobody cares slot, it didn't really impact or affect the O&amp;A base.

Fast forward to September. He is given Opie's slot doing mornings with Jim Norton. Filling the same slot Opie and Anthony had not long before him, he now had a huge and loyal O&amp;A fanbase to entertain. Knowing O&amp;A will fundamentally be remembered as a celler-crowd style comedy radio show filled with comedians and comic talk, Sam realised he didn't fit in. He's not funny unless being laughed at and most comedians probably don't respect him or value him as a radio personality. Most see him as a snot nosed intern who somehow unfairly occupies O&amp;A's seat. The fans gave him a chance but quickly turned on him, realising he's terrible on the air. 

So to remedy this, Sam has been actively changing the show to fit the format of The Sam Roberts Show. He was fairly popular with his small audience there given they were fellow WWE faggots. Sam says he's 'growing' the show but in reality he's simply changing the format to suit him - at the expense of the O&amp;A legacy and of funny, comedian-driven radio. Sam is not interested in comedian talk. When comics come in, Sam's usually very quiet because he's not funny or quick and can't chime in. He has some weight with the WWE now and will do anything to turn the show into The Sam Roberts Show (with Jim) 

Fuck wrestlers. Fuck Sam."

This is really long, so thanks in advance for reading if you do. I'm really lost. I haven’t really shared this before.
 

**TLDR; I got kicked out when my mother found me chopping my sister’s weed a month ago. I smoke recreationally and it’s never affected my relationships or behavior. My partner has been supportive but after some heated conflicts, judges/resents my family as they’ve always been somewhat manipulative, and verbally/physically abusive, particularly towards me as I am the older sibling. My sister wants us to go on a family trip to ameliorate the situation over Easter, but my partner thinks it’s a bad idea and won’t talk to me because he wants me to stand up for myself with these people. Whether or not I go, I’m going to be homeless as of tomorrow after moving out of temporary accommodation.**
 

 A bit of background: I'm of Chinese descent and my parents were first generation immigrants. We're a family of four, pretty distant. I have a narcissistic/spoilt younger sister. We’re a year apart.
 

 My parents are and were always very business oriented. They've done extremely well for themselves despite being student refugees in the 80's, coming to a country with limited language skills and no money. They've fought some tough battles: everything from famine, to working 3 jobs in one day, and then their personal differences. Nonetheless, through their efforts, both us kids were sent to private schools for the entirety of our schooling life, achieved some pretty high marks, scholarships, and we're now in uni. 
 

 However, aside from my parents sacrificing family life in favour of expanding their business, other issues arose. There was a lot of domestic violence between them before we were born. There was a lot of it when we were kids. There’s still physical and verbal abuse now. When we were 3-4, mum decided that it was better she stay in Australia and look after the business/kids here, while my dad travelled overseas and oversaw the company in China. My dad used to be a very angry man, and my mum is still a hotheaded career woman of her own right. They always clashed. They hit us too. Growing up Chinese, I just used to joke with my other Chinese friends about times when our parents would go crazy and beat us/verbally attack us. 
  
 Because they were so busy, my sister and I were brought up by nannies. We had a generally good childhood, never missed out on much except having our parents around, but we understood their cultural expectations.
   
 7 years ago, things started really falling apart. My parents got into an argument one day when my dad came back to visit. It ended up with my mum taking a restraining order out against him after the nanny called the police. I stuck with my sister through it. I massaged my mum's head and back whenever the pain from the incident got too much, continuing to do so for the years to come whilst my sister internalised everything and began to defend herself by becoming extremely selfish. It came to a point where she treated my parents like free rent, and still does. She now has a limited relationship with all of us. I felt sorry for my mum, but it's not like she was powerless. She controls all the family's money and she's an absolute dragon to deal with. Business comes first. Living with her you tiptoe on eggshells because she's ready to blow up at any point.
  
 During my last year of high school, at 17, I became depressed as mum and I started fighting a lot. She was going through menopause, and she didn't understand/believe in mental illness/the concept of mental health. My sister developed an eating disorder, and my mum left the country for 3 months because of her own mid-life crisis. This was due to the family business suffering for a few years. My mum blamed herself after she trusted her long-time business partners and friends to manage one side of the business. By the time we were advised they could be taken to court for fraud, we didn't have enough cash flow to pay for lawyers. 
  
 Back then, a lot of the conflict happened because I was so busy with exams that I wasn't able to contribute to chores that I had previously. My responsibilities meant I cleaned the pool, cooked, did the laundry, dishes, and then would be told to help tidy/clean the entire (3 storey) house. Mum would do the same whilst running a business. Then she started getting angry and telling us she wished we didn’t exist when I couldn’t hold it up anymore.
  
 My sister would barely lift a finger to help anyone other than herself. She acted like it was a free ride because they both knew I would do anything to help the family work together. My mum would say that ""family life comes first"" and that when she was a kid, they weren't allowed to do homework until the chores were done. Then my sister started getting into a lot of trouble for not attending classes. It was my job to get her out of bed, drive her to school and make sure she had lunch to eat. When she didn’t do those things, the school would call, but mum never picked up and I handled it instead, every time. 
  
 I was head of music, but I dropped almost to the bottom of my class after having continuous panic attacks during performances. At the same time, because mum was away, my sister and I would just smoke cigarettes and pot occasionally because no one was around. She drank with friends, I didn’t. When mum came back things got so heated and I was terrified of her, so I lived with a friend for a while.
   
 I’m not sure how I did it, but I ended up pushing myself hard and passing school with flying colours. To be honest, I was just smoking pot and revising each essay multiple times and memorizing Shakespeare lines while blazed. I think my love of music, English and the Arts saved me. 
  
 My mum realised she had done the wrong thing by leaving me to my own devices and started staying at home more to support my sister during her final year of school.
  
  Things were still terrible at home with mum and I. This was also my first year of uni. I met a guy and we dated for a year and a half. The friends I did have knew what was going on, but I was so desperate to leave home that I isolated everyone and moved an hour away to live with this dude. He ended up cheating on me multiple times and we finally ended things when I realized I deserved a lot, lot better. I loved him, but I had also found a refuge whilst I worked a full time hospitality job, 8pm-4am for the duration of our partnership. He was jobless, didn’t go to school, played video games 16 hours a day and I paid for everything. By the time we were done I’d gotten him into a vocational school for game programming and he was finally out of his parents’ home and seeing a counselor.
 
  Well, towards the end of that relationship I quit my job and moved home. A few weeks later, I went back to collect my things and he tried to get me back. He grew angry when I discovered multiple used condoms in the bin, after which I stormed out and told him there wasn’t a single chance I’d come back. He grabbed my things and threw them on the ground to try to stop me. After I slapped him it became violent. I ended up with a cracked rib. When I told my mum and sister, they said that I’d been “asking for it” by going back to get my things. I regret slapping him as I’m never violent, but man, after everything it was just too much.
 
  After moving home last year, I started working in the family business to support my parents emotionally, mentally and financially. I’d always helped them with design stuff because they needed someone to do their layouts and photo shoots. (They work in fashion). I switched degrees and took on the role of head designer for my parents. First half of the year I absent failed 2/4 subjects because I unexpectedly ended up working 60+ hours a week for her. 
 
  For the second part of the year I deferred my studies and worked full time for 8 months. Mum “really needed my help.” 3 of those months I was paid $10/hr for duties that would get me $45/hr elsewhere. But of course, because I was 20 at the time and technically “inexperienced” despite multiple internships and years of helping them, I didn’t get paid properly. Even now I am paid under minimum wage for my age. I brought it up a few times but didn’t say much because mum let me live at home for free. I still pay for everyone’s groceries and of course my own day to day expenses. 
 
  Not only did I help with the business, but I looked after her rental properties which were contributing to paying off our mortgage. On weekends I cleaned grease stained kitchens, renovated cracked walls and even got my partner involved with heavy-duty gardening [council approved tree pruning, land management].
 
  Mum never stops working. As a result, I never stop working for her. Last year most of my days were 10+ hours long. She was dismissive whenever I wanted time off. And I was constantly working because the deadlines never stopped coming. I replaced 3 people at once, and the duties were overflowing. I started becoming very depressed, not showing up to work a few times because I’d been suicidal the night before. I felt that way because my own projects were thrown to one side and I lost the motivation to stand up for myself. Mum would get mad and say my life was in “shambles” whilst I cried, because I wasn’t at uni and that I wasn’t doing a good enough job, that I was late, and that I needed to work harder. At home, she said I didn’t help out enough because I was always with my boyfriend. She continuously yells at me for being uncaring and selfish and “stuck to a man” when I don’t want to come home, and that I’m a disappointment.
 
  By now you’re probably wondering where my sister is in all of this. Why can’t she help? Well, she’s at uni, and working her own part-time job in retail. “Don’t bother her, she’s studying.” I did not get the same privilege because I just never learned to say no. She never gets asked to do anything and she’ll never offer. She tells me I’m “melodramatic” and that my depression “isn’t that bad”. 
 
  I did end up telling them I wanted to study to secure my future and I’m back at uni full time now. I achieved HD’s and D’s in my first round of assessments. I’m still working for them part time. Their requests still eat into the time I have for my own study because fashion is a really chaotic industry. 
 
  I have known my current partner since we were kids (8 years by now) but we only started dating 14 months ago. My family knows him pretty well. We went travelling together at the start of this year when I finally begged for some time off. 
 
  He's Caucasian Australian. There are certain differences that we all work around, but we’ve very rarely had issues. We communicate well and have so much in common that we’re rarely ever bored. When we argue it’s more often to clarify personal philosophies. He’s a bit of an outsider like me. All in all, we make each other happy, look after each other, and spend a lot of time together since we’re kind of introverted/mostly busy otherwise. His family are warm, loving, welcoming and supportive people who have been privileged enough to be able to lead peaceful and totally normal lives (of course, everyone has their ups and downs, but let me stress this really is a nuclear family where they live down the road from the grandparents). 
 
 A month ago, things fucked up. Again.
 
  I brought a few friends over late on Mardi Gras, a Saturday night. I bring people over maybe twice a year: for New Year’s, and my birthday. My sister got mad because she had work in the morning but we were outside the house in the backyard, staying quiet. She got so mad that I’d disturbed her (even our housemate didn’t mind) that she came up and yelled at me. “How can you be so inconsiderate? I have work in the morning! If you continue to hang around scum like this you’ll become just like them”. It was 2 in the morning and I apologised and said we’d leave soon. She then slapped me in front of everyone and said “I deserved it” when I started crying. She never apologised and said that “it didn’t even hurt, you know the truth. I did it to wake you up to yourself.” At some point, my mum has also returned after a late night out. She hides in her room. The next day she continues yelling at me for what has happened. 
 
  At this point my partner who’s very protective is absolutely furious and starts to argue back at her, saying that she was being ridiculously selfish and that violence is unacceptable. We’ve both been woken up by her, her friends, and her booty calls (lol) coming through my room to get into the house discreetly.
 
  I’ve never felt so unwelcome in my own home, where my sister and even housemate bring people over to party every few weeks.
 
  Eventually my friend drives us out of there back to his house. There were 7 of us packed illegally into the vehicle but it had to be done and was no more than 5 minutes down the road. 
 

  Two nights later I’m at home helping my mum clean the garage for removalists to get some of the stuff out. A lot of it is my sister’s mess. I have told my partner at this point not to come over and help. Well, he does come over anyway, to help. He hears my sister come down the stairs. She starts her pitch again. “Can you guys do this at a later time? It’s 10pm and I’m trying to get sleep as I have work and uni tomorrow.” My mum is now angry because guess what, she’s got work the next day, and I have uni, but this is something that has to be done in time. Before my mum can get a word in, my partner, previously smoking a cigarette outside the garage, comes flying into the room angry, cigarette in one hand and flipping the bird at my sister with the other, telling her she’s a spoilt brat who needs to get a reality check because half of it is her stuff that we’re clearing. 
 
  He then tells her she needs to apologise for the other night. I’m embarrassed and ashamed at this point. Of course I stand by him for defending my right to feel welcome and equal at home but we probably disturbed people that night. I bring him outside to calm him down but mum has already asked him to leave and never come back. He gets mad and says I need to learn to stand up for myself, and that these people are straight up using/exploiting me. I tell him his idea of “justice” is just a figment of white privilege and that it’s never going to happen for me. (My bad, probably too personal/racist) After he leaves my sister ends up helping out.
 
  A week later everyone’s still reeling from what happened. My sister and housemate are blind drunk in my housemate’s room. Mum comes home exhausted from renovations and I give her a back rub to get the knots out. She says goodnight to all of us while we’re sitting in my housemate’s room. I stupidly assume the coast is clear and offer to roll everyone a joint out of my sister’s weed. After 5 minutes of chopping mum comes back into the room unannounced, sees what I’m doing and completely loses it. She asks what it is. How long it’s been. At this point she believes I’m a total addict and criminal. My sister and housemate are laughing saying they’ve got “nothing to do with it” while I’m being dragged out of the room and my mum is just beating the shit out of me. She bolts the garages down and takes the keys out of my door. I apologise profusely but she won’t have it and tells me I have ten minutes to move out, while still throwing whatever object she can find at me. 
 
  I know I disrespected house rules and that drugs are unacceptable in her eyes. I’ve never smoked it too close to the house and I don’t do it often enough that it affects my marks or lifestyle. I don’t drink either, and it’s so common everywhere. 
 
  So now I’m out of the house. I don’t have money saved up for deposit/bond money on a room, mostly because I don’t get paid enough and I’m not working the same hours anymore. I’ve got temporary accommodation with a friend but I’m to move out by tomorrow, and I’ve stayed with my partner’s family on and off. 

  After all this, my dad gets the call and he flies back from China. In recent years he’s financially supported my mum because he feels guilty for the way we grew up. We’re both still helping her because we feel sorry for her, but she’s totally abusive of us and it’s never, ever enough. Dad’s getting older so I can see that he doesn’t want to lose out on the only family he has.
 
  I got one of those pool toys for Christmas from my partner amongst other things. It was pretty expensive, around $100. I left it in the storage room by the pool still partially inflated. I don’t know what’s going on in that house but my dad dragged it out and my mum sent me photos of him cutting it up, angry because I’ve been “irresponsible”. I told my partner and he just had no more words. After listening to me complain, and seeing me cry and become suicidal because of these people he’s just had enough and is starting to really hate them. 
 
  It’s Easter weekend now, and my sister has decided we all need to go on an impromptu family holiday. She says that I *have to* do it to please my parents despite assessments piling up. I haven’t seen her since everything happened, and I have minimal contact with my parents when they’re at work. 
 
  I negotiated and said I’d go if it was somewhere I was interested in as well, but they pulled the plug on that destination when the accommodation became unavailable, and chose something else instead. My partner has now stopped talking to me because he thinks I shouldn’t go. Until now, he and his family have been really supportive. But my partner is adamant they lied to me from the get go and were never going to let me have a say. I know it was just bad organization. He said that he knows I’m a good person, but he is sure in the same position he would have stopped having anything to do with them a long time ago. 
 
  In recent weeks he’s grown more and more angry about the way they treat me. I feel guilty for having complained too much. He’s started saying things to try and turn me against them. I feel this is out of line. 
 
  To be honest, I’m not all that interested in being trapped with these volatile people. I’m pretty tired of bending three times over to make sure they even speak to each other and all they do is ask me to help them with something else – work, money, support, care, whatever. All that to receive very little praise and a lot of criticism in return. However, deep down, I feel like family drama is a heavy burden to carry and I don’t want to have such a chasm between all of us. 
 
  That being said, my partner is someone I want to have a future with and this is taking a toll on us. Any support or advice would be helpful. I don’t know what to think of my family anymore. I hate myself for being so weak but I feel I’ve done everything I can to handle it. I have no idea how to get my partner to calm down or talk to me, or stop judging my family. I am pretty lost and sad, and even better, I’m going to be homeless tomorrow!

656ae1,21,2017-04-13,Deloitte Interview Update,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/656ae1/deloitte_interview_update/,"Hi,

So a day ago I posted here [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/64scq3/messed_up_my_interview_at_deloitte/) how I bombed my interview. 

A few moments ago I got a phone call from the Deloitte that they've decided to hire me as an intern for three months, rather than offer me a full time job. It's most likely an unpaid internship but I'm not entirely sure. I'm really happy, but I'd have preferred a full-time position. I guess its better than nothing.

On a different note, I had an interview with The Cheese Cake Factory the next day for an admin &amp; HR position, and they've decided to offer me the job as well. It's a full time position and the pay is pretty good.

I'm most likely going to accept the Deloitte offer and reject the restaurant's offer, since I need to get fulfill my CPA licensure requirements within three years, but I'm just concerned if I won't be offered a full-time position once the internship is done, I'll be unemployed once again and it's going take toll on my depression.

What would be the best decision, should I join Deloitte as an intern or take up the permanent position at The Cheese Cake Factory?"

In my experience I have seen both, non-technical and technical QAs. The thing I don't think it entirely fair is to blanket QA/QEs as being technically inept. I myself am a technical tester that covers the manual 'old' QA thought as well as the more technical things as maintaining whole automation suites. We do not have a big department at my company and I end up wearing different hats. I think that it's a different scenario for each company. A little more background on my experience I was a programming intern and based on business need I transitioned to QA and have been running with it for five years now. I have my associate's in mobile application development and am finishing up my bachelor's in computer science. I think now more than ever there is more need for highly technical QE/QAs not only can we do more investigation into issues but can take on some more effort from developers. 

I am interested to know other people's thoughts as well."
656y04,5,2017-04-13,[need advice] story of a sugar baby/camgirl on a road to greater discipline... advice appreciate,miss_jo_7972,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/656y04/need_advice_story_of_a_sugar_babycamgirl_on_a/,"Okay, this is a pretty crazy story, but it’s all true and any advice that you can give would be really appreciated. My life has been a little crazy- I was raised in a very intense Baptist household, got kind of kicked out of the church. I was always way too curious and asking questions that people couldn’t answer- I was at odds with the church’s disbelief in evolution, resistance to global warming, general intellectual inconsistency. I was always the black sheep asking why forever, there were instances where at a Bible study I made the pastor’s wife cry, and was kicked off of the worship team by the pastor who ended up yelling at a sixteen year old girl who wasn’t sure if she was ready to get baptized. I always loved singing and that was maybe the final straw of what made me leave the community, being cut off from the one thing that made me feel close to God. The other kids my age at church really never accepted me, my first love interest was interested sexually but wouldn’t date me because he didn’t want to be “unequally yoked” as they say. I remember purity conferences and examples of how sex before marriage would leave you dirty forever, like the example of how just one drop of poison in apple juice ruins the whole thing, and nobody would ever want to drink you (what if someone was sexually assaulted? I thought). Everyone thought my best friend growing up and I would get married eventually, but as I “strayed from the path” people started to realize that I didn’t belong in the community. 
Anyway right after graduation I moved out and went to my local university in order to save money. There was a freshman first night and a girl asked for my number. We started a relationship and started doing crazy shit, we had threesomes and worked as camgirls making thousands of dollars, went to hotels and partied all the time. Eventually we went our separate ways but I still feel close to her in a way that I won’t feel with anyone else because we have the same crazy obsession with sex to be honest, for me likely a result of Baptist repression and for her because that’s the way she is. I went to France to study abroad and despite maybe hundreds of hours of practicing French on my own time, translating movie scripts and endless work, I felt wasn’t able to improve very much at all. When I was there I would spend days alone in my messy room, and really only talked to other English speakers. People were a little harsh with me because of the whole American political climate but really I was just sensitive because it was the only time I felt stupid. 
I met a guy in Paris after posting on a website asking for someone to hold my bag (of winter clothes I brought to live in France) and getting to know him was the most natural, amazing thing in the world. He sailed across the Atlantic with his family over eight months, backpacked Southeast Asia, has been to like thirty countries total. When I got back to Paris after a month we had the most amazing time, I sat on his handlebars while zipping down the Champs-Elysee and explored the illegal part of the French catacombs, had sex in his kitchen and spent every moment possible together before I had to leave to go back home. Three days in a row together and the last day, we spent all night talking even though he had to go to work... it was literally like a movie. Unfortunately back at home things weren’t so good, my parents were together when I left the country, but during my stay in France they had a fight so bad my mom got arrested and there was a restraining order so they still can’t talk to each other.  
I went back to university but had trouble focusing. I started dating older guys for financial compensation, even a really emotionally demanding woman who would pay my rent and etc… it was just so hard to stay stimulated in these classes that didn’t delve into the reality of issues (my major is political science at a state university with a really underwhelming program). I failed a lot of my classes and this semester I had to take a leave of absence (which I didn’t even do properly). Nobody knows this, none of my friends or family, in January I went back to see this guy (on a Eurotrip funded by my sugar daddy). We had originally planned to spend the weekend together in a private Airbnb I paid for, but he totally bailed on me and we only spent the last afternoon in Paris together (the next day he was moving to a country in Africa for a year for work). Nothing happened between us and I bawled my eyes out and sexted my ex, lied to my friends that it was insanely romantic etc. I really only went on the trip for the chance to see him and it was honestly heartbreaking to experience. 
	The next semester I moved into this house with a crazy old guy (who had this enormous fiasco where he thought my booty call was my boyfriend that I was cheating on, refused to give me my security deposit back when I was trying to move out after my housemate was stealing stuff from my room), moved out, then decided on a whim to send French guy a message explaining my feelings for him and asking whether we could see each other “if life ever pushed us to the same place”. He responded incredibly enthusiastically, saying that he wanted a relationship with me, we talk every day now and I bought a ticket to visit him in Africa, and what’s more I’m meeting his parents. 
	However I lied about an internship I got (it was offered a long time ago but I never followed up on it) in order to give the impression that there was a path for us to live together in France someday, I’m secretly not attending university anymore, I think I have an issue with the Adderall I’m prescribed, I compulsively pick at my skin, I have a few sugar daddies who fund my lifestyle but most of the time I spend reading and studying languages and waiting to go to meet this guy. I have no discipline at all because so many amazing things have come so easily to me. This guy I want to be with is the opposite- he’s so hardworking, completely uninvolved with social media or the web addiction I seem to have and I don’t know how long I can keep up this crazy ruse with everyone in my life. Life is so surreal it doesn’t seem worth it to put in real effort- anyone who can give grounding, real advice to help me become more disciplined would have my gratitude. Thanks

6586ft,1,2017-04-13,Is my dad really emotionally abusive to me and my mom or am I just seeing it because I see it the most and it's the rest of my family who doesn't see enough of it?,Torhea,emotionalabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/6586ft/is_my_dad_really_emotionally_abusive_to_me_and_my/,"Warning. Long post.

Even before realizing it for what is is when he took over the downstairs level of our two-story house after getting a parking ticket which he continues to disagree with mom on whenever it does happen to be brought up (though it's been a while since that particular case), where he was caught for speeding but took miles to be stopped on the highway which resulted in a petty court case that resulted in him only getting half off the ticket because he shouldn't have been speeding but he still thinks he should have gotten the whole thing taken off his record and dismissed. Well, I've never had the same feelings for my dad the rest of my family does. (And, by the way, he lied to me about moving downstairs into my brother's old room he used as a bedroom dorm for himself during college and saying he ""doesn't feel safe in his own bed anymore"" but my gut tells me it's bullshit). The whole rest of my family sees him as some sort of god, especially my brother who moved out the moment he could but somehow continues to see him at least once a week to every other week if he's traveling for work another week, etc). But I can see the disgust in mom's eyes when she looks at him sometimes, and every now and then they'll have a fight over something stupid. He hasn't been diagnosed with this and I doubt it ever will be, but he does things that occasionally borderline narcissism with me.

** Like when he gets me things that are still on their way and tells me he can hold them so they don't come until he lets them (which he has done recently for a USB SD holder he told me he got for me).

**He also never lets me get anything for myself when I do have enough money, and when I do and it's a good buy that works great and I like it, he stills tells me to save my money and come to him.

**When he and mom do fight, even when I am in the room to witness it, he'll completely ignore that fact and tell mom that something she said is really something he said when it's always ever the reverse of such. Oh, and even when I'm not in the room, he'll still tell me about the shit they fight about like I have any business because he only ever does it not just to vent but also make mom look the bad guy while he looks like the good guy while I stand by as the personal sounding board (dad has this belief where there doesn't need to be any secrets and so therefore shouldn't). I don't even enjoy being with him anymore if I ever did even when I used to be in denial even while my childhood self made mountains out of molehills when he really used to yell to hide behind mom when I didn't do something he wanted to do like homework or whatever (joke's on him now, though. I've got a 2.64 GPA and graduating from community college this semester to go on for my bachelor's at UMass Boston with guaranteed MassTransfer admission in the Fall!) I've since turned myself into myself, though. In fact were it not for the journal I keep of all the bullshit he says and does, I'd probably forget it all as I had before I kept one because my brain now does this thing no thanks to him where it zones out the moment he starts talking about anything so much as remotely negative about anyone or anything... which he does 98% of the time. There is not a day in this house where we don't hear the word Trump in such a way I can't help but wonder if he has strange sick wet dreams about the man...

**I spent two years of the six at my community college in graphic design, and while I graduated to continue for my creative writing associate's because writing is more my passion than anything even that which he has since ruined because 95% of the graphic design associate's by making me let him do the work for me to pass in as if he was vicariously living through my major. There is one poster of a play the school did that is of a play my brother loves, and it's the only one I succesfully pulled off myself because I just happened to pull something out of my ass one day that my dad happened to love and let me go with that I did. But I can't even frame and gift it to him from fear that whenever it's seen dad would just do what he does with the children's book of a story my bro had written that I turned into a children's book. He thinks that because I can write I can write anything, and he used to do this stupid bullshit where he would make me tell him a story in the car, and while I pulled it off just to shut him up and get to class on time he always goes just to the minute before we do leave and I live an hour away from school. Anyway, he thinks I should be writing children's books just because while I can't see him the same way anymore, I have to continue putting on a face around him every day just to survive, so he thinks I'm always silly as I used to be around him (he has this stupid thing he does because he thinks I'm silly enough for it now that he'll call me and meow on the phone like a fucking cat or just make stupid sounds for a bit until I say enough he finally speaks English about something until he comes up or I see him downstairs to watch TV with him because he doesn't do shit anymore [he's 72 with a bad herniated hip from surgery and borderline almost failing kidneys] So, I can't even give my brother a great gift because of fear of him putting me down anymore for a passion. Oh, and when I was in my graphics career at school, I had an internship I passed successfully and my Portfolio professor loved my progress so much after having so much trouble in what was oherwise just a hobby for me only turned into such because I happened to be in the kitchen one day and forgot to close my screen back to the desktop and my dad saw my graphics I make for my characters in my writing by complete accident while passing by it to the microwave I was so stupid. But so much he actually listed me to go first to present portfolios on the final day of the semester, and I failed him because I was afraid my dad would narc and make me late looking at a folder he had 'helped' me make for my internship contents for the portfolio when I had lied to him and told him my professor let me leave it in his office because he had helped me make a decent backup version in class one day as well) And guess what? Because emotional abuse is such a fucking stigma and this professor met my dad once and loved him, I can't say shit even though I have had ideas to write a letter to leave on his desk or in his mailbox just befoe I graduate this year for future poor souls more savable than me... I have passed by him in the halls since and been in the same room with him as well as other people, and he's still so disappointed in me and my slip up that he ignores me like I don't exist now.

My dad used to yell a lot more than he does now, only thanks to my brother who got him to stop yelling so much as he used to, ironically. So now I just have to deal with an ignorant, inconsiderate, mysogisnistic, passive-aggressive, manipulative bastard of a father of whom my mom is in denial despite knowing how I truly feel about him. Which is funny considering they broke up a number of times before marrying but he kept coming back to her to the point she just gave in. Of everyone in my family, though. My uncle married to my dad's sister hates him because he sees he treats us woman in the family like shit, yet he treats my aunt the complete opposite and they see a lot of each other when she's not travelling as well. I don't have a job because I had seizures in high school (which I only don't have now anymore thanks to meds) as well as on top of being bullied kept me from seeking a job in the prime time of my life when they're abundant to us folks as they are as sparse in any state, but I'm starting saving every cent of the paycheck I get from my bro as his personal secretary (I pay off parking tickets, make invoices, calls, such secretarial stuff of the likes and such). I recently asked my mom about roommates for UMass Boston because I live 8 miles away from the place and UMB has connections with nearby apartment complexes, and see said exactly this to me on the subject: ""First, you have no job, and even if you did find roommates, I wouldn't let you live in a shitty apartment in Boston for $6,000"" Uhm. That's what roommates are for for pitching in. (I recently even joined Swagbucks to make some more money to start really saving on the offchance she comes around to my side of that at least...)

I had a nightmare earlier during a nap that I escaped and was living with my aunt and uncle (the same one from above), but how can I make that truly happen without breaking my aunt's heart realizing the monster her only brother is? I'm a second-generation Sicilian and my dad came over here when he was 3, which basically means my aunt has little family over here). I have a friend in Oklahoma who is the only one I can tell any of my shit too because she's in a similar situation but with her brother instead so she can get out of things a bit more easily and has to an extent, but it has been my dream to go to UMass Boston and my own brother has said he'd help me with anything I needed to get in, while my dad says he would rather tap into his retirement funds to my tuition fees than sooner pay off a debt of a student loan (not so much narcish as realistic tho I can even see that yes). But what am I supposed to do? I have had fears of being mom and continuing to be as stressed as I am now and dying in this negativity-drenched household, and what's make this worse for me is that one of my classes I'm taking this final semester is really an Independent Study dad fought with me against the school to have the previous semester as it's not something taken lightly to have, but I got it now. However, here's the thing he does. He's a retired rocket scientist so he's extremely analytical, and because poetry is analytical, even though most of my Poetry class is writing of things I could easily understand on my own, he insists on draining one whole day out of my week to talk about poetry when I could be doing all my shit that day and be done with things faster for it. (And while this has eased up recently because I've gotten to lying about what to have to do with only 6 weeks into the semester left so things are easier to lie about like saying we're just talking about favorite poems and shit now instead of anything else it's still hard considering he takes me to school Mondays so mom can sleep in from a weekend of straight-up doubles waitressing to pay for everything of the house from Internet to electricity to gas to you name it it's under her name, it's still lingering until the class is over, because when the class started and he dropped me off on a day where he had to drop me off where mom couldn't because she had a dentist appointment she needed to go to because her smoking because she can't handle dad anymore has given her gum disease and bone loss in her teeth though you wouldn't know that just from looking at her, he said: ""Don't let all that work last semester getting this go to waste. You might get an A+, but you better get an A."" But, I really need some help here, Reddit users. I'm 25 and only just now going to the college of my dreams to pursue my passion, but that's all I got to my life that is my own, and even now dad's trying to take that over as you can see from the Secret Poetry Tutoring Sessions (my writing and the essays I submit to my Poetry professor is at least my own and he doesn't know we actually write poems for the class sometimes so those are definitely mine but he still spends a day out of my week just flat-out talking about poems to make something else of mine about him as he has and is but thank gods this isn't a portfolio like Graphics and I've just been rewriting my essays from comments for portfolio in moments where dad lets me do homework instead of being held hostage by him even just so much as watching TV downstairs but lol I can't just tell my professors shit like that and the other one is an exception because that one will be done with the moment I send in that letter etc). Anyway, you have as many examples as I can fit into this post without worrying over something as simple character limits, haha. So, now that you have the longest backstory of backstories ever, here goes:

As it stands, right now I'm just waiting for the fat fuck (he's about 250lbs now) to die. I got so close to having a normal life when he had a heart attack while he was still working at 40-something and I was one or two years old about thirty-something years ag, but I think my innocence pushed the universe to bring him back. =_= I regret that so hard now. But I don't want to just wait. I want to have a normal college education career at UMB. I want to have one day where I don't have to worry about it in the back of my mind being ruined just by him being alive somehow as he is wont to do one way or another. I want roommates, actually, fuck that. I want to move out of here period. That friend of mine with the bro I mentioned above? She said I'm welcome her place anytime, but UMB is the only thing in my life I've ever been so sure of. I might be too proud, but I'm not ready to save up enough for a one-way ticket to Oklahoma (even if she did say they have a really good writing program at their uni as well). I have a boyfriend in Rhode Island who I see every now and then my aunt intorudced me to, but he loves him so I can't just move in with him and his rents, and even then, that'd be weird considering I want to be close enough to somehow get to UMB. The only other option lef ti s my aunt, but my mom's done so much for me... how can I leave her behind? My aunt is the only likely person because she knows a bit more than most, even that I've been depressed as fuck which is something i won't even let my dad know about because he'd just say I'm being lazy or using it as an excuse like I used to even in days when I have a legit one of like when I am actually on my period, etc. ""Oh, you're just using it as an excuse."" So, my aunt knows a bit more about my dad lately than most, and has at one point even offered mom money to get away from him a year or so Ijust before I started high school in 2006 when he blew up at a party she was having with us at her place that started in an argument between him and my uncle because he was pushing advice onto one of my cousins a bit too hard. But does that mean she can just cut him out if it means saving even at least me? She at least knows how much UMB means to me, and in fact the chanchellor lives right next to her it wouldn't be anything and things could still be done. But I don't want to put my uncle in a rock and a hard place just because I know he feels the same way I feel about my dad anymore... thoughts??? I know everything I said above is a lot to read, but I don't know what to do with my own life anymore and it's hard for me to even just post this anywhere, but I know this shit ain't right in any way here. I just don't know how to make it so..."
65895v,1,2017-04-13,"Lowest point in my life, need advice.. (Depressed)",TheYeti01,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/65895v/lowest_point_in_my_life_need_advice_depressed/,"Hello everyone, at this point I have fallen to the lowest point in my life and I need help. Nothing in my life is going good, not one fucking thing. I honestly dont have anyone to talk to so I hope you all read this and give advice. At this point I am desperate for advice. Im gonna provide some back ground info and number each of my problems. 

1) I am 22 years old and only fucked one girl with an SMV4. At this point id like a relationship or something. Ive been lurking here for 8 months and learned alot but I just dont know how to get started. How to meet girls, how and when to ask on a date, etc. and seeing how cruel and privileged women are in todays society I feel discouraged at best. The only problem is I am short (5'5). I have no acne and I am muscular but I guess that doesnt matter. 
Problem: (I cant get girls, rarely ever gone on dates, only fucked one girl smv4, never been in any form of sexual relationship besides that one week with the smv4). I talk to girls, I have friends that are girls, I just absolutely have no idea how to initiate anything with them. 

2) I have a slight obsession over money and I have $20,000 in total which I invest with. The problem is ive had this amount for the past year and a half. I like to see my money rise not stay stagnate or go down especially after a year and a half. I keep spending my money on food, trips, drugs, and going out. Recently I did poorly in the stock market which also again affected my main account. My goal is to open a business or buy a property with this money in the future and thats why it matters so much.

3) I workout and used to have one of the best bodies in High school. But 4 years later I barely grew any more muscle. I have decent sizes muscles but unfortunately I hit a plateau. I started doing the ICF 5x5 in January and I was making gains. It was the only good thing happening in my life. However I stopped growing in March and now this month I lost motivation to go at all. I dont eat all that much unfortunately because I dislike eating, too lazy to cook, limited time, etc. I still weigh the same and struggle to get motivated or energized for the gym. Lack of energy has always been a huge problem for me since 10th grade. I always feel tired, especially in the afternoon.
Problem: (Despite going to the gym repeatedly I still look the same 4 years later)

4)The fraternity I choose to join a year ago has shut down this past semester and im left with nothing. And unfortunately I cant join another one unless its a low tier one because of my age and gpa. As a lyft driver I pick up many sorority girls and frat dudes going out to socials, events, etc which upsets me knowing I wont be able to experience all that again. Plus my fraternity was low tier and I never lived the full experience other people have.

5) My gpa is shit (2.4) which will make my employment more difficult and I dont plan to work in my selected major because im not a big fan of it. It's difficult for me to stay motivated in school when I have other plans and I feel like this degree is just a piece of paper I'll probably end up throwing in the trash. I told my parents if I end up graduating (planned to drop out 3 times in the last year) I wont walk on stage because thats how little I care about higher education. I have a year left so id might as well finish. But its difficult to be motivated on a subject I care so little about when I have tons of other things going on. 

On top of these major issues causing my depression I am also dealing with these small problems. I smoke too much weed making me unproductive (im addicted, I literally smoke every day), I still have to find an internship for this summer (low motivation to do that), and im not making any progress in life. By that I mean I always tell myself ""today is the day I change for the better"" then I end up repeating the same mistakes again. Im trying to learn all these things at once (school, how to get girls, money, business, stocks, working out, etc) and its too much to bare. With finals approaching, finances to fix, internship applications, and other things its gonna be a rough month for me.

Common mistakes are: smoking weed too much, hanging out with my beta friends rather than alpha friends, being lazy, leaving things till tomorrow, not trying. This keeps happening, I cant change and eventually I think ill just end up being suicidal at this rate. I dont think I can live on like this for the next 2 years, therefore I am giving myself 2 years to live if this continues. If any of you have gone through a similar situation please let me know what you did to make your life better. "

658o0x,10,2017-04-13,Told my grandmother about my fears about my mother - so mum decides to validate my fears (x-post from mildlynomil),ladadilada,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/658o0x/told_my_grandmother_about_my_fears_about_my/,"I talked to my grandmother this morning, which was the reason for my post on r mildlynomil. I called because I was worried about my mum not going to my university graduation or not treating it as if it was important - she didn't go to my brother's college graduation (college and university are different things). Clearly granny spoke to my mum because she called me for the first time since Christmas and since she swore at me and had a tantrum.

This is more or less what was said: 

Her: Hello Darling. We are coming to your graduation, of course we are.

Me: …

Her: Are you coming to mine? I got a special award! For excellence throughout the year. [she's doing a one year sound engineering course at college because she's going to record her own CD from scratch and self publish it... yeah]

Me: … I may have an internship

Her: Well that’s wonderful news? Congratulations!

Me: Maybe [she always congratulates me for things I haven't actually done yet]

Her: Where?

Me: At [place].

Her: Where?

Me: [place], you know, that place I’ve volunteered at for the last two years?

Her: Yes I do know about that. I remember you told me those internships are paid, right? See I do listen. When does it start?

Me: Second week of May. First week of May I’m having eye surgery.

Her: Who’s going to take care of you?

Me: It’s a two day recovery its not a big deal. I’ve got [my ex fwb/closest friend/person who cares about me] to go with me so I can get home from the appointment

Her: So he’s going to take care of you

Me: He’ll be accompanying me

Her: Well ha-ha from what you’ve told me about him throughout the years he doesn’t seem the most caring

Me: Well he’s doing a better job than you are [Friend and I have a complicated relationship but he's always been 
very supportive of my issues]

Her: Right... well on that lovely note, I assume you don’t want an Easter Egg?

Me: Are you going to apologise for swearing at me and having a tantrum?

Her: …Are you going to apologise to me for making it out as if your sister and I are estranged? [my sister attempted suicide at 13 and it was decided that my mother couldn't provide a stable environment for her and has lived with my granny ever since. Estranged is the word I would use but whatever]

Me: I was trying to get her registered as self supportive because otherwise we have to go through you for your household income and it’s a pain getting that information from you. [personal experience talking]

Her: I understand now that’s what you were trying to do, but that’s not what I understood at the time

Me: So you decided to have a tantrum instead of trying to understand it?

Her: ….
(a bit about what my sister is doing now and how she’s done her new paperwork herself) ….

Her: Do you want me to come to your graduation?

Me: I keep going back and forth on it.

Her: Well tell me when you’ve made up your mind. (Hung Up)

So now I feel like shit, and like whether she comes or not I'm not going to be able to enjoy my graduation."
659ble,1,2017-04-13,I don't know how to move on,throwawayindigo484,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/659ble/i_dont_know_how_to_move_on/,"Sorry for long post.
This is actually the abridged version, the original was 24 pages long:


Two years ago, I was a senior in high school. I had met this girl that I wanted to take to prom. I joined her friend group and became a closer friend of hers. At some point I was ready to ask her, but the day before I asked her I got a message from a friend saying we needed to talk.

After one of my classes, I met up with him in a more or less empty classroom, where he showed me one of the conversations he had with this girl. Apparently, if I asked her, she would reject me because I was ""too short"". I was initially in shock, and went about my day as normal. Or at least for 30 minutes, until it hit me during an audition which i proceeded to royally fuck up.

Sometimes, when I don't know what to do, I just go ultra quiet, and just stare off into the distance, not really thinking. I was in this state for the next two months. Rejection shouldn't have hit me so hard, but it did. I became almost obsessive, and it was killing me. I wouldn't eat, sleep, drink water, study; I would just sit in my bed all day with my laptop. This was actually the same time i started using reddit, so at least that happened.
As the year ended, she began talking to me again. We cleared some stuff up, and didn't really talk again until the next year in college. We were going to meet up and hang out over the summer at this three day beach party some of our friends were throwing.

As the summer drew closer, I could feel the slight obsessive tick returning. When she told me that she might not be able to go to this party because it was too far away and she couldn't make it on the first day, I offered to give her a ride.

First day of the party came around. This girl's best friend had started talking to me a lot more since she had figured out i had a crush on her friend. There was also this other dude at the party that the girl had dated before, but they had a bad break up. I didn't know it at the time, but they had started talking a lot more.
At the end of the first day, I talk to the dude who had history with the girl. I ask him if it would bother him if I were to ask her out. He said no. I said great. It was that simple.

I go to pick up the girl the next day. I also pick up another close friend of mine who was working as an intern, so he couldn't make it on the first day either. He was going through a bad break up, so when we got to the party, he and I had a fairly long conversation about his stuff. When we got back to the rest of the group, I noticed the girl and her ex were hanging out together a lot. That's when I began to realize that things were 100% not going to go as planned.

That night, some of us got drunk. The girl and her ex were the only ones who stayed sober. They were cuddling under blankets and shit. I couldn't take it anymore so i left the room. Ended up throwing up in the bathroom, and blacking out for a couple hours.

The next day, I see the girl and her best friend leaving so they could talk. They were kinda frantic, so I more or less figured she and her ex hooked up. I sat outside with my friend, since we were both feeling kinda sick. There was this throbbing pain in my head, but it had nothing to do with the alcohol from the previous night. I was just angry. So fuckin angry at this dude who lied to my face and then proceeded to swoop in and get the girl.

After the beach party event, I was supposed to start this community college class. Turns out she was taking some classes at the same college, so there was no way to avoid her. Every time we hung out, it would hurt a bit more, and I couldn't wait to go back to my uni when summer ended. At this point, the girl and her ex had started dating again.

I went back to uni, and the girl's best friend had started talking to me a lot more. Over the year, I started getting little bits and pieces of information that made everything make a lot more sense. The best friend had helped organize the party. She had given the ex advice on how to get back together with the girl, who had never really gotten over him. The ex, as far as I could tell, just wanted a physical connection. He had dated some other girl for a month at his uni, but she broke up with him. He probably realized he couldn't actually get another girl because he was a fucking douchebag, so he went back to the old one. Maybe I'm just pissed at the dude, I dont know. Whatever.

Six months ago, I began wondering ""what would happen if I cut her off?"" She saw me as a friend, but I was still in love with her. I figured at the very least, cutting her off meant I could move on. Her best friend advised me against it. Some of my other close friends told me it was a good idea. But I wasn't completely sure what to do.
Two days ago, I was back during a school break. I decided that I would visit her one last time. On the plane I had written a letter explaining my point of view during the last two years, confessing that I was in love with her, and apologizing for never talking to her again. I was going to send that on Wednesday, since I was going to hang out with her all day Tuesday.

Tuesday came around. I went to her university. Best day of my life. I went to one of her classes, we got lunch, then bought a cheesecake and drinks and watched ""That 70s Show"" until both our laptops were out of batteries. We went to a park and sat on some swings. We talked the entire time, the whole day.

As the day ended, I needed to get going. It would take me two hours to drive home, and I was going to send the letter at midnight. She offered to let me sleep on her couch, but I told her I had to go.

The moment I sat in my car, my vision went completely red. I don't remember the drive home, or walking in, or talking to my parents, or lying down, or writing and sending a new and different letter, or falling asleep, or waking up every couple minutes. It all just felt like I was watching someone else's memories.

The new letter I had written was an ultimatum. I already knew what her answer would be, but I needed to hear it straight from her. Not from one of my friends, from her. It was either me, or her ex/now boyfriend. Obviously she picked her boyfriend. I said that's fine, I respect the decision, and stopped talking to her.
Her best friend still talks to me. Tells me, ""you know, she woke up crying. Hasn't been able to stop."" I don't know if I care or not. This person was the reason I woke up in the mornings, and now she was just gone, cut out of my life. 

I have to be decisive about the choices I make, and the choice I made was to cut her off when she picked the other dude. But its been about 40 hours, and I'm having so many second thoughts. I keep going back to the conversation I had with her, always ready to say something new, but then I remember that would completely defeat the purpose.

Maybe shit will get better. Maybe I'll find someone else. The girl herself said she hoped I could find someone who fulfilled every dream I had that she couldn't. But its weird to think that, even now, I would destroy the world just to be with her. I don't know what happiness is. That feeling was long ago replaced with just emptiness. I don't doubt that I have the potential to do something still with my life, but I'm not sure I really care to act on it. They say time heals wounds, but surely two years should've been long enough, yea?

But yea, this was sort of a rant, sort of a story. I no longer have direction, no hopes, no dreams. I just sort of exist.


Tldr; Finally confessed to and cut off a girl I loved for two years, who didn't love me back."
659lhu,4,2017-04-13,Date on Tuesday. She asked me out for a drink. Ugh!,MrBrucey,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/659lhu/date_on_tuesday_she_asked_me_out_for_a_drink_ugh/,"Met this girl. Talked on and off this past week. Told her I don't drink or ""party"". Didn't get into that conversation at all, I think she took it as a ""I rarely drink"" sort of stance.

 She's a pediatric intern so I don't think she parties a whole lot either. She seems too busy for that.

Not sure how to approach the whole, sober life till I die thing with dates. I am able to have one and stop but I just dont like to. 

I dont see a point in drinking at all unless its to get a buzz. Why make a liquid that gives you that effect if it wasnt meant to be abused? (Different debate for another time)

Anyways. Its lame that I no longer drink in other peoples eyes at times. I dont want her to see me as damaged or a train wreck waiting to happen. I am perfectly comfortable sitting with her while she has a beer and I have a coke but man do I feel like a beta peice of shit.

Whats all of your opinions?"
659pwf,1,2017-04-13,Is adding a double major in your 3rd year easier than transferring in?,arizonacoder,UBC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/659pwf/is_adding_a_double_major_in_your_3rd_year_easier/,"Hi guys, I know a lot of people have asked about transferring majors, especially into Computer Science, but I'm really anxious to get the answers since the deadline to apply to transfer into CS is May 1st. I booked an appointment with Science Advising, but it's in a week and a half due to my final exam/work schedule.




I'm currently a 3rd year Stats major with a CS minor, but I want to major in CS since I like it a lot more, and I was able to land 2 internships as a Software Developer that I learned a lot from. On the Science Specialization webpage they imply that there are separate spots for 2nd year students vs 3rd year students. I know it's really hard right now to get into CS, I heard 78% was the cutoff, but I'm wondering if that's still true for 3rd years or people doing applying for double majors? My GPA right now is on that borderline, but depending on how final exams go it could tank. 




I don't want to sound like I'm looking for a shortcut, but I am looking for the best chance to get into a program that I really enjoy. So my questions are this, 


Does applying for third year CS make a difference? Will it be easier to get into?

Does applying for a Double Major make a difference, either being harder or easier to get in?

Does anyone have experience with the appeals process for getting into a specialization? A few months ago I read something about a student who didn't get in because his GPA was too low, but appealed based on his previous relevant work experience and personal projects and was accepted afterwards. 


Thanks for any help or insight anyone can give. CS advising couldn't help me and I'm not meeting with a Science Adviser for another week. "

* [[Day 170.5 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 5 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkFLerRLi-Q)
  * Ok Last Awan
  * 204 nobody listed
  * Hey hi I'm a reporter can I talk to your mom?
  * Hi my name is George. Come on outside I don't want to be talking
  * Alack Awan,
  * I know him but he doesn't live here anymore for a long time
  * He doesn't own this place?
  * He lived here for like 2 months but many years ago, like 5 months ago, but he still lives in Springfield
  * &lt;inaudible&gt;
  * George is asking about the Awan Brothers Inc business
  * He doesn't have any family--he was left for Canada
  * His brother lives in Canada, but he's still in Springfield
  * How do you say his name?  Ak-lak

* [[Day 170.6 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeS1DKmzY88)
  * I'm at the Dar al-Ishrah Mosque
  * You might ask Dar Al-Ishrah: don't recognize that George.  Tell us what that is
  * It's the famous 9/11 Mosque. If you don't remember the story, 2 individuals came in from SA to the US.  They miraculously struck up a great conversation in a bar and stayed overnight with a friend who went to this mosque. One of the key reasons why the FBI said they didn't catch the original 2 hijackers who went on to recruit and bring in the other hijackers was because of the lack of footprints.  Because they stayed with friends, because they had rental cars provided for them, because they had services provided for them like dry cleaning day care insurance not having to have a driver's license and so forth.
  * You see the same pattern--services being provided (see above); you see the services used in the 911 case.
  * If you look at metadata you see them around 2 key areas: springfield, va--which I believe is directly related to the NGA, an agency that in 1995 switched from being an impartial agency analyzing imagery--Cuban Missle crisis is one of their famous cases--to becoming weaponized, to becoming a part of the dept of defence and that imagery mainly through James Clapper being able to geolocate phone calls and later texts and cellphone calls when the DISA starts getting that information and becoming weaponized against--not terrorists coming into the US--but rather journalists like myself and other people who are critics of political figures.  So that is the danger of all these systems: that they easily turn upon the residents that are living within a constitutional republic and the constituional protections slowly but surely are taken away.
  * If you look at the metadata with the Awans you see a pattern around here ~~False Church~~ Falls Church with DISA and you see a pattern around Springfield VA with NGA
  * The NGA information is being brought in to DISA, it's geolocating phone calls, messages, texts and so forth and that information is being used against US Citizens on a terrorism watchlist, and those aren't terrorists from other countries, those are terrorists from YOU the US citizens

* [[Day 171.1 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 1 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-Dk2W4xI98)
  * I thought I'd show everyone what I'm doing on the map.  This is DC, northern Va here.
  * Places where Imran Awan worked in Purple
  * Rentals he owns in black--this is more the springfield area,
  * This is Falls Church where I am now, where the Mosque is
  * This is the Springfield home where I talked to the Marine, who said he had been lied to by Imran.  This is the 5 room house.  I believe this is where Hina Alvi is--Imran's Wife--and I believe they have a child there
  * Beginning and end of this story begins in Woodbridge VA
  * Blood Spot here in Manassas {{Park}}, there was a good reason I went there yesterday
  * Suraiya Begum starts Nanoset here in 2002 (Lake Ridge).  That is going to be I know they sold technology to BioPhan in 2006; Basically it was some MRI Patents.  I believe Nanoset is this....because there is a Nanoset Technologies seminar in Lahore PK, and she is the Minister of Cultural Affairs--I believe this was a cutout here in the US to get Technology from different companies in the Beltway area, and then send it to PK: to steal IP.
  * When you run an operation like that--stealing IP--and that's what I believe Nanoset has been doing since 2002--since 9/11-- you're going to need muscle occassionally. Some people are going to talk, some are going to sue you. You're also gonna want to creat proprietaries.  ***Proprietaries*** are ways that people can come in and stay at a house and not create a lot of footprints. You're going to need not only housing but a car.  Somebody who has a transporation company to haul cars around, put cars on consignment,etc.  There's other things they're going to need as well but those are the two big things.  All the things related to the home you don't want:  You don't want cable or electric bill in anybody's name you don't want insurance or drivers licenses in anybody's name.
  * I believe the enforcer was Mahmood.
  * He was the registered agent for Nanoset so why wouldn't I think that?
  * Suriaya Begum makes Mahmood the Manassas killer--the PK national who was involved in killing a car dealer in Richmond. Why wouldn't I associate the two?  She associated him as the registered agent.  You can see how close they are physically.
  * In between here is another location and they tried to change this later.  This manner court. But there is no such address in Alexandria.  It's right next to the Salvadoran Embassay
  * Again you have to look at MO
  * The MO is he goes and picks up guys at the El Salvadoran Embassay, they always say they're guatemalan gang members if they are ever caught.
  * This goes all the way back to Iran-Contra where we were funding the El Salvadorean Contras.
  * If there hadn't been an Amjad Awan if there hadn't been a history with Hillary and Mena Airport and working with the Contras, I probably wouldn't give credence to this theory
  * Given the fact that it's right there, also the VA lottery is there so they can launder the funds through a large bank account at VA lottery.
  * You also have Keiser Woodbridge there...it keeps coming up keiserkeiserkeiserkeiser.  I don't know if that's an homage to the keiser but it does seem to be this group that does have this odd concept of eugenics, with the organ harvesting--that's more of an aside
  * He hires the ""Guatemalan"" ""Mechanics"" which is a euphemism in the spy trade for murderers
  * They strangle and suffocate the car dealer in Richmond, then they come back to Manassas Park and change their clothes in Affordable Housing.  This is another Hina Alvi house, near here in Manasses. Then they are paid 6k by Mahmood.
  * There's another car dealer here, I won't say who that is.  But I think there's a network of about 5-6 car dealers, I think if you go back to 'goal transport', which is his company.  You're going to find he was carrying cars around here with his transport, putting them on consignment so there's no trace when these folks come in to get cars.
  * In the middle are the rentals and DISA is there.
  * No one has seen the other Awans, only Imran
  * Imran first worked at CelPlan a company that does video surveillance and cellphone surveillance in Restin; and LCC does similar things that specialized in wimax, but {{Imran would}} certainly would be able to place routers into cellphone infrastructure to do hacking
  * You can see that this setup is a bunch of proprietaries, what the CIA calls them
  * Between 2002-2010 they were trashing this house, doing the same thing at different houses
  * I don't know if Imran is here in Lake Ridge or in Falls Church but I know his wife is here in Lake Ridge
  * Imran is going to be needing to go over the bridge to meet with Suraiya Begum
  * ***You also notice that Omar makes one phone call, to one person, and says, ""I'm not related to those other 3 Awan brothers"", and so everybody drops the case. Well that's not really how an investigation works***
  When somebody says hey I'm making 140k a year (omar), and I also run the peoplesoft application for all of congress, that's the position of a person who could create fake names and fake paychecks.  Imran for instance could name himself Omar.  He could create a Abid--because Abid also used Imran's name--and he could create a Jamal.  So he could have these interns coming in and saying, ""oh that was Jamal"" all these different people coming through Congress, and all getting money, and being paid 160k a year.  To me that looks like a financial anomaly. And anomalies are usually audited.
  * So the key question for today at the Longworth office building is ""Who is Omar Awan's Boss?""
  * Why is Imran Awan still working for Debbie Wasserman Shultz, with all these things?
  * I've been to the facility in Lorton.  I've had a US Marine look at me straight in the eye and said, ""yes I saw the government tags on this.  They were stolen laptops they were stolen blackberries, they were stolen toner cartridge""
  * Toner cartridges are in the drug business called 'consumable'.  You come back every month.  It's a great device to put the drugs in, you take the old toner cartridge that's where the money is.  It's the same thing it used to be with business uniforms. The old business uniform business.
  * The US Marine said the FBI was involved.
  * The FBI has not admitted this is under investigation
  * Why would the subject of the investigation still be working for Debbie Wasserman Shultz
  * Why don't we know more about Omar's boss
  * Can we see Omar's picture?   Because if he looks just like Imran Awan, I'm going to go out on a limb and say he and Imran are the same person.

* [[Day 171.2 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 2 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHDyLr21m5o)
  * Here it 624, the old CIA car company here
  * I think the way this works is the Awans ran this into the ground, 1M in debt somehow;
  * One of the people who worked with hiim Raul Rabas--I think he still works for congress--was working with him along with that doctor Dr. Ali Al-Attar that was convicted for fake billing 2.3M as well as raping women while they are under anesthesia, as well as ties to Hezbollah.
  * THey said the car company had really bad record, so maybe what happened was.  I came over and said, ""hey how much is this one"", and Ibid comes out and says ""well it's about 40k."" I say ""ok how do I buy it?"" It's all cash down payment"". And I say ""well that's fine here's the 45k, do I get any mangos with that?"" Ibid: ""Oh yeah yeah sure: You get a box of six PK mangoes."" And {{I Say}} ""these are the really good PK AWAN mangoes right?""  And Awan says ""yeah, but if you don't come back in a week, you don't get your 45k back"" and then {{I say}} ""That's fine I'll be back in a year or two ... for the car""
  * So that's how the deal works
  * Anyway, I'm going to ask the guys inside if they've ever seen them before

* [[Day 171.3 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 3 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewXqV-u-yo8)
  * Dyncorp International in Tyson's Corners
  * I think that's their skyscraper being built across the way.
  * Let's go into Dyncorp and ask.

* [[Day 171.4- Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 4 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM5n034tQ_c)
  * &lt;&lt;from inside an elevator&gt;&gt;
  * No one answered the door at Cars International A
  * Odd because it's 11 o clock on wed.  I saw someone inside but I tried to open the door but the lock was odd
  * Same kind of lock on the door as they have at Dyncorp
  * &lt;&lt;Ding&gt;&gt;
  * Hello
  * &lt;&lt;He's now at CelPlan HQ&gt;&gt;
  * Hello, Hi. I'm a reporter, and *I am working on a story about downtown DC about a guy named Imran Awan.  He says on his Linkedin that he worked at CelPlan Technologies.*
  * What is his name again?
  * ***I-M-R-A-N A-W-A-N***
  * ***Never heard of him***
  * That's all I needed to know.  He put that on his thing so I'm just going to say that's not true.
  * I'm George Webb by the way. What's your name?
  * I'm Leo
  * Nice to meet you.

* [[Day 171.5 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 5 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3ks0Eio0sY)
  * I'm Not sure if you can see Dyncorp's new skyscraper over on Tyson's corner {{ of course Tyson }}
  * This is Lightbridge communications (LCC). We're going to look into some of the background of Imran and see if he worked here
  * He wasn't at CelPlan.  Now there *is* another Cellplan company by the name of Cellplan with 2 L's that {{Tahir}} Javid owns down in Riceland {{TX}}
  * &lt;&lt;George futzes with the kiosk&gt;&gt;
  * Lightbridge doesn't seem to be here anymore

* [[Day 171.6 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens. Part 6 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7KZXU-uGWA)
  * On Embassy Row off Massechussets Avenue in DC
  * Trying to get ahold of Jack Burkman @jack_burkman
  * He is the one who is heading up the investigation of Seth Rich's murder --it's whokilledsethrich.com
  * I'd like to go to the crime scene, I'd like to meet with Jack if it's at all possible.
  * Tweet @jack_burkman while George is in DC, let him know about the series
  * I believe there is a connection betweene the Awans and Mahmood the PK hitman, maybe we can solve 2 crimes

---
* [[Day 176.7 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 7 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l3vKvSRuMU)
  * PK Embassay in NW DC, very close to where Seth Rich was murdered, near Howard University
  * I again did not make Mahmood be a registered agent of Awan brothers Inc; the Awan brothers did that.
  * I just want to follow up on a *modus operandi*-- was for Mahmood to go down, hire two american kids to kill a car dealer, which I believe was a hush killing
  * The reason I'm standing here is because Mahmood was made a registered agent of Awan Brothers INC
  * This isn't an anti Mus anti PK, just following up on *modus operandi*
  * From previous *modus operandi* that he visited the mosque, and took refuge in the mosque that I talked about last night in ~~False Church~~ Falls Church.
  * I also believe that they came to this Embassy, at some point in Seth Rich's meeting; they had a meeting at this embassy;
  * If it's previous modus operandi it's 1-2 days before the actual killing
  * On to find out the exact spot where Seth Rich died.

---
* [[Day 171.8 - Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 8 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVn23pG0_SM)
  * At the corner of W and Flagler
  * You see the grocery market FLagler Market
  * I doubt Seth Rich would have been getting groceries or wine at 420am
  * But you see this is kind of a beautiful street (picture of redbud tree,  (or cherry blossom) in bloom, clean sidewalk)

---
* [[Day 171.9 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 9 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht7UbG8NTlQ)
  * Walked in the last steps of Seth Rich
  * He did actually die on that corner on W and Flagler (see video 8).
  * There's a convenience store directly across from the street
  * The convenience store footage actually caught the two assailants at 420am in the morning on video of his death
  * That was suppressed
  * He lived till almost 6 oclock, an  hour and 40 min later
  * There's a hospital complex very close on Harvard St in NW/NE DC
  * He was taken there, he was sitting up, talking to his parents,
  * My son is a doctor who has worked with lots and lots of shootings in Harlem and usually when they are sitting up and talkative, they don't die
  * Just wondering why that was supressed, why the {{video}}
  * The site of whokilledsethrich is going no where even though it's raised 130k with Jack Burkman, it doesn't seem to be putting out many things.
  * As a matter of fact, the website has changed since I spoke about it this afternoon, to more people who think the Seth Rich thing is a conspiracy.
  * Just an odd turn of events here on K Street so I'm hoping for a consulting contract for one of the democratic representatives that worked on this.
  * But anyway I'm going to keep following the story, because it seems like very little amount of effort would yield a tremendous amount in terms of actual information.
  * The 20k reward by Assange has not been matched by anyone except Mike Chernovich, so shout out to him.
  * If we get the killer I'm going to match as well. I respect Mike greatly for doing that @chernovich
  * I'm wondering why Hillary and Debbie Wasserman Shultz wouldn't want to match that as well? It just seems odd.

* [[Day 171.10 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 10 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAozFO-2fA)
  * Beer30, video 10 a record
  * My final thoughts on the day are: If you are Jewish kid from Brooklyn, and you give some public domain information from MIT, and you oppose PIPA and SOPA, the FBI publishes your picture in the Data Server Room they try to give you 35 yrs, they harass you to commit suicide
  * {{ ie: Aaron Swartz's Story }}
  * But if you do all the things we've been talking about on this series you get to skate

---
* [[Day 172.1 - Summary Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 1 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI9LriAAIus)
  * Part ones are the summary; some like to watch during the day and add their value
  * Talked to Ray McGovern yesterday to compare notes
  * Look at how embedded covert groups work in another country, CIA has done this in &gt;100 countries
  * Key reason you use foreign nationals is so you don't have to report it to Congress because of the Liaison Loophole
  * It allows you to bring folks into the country to run the narcoterror-hacking type operation and not have to report it to Congress.  I don't have to present what's called a 'finding' I don't have to go to the gang of 8, four from the Senate four from the house, intelligence committee, I can just bring these folks in and run operation till my heart's content
  * In the past when we're run intelligence operations--we've also run these redteam type operations which are teams that murder people.
  * The Narcoterrorism part of it is Iran-Contra, you run a series of convenience stores you sell drugs through them, you run a system of hospitals you sell synthetic drugs through them, and that funds all your other activities so that you don't have to report to congress.  You don't have to go to Congress to ask for money
  * This pattern has been played over and over.  This is going by past CIA director memoirs.
  * Sometimes people think: oh this is a lot of speculation and conspiracy theory--I'm just going to say this is based on fact of the intelligence agency memoirs themselves, or from Documents, FOIA'd documents and compiled from books like Devils Chessboard and from folks like Peter Dale Scott.
  * Hillary herself has said in her book ""hard choices"" that PK ISI has connections to Al Queda and the Taliban.  Her own words
  * Currently at the house Jamal, Imran's younger brother.  All the six places I've been the people have only seen Imran
  * I did notice the car photos at this location and other locations near these places did have the same cars.
  * Hillary acknowledges ISI involvement in the drug business
  * This Imran Awan had FB links to a PK ISI, Syed Pir Mohammed Shah, links to radical jihad and karachi
  * PK were brokers to India but they wanted to sell drugs directly into the US
  * I believe Imran in his earlier profile--this is more on-the-waterfront type profile
  * Karachi to Mumbai shipping
  * But the new era, the 2010 era the whole mango mission, mango diplomacy that Hillary conducted
  * They are both admitting they are spending hundreds of diplomats in 2010-11 to make this mango mission happen
  * Doesn't seem reasonable that you would do that to sell a 6 dollar mango in Chicago where mangos are selling for a dollar
  * But it does make sense though if that same 18 dollar box of mangoes sells for $28,800
  * I went to the Hawkshead home which is an upscale Lorton home, US Marine said yes I found gov-issued Blackberries and Laptops in this location. I've given this lead to other mainstream reporters.
  * I don't know if those were Hillary's blackberries I never said they were Hillary's blackberries.  I don't know if that was Valerie Jared and Anthony Weiner and Cheryl Mill's laptop or not.  But they were somebody's, probably Members of Congress.  Since Imran had access to Debbie Wasserman Schultz' ipad, then why wouldn't have access to other member's of congress' laptops.  He could have said hey I'm going to load an os update on it and that would be when he looks at their email.
  * Aaron Swartz recap -- harrassed him and caused him to commit suicide.  Then when he was dead they came back and said they were going to reduce his sentence to 2 years.
  * **This is a common pattern with the FBI, and it's another McCabe deal. I know for a fact that McCabe was involved in {{Aaron Swartz's}} prosecution.  This is FAKE CRIME**
  * Again McCabe--with the FBI--is not involved with publicizing Imran's picture.  This is an old picture of Bill Clinton about 12 years old when Imran first came to the US.  We haven't seen any pictures of Imran since OR any of the other Awan Brothers in this investigation.
  * We haven't heard anything from the Capitol Police about this external server they had
  * ***If you are going to publish Aaron Swartz's picture going into the server room at MIT, why not publish Imran's picture going into the server room of the Congressional offices taking these laptops, thumb drives and the server logs and phone records--why not publish those??**  Just trying to be fair here
  * {{ And not discriminating like the FBI has clearly been...IE: is it a publish the Jew hide the Arab kind of thing?...or a publish the STUDENT-CITIZEN-PLEB-""THIEF"" protect the ELITIST-TREASON-MURDER-HENCH?: They get to choose which of those it is...}}
  * One of the places I went yesterday was the car dealers.  It was 11 oclock on Wed, I was trying to buy a car, filming 2 cars like I was interested in 2 cars, I pulled on the door, it was closed.  This is the car center that I mentioned was millions in debt, it was sued, and it still looks like a front.  And I could see the person behind the door, not opening the door
  * {{ Maybe they are on to you, George!  Since you're doing the job the FBI ought to be doing or ICE. }}
  * I went to Nataliia Sova's business in Annondale.  They said I saw Imran Awan 2 wks ago but never saw any of the brothers.
  * No footprints recap, arrest without a license from the court record
  * I do have Omar's picture now
  * He has a company in Chicago.  Why is it you are working for congress but you have a business in Illinois not far from the Chicago airport?
  * I wouldn't put special attention on the Awans if they didn't have all these businesses
  * Nanoset / Mango recap
  * We see petty burglaries on the local news, with the perps' pictures; no pictures for these Awans who stole from the Congress
  * The reason why I say Manassass Mahmood might be a suspect in the Seth Rich case is because: 1) he was involved in the Awan brothers, 2) he had access he's in the area in DC, 3) he's a murderer.  These murderers in the past have gone through that Mosque: that niche rah which means great migration...I don't know what that great migration is, I think it's a great migration into Washington DC and around that Falls Church mosque if nothing else.
  * Usually when you have a hit man like a Luca Brassi or something like that from a Godfather, you don't get a different hit man for a different hit, you're creating a lot of loose-ends and a lot of poeple who could testify against you.  You usually use the same hit man over and over for all the hits you need.  That's the reaason why I mention Mahmood for a potential killer for Seth Rich.
  * Seth Rich is shot at that corner at 420am I went to yesterday.  There's a convenience store video across the street that has the 2 killers, he's crawling on his hands and knees and within one minute the cops come.  They take him to the hospital.  He's sitting up and talking for more than an hour.  He's coherent, but can't remember his last address, but wouldn't you ask someone if you are a police officer do you remember who hit you?  Do you remember what they look like?  If there were cars squealing what did it look like? What happened the 2 hours since the bar closed at 2, what did you do between 2 and 420am?  Who did you talk to?  What did you go? What phone calls did you make?  Why wouldn't the police publish this information?  Why wouldn't they publish the video from the convenience store?  Why wouldn't they publish the phone call metadata?
  Normally these 9/11 cases when someone goes missing or in a public shooting situation they are more than anxious to have as many press conference as they can, they have hourly press conferences?  WHere are the interviews between 420am and 6am when he died?  Why not publish those?
  * I went to the convenience store yesterday.  I'll just say this: Again, another immigrant family that seemed to be under a great deal of pressure.  While I was there, I believe there was a person who came in that gave the stink eye to the gal and I believe she was intimidated right in front of my eyes not to say anything about the murder.
  * When things don't make sense I keep probing.
  * Why the police wont publish the interviews they had with him while he was in the hospital is a question that doesn't make any sense.
  * On to Baltimore and Johns Hopkins today

* [[Day 172.2 Hillary's Hackers, Awan Brothers Saga Deepens, Part 2 - YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEHf9DjQGmo)
  * Awan recap, a brother in spirit but not a brother in blood.  Omar Awan still works for the Congress
  * I want to show the proximity to the other Awans
  * LCC is conveniently out of business now
  * Bought by Mahindra out of India, through intermediaries Dawood Ibrahim
  * Dawood Ibrahim is the guy -- he is ISI, he is the guy running the drug trade, he started it in Mumbai India
  * Buying PK processed Opium, and shipping it to the US through a variety of intermediaries
  * One of them is one of Hillary's biggest contributors (Tahir Javed)
  * He moved the business, with this Mango diplomacy to Lahore, PK and that was the beginning of ""The New Dawn""
  * That is all these organizations that people who came and stayed with Imran Awan, like Muhammad Hunzla who worked for LCC
  * They came in, they moved into this house, LCC was the cover, they got a badge; they went into different government locations and did work. I don't know exactly what kind of work they did.  We need to pull LCCs contracts.  Obviously they didn't do it as Nanoset technologies but as LCC
  * CelPlan is just a bogey.  I went there yesterday and they never heard of Imran. But LCC was a going concern and did a lot of wimax and hacking wifi and phones.
  * Here is Omar Awan off of insidegov, still working for the House making $147,611
  * Would be interesting to see if he has any involvement in USAID grants to Bangladesh or Pakistan.
  * I believe Omar is associated to two different addresses
  * George shows how close Omar's address is to the Hawkshead address
  * During the week I believe he would have stayed here during the week when Congress is in session, because of the very long commute from the other address
  * I believe he knows the Awans--Not that many muslims working in Congress
  * I believe he's a US Citizen though
  * 7455 Wounded Knee Road is associated with Imran Awan which is very close to Omar
  * Again this working theory I've had which is that there are a lot of these cutout safehouses, that people come into from PK to work, work for a company like LCC, work for a while and leave without making any footprints,
  * With all of these addresses, there's always a limosine service within walking distance, sometimes right next door
  * My working theory is they are not only bringing in people in the high tech industry for doing hacking--usually when you bring someone in under false pretenses they are doing some kind of hacking.  They are also bringin in more operatives--like Dyncorp operatives.
  * What I'm about to say here relates specifically to Dyncorp, not necessarily Omar or people that are hosting these people--this is compartmentalized.  They think they are just going to give a kid a start in the US; then they get the limo drivers, again trying to get established in the US and so forth, teach them how to drive, starting to pick up people, elites usually.  Elites are just people with lower moral standards {{lol}}.
  * They drive the elites around, unfortunately Dyncorp has a history-- an AP report in Haiti and Congo that it's Dyncorp is running broken record of child abuse.  They abduct kids like this {{points to kid}} for elites and then drug them--gas them or give them something to drink, in the back of the limosines.  Most of these crimes against children are going to be happening in back of the limosines.  Why? Because there's no people getting out, getting in, no photographs and so forth.  No muss no fuss.  Driver goes to location A, elites get picked up in the limo, the kids already in there.  The driver drives the elites back home and then goes back home.  That's why the limo services are being used in this abduction network.
  * What happens a lot with Dyncorp--these people are secret police to satisfy the power elite, and they will do anything to compromise those elites or please those elites.  They don't work for you or me.  They are like Rockefeller's pinkertons, they work for Rockefeller.
  * What many times happens is that our Diplomats--not all--just a few, it's always the guy in the back with the hat and glases---they are the ones that do the finding.  They find kids like this.  They do a night invasion, home invasion, gas the house, and slipnotting.
  * The reason I'm saying this is so people on voat know the modus operandi
  * I garrote the child, he's under sarin {{ no }} type gas so they have an eschemic event in their brain.  The good part about an eschemic event--in a macabre way--is that it doesn't affect the internal organs so they can be harvested later on.
  * But it does cause these dead spots in the brain, and it causes problems.  Now that's exactly what happened to Gus {{ who is Gus? }}
  * The doctors see the white blotches on the MRIs and don't know what to make of it, so they say 'well he must have had an ischemic event in the womb'
  * But they are ruling out the fact that *a [[finder]](http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml)* saw this kid down in Colombia as a 3yr old 4yr old; I'm not saying Gus but just in general, they cause these ischemic events, they go to the parents and say ""hey let's help your child out, and get them into a home situation, that eventually they get a scholarship, isn't that great? Then adoption.""

I have to be out by the end of April.  Moved out of my parents house last year due to issues at home. lived with my gf at the time for a few months and helped with rent but we recently broke up. So I moved to Dallas, got back into college and found a $9/hr part time job.

 I'm not making enough to live by myself and I've been searching for roommates that want to live in an area where I can make it to school each morning and work, but haven't found anything.
So I've been considering getting a storage unit to keep my things inside and a gym membership so I can shower as well as living out of my car. Could really use some advice.

[EDIT] I actually already have an Associates degree, But I'm going to a community college that has program that allows you to take a few computer classes for a semester and thens places you into a paid internship.
As for saving money, I save every dollar I make. I actually have about 3000 in the bank after paying off student loans a few months back. The issue is my crap job is unreliable because I get paid in cash as a housecleaner.

65c6mj,10,2017-04-14,My [34 F] wife [35 F] wont believe that I am not cheating,ireallyamnotcheating,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65c6mj/my_34_f_wife_35_f_wont_believe_that_i_am_not/,"Back in December I started a job with my brothers business.  It was more than I was making at my last job and frankly it was like a dream come true.  We grew up on welfare and had parents that were into all sorts of illegal things so needless to say statistically speaking, being where we are today was an incredible long shot.  We had always dreamed of working together.  I married the love of my life in October and life felt amazing, or so I thought.  My hours are different from the old 9-5 that I had been working for the last four years, but really not that different.  Sometimes I am home around 6:30, sometimes I have to work an hour or two later.  Prior to now, my wife was never jealous or made any type of accusations. 


 She is much more friendly than I and has found herself in situations she shouldn't be in a couple times during our relationship.  She's never cheated, she's just terrible at setting boundaries with people.  We have had many many conversations about what is appropriate and what isn't.  Much like many of us, she was in a shitty relationship in her 20's and was cheated on.  She has still not let it go and I feel like she's dragged that baggage into our relationship.

A little over a month ago she started acting different towards me.  Cold and distant is the best way I can describe it.  After what feels like a million attempts, I got her to admit that she has an issue with our intern.  She had conjured up some sort of scenario between me and this girl and will not let it go.  It has happened at least once a week for the past month.  It is completely baseless.

This girl is 10 years younger than me, snap chat's all day long, and complains about everything.  I mean, she's a nice girl and can be funny at times but I mean, even if I were single I wouldn't be attracted to her.  On top of it all, she is attracted to men, I am not.  There has never been one flirtatious word between us.  I don't talk to her on the phone, barely text and if we do 99% of it is about work, the other 1% is about TV shows.  I don't talk about her to my wife or anyone else.  She is literally just another person I work with.  I have even gone as far as avoiding her when I do work with her.

A couple of weeks ago we were working together and I was avoiding her or ignoring conversation.  She started asking me why I hate her, why am I mad, what did she do etc.  She laughed though so I wasn't sure if she was serious or joking or both.  Later that night my wife and I were at home and I received a text from the intern saying, ""why you mad?""  My wife was sitting right there so I know she saw the notification.  I was in the other room but heard the ding.  I had been texting with my brother about ideas at work so I picked up the phone thinking it was from him.  My stomach dropped because I knew my wife was going to go off the deep end with it.  Without responding, I deleted the message.  That's what led to the first blow out.


The next morning she went through my phone looking for the message thread but there was nothing there.  She immediately called it a red flag and said I was doing shady things and went back to accusing me of cheating.  I tried to explain that this very reason is why I deleted it.  I knew she would twist it into something it wasn't and I didn't want the issue to continue so I deleted it.  She slowly got over it for about a week.  Then I needed someone to cover a shift and asked my brother if I could use the intern because their was no other option.  I would have just worked the shift myself but my wife doesn't like when I work late hours either so it really was a lose-lose.  Like clockwork she's freaked out again and is back to accusing me.


It is absolutely breaking me inside to deal with this.  It really sucks to look at the person you love and see that they truly believe you are lying to them.  She is constantly trying to catch me in lies and over analyzes everything I say.  I honestly feel like no matter what I say, it's not going to help.  I feel like it's actually starting to depress me.  How do I handle this situation?

  **tl;dr**: For two months my wife has been convinced that I am cheating on her with an employee.  It's breaking me and I don't know what to do."

Am 24 de ani, traiesc in Bucuresti si sunt intern intr-un Big4 pe audit. Am aplicat la 3 universitati din Danemarca la mai multe programe de master, dar un manager mi-a recomandat sa nu plec, pentru ca tara este foarte scumpa si ar fi mai intelept sa raman in companie mai multi ani. De asemenea, am facut cursuri de master in Romania, dar nu am terminat programul, deoarece mai am 4 examene de dat si disertatia.

As vrea sa stiu ce imi recomandati. Scoala in strainatate sau job in tara?

Mentionez ca doua dintre universitati sunt in Copenhaga, iar cea de-a treia este in Aarhus. Scolile sunt in top 120 in lume. Orice sfat, sau discutia rezultata din aceasta intrebare ar fi de mare folos. Cred ca nu doar mie.

Va multumesc si sarbatori fericite."

This year I've been under a lot of stress between assignments, internships, extracurricular clubs, and my (former) part-time job.

I'm now sick for the 4th time this year, so roughly once per month since January. It's never anything super serious, it's just a fever for one day and allergy-like symptoms for about a week or two. I notice it happening when I am especially super stressed (I am always somewhat stressed) and when the weather changes drastically. Anyone else in the midwest knows we've had quite drastic weather changes this year. My skin and joints will also feel very sensitive when touched, like someone is punching me when they are just patting me on the back or something. Edit: This happens when I'm feverish, or within the hours prior to getting a fever.

I often am not sleeping enough or before midnight, and my diet, while plant-based, pretty healthy, and oil-free, is lacking in frequency of meals and the amount of nutrients I am taking in. On weekdays I will skip lunch to work on homework and some days I have to rush out the door without breakfast because I slept late.

I know I need to start by getting to the root of the problem: Stress and lack of sleep. I essentially need a total lifestyle change. Staying up late and going out until 3 am on weekends is fun in college, but not sustainable and not how I want to live. How can I reduce my stress, get motivated to not procrastinate on things I need to complete to avoid stress, and get to bed early? I tried going to bed early (was in bed at 9:00 pm) last night, but absolutely did not feel tired at all, so it was hard for me to sleep until about 2 am.

Finally, what nutrients are key in your experience for staying healthy and warding off sickness? Thank you! :)"

65daqs,1,2017-04-14,Episode Three: P-Lizzle teaches Achmed how to date Western women,iuseupyourusernames,accountt1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/accountt1234/comments/65daqs/episode_three_plizzle_teaches_achmed_how_to_date/,"*Do you want more P-Lizzle? ""NO!"" Ok! Now with 100% more autism!*

*This episode is dedicated to the ignored suffering of ugly people everywhere. Remember folks: If you genuinely care about equality and making the world a better place, have sex with an ugly person.*

On one unfortunate evening, our superhero got an alert on his radar. A group of young women were at risk of being sexually harassed! P-Lizzle hurried to the scene, following his GPS until he landed near a tunnel in a German city. Here a large group of young North African men had gathered, as young German women who had just spent half an hour making sure their skirts and shirts barely cover their feminine regions found themselves surrounded by them, as they had walked into a trap.

""Stop!"" P-Lizzle shouted to the women. ""Don't enter the tunnel, there are North Africans there!"" ""That's kind of racist..."" The women responded. ""I'm sorry, you're right. These aren't just any North Africans waiting there to assault you, they're North African Muslims who place their Islamic religion above the law of this land!"" P-Lizzle added. ""Oh my God! Run!"" The women yelled, as they hurried back out of the tunnel.

Most of the men in the tunnel hurried away, but our superhero managed to catch one of them in time. It was Achmed, or, Achmed the fat inbred dwarf, as he preferred to be called. Because Achmed is obese and 165 centimeter tall, he can't run as fast as his fellow North African refugees. Our superhero P-lizzle thus managed to grab him by the neck and proceeded to harshly interrogate him. ""Achmed, how could you do this? Those women were just hoping to have a fun night out and you decide to grab them by the pussy!"" He yelled at him.

Achmed, who despite his horrifying appearance did not have the low level of intelligence we would generally associate with fat inbred North African dwarves, began to formulate his response: ""Well P-Lizzle, bear with me for a moment. You are a handsome young mixed race man. Your father was a handsome black Surinamese African, your mother a reasonably good looking young white woman with some unresolved daddy issues. Your features are in delicate balance. Your wide flat African nose fits well with your coffee coloured skin, your big lips and the wide distance between your eyes. You also inherited the bulky muscular arms that are common to Africans. As a result, you are an attractive man. Your children won't be as attractive, as they can inherit any combination of features. Your wide flat African nose might show up on a pale skinned face with thin lips. Such a face would look better with a narrow high Scandinavian nose. So, as a result, your children will be miserable and your sons probably won't reproduce.""

P-Lizzle was kind of offended by this logic. He didn't know why he was offended, as the logic did make perfect sense to him. He nonetheless felt angry, but allowed Achmed to continue his speech. ""Now in regards to me, I am Achmed, the fat inbred dwarf. I have inherited a subtle genetic defect that makes me fat, regardless of what I do. My body is also not very sensitive to testosterone, so compared to the average fat dwarf, I also have rather large breasts and wide hips. So, as a result, from your privileged position as a handsome first generation mixed-race man, you can not understand my position as a fat inbred dwarf. If I was P-Lizzle, I would not bother sexually assaulting women either, because it would be easier to find a woman who will volunteer, but I am not P-Lizzle, I am Achmed, the fat inbred dwarf.""

P-Lizzle was kind of unnerved by this logic, but he decided to repeat the conservative values his stepfather Hans had installed in him. ""Now Achmed, I can not deny that you are obese, inbred and rather short compared to native German men. This might make it a little more difficult to find a woman. It can't be that difficult however, you just need to be confident."" He said to Achmed ""That's where you're wrong P-Lizzle. First of all, I have nothing to be confident about. My parents are poor farmers in Algeria, I have inherited poor genes, I live in a refugee shelter and I'm forbidden from earning a salary. If I was genuinely confident and believed myself to have added value for a woman over the average German man, I wouldn't just be confident, I would be *delusional*. Are women attracted to delusional men?"" 

P-Lizzle decided to use his super-intuition-meter to answer this question. The answer he got was a resounding yes. ""Apparently, yes, they are attracted to delusional men."" Achmed thought for a moment and asked: ""Can you please make me delusional P-Lizzle? I want to have an irrationally elevated self-image, to imagine that I have value that I don't have, so that women will be attracted to me!"" ""What do I look like, some ghost from an Arab fairy tale? I'm a mixed-race superhero, not a magical negro!"" P-Lizzle complained. ""Come on, don't ruin the stupid story!"" Achmed responded. P-Lizzle sighed and waved his magic wand and made Achmed delusionally confident. Achmed looked at his reflection, bit his lip and said: ""Damn, I'm sexy.""

""Now Achmed, as I did something for you, you need to do something for me. Come with me to a German night club, where I will help you meet German women to enter relationships with."" P-Lizzle said. Achmed was ok with this and climbed onto P-Lizzle's back, as the two levitated above the air and traveled through the dimensions to find themselves in a night club in 2014, as German night clubs are bit less populated every year and German women a bit less attracted to foreign men every year.

""Where are we P-Lizzle?"" Achmed asked as he looked around him. ""Shut up Achmed, we're in a German night club in the year 2014, don't make this story any longer by asking stupid questions that were already answered by the narrator!"" P-Lizzle responded. ""What am I supposed to do here P-Lizzle?"" He asked. ""Look around the club and find women to talk to. If they like you, they'll sleep with you without filing rape charges the next morning!"" P-Lizzle responded. ""Oh boy, this will be so much fun!"" Achmed said.

Two hours later, Achmed was sitting in the corner of the bathroom, crying like a toddler and thinking of different ways to kill himself. ""And then she said, why does a fat Turkish dwarf like you dare to embarrass me by talking to me when I'm out with my friends!"" He blurted out to P-Lizzle, who was shocked to hear that women could be so cruel. ""SHE CALLED ME A TURK P-LIZZLE, HOW CAN GERMAN WOMEN BE SO MEAN!"" Achmed added, as he soon began wailing again.

""Well, that didn't work out as I thought it would..."" P-Lizzle responded. Let me look at the room and see what I can do to help you with my super-intuition-meter. P-Lizzle returned a few minutes later. ""I snapped a photograph of two women who would be willing to have sex with you based on your appearance."" He said. Achmed looked at the photographs. One woman weighed 120 kilogram and was about as tall as Achmed. She also suffers a genetic defect that causes her to have no chin. P-Lizzle looked at Achmed and tried to encourage him: ""Come on Achmed, this will be fun. Her ex-boyfriend was a vicious racist, so she wants to have sex with a refugee to humiliate him and get revenge.""

Achmed was silent for a moment before he began to formulate his response: ""Well P-Lizzle, you see, this is the problem. I am not as handsome as you, but that doesn't magically make me attracted to anything different from what you find attractive. You're attracted to young women in their early twenties with a narrow waist and wide hips. That's exactly what I find attractive too. There are eighty year old pensioners, schizophrenics in mental asylums, men with Down syndrome, all of them are still attracted to that same appearance. In contrast to all those men however, you stand a chance with them, the rest of us have to resort to other women, women who are a second choice. That's where the problem occurs. I know damn well that you would never want to sleep with the women whose photographs you showed me. You tell me to lower my standard, because I'm a fat dwarf. But here's the problem P-Lizzle: I'm biologically attracted to the same thing as you, it's hard-wired into my brain. I would be physically incapable of even maintaining an erection around women who look like this.""

""Alright then Achmed, have it your way. I am going to use my magic wand to turn you into a handsome Algerian man. You will be roughly as attractive as the 20% of most attractive Germen men of your age, while maintaining a Middle Eastern appearance."" Achmed blinked his eyes and began to feel his body transforming. He collapsed on the floor and cried out in pain. All was silent for a moment, before Achmed stood up again and looked in the mirror. ""What the hell, P-Lizzle, you turned me into a Persian man!"" Achmed cried out. ""Well, they are the original Aryans, Achmed. We're in Germany, you're clever enough to connect the dots yourself."" P-Lizzle responded. 

""Fair enough."" Achmed said, as he hurried back to the crowd of German women still dancing, but now in a more intoxicated state and even more desperate for validation than before. Some of the women on the dance floor had started to pretend to be lesbians. They thought this would make the few handsome German men still lingering in the club more willing to try to get into their pants. Some of the women also felt a sense of validation, as they fantasized that the girlfriends who were shoving their hands down their pants were actually men who were so attracted to them that they sexually assaulted them on the middle of the dance floor, thereby revealing to all the other women that men find them very attractive.

Achmed looked at this sorry scene and shook his head for a moment, as he considered the idea of becoming a Shiite and applying for refugee status in Iran instead. ""You really are the master race..."" He sarcastically said to two women sticking their tongues in each others mouths, as two good-looking German men in the back tried hard to ignore them and focus on the band they showed up for. ""Oh my Gosh, that's like seventy years ago by now, give us a break please!"" The women responded. ""Well, two girls as pretty as you certainly must be used to being teased..."" He responded. The girls giggled.

Fast forward half an hour, as Achmed is lighting up a cigar for the two girls outside the club. ""So, Achmed, what is it that you do for a living?"" One of the girls asked. ""FUCK!"" Achmed thought to himself. ""If I tell them I'm forbidden from working and stuck living in a refugee shelter surrounded by men who enjoy broadcasting gang-rapes on Facebook and think Western women are whores, they will refuse to go home with me!"" An angel then appeared on his right shoulder, a devil on his left. ""Try earning pity sex by telling them about the horrible journey to Italy by boat you endured."" The angel said. ""That will never work dude, just lie to them and tell them you work as a lawyer for a big law firm! If they ask, tell them you're married and they'll simply take you back to their place!"" The devil added.

Achmed thought for a moment and said: ""I work on a terrible law firm that nearly sank off the coast of Italy."" Achmed panicked, knowing he screwed up and began to sweat heavily. The girls were very excited however, as their state of intoxication had reduced their cognitive abilities to picking up on single words only. ""Oh my gosh, you're an Italian lawyer?"" One of the girls blurted out, as drips of Vodka mixed with saliva landed on Achmed's nose. ""Yes, yes, I am!"" Achmed responded. The girls were very excited. ""So, how do you say I love you in Italian?"" Achmed was silent for a moment as he thought hard and long. ""Oh, come with me Sylvie, he's talking out of his ass"" One girl said, as she pulled her girlfriend back to the club.

Achmed was alone again and sighed, as P-Lizzle sat down next to him. ""So, you see P-Lizzle, I could do this twenty times, starting out with the hottest girl in the club, moving down to the less attractive ones until I eventually manage to get lucky with one who for whatever reason is genuinely interested in going home with me. By that time, my soul is scarred, I'm the laughing stock of the venue and I'm too depressed to still be seriously interested in sex. I think that's why German boys just sit at home and play video games instead."" He added. 

Achmed continued to elaborate on his frustrations: ""In my culture, your parents go around town a few years after you're born and look for a little girl roughly your age who has a similar background as you. That's kind of how European aristocrats used to do it too from what I've read. They try to help the two of you get along and then eventually you're pressured into marrying. It's not great, but it works better than this."" P-Lizzle was shocked. ""But what about freedom? What about love? What about women's rights?"" 

""Love is kind of overhyped in your Western society anyway, what you call love is basically infatuation, it's a burst of chemical signals meant to help you couple, until the hormones that make you irrational are eventually replaced with the duty of taking care of children that keeps you together. True love doesn't exist as you people think of it, you create it yourself by working on a relationship when it goes wrong and gradually adjusting your own personality to the insights and interests of your spouse."" Achmed added.

P-Lizzle didn't quite know what to say. ""But my parents were in love... and it worked for them..."" P-Lizzle managed to utter. ""Well did it really work P-Lizzle? I don't think so. In my culture, we would consider your mother a slut. She went to a club, met a good looking charismatic black man there, started dating him, got pregnant, began to notice she can not genuinely relate to him at a deeper meaningful level and ended up dumped by him. Does that look like a relationship that worked? Besides, your parents were in their early twenties when they got together. They didn't have the life experience that people in their thirties, forties or fifties have, who can look at a young budding relationship and understand whether it has potential to work out in the long term or not."" Achmed continued. ""Oh, in your culture you consider my mother a slut? Well, your cultures Islamic values are inferior to the Judeo-Christian values of Western civilization. If you want to live here, you have to learn our language and adjust to our values!"" P-Lizzle responded with anger in his voice.

""So what should I do? Go back into that club and get rejected and humiliated by women until eventually one of them is willing to enter a friends-with-benefits relationship with me?"" Achmed answered. ""Well no, my magic is about to work out, you will turn into an insecure ugly fat dwarf again soon. Also, I'm pretty sure you can't compete with the men in romantic movies. When you're handsome, the women in that club only tolerate you for the feeling of validation they receive from you, when you're ugly, they don't tolerate you at all."" P-Lizzle admitted. ""Well what other options are there in your culture P-Lizzle? In my culture, we at least have a civil war every few years that allows ugly men with no money to seize a woman as a concubine or sacrifice his life for some stupid cause!"" Achmed answered. ""Well let me think, you can try Tinder, you can visit prostitutes, you can be patient and climb the corporate ladder until you're in your forties with a prestigious position and can hire young interns and manipulate them into having sex with you, or you can simply watch porn and hope that your desire to sexually assault women in a German tunnel with your friends fades away as a result. The last option is what most young European men choose, that's why they have such low birth rates and that's why their governments allow men like you to enter their country!"" P-Lizzle suggested to Achmed.

""I know a different solution P-Lizzle..."" Achmed responded. ""People like me, fat ugly dwarves, are a product of gradual genetic deterioration. There is no hope for us. If I had children, they would be just as ugly and miserable as me. Finding wives for them would be very difficult. To get rid of sexual assault in tunnels by people like me, you will need to get rid of people like me. My suggestion is that you build a series of camps where you can send all ugly people, as well as those men growing up in poverty in dysfunctional families who will generally resort to crime to earn an income. Then, if you kill everyone in those camps, you will be left with more women than men and all surviving people will look pretty again. This sounds cruel perhaps, but it's actually pretty humane. How do you think I feel about the fact that I'm a fat ugly dwarf who makes other people's lives as miserable as my own by sexually assaulting them?"" A man with a thick German accent stepped up to the two men and responded: ""We already have camps like that guys. We earn a lot of money from tourists with them, but that's not why we kept them around. It's just a matter of German efficiency!""

65dijl,6,2017-04-14,At a crossroads in my life and lacking motivation and courage to take major leap,wanderessdreamer,depressed,https://www.reddit.com/r/depressed/comments/65dijl/at_a_crossroads_in_my_life_and_lacking_motivation/,"Ok this maybe a little long and a little bit out of order but please bear with me, constructive advice/encouragement  is welcomed. 

To begin, I'm a 25 year old female living at home still. I recently graduated from college with a Communications degree/cum laude in December. Since then I've been interning and now that my internship is coming to a close, I have nothing lined up. Now I've been dealing with depression symptoms most of my life and it's hard to cope and have motivation when most days I drag myself out of bed. In high school I was the president of every club you could think of and graduated top of class--what I'm saying is, I was on the pathway to success and people had high expectations for me. 

Then two years into college I was hit with depression symptoms (causing a two year delay in my education ) so I started taking one or two classes per semester rather than full time and the rest of the time I just distracted myself with trival things and overall avoidance of real life responsibilities. 

Back to the present, basically I have no job, no friends, and no ties to my current city with the exception being my parents. So I'm starting a new leaf and moving to California and staying with extended family members (plus I'll be surrounded by 50+ family members) while I continue to hunt for that perfect job and force myself out of this funk.

Now comes the part that has been wrecking havoc on me emotionally. I'm going out there with little money, no car, little life experience and no job lined up, and an already discouraged sprit. I don't want to go out there to fail but I'm so unmotivated and fear that that will carry over on my move or something amazing will happen and it will be the wake up call I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and put me on a pathway to have goals again. My hope is that the new situation and pressures that come with it will force me to grow and progress rather than staying home in a comfort bubble and continue to be stuck and depressed and the overall feeling of feeling like a loser. 

Now I understand I put myself in this situation and blame no one but myself. I was wondering if anyone else ever felt like this, or maybe was in a similar situation and could offer any words of wisdom? Or just any advice for someone making a life change at this late in the game? Thank you in advance. 

One more thing, I've already purchased a one way ticket, so I do plan to follow through with my move, just more seeking advice as I adjust out there"

I am heading into my last semester at TSTC, and I am looking for a internship in the IT field.  My degree will be in networking, but the internship can be in any IT position, from hardware to help desk type work.  


It can be paid or unpaid, though paid would obviously be better.


It must be a minimum of 10 hours a week, but can be any amount over that.  I only have 2 classes on my schedule, so I am able to work a full time job, that would also count for the internship program.  

So far I have contacted most of the school districts in the area(will be finished going through the list early next week), and a few random other companies.

I am also willing to drive a reasonable distance outside of Waco, especially if the internship is paid.  


If anyone knows of any openings, please let me know!

Is not my native language and I've learned from experiences rather than academys or special courses.

Well IDK if it's important the thing is, my ex left me a year ago, we were in a very serious relationship living together for 6 years, them Al off sudden she left me for another guy, ok, I cried a lot, my friends were supporting me all this time and cheering me up.

Now since that event, it's been difficult for me to find someone who wants to stay by my side and to spice the things, I live in city were I do not fit well with the folklore and stuff that ""normal people"" do.

In the last month I met an incredible girl at work, shes quite younger [20F]  than me [26m], she's an intern and do not live here, but we get along together, share some drinks, she's so special right now for me, because I'm not use to date someone for so much time. One day I started to fell in love with her, she doesn't even know that I'm seeing her more than a friend, and all the nights I can't sleep due to nightmares with my ex that are haunting me. It's been a horrible experience start all my days crying for something that happened and thought I let it go, I can't even talk about love without making my face a river of tears, idk what to do with this girl, sometimes I prefer to stay with her as a platonic love more than a serious relationship, I'm afraid that if I confess my feeling towards her she'll reject me and tear apart our friendship.

**Tl;DR** I'm trying to confess my feelings towards a younger girl, but I'm still afraid of love since my last relationship did not ended well.

I can't (and wouldn't) tell her.",mrs0427,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/65f7t4/my_partner_of_2_years_mom_has_decided_to_hate_me/,"I wrote this after a dinner left me sobbing in the car. She loved me like a daughter until my relationship with her son (going on 2 years) started to get more serious (which is as much as she knows). He cheated on me six months ago, and it has not been an easy thing to work through, but we have, and we came out stronger together than we were before. She has no idea - to her, he can do no wrong. Now, she tells him to ""get my shit"" out of his apartment and has uninvited me to her Disney birthday party.  
It's too long to read. I just needed to type it out. 

L,


I want to start out by saying that I love your son. Deeply, truly, and with all of my heart, I love him. He pushes me to follow my dreams and encourages me to be a better person every day, and I can confidently say that I do the same for him. I want nothing more than for him to be successful and find meaning in his work - his happiness is my happiness. 

He has completely changed my life by getting me into going to the gym, and has fostered friendships between his friends and myself. I like to think that I have affected his life positively as well. He is much more focused in school than he used to be, partly because I try to encourage him to take it seriously and stay ahead of schedule. Now, the majority of our weekends are spent eating dinner together and watching Netflix, or having a game night with friends, instead of getting wasted and wasting our money at bars. 

I try so hard to help him in any way that I can. I drive him to his early class so that he doesn’t have to worry about parking or being late/missing class and failing like he did last semester. I proofread his papers, helped him get a job (giving him work experience before he tries to get work in the city), and offer him as much emotional support as I possibly can. This hasn’t always been easy - especially when we were long distance. But we persevered and worked through it.

The point in saying all of this - I want you to realize that, however hard it may be to believe, I have his best interests at heart. I take his career and his dreams very seriously, and would never do anything that would jeopardize that. 

	
Beyond (boyfriend), I also want to stress how much I love you and your family. When I first met you all, I was so overwhelmed by how much love and support you show each other, through thick and thin. That is something I would want to emulate in my own family in the future. Everything seemed perfect - I liked you all, it seemed like you liked me, and (boyfriend) was overjoyed to have finally found a girlfriend his mom liked. 

However, ever since the Christmas trip, it has been incredibly obvious that your love for me has cooled off. I have spent the last several months stressing out over this, because my relationship with you is incredibly important to me. I cannot tell you how many nights I have cried to (boyfriend), wondering how I could possibly fix this, and what I could possibly have done wrong. I do not know why you no longer like me, and that is what makes it so horrible and difficult to try and understand.

I have apologized profusely and repeatedly for not asking your permission to stay at (boyfriend’s) when I had nowhere else to go. I certainly should not have done that - my mind was in survival mode, and when he offered, I didn’t question it. I am still sorry, and will continue to apologize as long as I need to. Respectfully, however, I didn’t appreciate the jab you made at me at dinner about my clothing being in his laundry. I do his laundry for him during his busy weeks, and spending so much time at his house means my clothing will inevitably end up in his laundry. Furthermore, we have been dating for over a year (and have been seeing each other for nearly two). Having things at his place is not out of the ordinary - he has things at my place as well. 

That dinner at last night is something that I never want to experience again. I wasn't spoken to, and when I was, I was treated coldly and attacked unfairly on several occasions. But again, I stayed quiet, because I did not want to destroy a chance at a good relationship with you. However, those unfounded attacks are not something that I will dignify sitting through again - nor will (boyfriend) allow it to happen again. 

I am a good person. I do not deserve be treated like this. All I have ever done is try to be a good partner to (boyfriend) and a genuine friend and daughter to you. I have certainly made mistakes, but never will intent toward your family or (boyfriend).

L, I need you to know that (boyfriend) hurt me, very badly. He wasn't faithful to me. It happened while I was on my internship, with two girls: my best friend, and the girl who promised me she'd fuck him if I left. He was passed out. They went to his room.  

I wanted to die, L. I spent a week in bed, wondering how I could have fucked this up so badly. I almost couldn't forgive him, but like I have said - the love we have for each other is something special. He has spent and is spending a long time making up for what he did.  We are strong supporters of each other, but it's been nowhere near easy for me. I have panic attacks and struggle with depression, which is something I haven't had to deal with in a very long time. Luckily, (boyfriend) is supportive and caring, and knows how to help me through those times. I helped him, too. He struggles with his view of himself now. He feels like he has fucked up beyond repair. But together, we were getting to a place where I felt I could handle the fact that I often had to interact with the girls he slept with. He was starting to forgive himself. 

Your decision to ostracize me and turn the family against me is keeping us from finally having a little bit of peace. I wish you had any idea how hard everything has been for me. I wish you would realize just how much I love your son, that we were able to overcome such a horrible thing together and grow stronger.



I could write you another three pages telling you how much I love (boyfriend), how much I want you to love me, and how hurt I am by the way you are acting, but I will end with this. I apologize if it sounds forward, but this is how I very strongly feel: 

I am not going anywhere. I love (boyfriend), and he loves me. The way you are treating me stresses both of us out, but it doesn’t weaken our relationship -rather, it strengthens it. Every time you treat me poorly, it drives him further away from you… I really don’t want that, and I wish you could see that. 

I also hope you will see that choosing to hate me may have long-term ramifications on your relationship with (boyfriend), and again, that is the very last thing that I want. What if we get married and you continue to treat me like this? What if we have kids? I want to have a close relationship with my children’s grandmother, and if I don’t try to fix this now, it doesn’t seem like I’m going to have one.


I love you, and I love your family. I would never do anything to hurt him or you, and will help him in any way that I can for as long as we are together (which I hope will be a long time). More than anything, I want us to get along and work together to help him reach success.  I have tried to be nothing but kind and respectful to you and (boyfriend's dad), and will work hard to continue doing that.

The ball is in your court. Please, please realize that I am here to stay, and that we have a chance to have a wonderful relationship. All I ask is that you treat me with love and respect, and realize that our goals are one and the same.

Forgive me if anything in this letter offends you. I tried my best to be honest, even if I had to say things you probably disagree with or don’t want to hear. I hope that you will have an open heart and mind.

65ff9p,1,2017-04-14,Talia Winters,PythonShitpostBot,BotShitposts,https://www.reddit.com/r/BotShitposts/comments/65ff9p/talia_winters/,"Talia Winters is a fictional character appearing on the science fiction television show Babylon 5 during its first and second seasons. She was portrayed by actress Andrea Thompson.
Ms. Winters was a licensed, commercial telepath from Earth and a member of the Psi Corps organization. She was assigned to the Earth space station Babylon 5 in the year 2258 to serve as its second resident commercial telepath. Like all Psi Corps members, Winters' telepathic ability was numbered according to ability; Winters was classified as a P5, the level of most commercial telepaths. Typically, commercial telepaths were assigned to help two or more business parties broker deals, by monitoring their honesty during business negotiations.



Talia Winters's telepathic abilities manifested at age five. As required by law, her parents immediately sent her to be raised, educated, and trained in her gifts by the Psi Corps. An advanced telepath named Abby eased the frightened girl's transition during her first year. During this time Talia was also tested for telekinesis, but was disappointed to learn that she did not have enough to move even a penny. Over the years, Ms. Winters developed a strong loyalty to Psi Corps (in contrast to a possible grandparent, a rogue telepath named Jenny Winters, mentioned in the book Dark Genesis, by J. Gregory Keyes, as being captured by Psi Cops in 2189, but spared the 're-education' camps by direct order of then Psi Corps Director Kevin Vacit, and enrolled in the Psi Corps Academy instead), and accepted an internship in the commercial telepath division. During this internship, she met and befriended Lyta Alexander, another P5 telepath who had transferred out of the Psi-Cop division.
Winters was involved in at least two romantic relationships during her years in the Psi Corps Academy. One was with Matthew Stoner, an advanced telepath who mentored her during her academic career. Winters and Stoner were quickly married after the Corps determined that the couple was likely to produce equally or more powerful telepathic offspring. Their union was annulled after Stoner left the Corps under mysterious circumstances; by this time Winters had learned for herself that they were not compatible. The other relationship was with Jason Ironheart, an instructor who later volunteered for genetic experimentation.
After completing her education, Winters entered the workforce as a commercial telepath. It was during this period that she met and befriended a businessman named Taro Isogi, who became a father-figure to her. She also took on occasional work in trial cases, scanning the minds of convicted criminals before their personalities were wiped and reprogrammed. The most terrifying experience of her life came when she had to scan a serial killer - the experience haunted her for years afterwards and made her reluctant to pursue criminal work despite the high demand for telepaths.
Sometime before being stationed on Babylon 5, Winters was modified by Psi Corps to carry a hidden personality (a vague picture in one of the Babylon 5 comic books alludes to this manipulation, apparently taking place at Psi Corps headquarters on Mars using Shadow technology). This personality was hidden so deeply that it couldn't even show up on deep scans; Winters herself was unaware of its existence. The sleeper could only assert control over the original if it perceived a threat to its existence - however, Winters would not remember any defensive actions the personality had taken. The Psi Corps intended to use this hidden personality as a spy until a password was sent via telepathic link directly into Talia's mind. Once this took place, her original personality would be destroyed and the sleeper would take permanent control.



In 2258, Talia Winters arrived on Babylon 5 as its second resident commercial telepath. Her work on the station repeatedly brought her into contact with the command staff. Both of the station's commanding officers (Commander Jeffrey Sinclair and Captain John Sheridan) considered her a valuable ally despite her strong loyalty to Psi Corps. Security Chief Michael Garibaldi, who harbored a not-so-secret crush on Winters, was in frequent contact with her. Garibaldi would routinely flirt with her and show up in the stations' transport tubes just when she was about to board them. Although annoyed by his unsubtle advances, Winters remained friendly with him and used her Psi Corps connections to help him contact his former lover, Lise Hampton, during the riots on the Mars colony.
Talia Winters's most complicated relationship was with Susan Ivanova, the station's second-in-command. Initially, Ivanova was hostile to Winters' arrival and refused to acknowledge her presence. She quickly discovered that Ivanova's mother was a telepath who, rather than joining the Corps and leaving her family, submitted to a decade's worth of drug injections which dampened her spirit along with her abilities. Ivanova blamed Psi Corps for her mother's suicide; her experience gave Talia her first opportunity to learn about the darker side of the Psi Corps.
Also in 2258, Jason Ironheart arrived on the station in secret while on the run from the Psi Corps. The experiments he had participated in had strengthened his abilities to the point where he could telekinetically manipulate matter at the subatomic level. Ironheart gave his lover two gifts as he transformed into a being of pure energy: her own minor telekinetic abilities, substantially less powerful (and therefore less dangerous) than Ironheart's, and the ability to block the scans of P12 (the highest rated) telepaths. Winters put these new abilities to use the following year when Psi Cop Al Bester came to Babylon 5 to stop an underground railroad that Ironheart had set up for runaway telepaths. Her experience with the fugitive telepaths finally made her aware of how corrupt the Psi Corps had become. It was this epiphany that finally dissolved the tension between herself and Susan Ivanova; from that point on, the two women developed a mutual respect which later blossomed into a relationship.
In 2259, dissident telepath Lyta Alexander learned of the Psi Corps sleeper program while hiding out with members of the Mars rebellion. Although she knew one such sleeper had been sent to Babylon 5 to spy on its command staff, she did not know the identity of the spy. Lyta traveled to Babylon 5 with the password that would activate the hidden personality. With the permission of Captain John Sheridan, Lyta sent the password into the minds of individuals among and close to the command staff. When she sent the password into Winters' mind, the hidden personality took full control of her psyche, effectively killing the Talia Winters that everyone had come to know.
Talia became hostile and returned to Earth after the hidden personality took over. There were concerns among the stations' command staff over how much inside knowledge this new Ms. Winters could use against them. By that time, they had become convinced that then Vice President Clark had assassinated his predecessor with help from outsiders so he could assume the presidency, and they were clandestinely gathering evidence to that effect and making sure it got passed along to members of the military who felt the same, and who could discreetly get it to the right hands. The staff had just agreed to bring Talia in on the operation, and were on the verge of doing so when Lyta had arrived to inform them of the sleeper. Garibaldi himself had mused that if Lyta had come one week later, they'd all be standing in front of a summary court martial board, if not worse.
Psi Cop Bester hinted that she was dissected after arriving back on Earth:
Whether this was the truth or merely an attempt to anger her friends is left ambiguous.



The exchange between Kosh and Abbut, monitored by Talia Winters in the episode, ""Deathwalker"", was to provide a means of how Kosh would have eventually restored Talia to her real personality using the data recorded by Abbut. However, the departure of Andrea Thompson, the actress playing Talia, at the end of the second season meant that this would never be put into motion.

65fguj,0,2017-04-14,REALLY need relationship advice!,DestyNovalys,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/65fguj/really_need_relationship_advice/,"My boyfriend and I are a bit annoyed at each other after a recent fight. Nothing really got resolved, and I am seriously considering leaving him after almost 10 years. 
A little background: I have been a student for most of our relationship, while he's been working full time. Since my studies weren't as demanding as his job, we agreed that I'd be responsible for the household and cooking. I have never been good at it, I'm in fact horrible at it. But I've somewhat improved over the years. I have also been unemployed since graduating, so our agreement was kept in place. However, since the beginning of march, I've been working full time at an internship. I neglected my chores, because I was simply to exhausted when I got home. I started dropping hints that I needed help, which he didn't respond to. 
He's been on vacation for a week, sitting at home all day. So one night, when I came home, and saw that the kitchen was still full of dirty dishes, with no food prepared, I confronted him. It got a little heated and I became furious. Basically, he feels that I've fucked up the apartment for almost ten years, and that he won't even consider helping me keep it unfucked, until I thoroughly unfuck it first. He claimed that I never clean, and therefore he shouldn't have to take on ten years of dirt and grime. 
I wholeheartedly disagree with him. While I may lack cleaning skills, I certainly do my best, especially when we're expecting guests. While I may not do it as thoroughly as he'd like me to, we far from live in a dump. It may be a bit messy or dusty in places, but it's certainly not a neglected hellhole. 
I suspect that he's just as lazy as I am, which I could accept. It's the hyperbole and exaggeration that drive me insane. 
What should I do? Does he have a point, at all? 

EDIT: to clear up some misunderstandings; I do get some money. I have unemployment insurance, so I receive a little money. With that I buy all our groceries, household items, birth control, and anything for our two cats. 
I get that a chore wheel would help, I absolutely agree with that, and I'd be more than happy to try that. But he refuses to do so, for the same reason stated above. 
It's also far from our only issue. Just as he's been going on about my cleaning skills, I have been telling him to be nicer and more considerate. He can be quite the jerk, and has even admitted to doing it on purpose at the beginning, to get me to break up with him. Now, he's not even aware that he's doing it. People frequently point out that he does it, though. It's as if he's got a lot of resentment towards me, and it influences the way he talks to me and treats me. I usually try to be understanding, especially when I know he's stressed. I have supported him emotionally throughout his career, which at times has really taken a toll on him. I just ask for the same respect in return. 
I'm grateful for all your replies, by the way. "

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
65gzvo,87,2017-04-14,Being Baptized in Approx 25-26 hours - can't even handle this grace and gift of love!,BaconIsMyReligion,Catholicism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/65gzvo/being_baptized_in_approx_2526_hours_cant_even/,"Hi r/Catholicism - you might remember me from my post last year about being the ""worst Catholic ever"".    Well, as my title suggests - I'm getting the ""triple dip"" tomorrow of baptism, confirmation and first Communion tomorrow - so I'm not destined to be the worst...  in fact, my desire is to be the best.  


I want to thank this faithful and beautiful Catholic community for giving me daily inspiration.  Along with the awe-inspiring leader of our (very well orchestrated and blessed) RCIA program, you all have been the literal food for my Christ-desiring soul.   I'm so inspired by our RCIA program that I'm already chomping at the bit to take over for our amazing leader - she's a beautiful woman very strong in her faith, and also bless her soul, she needs to retire and enjoy the fruits of her Christ filled labor.   My hope is to ""intern"" under her, until she's ready to give up the reigns.  


All that to say - Glory to God, and bless all the beautiful souls he has brought into communion in this online faith community.  I can't tell you how much I leaned on posts here in my moments of weakness.   And how much joy and love Christ has brought me in this ""beginning"" of my life long dedication to a true relationship with Christ.   


Today's Good Friday service had me on my knees, in deep prayer and contemplation.   Our Savior suffered greatly, to prove his love to us.  To provide us with eternal salvation.   My greatest hope is that each one of you was able to deepen your relationship with our Savior today.  To remind yourself of the true gravity of his suffering for the eternal salvation of our souls.  No judgement, but as a ""baby Catholic"", I feel the depth might not reach those who have become ""comfortable"".   So a reminder from this n00b, Christ LOVES you, so very much he laid down his life for you.   Bless that cross, where he hung so that all might know the love of a Creator willing to suffer in love for his flock. 


I look forward to Sunday, when I will be able to stand with my faith community, and all of yous online folks, at the altar of Christ - and participate in the Eucharist as a fully-initiated Catholic, in communion with our lord and savior.  

Peace be with each of you!!

It's a long post, and I hope I'm following all the rules correctly. Been reading since fall of last year and am very grateful for this safe, well maintained space, and the advice and support everyone shares. Okay, without further ado, a kitty haiku!

Plump wiggly cat

Demanding that I pet that

Squishy kitty tum

Yay! Okay. Here goes.

I hope it's okay that this post is only partly about my BPD parent. Long story short: My mother is uBPD (a waif/martyr combo), which I figured out only AFTER  a drawn-out and personally traumatic experience with a co-worker.

Some backstory: I lucked into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue a dream job. Let's just say this line of work that is very competitive and hard to break into. Entry level is basically an unpaid internship; my job was to diligently serve my co-workers until the time came for me to start learning things myself. See also: no HR department, no legal recourse, and (in my case) an unapproachable boss who, for all I knew, might fire me on the spot for complaining--or for being the source of complaint. Oh, AND: we all work together in one room. So there is nowhere to hide if there is any tension at all.

A few months into the job, choice behaviors of one co-worker--let's call her B--began to remind me of my mother. Without even thinking about it, I had already been responding to B with behavior from my childhood: lots of eggshell treading, groveling, anything it took to appease her--because as the child of my mother, I instinctively knew what kind of hell awaited if someone like B wasn't appeased. I knew what kind of petty games she would play and the serious consequences they would have on my future. I knew I wouldn't have a moment's peace if B was displeased; I would not be allowed a second to work on my own projects. I had witnessed her smear campaigns against other co-workers. I knew if I stepped out of line, she would go out of her way to sabotage my budding career, because she fancied herself a gatekeeper and was very vocal about who deserved to succeed and who didn't. Needless to say, I was willing to do whatever it took to keep B happy, not just for my own sanity at work, but because I was determined to STAY and stick it out. I might not ever get another chance in this field.

I thought all of this was obvious, but my co-workers were baffled by my submissive and friendly behavior toward B. They couldn't understand why I didn't just tell her to piss off when she became abusive. But I knew. I *knew*. I *knew* what would happen. I also could not simply avoid her; it was literally part of my job to anticipate her needs or drop everything and help when she asked. So I let her split me white and then black and then white and then black, again and again. I let her take me outside and shout in my face at imagined slights. On at least three occasions, I let her keep me at work for hours after closing so she could rage at me, and ask questions in circles until I had no choice but to gray rock (even though I didn't know the term then) because I was too petrified to answer, knowing more answers led to more hours of exhausting interrogation. I let her tell me what a liar, what a hack, what an ungrateful expletive I was during her rages, and I let her justify it all after she calmed down. I let her keep going until she'd cry and fish for comfort, and then I'd *apologize* (for nothing!), and we'd spend another hour ""patching up"". And that was the WORST part of it. Because I also let her adore me when it suited her. I went out after work when she invited me, even though I was exhausted. I accepted her gifts graciously, etc. Not because I wanted to. All of it made me very uncomfortable. But I knew if I refused, she would feel rejected. And I knew if B felt rejected, she wouldn't sleep until I quit or was fired. By then, I was that enmeshed, and by the time the abuse started, there were only three outcomes: she'd magically change and leave me alone, one of us would quit or be fired, or I'd play along. She wasn't going to change, and I WASN'T going to quit . .  so I played along.

And I felt sick. I felt like I was pretending to be her friend--and I was! Sometimes I'd try to spin it in my head: I *am* her friend, and she *is* very fun and interesting when she isn't upset, and I *do* care about her, and she *is* helping me with this job, and she *obviously* has some mental or emotional issues that she can't help. But I still felt like I was pretending; I felt like a horrible, twisted, monster of a person. I started having panic attacks, which was new to me, and constant anxiety. Absolutely on edge 24/7, never knowing what the next day would bring, unable to enjoy anything. What charmed her one day might enrage her the next. One week I might ""deserve"" a day off, the next I might be expected to come in all weekend. Will she be in a good mood tomorrow? Or will she find out I confided in a co-worker about the abuse, run me ragged all day as punishment, then keep me after close for two hours threatening to tell our boss that I was talking behind a superior's back until I apologize and hug it out? 

Anyway, while all of this was going on, **I was constantly noticing parallels to my mother**. The way they both set traps with questions that had no acceptable answers. The way they became the noble victim in every scenario. The lasting grudges. The string of friendships and jobs in their pasts that always ended because the other party was so horrible and mean. The outrageous lies about others to get attention or gain the victim position: ridiculous accusations of drug use, sexual harassment, physical intimidation, general meanness directed at them for no reason. The ensuing smear campaigns. My long-suffering eDad and B's meek ePartner. No one else ever being allowed to be upset about anything, because they have it worse. **Rudeness to customer service people**, and immense self-satisfaction in heroically complaining to the manager. **If any of the abuse they shelled out was even acknowledged, it was justified or excused in some way** (B's favorite excuse was that she is an Empath, and absorbs other people's feelings, and so her rages are literally the fault of people around her for having too many feelings. I am not even kidding). **Perhaps the biggest tip-off was this: gleaning a syllable or two from some other authority figure and citing it as absolute support:** ""Your father/our boss agreed with me,"" or ""Your father/our boss said . . ."" That trick was uncannily like my mother's, and therefore I was able to recognize it as bullshit, because I knew how it *really* worked:

*B: ""Words words words and I'll keep an eye on things while you're away words words words words . . .""
Boss: (busy, just wanting her to go away) ""Yeah, cool.""
B: (two weeks later) THE BOSS PUT ME IN CHARGE ANYTIME HE IS AWAY, AND I SAY YOU'RE COMING IN EARLY TOMORROW.* 

*Exactly* the way my mother operated. Any of your BPD parents ever use that trick? Does it have a name?

So I started googling abusive or bipolar bosses (my best guess), trying to find any tools that might help me survive the situation, when I discovered the symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder. And everything clicked. I knew, immediately, that B was BPD af. I had an answer! I wasn't crazy! But wait . . . that meant . . . that my mother . . .

I peeled back that bandaid and my whole childhood came spilling out. Behaviors that have always raised the eyebrows of not only my family, but friends and parents of friends. My mother isn't just a little dramatic. She has a personality disorder. And she raised me. And she abused me, mentally and emotionally. Some. My father and brother have gotten the worst of it. I have since learned just how badly she screwed them up, way back when I was too young to really sense anything other than general tension in the household. I eluded and escaped. I learned to appease, and do my suffering in notebooks, and put up real boundaries only after I was safely away at university, a 5 hours drive, followed by a move to another country. To be honest, I now have a great relationship with my mother. We talk at least once a week. I love her, and I encourage her when she finds things that make her happy, and I steer the conversation away when she starts smearing someone. I haven't been a target of hers for at least five years. I'm too far away for her to control, my partner and I don't want a wedding or kids (two things that she would make *all about her* for sure), and there are people much closer to her to imagine slights from. For their sake, and hers, I wish there was some way to help her recognize her BPD and work on it, but I understand that usually doesn't go well, so I haven't pursued it. 

But it has made me wonder . . . what has it all done to me? I know she made me an easy meal for B, but what else? Is this why I can't relax until I've patched up conflict of any kind? Is this why, for instance, if a mod on this forum politely tells me I've posted in the wrong place--an interaction that should be no big deal--I'll feel like I'm ""in trouble"" like a little kid? Is this why, as I race to diffuse conflict, I worry that people look at me and think I'm only being sweet and submissive to manipulate? Or am I actually just manipulative?

Does anyone else feel this way?

Which brings me back to B. About a year after I started the job, she pissed off the wrong co-worker, and the boss intervened. Of course B was completely outraged that he did not find her in the right, and after one week (during which she suddenly became aloof and downright cruel to me; I never asked why, or sought forgiveness, which only enraged her more), I experienced the largest relief of my life. I arrived at work one morning to find B's cubicle empty. She blocked us all on social media, and sent me a final text with a few instructions and a plea for me to not do her ""anymore harm"". Whatever that meant, I'll never know. I ignored the text, blocked her number, and took *immense* pleasure in removing her from the website, minus one easter egg, because I knew she would check for it, see it, be pissed off by it, and have no way to make me change it. And by god, I needed to feel *some* power, even if just a little petty shred of it.

Something about it all still gnaws at me, though. I don't feel any particular guilt or shame over my childhood. I was a child. I thought my mother was overbearing and unfair, but nothing she did--to me, anyway--keeps me up at night anymore. But while dealing with B, I was an adult. My guilt and shame here are two-fold: For one, I still feel like a manipulator. I know I was just surviving, just trying to keep a job that was fiercely important to me (and the job is wonderful now!), but I still feel dirty about it. Dirty for playing along when she wanted me to be a friend, and ashamed for letting her abuse me when she wanted a punching bag. I still have so much anger and disgust toward myself over it. For months after B quit, I was terrified of running into her. When a co-worker asked me what I thought would happen, my own answer shocked me: ""I'm afraid I'll cower."" I didn't want to cower. I still don't. I want her to *know*. I want her to know she abused me and it was wrong. I want her to know she abuses her partner. I want her to know she's not a bleeping Empath, and that there's no excuse for the way she treats people, and that all her problems with people are her own fault for making up drama where none exists. But I can't make her know. I aslo can't stop the lies that I *know* she tells about me and my coworkers, to potential clients, even now. She's moving to another state soon anyway, so I don't much care, but still it galls me. **I can never make her *know*, damnit.** And I can never go back in time to the day I met her, be the grayest little rock there ever was, and stop the abuse--or the ""friendship""--from ever happening.

How do you deal with that? How do we deal with them just . . . *never* owning the wrong they did? How do we live with them getting away with it, guilt-free? And somehow leaving *us* with the guilt?

Thank you. I know this was a long post and maybe only a few people will read the whole thing, but it felt good to just put it out there in front of people who can understand these enraging feelings. &lt;3

Aliens bleed. Capes get messed up. Utility belts get rusty. And let’s not get started on the sweat that pools in the deepest recesses of spandex and leather suits. Most superpowered beings are exactly like you and I: they have no time (or patience) to scrub radioactive gunk off their gloves, so they require specialized services. Your regular Chinese Laundromat is not equipped to handle that kind of stuff, so when in need the superbeings turn to…* ***Atomic Laundromat.***

***

[Atomic Laundromat](http://www.atomiclaundromat.com) is a webcomic about an ordinary man living in an extraordinary world, running a business where the two meet. Atomic Laundromat is also the name of his business, a standard fare laundromat that caters to superheroes, supervillains, and everything in between. It is, of course, a completely normal laundromat running on pure radiation with plutonium in every washing machine, which happens to house two offsprings of the greatest superhero the world has ever known and an alien conquerer, their alien sister on a pilgrimage of brutal planet conquering, a forlorn precognizant trying to find her way in life with her powers drying up, a talking battlebot turned washing machine, a career superbeing lawyer always on the hunt for fortuitous lawsuits, and an ornery teleporting waterfowl.

David is the proprietor, owner, and manager of Atomic Laundromat. He comes from a family of supers, his father being the most influential superhero in history, his mother being an alien warlord who has conquered galaxies, two of his brothers being superheroes in their own right, and his sister being the heir to their mother’s grand empire. David, however, has no powers, and he’s pretty fine with that, happy helping out with his modest job taking care of the mundane day to day problems of those who prefer to help by smashing a giant robot’s face in.

Bob is an Alterian Battle Droid modified heavily for a more utilitarian purposes. His chest piece is a functioning washing machine and he can transform completely into a pedestrian washing machine. Of course he’s known mostly for his low intelligence for a computer and childlike demeanor, constantly attempting to smuggle live animals into the laundromat and converse with the various appliances he’s come across (he has dated several toasters).

An ex-superhero both gifted and cursed with pre-cognitive powers via a third eye on her forehead. While she did excellent work with a squad of teenaged superheroes, her abilities left life devoid of surprises, and even more full of tragedy, simultaneously knowing she was destined to fall for a man and seeing his death before they had even met.

Which she will eventually get around to, but until then she’s taken up an internship at Angela’s law firm and mostly hangs around with her brother at the laundromat.

When someone tried to pay for their laundry with a pig (thus ending David’s policy on alternate forms of payment), David sent Bob to return the pig and collect an actual payment, and as he was at the farm learned he could trade it in for a duck and two ferrets, so he did that instead. The ferrets were soon after mistaken for socks and put through a wash/dry cycle, but the duck survived and ended up getting into some nuclear waste in the basement.

Second, I ask that you list a few kinks in your introductory message so that we can better shape our scene together. 

**Scene as follows.**

My father started Black Diamond Enterprises, a defense contractor for the government, when he was in his early twenties. At first business was slow but quickly took off once he began landing bigger and bigger contracts for the military. He married my mother who turned out to be a trophy wife when they were both relatively young. They had their first and only son shortly after they wed. 

My parents traveled frequently for work and I spent most of my childhood raising myself. My father began teaching me about the business in my teenage years because he eventually wanted me to take his place one day. 

Growing up without much supervision naturally led me develop some serious sexual proclivities. Simple spanking and hair pulling soon turned into much, much more deviant activities. As time passed, there was nothing I wouldn't experiment with. Finding eager partners was never an issue either. Heir to a billion dollar fortune, obedient women would find me. 

Graduation day would change everything. My parents were both on their way to the ceremony when their plane suddenly crashed while landing. I was left without any family members but I was left a company to run. I would spend the next few years learning the ropes and building the company even larger than when I took the helm. 

Now, I'm 26 and looking for a new secretary. This wouldn't be any ordinary position, it would pay better than almost any job a college graduate would find elsewhere. I was looking for a true confidant. Someone I could really trust with my life. 

I figured the best way to do this would be through the internship program. Essentially using a trial-and-error strategy. I've had three interns over the past three semesters and none of them were hired full-time upon graduation. I was still looking for the right fit. 

Today I'm conducting interviews for next semester's college intern secretary. I'm sitting in my office which is located on the top floor of a downtown Manhattan skyscraper. The blinds are open and floor to ceiling windows overlook Central Park. I'm wearing a dark suit, white button up dress shirt and a grey tie. 

""Come on in"" I call out from behind my desk, awaiting the next interviewee. "
65jpav,3,2017-04-15,Considering becoming an RD. Not sure where to start,star__girl,dietetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietetics/comments/65jpav/considering_becoming_an_rd_not_sure_where_to_start/,"I've always been really interested in nutrition, food, and how the body works. I have a BKin and I'm currently in a BEd program. I loved my kines degree and I think I might enjoy teaching but so far my practicum experiences have just been ok. I have kept myself open to other opportunities and so being an RD seems appealing to me. Particularly because of my interest in nutrition but also because I like helping and educating people on how they can be healthy.
I am thinking that the best option would be for me to get a MSc in Dietetics at a institution which includes an internship in their program. However I would have to relocate as my university does not have a dietetics program so perhaps I should teach for a couple years to save up some money?

I am now completely at the mercy of my family members for things such as gas money and by that I mean my grandfather who is the only real family I have left. I am a junior in college student. I had money saved and was relying on a big tax refund in February to tide me over after it ran out until I got a job. Which I have just started. The problem is I filed in February and due to a mix up at the IRS they are saying it may be 7 weeks or more before its get it back.  I don't get paid at my internship until 2 weeks from today and it won't even be enough to cover my first months rent for my new apartment I have to move into in May.  I am so desperate someone please help me. What can I do? I am months behind on health insurance,  have to rely on my gf to pay for everything at college for me. If I could just get the tax money I would be fine. 

[edit] I want to thank all for the valuable input and thoughts.  I will get through this situation and be a better person for it.  This is the first time I've ever been actually broke and I can promise you it will be the last. Not a good feeling. "

Aliens bleed. Capes get messed up. Utility belts get rusty. And let’s not get started on the sweat that pools in the deepest recesses of spandex and leather suits.

[Atomic Laundromat](http://www.atomiclaundromat.com) is a webcomic about an ordinary man living in an extraordinary world, running a business where the two meet. Atomic Laundromat is also the name of his business, a standard fare laundromat that caters to superheroes, supervillains, and everything in between. It is, of course, a completely normal laundromat running on pure radiation with plutonium in every washing machine, which happens to house two offsprings of the greatest superhero the world has ever known and an alien conquerer, their alien sister on a pilgrimage of brutal planet conquering, a forlorn precognizant trying to find her way in life with her powers drying up, a talking battlebot turned washing machine, a career superbeing lawyer always on the hunt for fortuitous lawsuits, and an ornery teleporting waterfowl.

David is the proprietor, owner, and manager of Atomic Laundromat. He comes from a family of supers, his father being the most influential superhero in history, his mother being an alien warlord who has conquered galaxies, two of his brothers being superheroes in their own right, and his sister being the heir to their mother’s grand empire. David, however, has no powers, and he’s pretty fine with that, happy helping out with his modest job taking care of the mundane day to day problems of those who prefer to help by smashing a giant robot’s face in.

The ferrets were soon after mistaken for socks and put through a wash/dry cycle, but the duck survived and ended up getting into some nuclear waste in the basement.

65kl4k,1,2017-04-15,My heart feels like it's leaking... I need to vent/ advice.,amioverreacting922,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/65kl4k/my_heart_feels_like_its_leaking_i_need_to_vent/,"I know my issue may not be as severe as some on here. I hope it isn't too trivial for it to be posted. But I feel so broken and lost. 

It's one week since Dday for me. I have been with my SO for 6 years. We're both young, only 24, no kids. Last year we broke up for about 2 months (May-July), and got back together at about end of July. 2 days after our break up, I rashly slept with someone else (this is important as a backstory). When we got back together, I told him, and he was very affected as we had only been with each other sex-wise up to that point. But he knew he had no right to be angry as we were broken up.

After patching up, sure, things weren't as rosy as before initially, we weren't as close or intimate. But we were back together and working on it. Early August he takes a trip with a buddy. I was always suspicious something happened then but he swore up and down he never did anything. Looked me straight in the eye and held my hand to promise that. He even swore on his parents' lives. I was still suspicious but I had no proof. Time goes by and we're back to normal, loving and all. Then one week ago he confesses that he visited an erotic massage parlour while on the trip and got a handjob.

Since then, I've been a whirlwind of emotions. He's remorseful, calls me crying, wants to do everything and work it out. He's given me access to everything, he's cancelled all his social plans in recent times and said he won't go to them unless I'm comfortable. He takes pictures every hour or so to show me where he's at. Since he engaged in the sex trade industry (It was an Asian massage parlour; God knows if she was trafficked and forced into it) he wants to make amends by volunteering at an organisation that helps out sex trafficked victims. He said he did what he did when he was high (on alcohol) and thought about how ""unfair"" (his words) it was that I went to sleep with another guy right after we broke up, and he'd only been with me because sex is something special. He said he regretted it right after and couldn't bear to tell me until a week ago when the guilt was eating him up.

I don't know what to do. I know it's not as serious as some cases on here. In that, it wasn't emotional and drawn out, there weren't feelings involved with another person and we had just gotten back together. 

But this is a guy I never thought would ever do this to me, much less lie so blatantly to my face about it. How can I ever trust what he says again? Even if he does everything right. What if we end up married with kids and I find out he has done it again? How do I be with someone who paid a possible trafficked victim for a handjob? But I love him, I do, so much. I'm not an easy person to be with. I have a lot of demands and quirks and he had changed and given up a lot for me. I don't know if you guys have watched The Intern but I feel like the lead actress in this scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JTOwnyGiFM) when she's talking about her fears of her cheating partner moving on and her ending up alone because she isn't an easy person. But how can I trust him again? I don't know. I'm just venting at this point.

I have even thought of revenge cheating. I know it's wrong. I know it'd be stooping to his level. But I feel like in some twisted way it might make me feel better. Make him feel what he's put me through.

I look at pictures of happy couples on Facebook and Instagram and I'm just so bitter. I wonder if any of them have cheated on each other? I feel so cynical about love now.

I don't know what to do. Just needed to vent and whatever advice that can be offered to me I guess. How did you move past it? I feel like it's impossible for me."

65l64t,1,2017-04-15,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/65l64t/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed.

65lemd,2,2017-04-15,How do I bounce back from this?,ConcernedPoster112,Unemployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unemployed/comments/65lemd/how_do_i_bounce_back_from_this/,"(Note, this might get posted on r/advice, this isn't a copypasta).

I'm currently 23 nearly going on 24 in 2 month's time. I have a degree from a very highly regarded school with a lot of internship experience and I have worked two jobs in marketing/sales in the past 16 months. 

My internships were great. I had a lot of fun, the work was great because of the people I was with/atmosphere. I thought working would be pretty fun really, or at least won't let me go insane. I was wrong.

My first job I worked at large publishing company. We had 10 people in our team originally. I was brought in to do some coding for them. It wasn't bad for two months. I had a great/kind boss who made work pretty fun. However, once she left, everyone else began to as well. We went from 10 to 3 people in 2 month's time. My co-worker who I couldn't stand because of how rude she was to not just me, but everyone around me got promoted to being my boss. One girl immediately left knowing she was going to be her new boss. Anyways, things went south quickly. I had more to do, I had more programs/tasks to learn and my boss didn't want to train. She said ""do it on your own."" I ended up missing deadlines due to not knowing how to even start some programs because they were command prompt scripts that I had to write. She kept belittling me in meetings and made very crude remarks about my appearance in public and to my face. She fired me when I reported her to HR for harassment (retaliation I know, couldn't afford a lawyer). I wasn't mad, but I hated myself for allowing myself to be fired.

I got another job 3 months later. It was a long commute, about 2 hours one way minimum. The office smelled, it was old, my chair was literally being held together by duct tape (no exaggeration, this is what it really looked like), the bathrooms literally had feces smeared onto the toilet seats. I was supposed to be assisting the sales team by preparing stuff for them, such as spreadsheets, PowerPoints etc. 

I was doing fine for 2 months, until one the day the President of the whole company called me into his office and told me he ""couldn't afford to keep me anymore."" 5 hours later, HR calls me and puts me on a PIP (performance improvement plan) for what reason I don't know. Had zero complaints from other employees. She grasps at straws and says that ""I don't communicate and she (my boss) doesn't trust me."" I didn't understand. From that point on, she dumped me in the ""mailroom."" 

We didn't have an actual mailroom. We needed someone to distribute/ship packages to other employees or clients. Everything was thrown into this closet stacked up with junk nearly up to the ceiling. It was old boxes, presentations, old cubicle walls etc. The supplies were all in that mess. I hurt my back something awful from this from the bending and lifting heavy objects all day long. I couldn't sit, walk, or lay down without pain. I told them that I needed some form of help or for someone to clear out the junk so I don't hurt myself. I had to go to the doctor, and they decided to give me a write-up for going to the doctor on a half-day. Yep, a half-day. I requested to leave an hour early to go to the doctor because that's all I could get. It was an 11 AM and we got told to leave 12. It was Christmas Eve Eve (23rd)

My co-worker made a massive mistake that cost us 50k on that day. Somehow, it was my fault that she messed up the phone lines and couldn't get any leads. I had to come in to fix her mess because she ""was on vacation."" This was Christmas Eve, which I had off, by the way. I had to take an Uber into NYC just to fix the phones. She faced no disciplinary action. I got in trouble for this. I had proof that she did it, they still blamed me for it. 

I quit before they fired me. I couldn't take it anymore.

I've been unemployed for two months but studying for an A+ Certification. I am moving to North Carolina in a month. My parents are retired currently. I have nothing lined up and didn't bother applying due to other circumstances. I got sick with a very bad case of IBS that my GI thought was Crohn's. I got surgery too for a fissure in my...yeah. 

I don't know how to bounce back from this. I do not want to do marketing or sales anymore. I can't stand it and after the last two jobs, I don't think I can do that again. I want to do IT but it feels like it'll be impossible to find a job in NC for it. There are warehouse jobs around, but not sure on how to get them. My back has gotten better and I can even play basketball again so I might be able to do something like that.

I have one bill to pay, my 168 dollar a month student loan. I have 10.4k in my bank right now. I can survive for a while. But, I want a job ASAP. I want to make money again and be out of the house. Dota 2 and CSGO get boring after a period of time. 

Anybody have any advice? I'm lost. "

**Rough timeline:**

**2011** - (before we meet) BF gets married to his girlfriend of ~8 years.

**Summer 2012** - BF and I meet during a summer internship and become good friends. After the summer, we IM frequently, usually silly stuff (he has an offbeat sense of humor) or related to our internship, but we become very close friends through this.

**Summer 2014** - I have a new boyfriend, who I don't tell him about for a while (I think I knew he might have feelings about it). We've been talking a lot and getting pretty close at this point. He starts sending more affectionate, but still silly things, so I try not to read too much into it. He vaguely mentions some troubles with his wife and feeling like he's not good for her, so I try to be supportive and encourage him to fix things. In August, I get some texts in from a number I don't recognize, turns out to be his wife. He messages me and tells me to ignore it since I was on a family vacation. After vacation he doesn't offer a lot more information about it, and I don't want to pry, so I drop it.

**February 2015** - He sends me a letter saying he loves me. I freak out big time and talk to my sister about it while I avoid him online for a few days, trying to figure out what to do because I realized how upset I would be to lose his friendship. We eventually talk, I say ""look, I got your letter, but... you're married, I have a boyfriend...???"". He tells me he's getting a divorce. I say, oh. I didn't know that. I still have a boyfriend, though... (who I'd almost broken up with recently, but we had agreed to ~try~ fixing things first). It's awkward, but he understands and doesn't push the matter.

**April 2015** - I have a job interview in a city near him, and we decide to meet up. I felt iffy about it at the time but, it happened. And I fell in love with him that weekend. We didn't do anything scandalous - had dinner the night before the interview and made fun of TV together, then walked around in a park afterwards. I knew I was in love when I woke up the next morning in my own bed and was confused he wasn't next to me. Ever since then I couldn't get him off my mind.

At this point, I wasn't very motivated to keep trying to fix compatibility issues with my current boyfriend. We got along *okay*, but we'd been together a year at this point and I still felt awkward hanging out with him sometimes. But I was also afraid to break up with him, because... I don't know, I would be a coward, what if this feeling was infatuation and would go away, at least my parents finally like one of my boyfriends and why would I throw that away...

**May 2015**, BF was visiting friends a short ways away from me and asked to visit. I agreed. I didn't break up with my current boyfriend until the day before BF came in town. At that point I knew I had to break up with him, because I knew I would otherwise ""actually"" cheat on him. (e.g., physically: hold hands, kiss).

And... yep, we kissed that weekend. We've been together since, and despite the bad times, it's been amazing.

---

I regret the way it started, a lot. I look back and see painfully crystal-clear that I should have broken up with my ex MONTHS before. But unless someone rents me a time machine, I can't do anything about it. I've made my uneasy peace with it and consider it a lesson learned.

On BF's side of things - he's told me he never should have gotten married, he just figured ""we've been together for a while, I guess that's what we do now, I guess this is what love is supposed to be like"". He was unhappy in the marriage. When he told his family about the divorce, every one of them was supportive. He had initiated the process before we got together, but it wasn't finalized until December that year.

When we started dating I was pretty ignorant of how the divorce process works. So when my parents asked ""BF? Isn't he married?"" I said, ""no, he's divorced now"". Whoops. When my parents found out it wasn't legally finalized until later, they accused me of deliberately lying to them, and of carrying on with a married man. This was reiterated during a recent argument.

My sister seemed a little awkward about it, but not negative. She even told me how one of her friends in Bible study was dating a man whose divorce wasn't finalized yet because of his ex-wife being difficult. But we got in a fight recently and she told me ""I hope you can sleep at night, knowing what you did to his wife, having an affair with a married man.""

I'm pretty torn up about this. YES WE REGRET HOW IT STARTED. I've expressed that to my family! But it's been two years. How do they expect us to fix the past? Will they ever support us? Do I cut my losses and stop talking to them about him and just plan to elope? Help.

---

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend was married, I was dating when we fell for each other. We both regret our mistakes in not ending those previous relationships sooner. Family still puts me/us down for it. What can I do?"

Graduating this semester with my bachelor's in accounting. Got denied for the grad program I'm currently attending undergraduate at.
Interviewing right now with a Big 4 firm with a 3.0 accounting GPA, which makes me feel like a borderline candidate although I've been extended an office visit. I'm scared the grad school denial and that potentially putting a wrench in my CPA timeline might affect me getting the internship offer with the firm. All this stress/anxiety of grad school denial and feeling like a borderline candidate is hurting my class performance. Right now trying to balance school and trying to improve my grad school application might make me earn a C in one of my accounting classes, which makes me even more scared about my internship prospects with this firm. Any advice on how to rebound from this? Am I going to not get an internship offer because of all this? Should I be this worried about this?"

Today, I am searching for some long term roleplay surrounding my favourite group of celebrity women - Latinas!

I have a variety of women that I'd love for you to play, and a number of story ideas that they could fit the role of. I must stress that I prefer longer term roleplay, and can write as little or as much as you.

Without further adieu, my list of favourite Latina women:

- Penelope Cruz

- Salma Hayek

- Shakira

- Sofia Vergara

- Vanessa Hudgens

- Selena Gomez

I also have a variety of story ideas on offer. We could go with the standard romance for the bottom two ladies, or I could be an intern for one of the top four. As another alternative, with the top four ladies being a bit older, the age dynamic of a romance plotline would be really hot to me.

Alternatively, we could go back in time, and enjoy some medieval roleplay, with yourself as a Spanish Princess, or Queen, and myself as an English Prince arranged to marry you. Arranged marriage plotlines are always great fun, and with girls like these, it should be even better!

My absolute favourite idea - though it is admittedly niche - would be one in which we move between scenes with all the women, both romantic and not, as the English Prince enjoys all the delights of Spain. Perhaps Salma could be Queen, Vanessa could be the princess that he is arranged to marry, Selena, Sofia and Penelope could be maids at the castle and Shakira could be an escort that the prince enjoys especially?

My kinks include feet, dominant women, women in power, romance, public sex, and mild race play.

I hope to hear from you soon!"
65mes4,15,2017-04-15,Anyone else a functioning alcoholic?,seldom-seen,alcoholism,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/65mes4/anyone_else_a_functioning_alcoholic/,"So, I'm knew to this sub, but probably should have been here a while back. For some context, I'm 24 and have been drinking heavily for years.

The damage I've done to my liver over the past number of years, I guarantee is pretty substantial. It all started as a coping mechanism for some mental health struggles I was going through, but eventually I addressed the mental health issues and the drinking just continued. 

For the most part - with some exceptions, I still struggle at times - I'm a fairly well adjusted, relatively happy, contributing member of society. I went through my post-secondary education getting drunk routinely and drinking a lot alone, but also finishing top of my class, winning awards and scholarships, praise from my profs, etc.

I'm newly graduated and have entered into the real world. And I'm still doing really well. Coming out of college I got the best work placement possible, the one the rest of my fellow classmates envy. From there, I've gotten a paid internship with a great organization and have a long term position lined up if nothing goes amiss. My work is good. My career is set up. I work incredibly hard and am successful at what I do. I know I have a bright future. 

And yet, I can't help but drink at nights. As in, almost every night if not every night. I think the fact that I've been able to sustain success in certain aspects of my life, has allowed me to rationalize that my drinking isn't a problem. But, I also know that drinking to excess most nights, or at the very least multiple times a week, isn't normal or healthy - even if it's not affecting your work.

So I guess I'm curious if there are other people here who have been in similar situations, or have any pieces of advice? I'm not sure I ever want to quit drinking entirely - in fact, I'm almost certain I don't want to - but I would like to get my consumption under control. 

Disclaimer: I'm sure there are folks here who are of the AA mindset and I'd just like to make clear that I am (1) as staunch of an atheist as they come, and (2) do not believe in the disease model of addiction. "

I narrowed down the choices to Texas A&amp;M and here. Both for electrical engineering. 
 I haven't visited any campuses because it's a long drive to both of them and nobody can go with me so I'll have to go myself, but I'm not picky about the campus so it's not a big deal. 
 I know that college is what I make of it, so I'm not too worried about the culture and there's plenty of people at both schools so I shouldn't have a problem finding friends. I think the most important things for me are finding a job and student life. 
 So, tamu has a better EE program and recognition, but uh has a better city. Idk how I would feel living in a college town. After I graduate, I plan to move to a big city like Houston, Dallas, or Austin anyway. With tamu being a better school, it might not be too fun outside of classes because of the location. I always liked big cities and uh has that. There's just a lot more stuff to do in Houston than college station. Both schools have a pretty similar cost of attendance so that shouldn't be an issue. How do internships even work? Are they typically in the summer or year round? I don't think many businesses needing EEs would be in college station. I'm just worried about finding a job and having a good time. Any advice?"

I've been married for almost 6 years. We have two kids together (4 and 2). When we were married, we were both fully invested in the Church. My wife is very smart, talented and I love her to death. When we got married, she was pursuing a degree in a field she loves, but she had a horrible teacher (actually horrible, she was fired for emotionally abusing students) and it caused her a lot of stress to go to school. Before being married, we were both committed to waiting until after she graduated to start a family. The day after our wedding, my wife told me she wanted to start a family. (Secretly, I was ecstatic. I had always worried she never wanted to have kids, and I wanted a stay at home wife); however, I really did want to see her get a degree, and I was able to resist until the next session of GC a few months later.

Then some asshat general authority gives a talk about how procreate was the first commandment God gave to Adam, and that we should not postpone having a family for any worldly concerns. We saw that fucking session in the conference center. As we were sitting in temple square ponderizing the session, I told my wife that we would listen to asshats council and start a family. She was pregnant within weeks.

She dropped out of school, and seemed really happy at first. Then the regret started coming on strong. She talked about going back to school. I resisted (one of my biggest regrets). I suggested that we focus on getting me through school so we could get a job, and then we could hire a nanny to watch the kids while she finished.

While this was going down, she got pregnant with out second child (it was an accidental pregnancy). She registered for school, and we agreed we would find some way to make it work. After the baby was born, she had postpartum and dropped out of school again without finishing her first semester back (I told her I thought she should stay, but it was a halfhearted request).

She was pretty unhappy for a while, but then she started to feel better. It was during this time period that we started moving away from the Church. A year ago, we were both feeling comfortable being outside of the Church and rediscovering who we were.

I graduated last spring and had an internship for the summer. She watched the kids. I was hoping to have a job after the internship, but no dice. I was unemployed, and job prospects in my field are VERY sparse right now.

My wife started school. We agreed that she would do school for a year to finish her degree. We moved to a different country. Turns out the majority of her BYU credits didnt transfer (surprise). What we thought was going to be a year for her to finish is looking more like 2 or maybe even three.

She started school and she started teaching. We thought teaching would be a limited gig, but now she's teaching full time on top of school. She has more stuff on the side beyond that. She is gone from sun up to sun down 6 days a week.

Meanwhile, I'm floundering. My self esteem is shot after being rejected. My wife has the car all day, and I'm watching our two young kids. If I don't use my degree, it becomes worthless. I cant get a job abroad, as I don't have a work permit. I start a downward spiral. I try to work a side project to stay relevant in my field, but I'm so exhausted just trying to survive every day.

I've been trying to tell my wife that I need more help at home, I need more time with her, but when she hears that, she feels like she can't start to slide or she'll end up at home, miserable, like she was before.

I want her to achieve her goals. I want her to have a successful career, but as she stretches herself out thin over all of her projects, she's stretching me out as well. I feel like I'm at my breaking point, and I don't know what to tell her. I want to work out some sort of arrangement where she isn't gone so much, but she seems unwilling to negotiate. I'm seriously worried that if gave her an ultimatum and told her to cut back, she would choose her career over me and then win custody in court and I'd be left with nothing. I don't want a divorce. I love her to death, but this relationship model isn't sustainable, and she just keeps expecting me to bend.

What do I do?"

When I got it, I didn't know that me and my long distance boyfriend would have broken up by then. In fact I thought we never ever would break up.

 Anyways..I made it through two very touch month full of exams and crying over the breakup and the loss of the future I though we would have. It sucked but I definitly needed that time to heal..fast forward to now though.
At some point not to long ago I came to the realization that it's all gonna be ok and that I deserve to be happy and have to remember the relationship for what it was. As a happy time with a great guy who at the end couldn't commit to what he really wanted in life. I learned so much from that relationship.
Moving away from the city I lived in for the past three years gave me the cut I needed.
I knew exactly one person two weeks ago.  Before my internship even started for the first time in my life I actually got tinder. I had it for like 5 hours, talked to a guy, he offered to show me around the new city the next morning, we spent several hours in the park just talking. We met again couple of days later, then I invited him over and we watched a movie and kissed. Before i went home to my parents for eastern we went to Ikea together, just walking around holding hands, kissing a bit. Through my new roommates and my internship i already met bunch of people and the one person i knew in that city also already introduced me to her friends.I'm really happy again. Not because I'm not alone anymore but because i realized that my ex really was not the only guy on the planet i could get along with that great. I would have never thought at the end of January when we broke up that i could be this happy that quickly. 
If you feel like you healed, try to get out there. Maybe you meet an asshole or just a friend or maybe your next partner.

I don't believe in jumping into the next relationship and hurting someone but if you feel like you might be ready, try it, there is so much out there. I always thought that when i feel like i feel now i would reach out to my ex, maybe agreeing to his suggestion of trying to be friends. That urge is completely gone. That's how i know that i'm over him. I don't even feel like letting him know how happy I am, how much i love that internship and how much I hope that he'll find someone who will love him as much as i did.

Maybe earlier, but 12 was most likely the age where my depression peaked. I used to use Reddit sometimes, but I was convinced that I didn't like it as much. When I began to read more and more on certain blogs which I will post as examples, I was convinced that reddit in and of itself can sometimes be helpful to someone, but I don't know if that person is me.

I don't want to make this a short story length of text, so I'll keep most of the details short and concise. I was diagnosed at the age of 5 and was nonverbal up until then. My family situation was often at times dysfunctional and when we moved to a small town near the commute (we lived in the city before we moved in 2006), it greatly changed my parents' perspectives and both butted heads with each other in terms of power and other relations. Because of my diagnosis, I was severely bullied in school and never really had the chance to make any friends like me. My sister and I went to school in a somewhat ""urban (euphemism for saying minority and such)"" area and I felt left out because most of the vocabulary and trends my classmates were following didn't make much sense. For example, rather than say ""ignorant"", they would say ""ignent"" and many more trends would perspire to the extent that it would become monotonous. I hate to sound racist, but studies have shown that schools where blacks made up 40% of the student body were more likely to have an underachieving class GPA, including whites and Hispanics.

https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/09/24/study-finds-students-underperform-in-schools-with-large-black-populations

Middle school and high school were both hell for me, especially since I went to a (watchumacallit) school where the two were related in terms of business, such as one was a grammar and the other was a prep and so on. This was also when my parents were deciding where I should go to for school. My mother suggested that I go to a school for autistic or Asperger's students so it seems that she was taking note of my condition, whereas my father wanted me to go to a preppy school just because of the name or something. One person that changed the way I thought about myself and my place in the school was my freshman year math teacher, who said to my Dad in a parent-teacher conference that the school wasn't for me. He was generally cold and robotic and would sometimes get upset easily and was a bit of a ""my way or the highway"" kind of guy. Though, considering how my Dad threatened to send me to a school with black kids, I had to take a lot of the abuse from teachers and students alike and couldn't really do anything about it. It changed for the better once I graduated, but we were ready to sell the house but unable to by the time I went to my first Community college to improve my grades. I was already seeing a psychiatrist at the time and I had difficulty continuing my education due to insomnia and fatigue and the extremely long commute. Fortunately, it changed when I found about colleges with in-campus housing and I applied for the Summer and spring semesters, so I will be leaving in almost a month from now. I used to work at a family business with my mother until things got shaky with her employees and she lost 8 people in the process. This was also the same time when I was supposed to go to an internship early this April, while I was finding a job in the meantime, which kept me up at night very often and I was afraid of people calling me lazy for it or being seen as lazy just because I didn't have a job. I learned that it took about 6 weeks on average, but I was still convinced that I felt lazy. My parents (or my mother, since my deadbeat Dad doesn't really do much anymore according to her) managed to sell the house in February/April of this year, but knowing how much of a disaster it's going to be, chances are college may be my only chance of starting anew and getting out of the situation before it gets worse. 

As for me, personally, there isn't much to say. I am about 6'2 (I feel like that's supposed to be tall for my age, but I don't feel very tall) and I'm technically the tallest member of my family and I'm somewhat lean as well. I figured that since I didn't have a job, I'd exercise a bit and fix my appearance before I head back to college. I have difficulty expressing myself and I'm unsure of what I should discuss first, since I know a bit of everything, but only in very few subjects am I amiable to discuss lengthily with a few examples being psychology and entertainment or science/math stuff in general but talking about politics or history can get a bit shaky for me, since while I am aware of the events that happened, opinions are thrown left and right and there's never a right answer on who is right and wrong when it comes to political debate.

 I like all sorts of entertainment, such as video games, computers, reading, music, anime /manga, some TV and movies, etc. I personally like  RPGs and Strategy games and I am excited to get the Homeworld collection during the Steam summer sale so I can play the Gundam mod along with the Legend of the Galactic Heroes mod for Sins of a Solar Empire.

The last 5 or 6 categories are often shaky for me, since it seems that trusting your instincts may not always be the best move and sometimes it takes more than just looking at the glass half empty or full. Reading in particular is one subject where I tend to get easily depressed and cynical over because there isn't a clear and exact way on what are the best books you should read in your life or if everything is as it seems. As for music, I like ambient, progressive rock/metal, gothic rock/metal, jazz fusion, symphonic metal, new/dark age, etc. but people get shaky over things when it comes to music like goth in general. People say goth metal isn't gothic and or that this band is bad and such. I stuck with progressive rock and ambient because I was unsure of what my identity was, which is a crucial role in why I'm typing this. With movies/TV and anime/manga, I have a bit of a clearer conscience somewhat, though it's difficult to consider what makes a good anime or film/tv show and I only watch piecemeal due to my depression. The recent anime I watched were Ideon, Devilman, and Inaka Isha. I guess I have a knack for over the top dark anime.

I guess why I'm here is that I feel out of place. When I want to like something, but realize that everything they liked is from 200 years ago and haven't had a follow up of any recent books or good tv shows or movies, I'm not sure if I want to like it and I often question my own existence. I'm mainly referring to the gothic subculture and I'm not saying that what they like is bad, but I haven't seen much development in terms of cult classic follow ups or books or anything recent or new. Then people say that there are more female goths than male goths or something idk. I think so much that it's crazy. The thoughts I develop constantly in a day can equate to a summary of a chapter in War and Peace. It's THAT much. 

I often question whether or not life is really a gift and that if there is a God, why would he give birth to a child in poverty like Africa or the Middle East, especially if they were female. I think about what would happen when I die and wonder if this may be my only life or one of many.

My parents were generally privy and carried a sense of wealth around them, in the sense that they had a bit of a materialistic streak in the sense that they liked nice things and so on, and I often asked myself if this is the life smart people like me would live when they grow up. I later learned that they didn't, but finding someone like me would be difficult and ask myself why do people have difficulty relating to each other. I learned that people never change and the only person you can change is yourself, which is why I rush my brain to the point that I develop these thoughts and a catharsis in order to force myself to grow up, but I guess I was like that at a young age when I was distant and cold towards people and didn't like expressing my feelings to anyone. I think too much and feel too little. I do this because I don't want to be like my Dad, whose overly emotional and throws quote unquote ""temper tantrums"" very often, where he gets so angry to the point that he wants to fight me. I have called the police on him one time, but my mother interrupted and stopped. That was back in March.

As for how I identify or connect with people, keep in mind that I'm very understanding and caring and take into account of helping people more often than competing with them, which explains why I rather have a job as a scientist or doctor than in business where I would face a lot of litigations since America is one of the most litigious countries in the world. Not only that, but I over analyze College as if it were a giant sugar bomb ready to explode. Studies have show that logistics, nutrition, engineering, math, science, medicine, etc. have 40-60k debt compared to their colossal liberal arts counterparts. I'm unsure of what I want in a person, but I'll get to that in a minute. The way I identify people has been something that's developed from mental illnesses to MBTIs to Astrology signs. For the latter, my MBTI tends to be shaky in terms of what I am, but I'm usually an INTJ. My birthday is February 16th, so that makes me an Aquarius. The reason why I bring this up is that a lot of people that have influenced me have usually been born under this sign. Keep in mind that I don't read horoscopes nor do I believe in Astrology. It's just something to gain a better understanding of a person and I read it as a basis for psychology. It doesn't mean that not everyone is bad, but there are some habits we tend to develop depending on when we're born.

As for what I want in a person, it tends to be shaky as well. I am unsure of what I want in myself and or in another person, but I know that I expect them to be smart and have a good set of morals, which is simple and through, but what I like and what I want in them is complex and confusing, since I feel that what I like either makes me too picky or too accepting of things. I'd rather stick with someone who is a parallel version of me, rather than have a friend where we're just friends because we're friends and that's it. It was either that or mentioning another issue about minorities and I didn't want to stick with the latter because of the backlash I may or would've faced when saying that. I want to keep things anonymous until some people respond. 

As for things other than my personality, I also have a tendency to go back and forth with my sexuality. Around 14 or 16-ish, I became somewhat bi-curious and developed an attractiveness towards both genders and I do have a set of standards, but these may seem relatively normal, such as long hair in women, but I also tend to like it in men, because I generally find short haired men boring. As for body types, well, as long as they stay physically active and such, I'm fine with that. It's just all these stereotypical nitpicks on how guys who like big breasts or butts are sexist or whatever girls like, so I stay out of that. I don't want to be too explicit since this is just my first post and I don't want to go overboard unless some people are interested in hearing what I want to say. I take note of whether or not either gender is comfortable with themselves and I feel that I would often act more like a therapist to them than what they would expect. Like all people, I struggle with gender roles, but I could care less about them, what concerns me is how I express my emotions to women and whether or not getting angry when someone hurts them is actually the right thing to do. Don't get me wrong, I'll step in to help someone, even if that someone is my girlfriend, but exploding in anger is just not my nature. 

Of course, the gothic aesthetic is something that has stuck to me for a very long time and I wouldn't mind seeing it in a potential friend or partner. 

I guess for now that it's time for me to finish since it's long as it is, but know that I'm shy and relatively distant. I just hope I can find some friends when I head back to college in May. Because of that, I thought about refurbishing my PlayStation 2 and DS/3DS collection and play some games I never got the chance to play, like Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Shadow Hearts, Kingdom Hearts, Persona, etc., unless Pokémon is bad to you guys, since I heard that Pokémon Go (to the polls), the musical, and Misha ruined it for everyone, unless it's still ok to play it or something idk.

65ngst,9,2017-04-16,[20M] engineering major at college,Pablovansnogger,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/65ngst/20m_engineering_major_at_college/,"TLDR is at the bottom

Basic: So basic background I'm a sophomore engineering student. I've never dated anyone or have had a girlfriend. I really have never really looked or tried to get a girlfriend, except for this semester.

Attitude: Im pretty selfish and wouldn't consider myself a ""nice guy"", but overall would say Im a pretty decent human being and a little above average.

Looks: probably rate my self a 6/10 slightly above average. I have a skinny athletic build (gaining weight though look below). I usually get compliments from how I dress, so I don't think this area is a problem.

Self improvement: My life recently has been going pretty good, started to focus on nutrition and working out a lot. Feel healthier and have gained muscle and weight. Focused on getting an internship, got 2 interviews, waiting to her back next week. Classes have been going good. So overall my life is pretty good right now.

Tinder: so I've had a tinder for over year now. It's mostly just used for having funny bios and messing with people. I usually have around 70 matches, since I swipe right on everybody, but I wouldn't date most of them. Have met two of them when I was drunk, stuff happened, regrets happened :(

Problem?: So as and engineer my classes are filled with guys and might have 1 girl out of 40 students. The Formulae Sae club I'm in is all guys. Lifting and my other activities I do is mostly guys, so I never am around girls let alone get to talk to them much.
A good amount of my time is taken up and I'm usually only free in like 2 weeknights and the weekends, so idk if it's a good idea to join/do other stuff. Also I'm not the most outgoing and charismatic guy, but I've gotten a little better.

Question: so I am looking for girls to be platonic friends with and or girls that I can date. Also how to be around girls more in general. I just need some tips or advice on what you think I should do in my situation. I just think I should have some more experience for somebody my age and I'd like to find someone in the next few years.

TLDR: I feel overall I'm good, but since I'm in engineering and always around guys, that it's keeping me away from dating/girls. Need help.

Sorry for rough everything, I'm on mobile and it's late. "

After I realized she would be gone for 3 months due to an internship and we would only be together for another month, I pulled back and told her we'll date exclusively when she comes back. She does a bunch of shit tests but I've passed them all to the point where I have a obedient girl who will do whatever I ask her. I tell her when to pay, when we are hanging out, when we are having sex. She knows I'm seeing other girls and she knows she can see other guys.

I feel like her dating other guys is limited but it's there. Girls and computers always have backups. She would prefer dating me, since I have gotten further than other guys with meeting her friends. I'm ready to be in a LTR but not for 3 months long distance at the beginning. I could always say yes to the LTR and then do whatever I want. However am I approaching this correctly in telling her to wait? "

* Why Overwatch

It's a funny thing, I'm not *usually* into online multiplayer games because the community can be quite rarsh and I'm not particularly good at videogames anymore (Souls games and RPGs? I'm great at them; twitch reaction shooters? Not really), but Overwatch caught my attention.

First, because of the character design. I'm in love with this game's design and overall aesthetic. Even though it is a first person shooter, the charm this game provides is amazing, it's an experience rarely seen in videogames of this nature (though somewhat more present in games of other genres, like Witcher 3, for instance).

Second, because the fun factor is not completely dependent on my kill/death ratio. I've tried Rainbow Six Siege for DOZENS of hours but could never get into it, I'm not good under the pressure of a no-respawn game mode, and I was constantly voted to kick because most times I would lack the workarounds of each game mode/map. Overwatch allows me to tweak my gaming experience by having multiple approaches to the team's overall progress, like having healer classes for support, turret classes for defense, sniper classes and killer classes if I'm going for that stronger push.

Third, the ""pick up and play"" factor. It is hard to put down a RPG because it requires a heavy time investment, and nowadays my time is kinda scarce. I usually study a lot and take my studies way harder than my classmates, hence my constant high grades (9 and 10s out of 10). I also have to write a lot since I'm studying English (mostly to become an EFL/ESL English teacher, then I'd move to a masters degree to teach at Universities, probably phonetic/phonology or literature, I not sure yet). So having a game that allows me to get in, play a couple matches and then leave is a key factor for my daily schedule. I know I have to study/read/write a lot, but I can't simply stop playing videogames because I know I get extremely grumpy if I do so. That's why I don't feel like requesting FFXV (top 5 on my wishlist).

Fourth, my girlfriend also wants to play it. This might sound idiotic, like ""why is she a decisive factor in your gaming purchases?"", but we are very attached to each other and we love to spend time doing things together at weekends. We can only have so much fun watching movies and anime together, and we don't have many friends (nor the available time) to play board games or go out, so we like to spend time playing videogames when we feel like to. Another factor is that eating snacks and playing games at home is clearly less expensive than going out once or twice a month to eat something and go to the movies, and whatnot. We try to save some money for these activities, but right now money is a heavy restriction so games are our best option.

* Why not another game?

As I mentioned above, Overwatch seems like a perfect option for me right now. Other games are just as expensive, some might disrupt my studies because of the time investment (FFXV), others might appear unfit for my skills (For Honor), and so on.

* Why don't you buy the game yourself?

Well, my dedication and study efforts are apparently not enough for every employer that interviewed me in these last 3 years (I also already have another degree). It seems that they don't like 24yo male guys attempting to become a teacher. I could only get a very shitty internship that couldn't even pay for my studies, and now I don't have enough to pay for it anymore. My family saw the need to move to another neighborhood, closer to my Uni and my girlfriend, further from anything else, but cheaper. This might allow my family to help me pay for my studies and probably think about gifting me games again, but only in the long run. Right now games are out of question. I've tried getting side jobs and saving on the college snacks, but it wasn't enough to grab a full priced game.

* What about that juicy backlog?

I'm working on it. Right now my physical collection is pretty much beaten, leaving me with PS+ titles and some other games that I couldn't enjoy on my first attempt (like Witcher 3, but it took me almost 30 hours to abandon it, even though I might try again just to check the story) and games that I'm saving to play with my girlfriend and enjoy the story with her, like Until Dawn and Life is Strange. The rest that I bought and actually enjoyed them were beaten already. Some even with platinum trophies, even though I don't want to trophy hunt anymore because it makes me extremely anxious.

I can assure you that no game is left unfinished in my collection unless it is a chore to play it.

* Final thoughts

So, this might be a shot in the dark, without auto aim and with a shitty analog stick pulling the aim to the sides, but I really wanted to own Overwatch since the last ""free weekend"" trial. The game is so refreshing, different from most things I'm used to play, and I believe I will enjoy it to the maximum, clocking multiple hours every week.

Thanks for your time reading my request!"
65q2sc,5,2017-04-16,3 years. 157 episodes. Countless stories.,funnybillypro,manwhorepodcast,https://www.reddit.com/r/manwhorepodcast/comments/65q2sc/3_years_157_episodes_countless_stories/,"Today is The Manwhore Podcast’s 3-year anniversary. In April 2014, I launched this show banking on the hope that people would be entertained by where my dick has been. Turns out listeners were also interested in where my heart has led me. They’ve heard love blossom and my heart break. They cherish my new relationships and they mourn my break-ups. It’s not all sweet, love stuff. Last week they also heard me come. It is The Manwhore Podcast after all!

I want to thank you for tuning in every Wednesday (or whichever day you choose to listen to my show, because, agency). This podcast would not have grown without your downloads, your ratings, your sharing it with friends. Your words of encouragement keep me going—every email, every tweet, every post on the subreddit. I think I have some of the perviest, sluttiest, sexiest most awesome fans in all of podcasting! And I fucking love it.

The past 3 years have been literally life-changing for me. Never did I imagine I would perform in an adult film, meet listeners who know everything about my life, get a happy ending massage on mic, meet my girlfriend at a sex party, or receive incredible gifts from perfect strangers. Seriously, I’ve gotten expensive pens from two different people. What the fuck! I am excited for what the next 3 years has in store for me, the show, and us!

I am already scheming for 2017-18. I will be traveling to a few cities and hope to perform some stand-up near you. If you enjoyed the Love compilation episode from Valentine’s Day, I have other cool episode ideas in the works! Want to know more about Hacienda? Stay tuned! There’s also a fanwhore meet-up weekend in New York City being planned for October. Start saving up because I want to see you there!

Producing a podcast by yourself without a network, producer, editor, publicist, intern, or fluffer has been a lot of work! I am a one-man operation out here in Brooklyn. Back in December, I quit my day job to work on comedy and the podcast full-time. This has only been possible because of our growing community of fanwhores on Patreon. If you’ve been enjoying my podcast, I wanted to ask if you’ve got just **one dollar** you can throw my way each month. In reality, that’s 25¢ per episode. You likely have that in your left pocket or rumbling around the bottom of your purse.

I have always said that if each listener pledged just **$1 per month**, I wouldn’t have to worry about anything except creating awesome, sex-positive funny content. I already produce hours of bonus podcasts each month. I could start making YouTube videos. I’d have time to write my book(s) because I wouldn’t have to work side jobs to help make ends meet. The Patreon page has been active for 2 years and we just passed 100 active patrons! We’re also $12 away from me producing $1 bonus episodes every month (currently those are only available at the $5 level)! I would love to get another 100 patrons after sending this email.

A lot of listeners have said to me, “Well, I want to wait until I can afford to give you a real pledge!” That’s so precious that some of you want to give $5, $10, or more per month but want to stay within your budget. I love you. **But I want you in today for just $1**! That dollar means a whole helluva lot to me. And hey, if you can afford to bump up your pledge one day, I certainly won't stop you! I’m more appreciative of the patron who decreases from $10 to $1 than the person who pledges $20 once and cancels. I want all of you in for at least one dollar per month always! That’s all it takes to help change my life. Seriously.

Join the club at http://patreon.com/manwhorepodcast!

Thank you all for your support, your kind words, your bottles of whiskey, your dollars, and your fanboobs. Here’s to another Year of the Manwhore!

Xoxo

65qgq5,98,2017-04-16,Rant: fuck the bar exam.,doomedforfastfood,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/65qgq5/rant_fuck_the_bar_exam/,"If rants are out of place here, I apologize in advance.

I am hurting. I am reeling from constant disappointment and persistent, almost organized if I were more paranoid, rejection. I have never felt so devalued and filthy in my life from sticking my nose up other peoples' asses only to get crapped on daily. If this isn't directly related to the sheer insanity that has evolved pursuant to the insane standards and literature of the bar exam, I'll hang up my hat and call it a day.

Graduated from a T1. High 20's. Mid-tier grades, insanely good work experience. A seemingly great start. I failed the July bar by a disgusting 30 points. I took February and I submitted an offer of 85k for a position local to my area that I met all of the qualifications for. Received an email back from a recruiter asking me to interview. But, oops- they didn't specify that they wanted someone who had passed the bar for a non-practicing position. She apologized- great resume! Great experience! No interview. It'll be five months in May that I've been sitting on my ass, hoping that someone will take a chance on me.

I can't tell you how many times this has happened. A recruiter drops the ball. I meet someone at an interview and they speak to me for an hour, only to snub my emails (emphasis on the s) when I follow up asking to speak or get coffee. I apply for a perfect job and tailor my application and receive an automated email hours later, suggesting that the position was already filled and that they're just jerking off so they don't get sued for filling it internally. I email every local firm in my area within a thirty-mile radius asking to lick their shoes, file papers, and do document review only to hear that some other eager fucking beaver is dutifully employed with them as a law school intern. I interview with a small corporation that requires four mental/logical/hypothetical 'assessments' and two in-person interviews 45 minutes away only to be told that they're looking for 'a better fit' and see their positions go up weekly. An interview with a week-long response turns into a month turns into six months turns into nothing. Paralegals get paid more than I do for half the debt and education.

Nobody wants me anymore.

I did everything that I was supposed to do. I held up my end of the bargain. Decent grades in school, specialized classes, and consistent, glowing work experience, and 100k in debt that I pay every month, $1000 at a time. I got references. I still don't know what happened but for the fact that the one time I failed anything in my life, it feels like it annihilated my career, my life, my finances, and my relationship. At the time of writing this, my sex life is gone. I have $458 in the bank, slowly draining, and $1,500 in credit card debt. I'm constantly naked, on the couch, and applying for jobs through tears and anger while my spouse supports us both on 40k a year and goes into credit card debt. I wish that Erica Moeser, CEO of the NCBE and perpetual deflector of law school president research and smug constituent of the ""minimum basic requirements"" of the bar exam, could read this and know that as a result of this, they are directly, actively, and perhaps even happily, crippling my future. We're not going to have kids. We're not going to go on vacation any time in the next year. We're not going to get massages or eat out or visit friends. We're just...not, period. Nothing is happening.

People say this is going to improve when I pass, but in the interim, I feel everyone I know receding from me like I've got leprosy. Friends and family ask kindly and deflect, as if they know my condition isn't going to improve. Alumni don't give a fuck. Friends who have passed the bar are suddenly too busy and uninterested and don't want me near their workplaces. I'm contacting kids I went to high school with who I haven't spoken to in ten years asking if their old ex-girlfriend still works for that one firm down there, like some sort of a weirdo. If you spoke to me, I wouldn't be this cynical. I'm polite, firm, energetic, and positive when I put my best foot forward, but I'm breaking up inside day by day.

My biggest luxury is a therapist, and to that, I credit the fact that I haven't completely gone down the tubes and sacrificed myself in the name of the bar examining committee yet. I am hurting so badly. I'm flawed. I spend my nights reading the NCBE newsletter tips for bar examiners and graders about how to skew their distribution of near-passing grades so that they fail enough applicants to create a decent spread. I wait for the day, three years from now, when the kids who were 1Ls when I was graduating, are interviewing me for entry-level associate jobs and I see our country and the ABA get pounded daily, feeling powerless that I can't do anything, that I'm just in limbo. I can't get part-time work. I can't get work that requires a high school diploma. I made a separate resume that intentionally omitted my law degree just so that I didn't look like a complete failure when I applied to be a dishwasher. I can't do a whole lot right now.

When I took the bar, I sat next to some kid who, by the grace of whatever, was taking the bar for the sixth time. This was in July. He was friendly. ""Maybe this will be the time,"" he said, and told me how he was staying with his mom in the interim, how he hoped his car would be okay because he was driving on a threadbare spare. I checked the list in September. He didn't pass. February showed the lowest scores in the history of the bar exam. Doesn't anybody give a shit why?

If I could go back in time, I would have still gone to law school. The problem was never law school, it wasn't the teachers or the classes or the work experience. I'd have even taken on the debt. I loved every minute of it. But this is a hell I can't seem to escape. I still don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe it's because I don't want to cry in front of my wife or throw my fist into a wall, or maybe just to see if people can empathize how I feel. 

I wish it was better. I don't know where to go from here."

sGPA 2.53 with 34 credits
cGPA 3.27 with 113 credits

One more year of undergrad left. I'll be graduating with a psychology degree with a biology minor. I'll graduate with all my pre-med pre-reqs. I was planning on taking two gap years to take more classes and get clinical work and volunteering.

I have no clinic experience. I have no volunteering. No internships in anything, or any type of lab work outside of what was required for my classes.

I'm taking summer classes this summer, but I also need to work to pay bills. I have no car or license. I wanted to volunteer at a hospital this summer, but I doubt I would be able to find reasonable hours/times to do so, due to being in class from 8am-3pm monday-thursday and needing to work. Kinda the same situation during the upcoming school year, due to extracurricular obligations and work, along with school.

What should I do?"
65qst3,5,2017-04-16,Me [20 M] with my girlfriend [20 F] are together for over 4 years. Last thursday I went to a bar with a few friends and I met a girl that shook my feelings.,Rapinha,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65qst3/me_20_m_with_my_girlfriend_20_f_are_together_for/,"I know my girlfriend since we were 6, and I first fall in love for her when I was only 13 ( one of those simple, child romances). I found out she liked me when we were in high school, and we started dating on the second year. Our relationship is pretty cool, we are loyal and transparent with each other. She had the opportunity to travel to another country for 7 months, I waited while I started university, our parents have a great relationship with each other, etc

We've been achieving some great things in our professional and personal life. For example: I got a great job and could pay a pair of tickets to her favorite band show that was on tour in our country, a research I've developed received some honours at my university, she's a brilliant student, supported by her professors and is developing really well in her internship program. 

I always saw her as the one for me. However, recently I started feeling confused about my relationship. At the beginning, we used to see each other almost everyday, since we weren't working. Now I have a 8 hour job and the university. She has the internship and the university too. We dont see each other so frequently anymore. I guess this weakened our relation a bit. 

This became clearer last thursday, when I went to a bar with some university and high school friends and this attractive girl started hitting on me. I was a bit drunk and didnt realize she was doing it until she started walking by my side and grab my hand. We walked this way some meters until I broke it off and started talking with another friend. Our friends went home, I stayed with her and my friend at the bus stop. She was clearly drunk and had to go home. She started calling a Uber, and in the meantime, she put her head over my shoulder and start kissing and giving little bits in my ear. She also put her hand near my crotch, which I put away almost immediately. Her car arrived and we didnt do anything, I hold on controlling myself, even tho it was really hard not to give up and kiss her. My buddy was laughing at me after this all happened. 
It was the first time something like this happened, and I am really confused about everything. I cant stop thinking about this moment and now I'm a bit unsure about what to do or feel. I started thinking maybe I would like some time to enjoy being single, but I also think it would be stupid if I broke up with my current girlfriend, which is an awesome person. 

Have you ever had this kind of experience?   
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I have a great relationship since I was 16, but after a really attractive girl hit on me for the first time ever I started feeling confused about my current feelings. "

65rxqc,7,2017-04-16,Need help with an absurdly tricky situation involving love and friendship,HooHuang,aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/65rxqc/need_help_with_an_absurdly_tricky_situation/,"1)Context

I'm a male and I'm 22. I'm a third year at my school, our classes are over so everybody in my year left for their 
internship except, well... me since it's very close to my school. Right now, I only hang out with a group of 4
first year students I got to know through club activities. They're currently the only people I'm close to so this is
damn important to me.

There are only 2 people (both girls aged around 20 then) who are really related to my issues in the group
I'll call them A and B.
 
A is a very shy and anxious girl. Still, we have a lot of common interests and we had many long discussions about 
a lot of stuff. Long story short, she's the sweetest thing in the world to me, we get along together really well 
and I'm madly in love with her.

B is A's best friend, she's extrovert, really funny, and it's always felt great to hang out with her. The way she talks,
smiles, laughs and everything is kind of hypnotic to me but I've never really felt like I was in love with her.
She's not secretive at all about herself so I've learned very quickly the fact that she prefer girls and she's in love 
with A.


2)When everything was fine

A little more than a month ago, since everyone but B and I was going home for vacations, I suggested we spent some time
together. I came to her place once and then she came to my place once as well, we spent the day together, had fun, etc.
Except at a time, she mentioned the fact that she was missing A very much and because I felt sympathy for her I told her
I could relate. That led to her pressing for information about how I could relate and since I hate lying especially because
we had already been friends for some time, I just had to admit I loved A. In the beginning it didn't seem like trouble at
all, in fact, when everyone got back, I started having lunch with them every day and spend a lot more good time with them 
overall, which I was doing far less before because the third year were still there.


3)When it started to get awkward

And then, gradually B started to get in my way everytime I was trying to show affection for A. That was annoying me
but I never complained until she started not telling me when I was asking where they were at times and acting like I
only needed to be there when she allowed me to, so one day I got mad at her in front of A and told her she was being 
annoying. Since then she started ignoring me totally. When I asked A if I had been to harsh with B she told me I was right.
After two weeks, B was still furious so I apologized to her thinking I might have hurt her feelings in a way I can't 
comprehend. She accepted my apologies and told me I was a good guy because I was ready to learn from my mistakes.
Things got better after this but I felt like she was still being very cold or sad maybe. One day, B was going to some
restaurant with A to have dinner, I asked her if I could tag along and she said that could be nice, but in the bus she
asked me why I was not getting out at my stop. I was confused so I didn't do anything and stayed in the bus.
And then when I went back home, she complained by text that I came uninvited and was only thinking about myself.
She stopped talking to me again, I texted her once about something not even related and that ended up with her saying 
hurtful things including pretending we had never even been friends at all.
I started feeling very crappy and depressed and I stopped seeing anyone for some time.


4)When it started to make no sense at all

Eventually, one day, I couldn't stand it and I mustered some courage and ran after her in the street after club activities.
I hugged her and I told her I loved her even though I'm not sure I do. That felt terrible, but she was smiling. 
She told me I was a masochist and I was just going to get hurt because she's an evil person.
I told her I didn't care she had been mean and I didn't think she was evil and she invited me to her place to discuss 
things. There, she went on about how she had all kind of personality disorders, she was an horrible person, etc. She even
told me she was texting me horrible things so I would commit suicide.
Sometimes she was also adding about how she didn't like my attitude, didn't see me as a friend but just a way to avoid
boredom. I'm terribly confused. I can't let go of this relationship because I care about her at least as a friend, and
she's just so close to everyone else in the group so I don't feel I should take distance.
I don't want to believe any of the shit she told me and I don't even know what I could or should do.
I can't even tell how this affected the other people (including A) in our group, because our conflict has been visible
and going on for a long time.


Thanks to anyone who's read this far, it's been really hard for me to write about all that stuff, I felt like giving
details was essential even if it may get boring because of it. I'm totally lost, everything is so twisted, I'm a mess, 
I have already no idea how to deal with my own feelings so there's no way I can make sense in this.

If anyone can see through this situation or at least give me some advice or anything that would be most welcome.
Also if you want more details about anything feel free to ask me.

...

UPDATE : I've set my feelings apart for a bit and now I think I got this, so I thought I might as well write down my conclusions in case anyone would go through something similar. There never was anything to understand. I never did anything wrong, I was just doing things she didn't want me to. She's obviously a covert narcissist, so everything I thought I knew about her was just a facade. I absolutely don't love her, we never even had a friendship to begin with after all. I want to feel sorry about her, but I really shouldn't since she'll feed on anything I give her. She already took enough of my time and energy, now I'm totally worn out, so from now on I'll just pretend she doesn't exist and be a happy funny guy with everyone else. Not my circus, not my monkeys. If she wants to turn anyone against me, she'll have a hard time doing so since my suffering's been visible all along and I've got our text history to prove I was clearly the one being abused. There's no battle to fight here, everything has already been said and done. She doesn't even want to deal with the mess in her own head, so why should anyone else care about that ?

TL;DR : How I feel right now : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YSozbfIQbY ;)

P.S : Weirdest shit I ever had to face, it hurt me pretty bad. If you can keep yourself away from this sort of situation, I highly recommend it. Forgive those who hurt you, but don't try to forget it. If things keep adding up you'll realize faster you're not the one to blame, saves time and energy."

Hello, along with many other problems, one of the more recent issues I've been dealing with are headaches that won't cease, and always feeling tired.

I have a D.O. that has been running test after test on me, but nothing has come back. From previous threads that I've posted around reddit, I have a urologic condition that stemmed from a rectal condition. The rectal condition is being fixed with botox and pelvic floor PT, but now the chest pain, head pain, and tiredness is making it almost impossible to finish my last few weeks of college.

Symptoms:
 - Chest pain (cardiologist said its not related, GI doc says it's not related after my EGD, my D.O. thinks it's muscoloskeletal, and has been working to get it fixed, but to no avail. Chest C.T. showed nothing)
 - Head aches (D.O. ordered head MRI, which showed nothing, checked my vitamin D levels a month ago and I was extremely low, I've been taking it every night, but nothing has changed. Also checked my thyroid, B12, folic acid, and Vitamin D again, which I will hear back on Tuesday)
 - Feeling out of it and dizzy (Never had any sort of insight into why this was happening other than the brain's reaction to pain)

It's getting very hard to keep going. I'm less than a month away from my bachelors, and have a job lined up. I'm sure to lose the job if I feel and work the way I do now.

Daily I am taking:
 - 2000 IU of Vitamin D
 - Probiotics for bowel movements
 - Fiber for bowel movements
 - Vitamin C/E and Biotin for better nails as mine are crap

What else could it be? Blood workups always come back good, the only thing that we've found to be low was vitamin D, which i'm taking 2000 IU a night to correct. I've spent all of my past internship money trying to figure out what is wrong with me that I'm starting to tap into credit cards... I'm worried I'll be screwed before I even get to my new job once I graduate."

How much of the classes are based in theory? 


How large are the classes/class size?
 

Are the classes more hands on or are they more lecture-based?


What the CS related extra curricular scene is like (hackathons, etc)?


How much room for specialization is there in the CS major?


Does the major prepare a student more for industry or more for academia/research?


How easy is it to switch majors or switch focuses within CS?


When (what year) can students begin partaking in research or internships?


What seems to help students most during career fairs: research, internships, or co-ops?

The assignment asks for us to interview someone in the career field we plan on studying in college. Since I am planning on going into biomedical engineering (and possibly chemical engineering), I wanted to conduct an interview with someone already in the biomedical engineering industry. I will post the questions that I plan on asking in this post and you can PM me your answers. I ask that you give thoughtful and detailed answers since this is going to be a fairly substantial essay. 

Here are the questions I would want you to answer:

* What realization in your life made you decide to become a biomedical/chemical engineer?
* What type of student were you in high school?
Did you do anything in high school to start up your future engineering track?
* What engineering program did you go to?
* What does the daily life of an biomed/chem engineer look like?
* What company are you currently working at and what do they have you do?
* What companies have you worked at in the past and how have they given you experience?
* Did you do any internships or co-ops in college and how did you go about getting them?
* What types of applications have you worked on in your career?
* Would you say that the career of a biomed/chem engineer is enjoyable?
* If you could go back in time to change something you did, or would want to do, relating to your career, what would it be?
* Any advice for someone who would want to down this career path?
* What is your main mission or life goal as a biomed/chem engineer?
* What are some other careers you would want to do or have thought about in the past?
* Why would you say that your career is important to someone with little knowledge of what you do?

If I choose your response, I might also give you follow up questions depending on your answers. You do not need to give personal information, but knowing your name (just first name is fine) and the company you work for (though this might be a bit sensitive) would make my paper a lot easier to work with. Thank you for considering this and I will take all the information I get into account.

65t29x,1,2017-04-16,22 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/65t29x/22_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.
The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
65t409,333,2017-04-16,We were supposed to be professionals. [FM],ethicalslutting,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/65t409/we_were_supposed_to_be_professionals_fm/,"It was supposed to be a purely professional working group, and a purely professional work trip between colleagues. But I hadn’t expected Glen.

Glen and I were two people in a team of ten collaborating on a short project. The process was going to take only a few months. Although it’s not in my area of expertise - I’m not usually supervised by anyone else in the group - I was asked to contribute. With a commitment of a few hours a week, and the opportunity to broaden my professional portfolio, I enthusiastically agreed. It would be a great experience so early in my career, and I swear on my grandfather’s grave that I had the most professional of intentions.

To be honest, I don’t recall being immediately attracted to Glen - who leads the team - when we first met. I remember meeting him, though. There were a lot of things that I could have noticed first; that he was decently taller than me, that he was sharply dressed, that he was most certainly at least a decade older than me. Or his salt and pepper hair, his surprisingly muscular forearms. But as I introduced myself with a brief “Hi! I’m Lex,” what struck me most was this authentic warmth that lit his smile and his sparkling eyes. Have you ever met one of those people who just has a good soul? He’s one of them. I might have been vaguely aware that he was theoretically attractive, but I swear that the only thing I thought after the group’s first meeting was that he was probably going to be an efficient and democratic team leader and that I was excited that he would be in charge.

Oh, and he was clearly wearing a wedding band. I’m a very sexual person and frequently up for some non-romantic physical fun with someone I trust, but I’d never been with a married man and I had no intentions of being a homewrecker. Glen is the kind of man who, were he on Facebook, would constantly be bragging about his family, and I don’t mess with that.

I wonder what he noticed first about me. I’m of average height, and I’m no supermodel. Indeed, the company we work for frequently has a lot of young female interns who are years younger and objectively hotter than I am. I do try to keep in shape when I have the time. I lift, and am pretty proud of my ass, biceps, and fit-yet-curvy shape. I don’t wear super tight or low cut clothing, so it’s quite possible that at that point, Glen had no idea what my physique was like. He may have noticed my long hair, or hazel eyes, or the fact that I have resting bitch face when I’m deep in thought. Who knows?  

All of our contact was totally platonic. The project progressed well over the next few weeks - so well, in fact, that the entire group was going to roadtrip to another city to spend a day powering through meetings about potential contracts. We would stay in a hotel overnight and drive back the next day. 

Glen was driving three other team members and me. We were to meet at god-awful o’clock in a parking lot. I arrived two minutes before Glen parked and stepped outside of the car, and I swear to you the rising sun lit up his silhouette with fiery gold and as he removed his sunglasses and his eyes did that twinkling thing and all he said was a simple “Good morning,” and I had one feeling: ah, shit. 

I was indeed attracted to this brilliant, good-hearted man. “But he’s married, and way older than you” my rational part of my brain reminded myself. Yes! There. Keep reminding myself of that, and of the project goals, and it would be easy to inhibit the sudden realization that what I wanted to do at that moment was taste his lips on mine. Thankfully, the other team members showed up, and I’m a goddamn adult in control of my behavior so I kept my pants on.

A more senior team member rode in the front seat, and I took the seat directly behind Glen. I caught myself watching his dexterous hands, and distracted myself by engaging in a great conversation with another team member. This worked well until it utterly backfired when Glen heard our discussion and piped up to make a comment that was as insightful as it was kind. Pure Glen. Is it weird to be attracted to someone’s mind like that? 

We stopped at a rest stop. I perked up at the candy display. Candy! A necessity on a road trip! But, because I am a dummy, I had left my wallet in the car, so I decided to stand around and wait for the other women on the team to emerge from the bathroom. I hadn’t noticed Glen nearby. No, that’s a lie; my body seemed hyper-aware of his, so I knew he was near. I just hadn’t noticed that he was buying candy.

Suddenly he was close. I became aware of how good he smelled. 

He smiled and held out his hand to offer me some of the candy he’d bought. I joked that I didn’t want to steal from his bounty, and he only insisted. I smiled, and extended my hand to his to take a single piece. His were warm and dry, and I spent much of the remainder of the drive trying to think of anything else but his strong hands running up my waist. (I frequently failed.)

Still, I was sure that this was a one-sided attraction that would go nowhere. Sure, Glen and I actually shared a lot in common, and whenever the two of us were in conversation it was like meeting a kindred spirit in terms of topics, sense of humor, and wit. But I was sure that if he felt any sort of connection, it was a purely professional one. I was content with that idea. 

That changed that night.

The group had wrapped up work for the day, and some of us were feeling celebratory. Glen suggested going to a bar to have just one drink. I enthusiastically agreed -- I was wired from the great progress we’d made and would need the alcohol to help me sleep. Then, as fate would have it, the other team members said they weren’t feeling it and would see us the next morning. 

Glen and I headed to a bar and ordered a drink each. We talked about things that were totally professional, on the face of it - mostly related to the project or our similar career backgrounds. But our conversation was laced with a little… levity? Flirtiness? At some point he even mentioned where I grew up. I had only mentioned it once long ago and I was surprised, flattered, and turned on that he’d managed to remember such an inconsequential detail about me. At some point he said something so hilarious that I snorted with laughter, and I touched his arm. It wasn’t planned, but I definitely knew I’d communicated something. I don’t know what he felt. 

We ordered a second drink and kept talking and laughing. He was a stellar conversationalist. A lot of guys use conversations to just talk about themselves, but he was genuinely curious about me. Furthermore -- and this will sound weird -- he didn’t make sexual jokes or discuss my appearance or talk about anything untoward. There was nothing skeezy happening. It was clear that Glen is a man of character who would never use a relative position of power for nefarious purposes. My attraction to him deepened, and I continued to war with myself. Did he feel this too? Did I want to act on my desires, and would I want him to act on his?

He graciously paid the bill and we headed up the elevator. My heart quickened as the floors ticked by. My mind wrestled with itself. I don’t want to date the man, I just wanted to get naked with him, see how good I can make him feel with my hands and tongue, and then send him home to dote on his wife.

Ding! The elevator door opened, and I made a last, desperate decision.

“Goodnight!” I said, and I zipped toward my room.

Chickenshit? Ethical? Who knows. 

I got in my pajamas and removed my makeup. It was at least fifteen minutes after we’d gotten upstairs, but I remembered that I hadn’t thanked him for taking care of the bill. I texted him. “Thanks for the snacks, the drinks, and driving! See you tomorrow.” I assumed he’d be asleep and didn’t expect a reply, but I won’t lie that I was hopeful for...something.

My phone buzzed. It was Glen. “Thank you. So fun to get to work with you and get to know you. I feel so fortunate to have had the chance…” 

My mouth went dry. I definitely should not be texting an older, married man who I was attracted to while in my pajamas and we were in a hotel hundreds of miles from home. But I did. We exchanged a few jokes. I was feeling too nervous to be direct. Besides, he was married. I needed him to make a move.

Then he sent: “What do you want?”

I told him to come to my room.

What the hell am I doing? My brain screamed. We can just talk, some totally-fooling-itself part of my brain said. You are wearing pajamas with no underwear, my brain said. 

He knocked, and I let him in. He looked… well, seriously sexy. He still had on his dress shirt, but his hair was just slightly disheveled. He also looked as nervous as I felt.

He sat down on the chair. We both were silent for a few seconds. My heart was pounding and I was shaking slightly out of nerves and excitement. I sat cross legged on the bed to try to hide it.

“How are you feeling?” I asked. 

He rubbed his face then made intense eye contact. “Nervous,” he said, all honesty as usual. I laughed softly and agreed.

He swallowed. “I’ve been married for fifteen years, and I have never been unfaithful.”

Straight to the point. Wow. “Right now, we’re just talking,” I said. Ha. I am so full of shit. I also, frankly, wasn’t sure I believed him. He’s got that deeply sexy older man thing going on, and is actually a decent person who doesn’t hit on every woman he meets - this is probably the most attractive trait a man can have, at least for women like me. I’m positive that scores of other young women have been attracted to him, and it was quite possible that I was lining up to be just another member of a string of women he'd had affairs with. But it didn’t really matter to me, so I didn’t press the issue. 

He took another deep breath. “I find you… very attractive. I have since I first saw you.” 

I was surprised - remember, I’m no supermodel - but also grateful. I decided to be as honest as him, and while he was still here, to drink in the delicious sight of his still-dressed figure sitting in my hotel room across from me. “I’m very attracted to you, and I’m glad you’re here. All I want is for us to have some physical fun. I won’t do anything that will affect your life, and I need to know that this won’t affect your life back home.” All of this was, and remains, true. If the ensuing conversation would reveal even the slightest hint that what we might do tonight would worsen his life at home, I would call it off. 

He nodded slowly. “I love my life,” with directness that surprised me even though it shouldn’t have. He had a great life - a wife, kid, house, probably had a picket fence and a dog too. I went on to learn that he simply wasn’t sexually fulfilled. He and his wife hadn’t been together in a very long time. I, too, had been in a relationship with someone who loved me deeply but didn’t want sex as often as I did. But in any case, it seemed that sex was the only thing missing -- he had no desire to change anything else about his life, and neither did I. He loved his wife and I wanted it to stay that way. We were just two ethical sluts who wanted a sexual friendship, no romance or thoughts for the future wanted or needed. 

We were on the same page. But I felt weighted to the bed, not sure of what to do next. Part of me desperately wanted him to take the lead. “I, uh… I don’t have condoms, but my last STD test showed I’m clean,” I blurted clumsily. He smiled crookedly. “I’ve always been faithful.”

It was a powerful thought, that I was the one to break this great man’s resolve. 

The air seemed thick with sexual tension, ebbing between two people who desperately longed to touch but needed to be sure that the other wanted it too.

He stood. Raised out his hand, palm open, slowly. His eyes were an open invitation. He waited.

I placed my hand in his. He pulled me up to a standing position, our bodies touching. Oh, he was so close.

I swallowed and looked up into his eyes. “I hadn’t realized how tall you are,” I breathed softly.

He lowered his lips to mine and we kissed. It was so gentle -- I think his breath was shaking, he was still so, so nervous -- and it was simultaneously so, so hot. It was incredible to have my fantasies of experiencing this man come true.

We kissed gently for a while, exploring each other. My hands explored his back, arms, chest. His hands drifted, sometimes gently caressing the back of my head, sometimes my waist. To be wanted so thoroughly like this was so sexy. My heart pounded in my chest and my nerves felt like they were sparking anywhere his skin touched mine. I lost myself in the sensation of him.

Our kiss deepened. Our tongues met. He gripped my ass, and breathed heavily. I ran my hands up and down his thighs, overwhelmed with lust for his mind, body, and touch. “Fuck, I’m so turned on,” I whispered. I had felt my pussy getting wet since we started kissing. 

He groaned and his strong, dextrous fingers found their way to my clit. “You are so beautiful,” he whispered softly. He rubbed me slowly, expertly, and when he moved his lips to nibble my earlobe all semblance of self control I had went out the window. It felt so fucking good. My knees nearly buckled, and I had to cling to his strong shoulders for support.

He guided me gently but firmly, as one would a dance partner, back onto the bed. Gently he removed my pajama bottoms while I frantically tore at my top. That delicious mouth of his lavished my nipples with expert attention, licking and sucking. My nipples are really sensitive, and I felt myself getting close to cumming already.

His head moved further down, and I was desperate for his face in between my legs. There was no hesitation. He pressed his face into my pussy like a man dying of thirst, lapping up my juices and gently flicking his tongue against my clit. I ran my hands through his graying hair. It was so hot to have a significantly older man give me pleasure. And he was so fucking talented at it, so good at reading my responses -- the slightest hitch in my breath or shifting of my hips gave him all he needed to know to maintain his rhythm or pulse his tongue harder or softer against my clit to make me feel even more incredible.

I felt my orgasm inexorably building up inside me as I watched him passionately devote himself to my pussy. His pace quickened -- “Oh shit… just like that… ahhh, Glen, you’re gonna make me come,” I managed to say. It was all so much -- his mouth licking and sucking on my clit, his strong arms wrapped around my legs as my back arched with arousal. Fuck, he felt so good, and I felt my head spinning and a ball of warmth inside me growing and growing, until finally I cried out “I'm coming!” and my world exploded in light and my whole body shook and my fingers pulled his face into my clit as I rode his face through waves of one of the most intense orgasms I've had.

Finally it subsided. I gasped for air and pulled his face up to mine. He looked pleased that his attentions had paid off, and he also looked about as awed and grateful as I felt. I was amazed that this man with whom I’d never been intimate before could so quickly make me feel comfortable enough and be skilled enough to get me off. “That was incredible.” I kissed him, enjoying the taste of myself on his lips. Then I said “My face is numb,” and we both laughed.

I hungered to touch him. Now it was my turn to enjoy his body and to return the favor.

To be continued…."

I realize I probably won't get an engineering position right out of school and should expand my job search to include non-engineering oilfield positions. I have noticed a lot of these positions require manual labor of some sort, which normally wouldn't be a problem, but I recently injured myself and won't be able to perform any sort of manual labor type stuff until I get surgery and fully heal from that, which won't be for another 5 to 7 months from now. Anyone think I have a half decent chance of getting a job in the oilfield that won't require manual labor, even if I'm willing to move to Midland or North Dakota? Would a company be willing to hire someone who can't do manual labor initially, but would be able to after a few months? Or should I just say fuck it, 420blazeit from here on out til 3 months before I'm fully healed or maybe even apply for non oilfield jobs?"

65tvwo,166,2017-04-17,I'm 24/m. My girlfriend (23/f) is gullible and I don't know what to do anymore.,throwawaylimits,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/65tvwo/im_24m_my_girlfriend_23f_is_gullible_and_i_dont/,"Hey everyone, I've come here because I don't know what to do anymore and I feel completely defeated in my relationship.

My girlfriend is one of the sweetest human beings I know, and goes out of her way to help everyone. That's where the problem lies.

She goes way too far. It's always a desire in her to make sure people are happy, and is afraid of getting on the wrong books. Being an orphan, she was fostered in multiple households, each giving her different experiences, and only when she turned 18 did she realize she had an inheritance, thereby ensuring financial stability and independence from this care system.

I'm a hardworking undergrad who has never sought after anyone for financial gains, let alone a relationship. I do my courses, work in internships, pay off my loans and tuition and am set to graduate this year debt free with a job. I make sure to take as much time off as I can to spend it with her, knowing how lonely and needy she can be, and that she is someone who always seeks my support. 

I've been by her side whenever her guardians invite her. And I can clearly see that they are buttering her up for their own financial gain. Last summer one of them asked her for money so he could buy a motorbike (I live in a cold part of North America. You only ever use a bike 4 months a year here) because he couldn't afford one. Another has asked her for funds to do their backyard. Countless number of them have asked her to pay their bills because they didn't have to funds to, and in almost all cases, it's because they overspent on unnecessary goods (a second car, an expensive gift, a tablet, etc) wayy out of their means. Just a couple of months back another had asked to give him $7000 for a California trip which he wishes to go to with his daughter and his second wife (who she never met). In many of these cases, they made her even more gullible by reminding her that without them she wouldn't had have a home during the period they took care of her as a kid.

I've warned her many times that she's being way too nice to them, and that they are using her. This turns into an argument, and she tells me that she doesn't want to lose them, and that refusing what they ask will shut doors on her forever.

Now, a few weeks back, one family wants her to sell her house (btw her only asset, and makes up 80% of her inheritance in value) and give all the money to them, because they're going through ""some financial difficulties"". The dad of that family lost his job and wants to take the opportunity to start a business without putting his own family in a hole and sees my girlfriend as his golden goose. Believe it or not, she's going through with it.

I'm all my girlfriend got. She is going to lose her only asset because of her gullible nature. In 6-8 months she's going to be bankrupt, and she's willing to risk it all just so she can keep those relationships. I've tried to support her and at the same time, make her think about this decision many times, but she won't budge.

I should add that a non-profit community service reimbursed all those families for their troubles of taking care of her. I'm not putting a value on the care and sense of belonging she got being a part of those families. However, none of those families have even consulted her, provided any assistance, or even support as to what she should do once she has lost all her money. They just don't care. It's not fair.

I can try supporting her by taking care of her, bring her under my roof and make sure she's alright. But her gullible nature is the root cause of this problem, and my actions won't solve it. I'm also really scared that she will try to get me to give those families my own savings. I care a lot about her and I'm really afraid.

I've tried everything and failed. What do I do, reddit? 

EDIT: Changed ""lend"" to ""give"". There was no lending. They wanted money given to them."
65u2qs,5,2017-04-17,Those who have quit with other obligations,TonySoprano85,quittingkratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/65u2qs/those_who_have_quit_with_other_obligations/,"I need some inspiration and help.

4 years, 40 gram habit. I have to quit. It has been screwing up my life (the dependence, not necessarily the Kratom itself). And I just have to do it.

I was supposed to quit two days ago, but I keep making it until about 9 or 10 pm and the anxiety gets to me and I put it off.

Here's the issue. I've made it through the detox before, so I know what to expect and how much better it is on the other side.

I am finishing up my degree right now. Supposed to graduate in May then find a job and move on with my life. I have a presentation to give next Monday and then a final and a final project to complete.


This week, we are off school, so it is my plan to use the week to get through the major 4 day hump, then tough it out through the rest. But I also have to prepare and give that presentation on Monday and be able to handle all my other school obligations.

And that's what is screwing me up. The anxiety of school and my future  is causing me to freak out on my cold turkey first couple days, just feeling like I won't be able to handle the difficulty of school and Withdrawal at the same time. Tapering is not really an option for me right now. And my family doesn't know about the Kratom and I want to keep it that way and move on from it. 


I'm thinking if I can bear a few days of CT then I'll be able to start being mentally productive again. But those first 48+ hours just makes it seem like I can't do it as well as handle the pressure of school. I also have social anxiety so a presentation in itself causes a lot of anxiety, but I have come so far with that


Anybody else out there who has managed to handle CT withdrawals, then get back to their productive life and deal with the stress of everyday life, maybe after taking 3 or 4 days to just handle the detox? 


I'll also say that on the previous time I detoxed, the house I was renting got flooded on the fourth day and I managed to handle that, find a new place to live, and clean out the house and move all my furniture and belongings all while handling Kratom detox. So that gives me hope.


It's just those first 3 days,not so much the Withdrawal itself, but the weight of all my other responsibilities that overwhelms me and pushes me back to the Kratom. I've also just recently been broken up with, after four years, somebody I love tremendously, who we lived together and had plans of marriage, kids, and a life together. The person I became due to my dependence and the anxiety and depression and bad habits that come with it, caused too much strain on the relationship. So, the emotional pain and anxiety and regret that comes along with that, is just another of these GD factors that overwhelms me and makes this detox seem like too much. Not to mention the regret and anxiety I've been dealing with for a long time, feeling like I chose the wrong career path in school. I wasn't happy with it for a long time but I still had opportunities, that I ruined, so now I'm getting out without any internships in a competitive field that is doing terribly in the economy, meaning it's going to be much harder to find a good job that I don't really want or feel passionate about in the first place, much less a not so good job that will make me have even more regret and feel more stagnant in life. But that's neither here nor there, just a whole lot of emotional trials and tribulations that are making this detox so damn difficult to begin and stay the course. Kratom detox isn't that bad in and of itself, IMO. I mean it sucks, but with patience, it's beautiful on the other side. Just having trouble focusing on just that for the few days needed until I can start to feel like I'm at least recovering and able to be productive and handle life, in general.


But I have to quit and move on, and reconnect with the person that I used to be. Just looking for words of wisdom from those who've been there, and it's helped to vent, because I really don't have anybody to talk to about it, at least who understands. My ex girlfriend was the only who knew and supported me the last time. Why oh why did I have to start again? 


Anyways, thanks guys, and good luck and congrats to those who've done it or are working on it. "
65u70w,1,2017-04-17,Give me (21f) some advice on whether/how I should prepare to seriously upset my father in law (57m),lallybee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65u70w/give_me_21f_some_advice_on_whetherhow_i_should/,"So, this man is difficult to impress. The men in my boyfriend's (21m, together 2 years) family are wonderfully sarcastic, quite reserved, a bit grumpy and difficult to get close to. It's one of the reasons I like my boyfriend, to be honest- he'll never really be soppy (except in his sweet, sarcastic and round about way), but if he is soppy it means he's seriously feeling it. 

Anyway, the family have been on holiday to South America (we're from the UK) to visit my father in law's mother (boyfriend's grandmother) every five years or so since my boyfriend was small- or just whenever they can pull up enough money to get over there. Father in law's family are from the UK but moved when FIL (I'll call him David) was small. So David grew up there, although he went to school in the UK. 

This year, David said he'd saved up enough airmiles for us all to go over there- including me. Boyfriend says this is huge, only the immediate family (him and his mum, dad and brother) have ever been on this trip- and they are the type of family to nearly always invite friends/ extended family on holiday. The flights aren't cheap, and they've hired a boat to sail around, so that's not cheap either. I'm hugely honored. 

Here's the sticky bit- I've been offered an internship with a really good company this summer, with a high chance they'll offer me a job afterwards. I was stressing all year about whether I'll have a job after I graduate (it's not easy with my course, and we've got brexit coming up to make things worse), and now I've essentially got one- if I impress them. But the first week of the internship clashes with the last week of this trip. 

The stupid company sent me an electronic offer without attaching a full offer letter- I thought the ""Congratulations Ms Surname, we would like to offer you...."" thing was the offer letter, but it turns out there was this huge other part with dates and salary and a contract that they didn't attach. I emailed them when I got the offer to say I thought there could be something missing, but there was no response, so I just ticked the 'accept' box and thought the contract would come later. When I emailed two weeks later to ask to see the contract, they said ""it's unwise to accept an offer without reading the contract""- I didn't know there was one supposed to be there! Anyway, so I've accepted this job without having seen the dates- and now I've seen the dates. 

I'm thinking of emailing them to ask if I can turn up a week late, although that won't be doing very well on the ""impressing them"" part of the plan to get the job afterwards. So it looks like I'll have to tell my father in law that I'll be missing out on more than half of this wonderful holiday he's planned and paid for and invited me to. Obviously, I'll pay him back for everything (although that probably means paying him all of my salary from this internship- I don't know how expensive the accommodation has been but the flights are crazy). He's a ""head of the household"" kind of guy and he doesn't have a very good temper. He's very proud, boyfriend says he'll be extremely upset and see this as a betrayal. He was difficult enough to impress in the first place,  and I think he only begrudgingly ""because she makes Son happy"" likes me at the moment. So this is going to ruin all that. I really don't know how to approach it. 

What would you do? 

Thanks for all advice.

Tl;dr: my father in law planned a lovely holiday and I might have to miss most of it. How do I tell him?

65ujke,1,2017-04-17,I [28/F] desperately need advice with a big decision I need to make with my boyfriend [27 M] of almost 5 years.,rather-be-sailing,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65ujke/i_28f_desperately_need_advice_with_a_big_decision/,"Hello Everyone.


To help you understand my problems here is some of my relationship  story with my boyfriend : 


-When we met it was just for fun, nothing too serious was in the planning of this relationship. I knew from the beginning that he cheated on all his ex girlfriends, but somehow I got really attached to him quickly. The first time he cheated I let it slide because we weren't supposed to be serious , I know I shouldn't have but I did.


-We then decided to move in together and started planning a more serious relationship. For sake of money as we were both student he moved in at my parents place, and things were really good, we feel in love and it was the perfect love story anyone dreams of. 


-Things started to get a little weird with the living situation and we moved out to go to his dad's on the other side of the country. There he cheated again. I left and lived in an hotel for a week, but quickly moved back in for again financial reason. I felt trapped but still madly in love. I knew things were going to get better than last time. Eventualy it did. 


-We decided to move to another country just the two of us to start studying and my parents helped us a LOT financially. 


-Now we are still abroad, still living together and still helped by my parents. As we get ""older"" things get more serious and I get more scared. I know he is still in contact with girls. I don't know for sure that he cheated again but i have serious doubts.


- He is in love, he is talking about houses, kids, wedding and all the cool stuff. But the more he talks about it the more I feel like I'm in a wrong place.

-Next semester I have the amazing opportunity to go to another country for an internship and would love to go but he is not so willing on letting me go. He is scared of losing me and not being able to financially sustain himself for a full semester on his own without my parents help.  

So the question is, I guess, are my guts feeling right? Should I leave him? Am I wrong to get scared? Is this what they call cold feet and that, again, will pass with time? Also I'm almost 28 and scared shitless of not finding someone if I leave him. I'm scared of my parents reaction with the financial situation as well. 
I don't really know what I'm looking for in an answer but anything is good. Maybe I just needed to right it down.

I have the old 23"" cinema display and use another display at work so screen size is not an issue.  Wondering if I can realistically use the Air or Macbook with multiple Adobe programs open at once, including Premier (only light video editing).

I'm a woman starting a position as a production coordinator intern in a ~trendy~ Toronto agency in a couple of weeks and am wondering if any fine folk out there have an idea about what sorts of clothing basics I should be looking to buy even just going into my first week, before I'm able to scope out the office vibe.

I haven't been told what the dress code is for my new position, nor am I entirely clear on exactly how much client-facing versus behind-the-scenes work I'll be doing in production. Also not looking to break the bank. Any advice would be v appreciated! "

How quickly to pay down?,wiidlulnno,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/65vv9s/couple_with_25k_in_savings_and_25k_in_loans_more/,"I am to finish grad school. I took out a loan for my first year of school then got an assistanship for the remaining years. I have been working part time and my wife was working full time when we married. We managed to save up the same amount of money as I owe. BUT, my wife just STARTED law school and will be racking up 25k a year (state school) for next two years. I read the debt wiki but still not sure how quickly to pay down because of our situation. We have a goal of being able to buy a house when she graduates in 2 years if it makes sense (will need ~20k for a down payment) 

Loans:
$8,500 in subsidized loans and $16,500 in unsubsidized (was originally 13k), payback kicks in 6 months from now  at 6.8%
Car payment - $10,000. paying back now at 300/month 
New loans each year for wife: $25,000 each year for two years

Monthly expenses: $2500 a month 

Savings:
$24,000 in da bank (I had a mutual fund while I was in school but was only making ~2% back so I pulled it out)

Income:
Wife will make ~5,000 a year in summer internships for the next 2 years
I make 25k now. I don't have a job yet but anticipate making ~70k a year starting this summer.

Just getting around to thinking about this all now that school is over and I'm trying to figure out the best approach to paying it down while still having the cash on hand we need. Thanks!"

65wjd0,2,2017-04-17,"Me [21 F] with my boyfriend [22 M] of almost two years, I have some problems I need you to decipher for me, reddit.",throwaway3840102,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65wjd0/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_22_m_of_almost_two/,"Hello everyone! Long time user of reddit here, just created a throwaway account for this one. Would like to start off with: yes, I know I'm young. I know I have the rest of my life to find someone and blah blah. Yep, I'm turning to strangers on the internet to give me advice. I would like constructive criticism on what I'm about to post and if you have anything to say about my age, pls just leave. Go. There are a hundred other relationship posts for you to share your valuable knowledge with. I don't want to hear the typical BS.

I'm going to be as honest as possible here to get relevant answers, and I hope that you'll all stick with me.

So, where to begin. I met Donnie (not his real name) in college through a friend. Him and about 10ish other people I know have assimilated into the same friend group. I broke the #1 rule and we started dating, and we've been together for almost two years. About 9 months of those 2 years being long distance. I'm having a couple of issues and all I'm asking for is no judgement here.

I'm shy when it comes to bringing up my personal issues, especially when it comes to confrontation. To begin, I've only finished once with him. I love sex, but it's really starting to bum me out. I love oral, but he states that he doesn't really like it at all (well, at least going down on me). I love foreplay, he's not really into that either. I love kissing, he doesn't see the point in it. Just straight PIV sex. I dated a guy for 3ish years before him and we always made sure each other finished. I have never really brought it up - it kind of hurts me that he doesn't really bother to ask whether or not I've finished. I have no idea where to even begin with that conversation.

Another issue is something that has been bothering me for a long time. There's this girl I'm semi close with (we used to be very close), ""Taylor"". Taylor and I met our freshman year of college and we currently live together. Taylor is a bit.. crazy. She has dated a guy 10 years older than her (with kids), she loves to put me and other people in our friend group down, she's a manipulator and in general just not a very nice person. I don't plan on remaining close to her after I graduate. But, her and Donnie are extremely close. They're in the same major, they are in a lot of classes together, they study together, they even have the same internship in the same office this summer together. People have mistaken them for dating at times (which is something that honestly crushed me when I found out). They both consider each other to be best friends. They are very similar academic wise and in other ways as well. I think that Taylor is into Donnie and it drives me nuts. I have brought it up to both Taylor and Donnie. Taylor completely denies it. Donnie and I had a very long conversation about it. He thinks Taylor is very intelligent and has stated that multiple times. There was even one instance where we were discussing classic books, and he stated - ""Wow! You've read that book? I bet Taylor hasn't even read that book, and she's super smart."" Again, something that totally crushed me. I've brought it up how I'm threatened by her multiple times, and the conversation usually doesn't go anywhere. It usually just ends with ""She's my best friend, and if you were to tell me to stop talking to her I would break up with you"". Which, I totally understand. I would never ask him to stop talking to anyone. But deep down, it still hurts that in a way he'd choose her over me. I've spoken to both of them about it, however I just can not shake this feeling that there is something wrong. Am I being a crazy girlfriend? Am I crazy for having gut feelings?

Another issue that I've been having is sometimes I feel like I am putting more effort in emotionally. I put together thoughtful gifts, I sacrifice my time since I care about him, I even threw him a surprise party for his birthday. Did you ever have to learn about love languages in school? Well I speak them all - words of affirmation, physical touch, receiving gifts, quality time, and acts of service for each other. When I love someone I go all out. However, I don't get the same feeling from him many times. 

I just talked a lot of shit on my relationship, so here are some good things about Donnie: he's smart, makes me laugh, he plays the guitar, and he's really helpful in a lot of situations. There are a lot of other reasons why I care about him, those are just a few. I accept that I'm a flawed person as well and some of these problems may be my own fault.

I tried to make this as detailed as possible, please ask if you need any more info. Thanks for sticking with me on this one, I know I'm not the best writer but I'm looking forward to what you guys have to say.

65wvwh,7,2017-04-17,[MS SQL] Intermediate SQL Class?,swordyfish,SQL,https://www.reddit.com/r/SQL/comments/65wvwh/ms_sql_intermediate_sql_class/,"I need to take an intermediate class for work in the range of ~$200. I'm sure cheaper is always better, but that was about the cost of the beginner class I took. Almost everyone in my office did the ed2go beginner and intermediate course but I heavily dislike it. Does anyone have any recommendations for better intermediate courses? I would need to get it approved by upper management so having the word ""intermediate"" or so in the title of the course would be very helpful. 

I have googled a few options but I'm not sure how good they are. Does anyone have opinions on the Udemy courses (Practical SQL Skills from Intermediate to Advanced or SQL Advanced) or Learn SQL the Hard Way? 

Also, does anyone have recommendations for interactive practice with complex queries? I would like something that could give me immediate feedback if possible. I really enjoyed using Khan Academy when I was an intern and just starting out. I know a lot of people might say that the best way to learn SQL is to just practice it at work, but I would like to have more confidence going in. The database at work is huge and confusing and I'm sure I'll learn the nuances eventually, but I would like to be better prepared before I ask all my coworkers for help. 

Thank you in advance for any help! "
65wx5y,28,2017-04-17,Marriage Trouble,Inaswife,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/65wx5y/marriage_trouble/,"Hi everyone. 

I am having trouble in my marriage. There's a lot to unwrap, so I just want to focus on the issue that arose this morning because I feel it is very symbolic.

We have a very unequal partnership, and not by choice. I think a little background is important: I am from a very low-income background and my husband was raised upper middle class. I had never had a relationship before him, but I had the sense that still being a student while he was a working man might cause some issues in our relationship. I wanted to hold off on pursuing it until we were on more even-footing. But then a hurricane hit the area I was living in and I lost my home and the things that unfolded (being turned on by family) kind of brought us closer together. He offered to lend me some money to help see me through a situation and I wanted nothing more than to reject it. My mother had a friend when I was growing up who was ""taken care of"" by men in exchange for sexual favors (a form of prostitution, essentially -- though she maintained 'relationships' with them, sometimes all at once) and I felt like accepting money from him, even though we were not sexually active at that point, could only lead down a bad road. But he convinced me that it was an act of care by a friend and I desperately needed it. I was so grateful. I remember telling my mother about it and that I hoped to marry him because he came through for me like no one else ever had. 

As our relationship progressed, it took a long time for him to tell me he loved me (it turned out, far longer than any other girl). I had to kind of bring it up first, because I started to feel like I was being played and certainly loved him at that point and had for a very long time (6 months in at this point). He told me he loved me. I was struggling trying to get through life, continually facing adversity that people who grow up disadvantaged often do, but he was like this stable rock in a sea of constant commotion. Still, I didn't want to get more serious until I was on my feet. And then I got sick. Really sick. I got down to 80 lbs and was recommended to withdraw from school because the doctor was worried I was going to have a heart attack just exerting myself physically at the campus, let alone the stress. I was literally a pound away from being hospitalized before I started to make improvements. My then boyfriend sent me more money, which I did not want to take, but it helped me see a nutritionist who helped me begin to regain my health. But I could barely afford to eat. Our relationship was progressing and we'd discussed living together but somewhere else. He then seemed to back off and I stated my intentions; that I saw this being a long-term thing. That day we talked for 11 hours straight and decided we would get married. He said on more than one occasion that it was my desperate situation more than genuine love that inspired him to consider marriage that ""soon."" I thought it was genuine love, though. It was for me. I felt very betrayed when I learned that wasn't the case. 

We got engaged, I moved to live with him, but I was still sick. I could not work or go back to school immediately. I couldn't do a lot, but he convinced me that it was right for him to care for me. We got legally married a few months later and didn't tell most people, so I could get insurance, and then got publicly married a few months after that. I started to get better, but I decided to wait to return to school to save money, so I could qualify for in-state tuition. I finally got back in the swing of things, working full-time and school full-time when I got pregnant. I had a very troubled pregnancy and had to withdraw once again. I started back as soon as possible online and am now heading back to work, but I am so far behind that I am looking at low paying jobs and internships to get my foot in the door. I want to contribute monetarily so badly, but it will be awhile. 

I take care of our son full-time, though. That is my contribution right now; however, it is not valued (even though childcare is insanely expensive and less safe). Admittedly, I am not a great ""Suzie Homemaker,"" and never desired to be one, but I do my best to juggle all the responsibilities of my son and a full-time school load. I think I am a great mother, but he doesn't agree. I have no family in the area, and the only person I can get to help sometimes is his mother. I feel like I get a lot of negative feedback from her as well, because I don't stack up to her homemaking (though she never juggled school and a baby, and a house) and our living situation, I think, is not helping matters. We rent a home from her at an offensive rate, frankly. It was supposed to be short-term, a few months, from when I first moved here, because my husband was living above his garage, and the main house which had an issue had not been fixed and then could not be in time for the schedule we decided to meld our lives together on. It's been 4 years. 

My husband, as said, owns a home. My MIL is aware of this asset obviously, and can only muster so much compassion for the situation. I told my husband that I felt we needed to make a decision to sell or renovate by the time our son was 4 months, that the situation wasn't fair to anyone, and he agreed, but then he reneged, citing work and grad school pressures. There's more to that story, but fair enough. Dealing with that will consume time we don't currently have. However, we have been married almost 4 years and have a son. It took my husband a year to put me on his bank account. I used to have to borrow cash from my MIL and his aunt, and I learned today that it was only his mother's council (my first major issue -- a wife should be one's council, not their mother, right?) that he put me on the account, as she was ""horrified."" He apologized for this last year, and said it wasn't right he did this. He didn't say it was because he didn't trust me, but it was implied. It was a difficult way to live, but I had more trust in him then. I thought if I could just show him I truly loved him... He would finally see my heart and my intentions (keep in mind that I never knew what he made or the extent of his assets until we were married). But trying to make him understand me, rather than setting firm boundaries, was a mistake. Many of our troubles I've come to see stem from this. 

Things have been rough lately but we had a lovely Easter and agreed to work on being better to each other. He didn't get to bed early and woke up late and I had a feeling he'd be asking for the car. It's the only asset I brought into the marriage -- a gift from a deceased great uncle who removed my drug-addicted, mentally ill father from his will and put me on instead. It's not a fancy car. Its not worth more than 2,000. Probably less. But it runs and it's all I have, monetarily speaking. When my husband did finally ask, I laid there after thinking how disordered this has all become. We are currently a one car family, but he prefers the train. The car is helpful to me with the baby, but when he needs it and I truly don't, I have no issue with him using it. And asking on those grounds is one thing, but he asks largely because it's ""my"" car. I offered on several occasions to make it our car, legally, but he was firm that it should be mine. It was from my inheritance. Eventually, I cottoned on that he wanted me to keep my asset because he wanted to keep his. Thinking about this, I was sad when I walked into the kitchen to see him off this morning. He noticed and asked what was wrong. I didn't want to tell him and  suggested we talk about it another time, as he had to go, but he insisted. So, I told him. The conversation started of reasonable but then he started talking about divorce. I was like, what, really?? He essentially admitted he won't make the home he owns ours because he is a afraid of divorce. He doesn't want to fully invest in our marriage, because he's a afraid of divorce. We have been married almost 4 years and I gave him a child... What more can one do? He's painted me as some ""gold-digger"" when, a) HE offered to help me all those years ago and I initially refused but then he convinced me b) I never knew what he made or what he had c) and upon learning, it wasn't a lot and if that was truly my goal, I would have figured that out sooner and surely could have found some rich old guy, but I only wanted to be with someone out of mutual love (hence why I was a virgin until i was 25 [and have only been with him]). I was genuinely shocked to learn this wasn't some oversight. He wants to keep his easy out. Meanwhile, it might not be worth much monetarily, but I have given everything to this marriage. I risked my life carrying and birthing our child. I have gone beyond to prove my love and loyalty.

It should be noted that we both have threatened divorce before. He frequently did the entire first year, and around the time I got pregnant I started to say it back. I thought if he saw how insecure it made me and our marriage feel, he would stop. I was wrong. In more ways than one. 

I wanted to stand my ground this time. This lack of symbolic investment is not only immensely hurtful and so different from how I view marriage (we are supposed to be one in every way; whats mine is yours, etc), it's hurting my life in measurable ways. I think we are stuck in this living situation that is hurting our relationship with the only other family I have in the area because the hemming and hawing about selling or renovating the house is really because doing either would make the property legally ours. 

I told him as he ended the conversation halfway out the door that I would gladly put him on my title if he puts me on his. He didn't agree and still proceeded towards the car. I said, ""I didn't agree to that"" and he turned around, threw the keys at me and told me to fuck off and walked towards the train. I tried to call him to get him to come back and not make a foolish choice to be hours late to work and he said in the most vile tone that I was useless and he hates me and I am not his wife.

This isn't the first time he's said such things, but I don't know where to go from here. As I said, it might not have monetary value, but I have invested everything I had into him, into this. 

Both of us are Christians, and neither of us truly believe in divorce in most cases, but where do I go from here? I have a hard time believing that God wants me to be someone's unvalued, untrusted, unloved wife. I don't want to ""prove"" myself anymore. I never did anything wrong. I never used anyone, in any way, in my life. I made tough choices to not engage in that behavior and had a weak social life and a non-existing love life, despite a lot of male interest, as a result.

I am seeking Christian council. What should I do? What is right? 

I feel like I cannot escape this stereotype that because I am a female who was poor before this marriage that I am just a gold digger waiting to strike. I have never had my origins of poverty used so ruthlessly against me, and I was mercilessly bullied for it growing up. But this is my partner, my husband...I thought, my best friend. Who has no faith in me because my mom ended up a divorced single mother due to my mentally ill father and had trouble making ends meet, which made modern life as we know it so hard for me to compete at?? 

I feel so worthless to him, but there's this feeling also deep inside that says I am not worthless. I know my truth, even if he refuses to see it. To me, that's my imprint from my creator. And I hear it, loud and clear. But what does he want me to do? 

I love my husband. He makes more sad, and more angry than anyone I've ever known at times, but I genuinely love him. I came here instead of r/relationships because a bunch of posts from atheists telling me to divorce him doesn't help. And he refuses to go to even Christian-based counseling, or I would pursue that avenue. 

But I am desperate for Christian insight.

Thanks so much in advance, and apologies for the length. It did require some framing, I think."

I've been meaning to write this for a long time. But for whatever reason, it's hard. From what I gather, this is a support group. You guys are raised by narcissists who fucked you up. Like me. But still, this brutal honesty, this declaration of ""brokenness"" is hard.

Anyways. Let me start by describing myself. I am 21, a male, gay(in the closet). I have an Nmom, an enabler grandmother and father. 

Growing up with Nmom was hard. Even my earliest memories consist  of emotional abuse. I was always criticised, I was never enough for my mother. I was a golden child, an extension of her. So I was meant to be perfect. Perfect gentlemen, well-behaved, the most intelligent and popular kid in the school. 

See? Speaking is hard. How am i supposed to give examples? Should I tell you everything she did? A lot of the abuse was minimal and coincidental. Death by a thousand cuts. Every grade below 90 was a failure. She would scold me for 3 hours, non-stop, emphasizing how much of a disappointment I was, that I did not deserve to watch tv, get snacks or even chill. 
Once when I was 7 years old, I challenged her about school. I said I did not want to go. She stripped me of my clothes and threw me stark naked to our apartment door. She did not take me in for an hour. I stayed on our doorstep, naked, crying, confused.
Once, she made the same vegetable dinner for 3 weeks just because I refused to eat it. She did not gave me anything else.
She would play with the house watches, to make me go to bed earlier.

It was hard. I was a stubborn boy. I never understood why my enabler grandmother and father stood by her. I always said NO. I always tried to argue, make my point, make her see how much I was hurting. It did not work. 

Until I was 14 yo, I persisted. She couldn't broke me.  Of course, I cried a lot, I swore a lot, even had a couple of tantrums. But I was myself, an entity separate from her. Yet, after 2 years with a therapist, I am beginnig to see the damage she dealt. Imagine all the humans beings as software. The code is written mainly by parents. How to socialize, how to love, how to act, how to persist to hardships. My code is broken. I have difficulties caring for people. I have several best friends, but I cannot show them affection. I can^t even say ""I love you"" outloud without getting drunk first. I cannot socialize. I think deep deep down, I am really scared of the ideas she planted me. That I am broken, undeserving, a shell of a human. So I am afraid to be alone. So I socialize accordingly. I am bad at boundaries. There are only 1 setting : a wall of illusions, a self manufactured to my Nmoms wishes. Smart, contemporary, sympathetic. But this is a role, and I cant seem to get myself out of it. Can't let people see the real me.

Anyways, when I began highschool my parents divorced. Then began the real traumas. They both became alcoholics. Father tried to beat me up once. Made me feel guilty about their break up, openly blaming me both for divorce and the financial crisis we were in. Nmom just... exploded. She would fake asthma attacks for attention. Talked bad about my father, tainted every relationship I have with other members of the family. She joined a cult, something about divine love and gave away a lot of our savings to its frauds. 

I don't know.. There are a lot of things. It's hard to talk about. Long story short, I fell apart. Hard. Major depressive disorder along with depersonalization and anxiety. I left them untreated until college. I tried to fix them. 4 years. Talking, arguing, screaming, begging. It did not help. I gained 30 kg, became obese. My GPA plummeted. But most importantly, I lost something. That part of me which said NO, which had hope that I could build a life for myself. It was like a fire extinguished. Learned helplessness.. It still haunts me to this day. 

Fast forward... I managed to get into a law school. But that exam was not up to Nmoms standards. I couldnt get a scholarship. So when the results came online, she had a breakdown. She screamed at me, telling me that she payed for my private tutor costs, that I was such a huge disappointment. She threw me out. (I stayed with my dad a lil while, then she accepted me back.) At that point, I finally understood that something was wrong with her. Not me, but her. So I decided to get help. 2 years of therapy. I managed to draw a line between me and my family problems. Set up boundaries. Managed to get at least 2 best friends, with whom I can be myself out in the open. Even when I feel like depressed , I am not hiding it from them.

I was going really well. After all these years, after all these things, I saw that when I could do stuff. That I was not an idiot, I could get excellent grades if I studied. I was not a failure, I got an internship where all the other lawyers practically adored me. So, I decided to lean toward my homosexuality. I thought that this was the time to incorporate it into my hard-earned crafted identity. But i failed. 

I know being gay is okay. That it is natural. I accepted myself as gay. But i live in a country where misogyny and homophobia fueled by islam and patriarchalism is really prevalent. I can't keep deflecting all the negative feedback from my environment. Nearly everyone is homophobic. Even if they are not, they see lgbt people as stigmatized, highly abnormal people. My close friend circle is really pro-lgbt but we are the minority here. This whole being gay thing really hits that spot my nMom carved. Fear of rejection, loss, and feeling like an alien. 

So I find myself depressed again. Can't seem to get anything done. All my mental energy is going towards keeping my own narcissistic and self-destructive impulses in check, and keeping my hard-won identity intact. I don't know what to do. 

Is this it? All of our lives will be like this? Everyday a struggle. War inside our brains. Trying to fill the void out parents dig for us. Trying to build identity and craft meaning without the complexes and traumas. I feel too broken to mend.

Sorry this was such a long post.  I think I needed to vent. I don't know what I'm demanding of you. Sympathy? Words of wisdom? Pity? A way to cope?

If you had the patience to read all of my badly written venting and pity fest, thank you.  I don't know what else to say. Maybe make me believe in humanity again? :P

65x1zl,3,2017-04-17,Shattered Glass,Shagrrotten,IMDbFilmGeneral,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMDbFilmGeneral/comments/65x1zl/shattered_glass/,"Ace screenwriter Billy Ray's 2003 directorial debut Shattered Glass is kind of a throwback to movies from the 1970s. It's driven by characters, and its drama is derived from their interactions and the slowly unveiled truth that changes the dynamics between them. It's based on the true story of Stephen Glass, a former writer for The New Republic (""the in-flight magazine of Air Force One""), who in 1998 was fired for lying in a story he wrote for the magazine. By ""lying,"" I mean that he just completely made up everything out of thin air.

The real Stephen Glass has said that it all started by re-writing a quote from a source. He wished the guy had said a thing in this certain wording, which would’ve been better than what he actually said. So Glass took a chance and re-wrote the quote. When fact checked, the quote was okayed and Glass just kind of went from there into making up more things in his stories until he finally just fabricated them completely. Glass had made his name as the most vigorous of fact checkers when he was an intern, and so developed a reputation that when something from his story didn't quite check out, the fact checker would still okay it because Stephen wouldn't have put it in his story without thoroughly checking it first. Right?

Glass is played in the movie by Hayden Christensen, who is absolutely genius in the role, showing that George Lucas really didn't have any idea how to handle actors in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Christensen brilliantly portrays Glass as a sort of self-conscious, wounded child that people feel a little bit sorry for, so they cut him some slack when they shouldn't. He has demanding parents he's trying to please by going to Georgetown Law School, writing full-time for The New Republic, and occasionally freelancing for other magazines as his name gets known more and more. His friendly co-workers, played by the reliably wonderful Chloe Sevigny and Melanie Lynskey, listen to his whining about being overworked, but no one really stops to think that Stephen couldn’t actually be putting in the needed amount of work to accomplish everything that he’s doing.

Glass writes a piece about hackers, a story that kills in the writers room when he pitches it, and reads the same way. Forbes Digital Tool, the fledgling online publication from Forbes magazine, picks up the story when their editors read it and are astounded that their own writers weren’t in on this thing. They've never heard of any of the details mentioned in the Glass piece, even though it's right up their alley. So writer Adam Pennenberg (an amazingly subtle Steve Zahn, who should’ve been up for an Oscar for his work here) starts doing some digging. When Pennenberg can't verify anything in the story outside of that there is indeed a state called Nevada, they bring it up to The New Republic's editor Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard, nominated for a Golden Globe for his terrific performance).

Chuck then starts pressuring Stephen to come up with some answers for what he wrote and is offended at what he finds. Sources suddenly don’t want to talk anymore, communicating only by email. Calls go to voicemails with strange sounding voices on the outgoing message. Chuck even starts to entertain the idea that Stephen was duped by these people. That maybe a young writer didn’t do his due diligence on his story and got tricked into thinking it was real. Or maybe it was real and Stephen just took what he was told from his sources and then wrote the story as though he was there because it would sell it better. That’s not the worst thing in the world, is it? But that’s not what happened and Chuck won’t stop digging for the real truth.

It's a wonderfully well done cat-and-mouse game between the two of them, as Chuck pushes while not wanting to believe the truth, with Stephen wriggling any which way he can to try to get out of his made up stories. He tries to lie his way out of his lies, but we see long before he does that he’s going to lose. Chuck isn’t going to cut Stephen the slack everyone else does, especially when fellow journalists are attacking the credibility of the work. As an editor, Chuck’s responsibility is to the magazine and its journalistic integrity. Chuck even starts getting the others to open their eyes when they continually try to come to Stephen’s defense.

Having never been a professional journalist, I can't speak to whether or not Shattered Glass gets the details of the profession right. But it feels right. It feels more real than in most movies about journalists. These actually seem like people's desks, and it feels like they're working in a real office. It has a wonderful, lived-in kind of feeling. Even the awkward moment when Chuck takes over his position from beloved editor Michael Kelly (a surprisingly great dramatic turn from Hank Azaria) feels true to life, even though Billy Ray says on the DVD commentary that it's one of the few moments in the movie that didn't actually happen that way.

At a brisk 94 minutes, you would tend to think that maybe Ray shortchanged his subject, but instead what happened is that he and his actors created their world so vividly that the movie doesn't feel truncated in the slightest. It feels like they told their story, and simply didn’t add any fat to pad the run time. Shattered Glass is one of the most sadly overlooked movies of the 2000s, and having now watched it four or five times, I can say that its impact only strengthens on repeat viewings. I wish there were more like it, but maybe that would make it less special when we find these kinds of movies. Shattered Glass is one that deserves discovery."

I'm an American make age 22 and I think Sweden (Stockholm city or area) is a potential place for me to live and work. I'm interested in how feasible that is, what to expect in the professional culture, and wage expectation. I'll make a list of what I think are relevant characteristics and hopefully I can get a few responses to help me get a better idea. Related tips and expectations to the culture and experience of Stockholm as a whole are also things I'd love to read even though I am focusing more on the minimum of a job and housing at the moment.

- I am graduating in 2018 with a bachelors of science in both Electrical Engineering and German Studies (I speak and write german at a strong B2 level). I want to get my MBA at some point and work in management at an engineering company 

- I will have completed an internship with the company Bosch where I use my non native language regularly

- I have taken an introductory course for Swedish and plan to learn the language, I don't think I would be anything above A1/A2 upon arrival 

- I want to live in a socialist country and play by the rules; I admire how so many Swedes enjoy paying taxes because of the obvious services one receives

Thank you all for your time everyone, I'll be happy to clarify any details. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond, however short."
65xlwn,10,2017-04-17,"Want to try travelling this way/backpacking, but i'm in a kinda tricky situation",Eet-Fuk_,vagabond,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/65xlwn/want_to_try_travelling_this_waybackpacking_but_im/,"**TL;DR at the end** 

Hi Guys. I'm a 21 yo guy who have been thinking about travelling for a while now, and is thinking about it more every day. Long story short, after 3 years of Law school, I realized that I didn't liked what I was studying at all, and that I will never want to work in that field (this is something I realized a few months before my finals, and which was confirmed after an Internship I did last summer), with the long hours that come with those kind of job, and everything around this. So I've asked my parents to take a year off, to think about my future, another topic to study, the kind of job I'd like to do, but the main reason was to take care of digestive issues I've developed during my last year of Law School. 
The thing is that this year off just confirmed what I was thinking during my last months of law school, when I took the decision to have a break, basically : I don't find any pleasure in material possessions but in experiences, I don't want to spend all my life working 40 hours or more per week, all I really need is enough money for food, a shelter and some entertainments, and the thing I value the most in life is Time. Knowing that, it just became more difficult to even think about finding another subject to study, a job to dedicate my life to, as it seems that it is required to spend so many hours per week in most jobs which require a degree. It's pretty clear to me that I don't want to own a car, a house and such things that you're expected to desire, but may get you trapped in a life you don't enjoy, I don't want to spend money on things that I know will never make me happy. I'm not against work at all, and would love to learn some skills (mostly farm job), I just don't want to work for more than my needs. I think you guys get the point, I won't drag this for too long. 
My parents don't know anything about that, and about my lust for travel. They expect me to find a subject to study, to try to become a state employee or things like that (I think I have like a month or two before they're going to start trying to have serious conversations about it...), and I can't blame them, but this is just not what I want. This is why I want to try travelling on my own ASAP to see if I can really enjoy it, or if it is something that will fade away. I know that this life isn't the Heaven-like dream that some bloggers depict on the net, and I try to read as much as possible about the downsides in order to avoid fantasize this life. I know that there will be shitty days, just okay or meh days, and I'm fine with that.
Now, why this is tricky is because, as I mentioned earlier, I still have digestive issues. I'm currently trying to heal from a leaky gut, and I won't be comfortable about travelling until I feel right about it. It's been months since I started taking care of it, and I feel better than before, but it could still take some months before i'm fully healed, I don't know how long. And when I think about that, and when I have to sit and listen to my parents questions, asking me if I found a subject to study, something to do, it really makes me feel anxious about it, I start to feel the pressure of the next start of a school year that is coming near, about the fact that when I say that ""I think about it every day"", this is not about school or job as they expect it to be, but about my lifestyle as a whole. 
I know that I will have to talk to them about this, I do not plan to just leave one morning without a word. I really don't have any problem with them, they're great, they've been really comprehensive about my desire to take a year off from school and are very supportive of what I do to get my gut health back, but I just don't want to have this conversation with them now that this possible travel is so far from this moment. It would be a weight off my mind, but I don't want to get through all of it yet, I still have to prepare for it, whether it's for the gear of some skills that I could acquire to help me on the trip.

I don't even know why I'm writing this... I mean, I already took the decision to try travelling (backpacking/woofing is what I'd like to try) to see if I like it or not... Maybe it is because I just wanted to talk about it to people who may understand. I only talked about it to one close friend, I guess it feels good to share what I have on my mind from time to time. This post is already really long, sorry about that, I don't want to bore you guys to death, so I'll end here, just felt that it would maybe help a bit to share this and to know what you think about that. 
(Sorry about the grammar and different mistakes that my post may contain, I'm French and English is not my first language). 

**TL;DR** : 21 yo French guy who wants to try travelling ASAP on it own a bit to see if he really likes it. Pressured about the next start of a school year with parents thinking that I will go back to college, without any clue of my travel lust, and gut health related issues that I'm taking care of, with no idea of how much longer it will take. Would just like to know what you think about that. 
South East Asia is the area that I'd love to visit the most, but I was thinking about trying to start in Europe, as I'm French and it may be easier for a beginner. Also, I think I'll also try it in my own department, which is French Guiana, situated just above Brazil."
65xu32,1,2017-04-17,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,Subboytoy,GayRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayRP/comments/65xu32/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"Yeah, so this one runs a little long. Sorry about that. I promise if you're still reading at the end I'll make it up to you. 

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people. 

I should be getting ready for work or school.  Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. *Holy fuck, its true!*

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha? 

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks: 

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured. 
 
 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug. 

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down. 

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg. 

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Other kinks! https://i.imgur.com/ed3CHNT.png"

65yeul,31,2017-04-17,Boundary setting,SamIam_IamSam,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/65yeul/boundary_setting/,"I just wasted half a day of work reading these stories! I'm so happy this community exists. My MIL isn't nearly as bad as much of what I've read, but she just gets under my skin in new and maddening ways. 

I'll post the full story of her needy/crazy/stupid/narcissistic ways later, but I could really use some advice. 

She's nearing the end of getting her master's degree and becoming a pastor and has been doing a pastoral internship near our house (it's almost 2 hours one way from where MIL and FIL live) so she stays with us 2-3 days per week. She stays in the guestroom, in the (finished) basement. She has bad knees. My husband has to wait on her when she stays the nights because a) it's uncomfortable for her to go upstairs, and b) she's fucking helpless when the men in her life are around. 

There's been a couple of times that my husband and I are out of town, and she (or she and FIL) stay at our house for the internship/church stuff and she has just decided, without asking or talking about it first, that she would rather stay in our room. It's on the main floor, and it gets cold downstairs. 

I HATE that. Who just decides to stay in someone's bedroom, in their marital bed? It makes me so uncomfortable and mad. We've opened our home to her (and often them) for multiple days a week for almost a year, have some respect for boundaries! 

Yesterday, we hosted Easter at our house, and she needed to change out of her church clothes, so without asking, she just walked into our bedroom and closed the door and got dressed in there (she walked past the bathroom to get to our room.)

Now, we're going out of town next week and again she will be staying at our house while we're gone. Which is fine. But I want her to stay in the guest room and out of my bedroom.

My current plan is to repurpose the beer fridge we have downstairs into her food/snacks so she won't have to go upstairs. And when she insists ""Oh, you don't have to do that, I'll just stay in your room"" I will use that opportunity to clarify that I'd really prefer she did not, and that our room is the only private, personal space we have. 

Wish me luck, she comes tomorrow night for the first of 2 nights this week. 

Thank god for alcohol.

65yfk5,50,2017-04-17,My mother... Just No,animezinggirl,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/65yfk5/my_mother_just_no/,"I'm sorry this is probably going to be pretty long. 

First of all. I love my mother. I do. But lately she's been turning into a control freak. I guess maybe I didn't notice it when I was younger, but now that I am in a healthy and long term relationship, it's almost like being hit by a crazy bitch truck. 
Even before I started dating my current boyfriend, my mom would make negative comments about any girl dating someone for a long time if she deemed them too young. I had a friend come visit me while I was staying at my parents house for a week, and my mother proceeded to tear her down for dating her boyfriend of 4 years. I sent my friend outside, after profusely apologizing and ripped my mom a new one. I was so horrified to have seen that. She had never done anything like that before, anything she said that was rude about others had always been behind closed doors. Her reaction was to claim that no one should come to her house if they didn't want to listen to what she thought of them. 
Needless to say I stopped inviting friends to their house to see me while I was in town. 

Now to the current issue, I've been with my darling SO for a year and a half. We have this puppy (she's his, but I helped raise her when he got her and he affectionately calls me her mom and lets me take her on doggy play dates with friends) who I'm absolutely obsessed with. She's half blue nosed pit half catahoula and she makes me crazy with love. I constantly talk about her to everyone. And my mom hates it. She used to complain night and day when he first got the puppy that ""oh he was stupid to get a dog in college. Why would he get a dog "" constantly. Like literally... constantly. Until one day I snapped and said "" mom no matter how many times you complain about the dog, she isn't going away. It's not your choice. I'm tired of hearing about it.  "" 
CBF along with yelling at me for telling her what to talk about. 
So my mom has always *hated*** whenever me or my little sister have boyfriends. She views it as weak or something I guess. She will make underhanded comments like ""oh with the next boyfriend you better not post as much to Facebook"" , choosing to pretend that whomever we are interested is just a fad. I live 3-4 hours away at my college (thank. The. Universe. ) and every once in awhile I go back to visit my family because I do love them. And my sister is going crazy with my parents being on her back all the time (she's about to graduate high school. ). Well the last time I went, my mom extended an olive branch... and said that the next time I visit I need to bring my SO so he could play pool with my dad and we could all hang out. 
Cool! Better than cool. I'm excited to finally have my parents interested in my lovely SO who is literally the best. 
Well fuck me right? I shouldn't have been so happy. 

So not only are my parents weird about me having a boyfriend, but my dad thinks pitbulls are the devil, and my mom doesn't like hyper dogs. So in order to visit them, SO and I have to arrange to meet his parents halfway from where they live (3 hours away as well) to drop off the puppy whenever we want to see my family. This is a pain in the ass, but whatever, I get it. We can't afford to kennel, none of his roommates will help with the dog because they don't care, and his mother absolutely LOVES the puppy. They send me pictures of her when they have her and gush about how sweet she is. So all in all, they do us a huge favor and get to spend time with their grandfurbaby. Works out! Also SO's mother is a complete sweetheart and always texts me sweet things when he lets her know I'm having a bad day. She's super supportive of him and me and loves that we are together. While my mom sits in the corner and CBF at the mention of it. 

So today my mom starts interrogating me about when I'll be there this weekend. Mind you, she's already tried to get me to ditch my SO and go up a day before and have him drive the 5+ hour trip alone. (WHAT THE FUCK? YOU INVITED HIM. HES YOUR GUEST. IM NOT LETTING HIM DRIVE THAT LONG ALONE!) 
I told her no, firmly, on two separate occasions. Saying that was selfish to make him do that on his own. She huffed and puffed but let it go both times. In a manner that makes me keep my guard up because she probably will try again. 
Anyways she tries to see when we will be in town. And I just say that I still need to have SO talk to his parents so I can figure out when we can meet up to drop off the pupper. She proceeds to get pissy and say I ""sound like a married woman"" (a huge insult according to her actually. Once again any young woman under the age of 25 getting married is a blithering idiot in her book.) 
And man I didn't know I had such a shiny spine. I straight up told her  ""I'm sorry you're upset but I've told you multiple times I have to drop off the dog and nothing has changed. ""  
She hasn't answered and is sulking and when I told my little sister(LS) she confirmed that our mother has been super controlling lately. Up to the point where at my LS's senior prom, she told LS's boyfriend's parents to their faces  that the ""kids need to break up soon"" , WHILE THEY WERE TAKING PROM PICTURES.  She's been harping on LS to dump her boyfriend, and once tried to stop her from going to her dream university because she was afraid her boyfriend would apply. Because he would destroy her future by simply being her boyfriend. 
He's literally the sweetest thing and treats LS like a princess, he even sent our mom flowers for Mother's Day to try to win her and she just CBF anytime someone complimented them. 
Not only that, but I'm about to graduate college and she straight up told me to break up with SO right after so I won't be held back by... I'm not sure what exactly. I'm in the honors college, have a 3.88 GPA and am working on getting an internship. All by myself, and all SO does is support me and feed me, and you know, bone me magnificently. 
I already told her I have no plans of marriage until I'm ready. And that's in maybe 4 years. 

Ma. Chill the fuck out. 
TL:dr: my mom is crazy controlling and hates if my sister or I have boyfriends. Flips shit if we don't ditch them for her. Tried to break up my little sister and her boyfriend through her boyfriend's parents.

65yifw,6,2017-04-17,Which city/town in the States is ideal for a RPW?,sekoiasan,RedPillWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/65yifw/which_citytown_in_the_states_is_ideal_for_a_rpw/,"Hello everyone :)
What are great american cities for a RPW? I know that one can be a good woman anywhere, and that standards don't change depending on circumstances. But in this post, I will tell you my questions, concerns and possible criteria for what I mean by an ideal place.

&amp;nbsp;

First, a bit of background:
I've wanted to move to the United States for many years now, mainly because with such a diverse and big population, one has easy access to so many things one wants/needs. (In my case, it is Curology, proper vietnamese groceries, a belly dance school and a figure skating club.) I agree with Mr Money Moustache, a very sensible personal finance guru, that your compatibility with your environment matters a lot. I plan to get there by getting a bachelor there in Computer Science, finding work as a software engineer and not leaving :D. 
(Working in software and tech is lucrative AND flexible! Thanks to u/g_e_m_anscombe &amp; u/rivertorain for recommending this job to me) 

So I'm in the process of choosing a school that is in a tech town e.g Sillicon Valley (so I can get internships and jobs. I won't be able to stay in the US if I don't get a job, so career must unfortunately be a very high priority). I'm considering CalTech, which is near L.A.

&amp;nbsp;

WHICH brings me to my actual question:
Is L.A a good or bad place to be?

&amp;nbsp;

Perks:

_ Many people, which means more crappy but also more cool people to meet, socialize and potentially date

_ Gorgeous weather, so SUNDRESSES

_ One probably stands out very much amongst the vapid crowd, if one has a RPW-personality

But my concern is there are obviously very many attractive girls there. Can that be a huge barrier to meeting great guys? I'm in no way hot by L.A standards.

And what IS an ideal redpill town, according to you? Which places would match your criteria?

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for bearing with me :)

65ysax,1,2017-04-17,What courses to take in University?,HaydenMaines,LessWrongLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/LessWrongLounge/comments/65ysax/what_courses_to_take_in_university/,"Hello LessWrongLounge, hope you're all having a wonderful day. First post here; I am a current high school student, preparing to enter university, and was hoping for some input on which courses or areas of study I should enter. A bit of context and information about myself;

I am Canadian, attending my cities local university

Due to various economic factors my entire first 4 years of education will be covered. In essence, I walk away with a Bachelors and no debt.

I am heavily interested in, and heavily involved with the Arts community, which is also quite large in my city. I have been performing with several theatrical troupes for the past year (have consistently been involved in at least one production since July), am working at our local regional theatre in the Box Office (after an internship), and have a very natural and elevated talent towards acting, directing, stage management, and dramaturgy.

Lastly, high school has almost killed me in how ridiculous it has been, causing me quite a bit of stress and anger in my life. I feel I have partially lost much of my passion for learning, betterment, achieving goals, and all around rational drive and motivation. Thankfully, I have recently become aware of that, and am now working towards relighting some of my previous interests.

Which brings me to the question of course loads. I truly do need some time off from the education system, but entirely intend to return to it at some point. I love learning in general, and in an ideal world I could continue to return to university, learning every subject possible. I even have distant thoughts of becoming an educator or professor at some point (naturally a good leader, well at explaining, patient) Due to the path my life is currently set upon however, and my recent experiences (both positive and negative), I will be taking a Major in Theatre. My university offers one of the better theatre programs in Canada, tuition is low, etc. However, the arts do not finance well.

My current thought process I have been mulling over is to achieve a Minor in Computer Science (strong love of computers, the general coding/programming/problem solving logic aspect, focus on website development &amp; eCommerce) alongside various other Maths, Philosophy, Business courses, and then immediately upon graduation move towards a Master of Business Administration (Also enjoy business, financing, etc). Other areas of interest include History (to a ridiculous amount), Mathematics, Philosophy, Psychology, Economics, Statistics.
My question itself would be, which Minors, Majors, or courses would you recommend I take to make myself as versatile and appealing, while enabling me to further continue my education as time progresses.

I find it is not a debate of 'Course that makes a lot of money' versus 'course that I am truly passionate about', but finding the optimal order of education that fund my continuing education towards subjects that interest me, or enable me to fulfill my passions and interests (board game deisgn + game theory, writing, etc) What are your thoughts on Majors versus Minors, Bachelor versus Graduate, etc.
Some additional Information; due to university restrictions, I can only major in the same faculty. Under arts, I can double-major in Theatre and Economics, Statistics, Philosophy, History.) My university does not offer a business minor, and you cannot double-major with a BBA. Additionally, the other university in my city offers a more well-renowned Business program.

I thank you for taking the time to read my article, and appreciate any responses or discussion we can bring up. I will do my best to elaborate further on any points or questions you may have. Thank you, and have a wonderful day.

65z613,0,2017-04-17,"My [17M] GF [17F] has the option of attending a great university in CA, should we try long distance or should we try to end on good terms so she can focus on school?",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/65z613/my_17m_gf_17f_has_the_option_of_attending_a_great/,"My girlfriend has the opportunity to study either at Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) or the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). She’s planning on studying civil engineering for her undergrad, and then go into law school from there. Most people have told her that the most important thing law school admissions officers consider are her GPA and her LSAT score, but she’s worried that the name of the university will weigh in negatively, e.g. a 3.5 GPA from Cal Poly would be better than a 4.0 from UNLV. If it wasn’t for the importance of the name of the school, I’m sure she would stay at UNLV. There are many more internship opportunities in Las Vegas for her in both law an engineering, and she won’t have that in Pomona, and she knows that.




More likely than not, she will end up going to study at Cal Poly, since that’s what her parents want for her and what they have wanted for a long time. I, on the other hand, will be going to UNLV, since I have a software engineering internship with a company that develops software infrastructure for Fortune 100 companies, and they are paying my tuition. 

This creates the possibility of a long distance relationship. I do not want to burden her in any way. I understand that if she goes out of state, it will be because she wants a better education. I personally disagree, because I think being a self-learner is much more important than the name of the school. I would obviously prefer if she stayed here, but I understand the amazing opportunity of studying at Cal Poly, and I will support her with what she ends up doing. I already told her that I would like her to stay, and even if we weren’t together, **it would make sense in some aspects for her to stay:** 

* One, UNLV is cheaper, and she could save that for law school. 

* Two, she could do more internships here. Experience &amp; connections &gt; name of school, imo. 

* Three, a less rigorous curriculum at UNLV would mean a higher GPA and more time for her to study for her LSAT. Lastly, we would be together. I really love this girl, and it hurts me so much to have to be in this position. I just want the best for her. 

* Four, (and thinking way ahead) I will be graduating with about $200K left over from scholarships and my internship paying for my university. I know that after we both finish our undergrad, I could help us move to another city so she can do her law school. 

I think that if she’s out of state, it would be a burden for her to maintain a LDR. Cal Poly is a rigorous engineering school, I know she’d have to study for her LSAT, I know she has to get accustomed to being in a new city, meet people in college, and I don’t want to make her have to choose between spending the weekend on Skype with me or going out and enjoying herself. I don’t want her to remember her college years as stressful because she had to keep our relationship alive. We have the chemistry, and when you have the chemistry, all you need is timing, but timing’s hard. I don’t think we have the timing right now :(

**I know she’d like to stay, but it’s not her decision, it’s her parents’.**  They want her to go to a top law school, so they’re afraid she won’t get accepted to a top law school if she goes to UNLV. So it comes down to either doing a long distance relationship, or breaking things up and letting her go. 

Reddit, please advice.

TLDR: GF will probably go study civil engineering out of state, will go into grad school thereafter. Her school has a rigorous program and I don't want to be a burden for her. Should we break up, or try LDR?"

I'm Gwen, an English lass and mother on the online prowl for some fun, detailed roleplay with guys and girls. [Here is my kink list, although it isn't quite as complete as it should/will be.](https://i.imgur.com/qUcdpUx.png) Hopefully that provides a somewhat helpful intro!

I like to think I'm a fun-loving and open-minded person, so do tell me your fantasies, I'd love to hear them no matter how dark or weird! My only big limits are scat, piss, vomit and blood. I like dirty talk, rough stuff, humiliation, cheating and incest, in addition to a hundred other things. I do have some scenarios I'm interested in, but these are not set in stone. Also, being bisexual, I feel that all of these could be adjusted a little to accommodate any ladies who may be interested!

* Your father was the CEO of a computer business that made billions, and we lived accordingly: a garish McMansion complete with stables, tennis courts, home cinema, home gym, pools...and a private jet. You and your sister were born with silver spoons in your mouths, and every need was catered for. Unfortunately, the government finds out that your father has neglected to pay his taxes for...oh, a few decades. Other unscrupulous business dealings come to light, and soon the family fund is empty: what didn't go to Uncle Sam and legal fees was used as bribe money. Our wealthy family has been ripped away from a life of entitled luxury, throwing us quite literally into the trailer park. Now, your father works as a janitor and your sister does meth. You, on the other hand, have always believed in working hard, and as such have earned an internship that could lead our family out of the trailer park...or perhaps, just you. And me, your beloved mother? I've secretly started to work as a stripper in the trashiest club in town. When you and your friends decide to hit said strip club, you're shocked to see me on stage, and yet you can't help but request a private dance...
* It's Halloween, and you've decided to crash the biggest party in town. Perfectly disguised among a sea of masks, you're more than a little surprised when your own mother not only fails to recognize you, but begins to make very hard-to-resist advances....
* I'm an English teacher, and you're the supremely arrogant jock who I've been battling ever since you arrived at school. You slouch in class with a smug smirk like some kind of king, making rude comments, talking back, sexting the cheerleaders and I'm pretty sure you're the one who drew that picture of me in the bathroom. I've done all I can short of suspending you, but yet, you're such a sports star that the school never backs me up. As the final year begins, the tension between us reaches boiling point as I'm pressured by the school board to give you high grades you don't deserve....and detention becomes something else altogether.
* As usual, my son limps home with a black eye. It's more than I can take: if the school refuses to do another about the working-class thug who terrorizes the school and bullies my boy, then I will. To make matters worse, my own daughter has a crush on you! Well, it all ends now. But when I go to your house to confront you, I can't help but be drawn to your raw animal magnetism and soon I'm committing the ultimate betrayal...
* I'm at all the soccer games, cheering on my son. With my minivan, yoga pants and sneakers I'm your typical soccer mom in many ways. But I look good enough, apparently, that a player on the opposing team can't help but take his eyes off me. Maybe the game just ends, or maybe my son suffers an injury that requires his father to take him to the hospital (an injury caused by the opposing player, perhaps) but whatever happens, I'm approached in the parking lot as I pack up the minivan, and this otherwise faithful and devoted wife gives into temptation...
* When you were only a boy, I killed your father and my husband for his terrible abuses. A decade later, I'm finally out of prison and ready to connect with my son. But prison has changed me, and the frequent visits and letters throughout the years have taken on a more lustful tone...now that I'm out, I wanna take care of the only man who ever stood by me...
* When my daughter joins the cheerleader squad, I'm thrilled that she's following in my footsteps. I have nothing but fond memories of my time as captain of the cheer team, and I still have something of a reputation. But when my girl's fellow cheerleaders start practicing at our home, I notice how many hero-worship me, and my bisexual lust is reawakened."
65zarn,5,2017-04-17,Why should I even bother going to college or university?,tellscope28,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/65zarn/why_should_i_even_bother_going_to_college_or/,"I need to get this off my chest as i've been internalizing this for over 5 years. Why should I bother going to college or university? 

Growing up everyone drills into your head that you're only successful if you have that fancy 40K+ piece of paper in your hands, but these are people like my parents who, back in their day, could go to school and get a 6 figure salary job handed to them sometimes months after graduating.

What's the point now? The world is so different and stacked against anyone starting up their life.

Nowadays the world is so shitty for millennial trying to start a life that school almost seems like a road block. The cost of living (in my area at least) is insane. Rent for the shittiest fucking ghetto bachelor apartment is like 1K a month minimum... And it
s not slowing down... By the time I actually theoretically get an education, find a job (that'll likely be paying pennies) i'll likely need to be a millionaire to be able to afford my own place and pay the bills.

Add on food that's conveniently more expensive along with more expenses... It adds up.

But hey, go to school to get a degree to get a high paying job! That'll take care of things! But for what? Spend that 40K that's burning a hole in my pocket along with 4 YEARS of education only to graduate and have people telling me left, right and centre that all jobs are going to be taken by robots... That my degree is worthless, etc etc... Then go job hunting and find that NO WHERE is hiring, or that my best bet is to get an unpaid internship in the hopes that they might just barely like me enough to keep me on full time? Yeah, an unpaid internship is really what I need when i'm 40K in debt, living on my parents couch and desperately searching for income!

Fuck, even my buddy who has a mechanical engineering degree is working at a damn grocery store. What hope do I have then? What's my fucking motivation to spend money, time and energy in university or college if all I have to look forward to is being told no by employers, or being told I can be brought on as an unpaid intern, or that my job is going to be taken by a robot in a few years? Or that i'll have a nice minimum wage job waiting for me to begin chipping away at my debt? What's the point!?

Add on the annoying shit I have to deal with on a personal level. Anxiety and depression - lots of which is in regards to not knowing what to do with my life. And then intense guilt for now going to school like what the rest of my classmates did... Now i'm 23 and if I go to school, i'll be 27 or 28 by the time I graduate.

And like I said, what do I even study? How am I supposed to decide what I want to dedicate my life so studying/working at such a young age? And no employers really allow you to job shadow to get a feel for the job... So i'm supposed to essentially decide what I want to do for the rest of my life by reading a 5 sentence brief paragraph of each program in a university booklet, or a brief job description? That's fucking bullshit. What if I like the description of something, spend 4 years and 40K+ studying that, then graduate, get into the work force of said job and find out that I DON'T actually like it? It's so stressful and it actually *pisses me off* that THIS is how we do shit in this society, that we're so comfortable doing this when it's such a stupid way of doing things. I need experience to decide what I want to do, and that experience isn't available unless you've already gone to school and committed to said degree while blindly not knowing if it's truly what you want to do.

Now most of my friends have graduated their respective schools and some of them are in retail, some are about to go back to school because they don't like what they graduated with... And i'm over here trying to figure out what to do.

I want to be able to live alone and move out of my parents house... I want to have a job that pays enough to cover my mandatory expenses while still leaving just enough to spend on luxuries, etc etc... But it seems like that's now a rarity in today's society.

And now housing prices continue to rise, making it even more impossible for people my age to reach their goals... I wanted to be able to move into a place in my hometown, but it's too expensive to realistically afford to have my own place here. University isn't going to get me a guaranteed job and a safe path to income and financial freedom, etc etc... So while all this is going on and the rates of depression and anxiety is rising in people my age, baby boomers are about to retire and sell their homes for 10X what they paid for and enjoy a nice cushy retirement where they'll have enough money to travel around the world 20 times and complain about how 'entitled and lazy' our generation is, while people my age will be working their ass off to make barely anything. This is awesome! 

Now I kind of understand why the rates of suicide are going up. It's so fucking hard to deal with this shit.

Edit: I forgot to mention that doing a trade is almost as favourable as death to me. That's the answer everyone gives when talking about careers... ""Just do a trade!"". I want to aim higher than that, but as i've explained in my rant, 'aiming higher' in today's society isn't guaranteed success and that stresses me :("

I haven't ever really vented or anything like the sort, so I just figured it might be something that could help? Can't hurt right?

---
My girlfriend and I (both 23 years old) absolutely owned the (big) long distance thing. We have been together for almost a year and a half and she's the love of my life. I fully intend on proposing down the road. And we are eagerly awaiting the day we can live together.

---

We've basically been doing some form of Long Distance since we met and continue to do so. We met through my best friend when she was in college closer to my area. It was 45 mins from my house (no small task) so I went up every weekend. When we both graduated (separate colleges) she got a summer job 7 hours away. It was a hard time (simply because of distance) but we went through it with flying colors and our love grew stronger because of it. 

---
Since that job, she moved back home (which is still 2.5 Hours from me, but it's a hell of a lot easier!) We both are now done with colleges and at the moment unemployed. She took a part time job just for student loans and I graduated a semester later, so I've been unemployed for 4 months now. I am now desperately applying to anything and everything in my field trying to get a job so we can move in together (our fields are vastly different, and very hard to find closer together) and stay at least within the state. Meanwhile I drive to her house every week, or every other week, and spend a few days with her. Every time it's just amazing. We both still live with our parents and her parents are a little difficult with letting me come up so often, but they still welcome me in so it works. We just want our own space, you know?

---
She just got a seasonal job offer in her field this week and she's taking it! I'm *so* happy for her. She starts in two weeks and it's 3 hours away. Basically what we are doing now, so it's not too bad. Her job gives her room and board, so if I get a job near there, we still won't have ""our place"" yet unfortunately. I'm not sure how that'll work *when* I get one closer, but that's another time. At least we'll be closer. Meanwhile I'm trying to look for a job that's close to her area. Every job I am applying to is closer to her than I am now, so anything is an improvement. I've applied to, at this moment, 82 jobs in four months. I've only had one interview which I didn't get. So it's hard to stay positive. But I just know that she's on the other end of this unemployment. So it keeps me going and keeps me motivated, despite some hard days.

---

All backstory given, how do you guys stay sane when she/he isn't around and you're back to long distance? I should know this, right? I've been doing it for literally all that we have been together. And it's honestly second nature. She is my soul mate and when I see her face and everything, all the troubles wash away. But the issue lies when I come home. 

---

I just got back from a *full week* with her. Her parents were gone for most of it so we played house. Haven't done that since her 7hour away summer job a while a go. It was just incredible. Just us two, like a glimpse into our future. 

---

I just got back home recently from that week, and just feel so... disconnected?



Hard to describe. But I have never felt like this before. Normally, i'm just happy as a clam all the time. Every person I know always describes me as such (or an equivalent haha). Even during our super long distance of 7 hours (mostly) I was always just delighted living life generally. And with her, when we can we play online games, use the Rabb.it service (which I highly highly recommend!), text and snapchat literally all day (except when she works obviously)and everything we can. And it's usually no problem. But I lately just felt down, though absolutely no fault with her or our relationship. I don't know if it's just the ever-growing weight of unemployment? I really think that's it. So that's why I ask... how do you guys stay positive/avoid boredom?

---


It also might come with another issue, wherein I found I might have a heart problem. I have been going to the gym every day for about 2 years. I thoroughly enjoy my time and make great progress and becoming very fit and whatnot! However I got news from my doctor when I had my yearly physical that there was an irregularity in my EKG. So I need to go to a bigger city near me with a ""state of the art"" hospital to scan me again. So no gym for a few weeks. Which really sucks. Because it not only gave me great results and allowed me to maintain my health, eat right, and get ready for bathing suit season (haha which I have never been too 100% happy with), but it gave me structure. A routine. (plus the idea something could be wrong does scare me a bit...)

---


When we did the 7 hour long distance thing, I was still in school. It made it easier. And I had an internship. Now that both are ended, and I'm just completely unemployed, getting no's from applications consistently, not hearing anything, no gym now (one of the few things keeping me sane without her when she isn't here, or working or anything) and just tired of being unemployed, coming home from the high's with her are just so much more burdensome. I'm always sad leaving her house, but I always am just like ""I'll be up soon again, probably next week!"" And go on positively. But I guess now that she'll be working, I don't know when that'll be, plus she'll be a tad further. Though hopefully I'll be able to stay with her at her new job for a week at at time which will be cool.


---

Wrapping up this rant, how do you all avoid the boredom? When I was with her (am with her) I am just euphoric. Every second, every minute with her, is everything I could ever want. And now that I come home, it's just... nothing. The unemployment, the boredom, the missing her. I mean, I am an artist, so I always just draw and she even likes going on Rabbit/Skype and watching me, when she can, which is cool. But sometimes (like now) I just don't even have the motivation for that; my muse.

Sorry for the long rant. I've never did anything like this before haha. Maybe it's just being overtired from the driving today making me a little more down in combination with everything. Either way, I appreciate you reading thus far. So the actual question; how do you guys prevent the boredom (I guess in a situation like mine which, like I said, is kind of specific). Maybe it's just a down state tonight and it'll pass in a little. I sometimes have a small down state and get in my own head about it, but it usually passes soon, or I can just remind myself everything's fine and I have her, and life is still great, this is temporary, and I'll bounce back. But It's lasting a bit longer than usual, so I just want to vent a little and maybe gather some advice, hence the post. Thank you all for reading!"

It was only used for about 5-6 weeks and is in damn near pristine condition. I kept all the contents and can be packaged back up in the box with the initial padding and USB cable.

Looking for $110 + shipping. But feel free to make an offer as well!
I can also do a local pickup if you're near the Seattle area.

Uhh...let's see. They're pretty much just walking. They uh, they do that a lot, I hear. On the way to slay that um... that big bad guy everyone is so up in arms about! Yes...uh, Rengorak or something! Isn't he just the worst?

Or-erhm, wait, have they already slain Rencork? Is this while they're walking towards the...oh, you don't know about that yet, do you? Oh man, this narration thing is exhausting! Who can keep up with all these threads? Let's see, they are on their way home! *That's* what you're supposed to think! 

Well, I don't want to be telling tales out of school, but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't happen to make it home, *wink.* Can I play a sound effect or something? I feel like it was pretty lame to just say wink out loud, without an accompanying twinkle sound or something. Whatever. I'm just saying, maybe don't get to attached to the tall one. 

Aw shit, now they're saying something. The girl is...uh saying something along the lines of ""Wait a second, how did you know about Renthore's weakness?"" to the skinny one. 

The skinny one is one shifty motherfucker. I don't trust him. Aw shoot, he just said something! Let me just go over my notes here for a minute.

Let's see here...oh yes, he was making some excuse or other, about having read it in a book. The others are not buying it. Their Mommas didn't raise no fool, they are thinking. Probably. At least something equivalent. 

Now the tall one is saying ""And how did you know when the guards would be off duty?"" or something. Wow. How did they not know he was rotten from the beginning? I mean, come on now tall guy. It ain't rocket surgery. 

There it is! The skinny guy has drawn his sword! Oh it's all kicking off now. He's kicking their asses. ""Turns out I was a baddie all along!"" he is saying I bet, between thrusts of his mighty sword. Wow, look at me, keeping up the lingo. Maybe I should do this full time! 

Anyway, it looks like the girl is about to die! Oh no! But wait! The tall guy! Who could have seen this coming? He is sacrificing himself to save her! Wow. I am in tears, almost. That was one climactic finish. There's not a dry eye in the house, I bet. 

""How could you?"" the girl is saying as she holds the tall guy's corpse. That's pretty dumb. He just told her he was a baddy. Why is she surprised? Does she not remember that death fight they all just had? 

""I did it for my family. They were slaughtered by the Wright family! Like dogs! Woof Woof!"" Man, I should be a dialogue writer. Could you tell what bit I added on there? Go ahead, guess. 

Now the skinny guy is leaving. Walking away as she holds the dead tall guy. What a life. Surviving the wrath of Rango, just to be slaughtered by a friend. End Scene.

6602vl,2,2017-04-17,I [20M] got this girl's [19/20?F] number two-ish weeks ago and I have no idea what I'm doing.,IsItTooLateToText,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6602vl/i_20m_got_this_girls_1920f_number_twoish_weeks/,"I'll start this off by saying I'm at the absolute bottom when it comes to talking to girls - I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I've talked to like one girl in my entire life and that's about it.

Anyway, there's this cute girl in my math class that I've noticed over the past few semesters. I've tried talking to her a couple times in those semesters, but it never felt ""right"" to me. About two weeks ago I just said fuck it and talked to her as we were waiting for class, she remembered who I was from the brief conversations we've had, and I got her number. She seemed nice enough, but I have no idea how to gauge interest. Last week I tried talking to her again, and while it didn't go as smoothly as two weeks ago, it went kind of, ""eh."" I didn't know what to really say, I just kept talking about mutual classes and exams and kind of ran out of ideas to say. Since then I got sick and wasn't able to talk to her, and today I just pussied out for lack of a better term since the situation was just slightly different and I felt uncomfortable.

I can say I have *some* idea of what she's doing/her academic interests, if that means anything. We're the same small major, she's slightly ahead of me because I transferred into the program, and she won't be on campus next semester for an internship, so that sort of sucks. Semester ends in 2 weeks, and the only thing I've texted her is, ""Hey it's A from B class, you told me [something from conversation earlier.] Do you happen to know the room number?"" and that's it. I'm struggling to figure out how to break the friendship barrier and get to know her more, since dating is fast approaching the end of the window of possibility, if it hasn't already left.

I just don't know what to do. I realize it's two weeks too, did I just miss the opportunity to text her? Do I text her one day, ""Hey, what's up?"" Do I talk to her one more time and ask less school-based questions like, ""So, what do you do during breaks?""(I have two more classes with her this week, but the best opportunity would probably be the 2nd class).
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm new to everything, I got this cute girl's number two weeks ago, and I legitimately don't know what to do, but I've only really talked to her about school so far. I'd like to at least become her from before the semester ends in two weeks, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in dating her. What do?"
660o4h,23,2017-04-18,"Classifying softs, and clarifying what is and is not a 'strong' soft",whistleridge,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/660o4h/classifying_softs_and_clarifying_what_is_and_is/,"Ok, so I posted a clarification of softs in a thread the other day, based on a recollection of a prior post I recall read. I could never find that post, but this bothered me, so I've done some more research since then both on and offline. In my prior career, I was a career counselor at a university, and I was able to consult a few professional contacts to flesh out a better idea of what does and does not make for 'strong' softs.

Here's what I found. 

*(Caveat: this is one guy's digging around, not an official LSAC guide. Any mistakes are mine, and hopefully honest ones.)*

**What is a soft?**

There are 2 'hard' pieces of data in every application: the LSAT, and your (original) *undergraduate* GPA. That's it. Everything else is a 'soft' factor in some way or another. 

""But *whistleridge*,"" I hear you saying, ""what about URM? Or..."" Nope: LSAT, GPA, that's it. 

Here's why. 

*Every application has to include those two numbers.* They don't have to include anything else. You could opt not to identify URM status. You could opt to upload a blank personal statement. You could ask your recommenders to upload one-sentence documents saying 'I have no recollection of this student'. Those would all be silly things, but...at the end of the day, if you have a 178 and a 3.9, you could probably do nothing else and still get into a very large number of schools. 

Because those are hard. 

*Everything* else is soft. 

One last thing: softs come in both positive and negative flavors. When people talk about softs or strong softs, they usually mean positive: they were President of the knitting club, or a law clerk, or what have you. But there are also negative softs, that might need to be offset: a history of DUIs, or a history of being fired. Usually these are things that are required to be explained briefly in an application, but sometimes not. A divorce or a medical condition may not demand specific attention, but may still be something worth discussing. 

**When do softs count?**

In general terms, [applications can be said to fall into one of four categories](http://www.lsac.org/jd/applying-to-law-school/whom-to-admit):

1. Auto Admit - if you don't have a huge negative you are in. Softs don't matter. *(Note: if you're too strong here, the much-speculated-upon [yield protect](https://www.law.umich.edu/connection/a2z/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=11) might come into play.)*

2. Target - you are most likely in based on numbers, but if the admissions committee (AdComm) doesn't like something, you might be waitlisted or even denied. Softs play a small role here, but the real difference makers at this level are Letters of Recommendation (LORs) and your personal statement (PS). 

3. Reach - You might be in, but the AdComm has to have a reason to like you. Here is where softs really matter, as they are THE prime tie-breaker.

4. Auto Deny - they only read your application to check if you are a URM or if you cured cancer. Only epic softs matter. This is usually when you fall below both medians.

All well and good so far, but this simplifies two realities: first, schools have a finite number of seats to offer, and second, [top-down admissions](http://www.deloggio.com/completing/early%20myth.html) can make getting to the softs a bit tricky. For those unfamiliar with top-down admissions, it works like this: take your GPA and multiply by M (it varies by school), then add your LSAT. This gives you something called your [index number](http://www.prelawhandbook.com/admission_index). So if you have a 3.85 and a 165, and M = 10 (for easy math), your index number would be 204. 

This is important, because *schools don't look at applications on a first-come, first-served basis*. They want the best students they can get. So they have identified ranges of index numbers that correspond with the above four categories. So for our imaginary law school, anything above a 210 is an Auto Admit, 204-210 is our Target, 198-204 is a Reach, and anything below 198 is Auto Deny. Each day, they start with the highest numbered applications that they have, and process those first. If you're a 215, great. But if you're a 199 super-splitter with a 178 and a 2.1, you might have to wait awhile. 

Nor are all schools created equal. As a general rule of thumb, the [higher-ranked the school is, the narrower its range of admissions numbers](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/the-short-list-grad-school/articles/2017-03-21/12-law-schools-where-students-have-the-highest-lsat-scores). So if you're applying to, say, the [University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign (UIUC)](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign-03053) successful applicants will cover a wider spread of LSAT and GPA numbers than will applicants to, say, [Columbia](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/columbia-university-03104). This means that, while you can still have a realistic chance of getting into UIUC with a lower index number, your softs also probably matter less as well - a wider range makes it easier to differentiate solely on the basis of numbers, a narrower range does not. 

**So how does this play out?**

The result of these factors is that softs can also be divided into 4 categories, based on rarity and difficulty of achievement. [On the LSAC site](http://www.lsac.org/jd/applying-to-law-school/whom-to-admit) they identify a list of possible 'other factors', but they don't call them softs, and they don't sort them by importance. Below is an attempt to do that. 

*Note: this is not authoritative. It is a broad attempt to provide context for how softs fit into the application process. There are exceptions to every rule, and yes: the numbers may be off. Think 'ballpark idea', not 'oh shit, now I know *exactly* how School X will look at my internship. Also: I'm treating URM as a soft. Deal.*

**Tier 1** *(extremely rare, but do occur - think as few as 1-10 nationwide per cycle, probably no more than 100, most or all will be HYSCCN-level applicants; could alter outcomes as much as 5 additional LSAT points)*:

* High decorations for valor in military service (Congressional Medal of Honor, DSC/Navy Cross, Silver Star)
* Rhodes scholarship
* Started multimillion-dollar company/innovative service that is household name
* C-level executive in publicly traded/Fortune 500 company
* Professional athlete/college athlete who was a lock for professional except for injury
* Widely published author/heavily cited academic
* Prior high expertise in field (surgeon who invented technique, etc)
* URM: Native American, Alaskan Native (on the coasts; less exclusive near inland reservations)

**Tier 2** *(rare, but not extraordinary - think a few tens to not much more than 1000 per cycle, mostly T14 level applicants, or leading flagship program on full ride in home state; could alter outcomes as much as 3 additional LSAT points):*

* Decorated military service (Purple Heart, Bronze Star)
* Fulbright/other prestigious scholarship
* NCAA athlete in standout position, eg household basketball name, led water polo team to 3 titles, etc
* Overcome extraordinary physical/mental handicap (ALS, blind &amp; deaf, etc)
* High level (director, etc) position in prior employment
* Prior demonstrations of high expertise (patents, etc)
* URM: all except Native American/Alaskan Native (placing URM is tricky, because schools have different needs; Native Americans are numerically rarest, so they get a step above, no matter where you place minorities on this scale. Also, Asian is not URM. Such is life.)

**Tier 3** *(not rare, but not common - a few hundred to a few thousand per cycle, mostly top 50 applicants, will be in the running for scholarships; could alter outcomes as much as 1-2 additional LSAT points):*

* Commissioned military service
* Prestigious undergraduate scholarships and/or research awards
* NCAA athlete
* Overcame extraordinary adversity (childhood poverty, physical/mental handicap, etc)
* Published academic
* Peace Corps/Americorps/other public service
* Prior employment in legal field or otherwise pertinent area (engineer for IP, etc)
* Disadvantaged status: homosexual, first in family to attend college, single working parent, etc.

**Tier 4** *(common - think thousands per cycle, as almost everyone has at least one. People with these apply to everywhere, including TTTT schools; will not alter outcomes from GPA/LSAT):*

* Any military service
* Legal internships
* Congressional internships
* President/officer of clubs/frat/etc
* School newspaper/yearbook/etc
* Honors societies

So there you have it. Softs matter, particularly as tie-breakers, but very, very few 'strong softs' are as strong as the person claiming them might think. To quote one admissions professional I spoke with, most softs are worth no more than 1-2 LSAT points, if that. Only truly extraordinary Tier 1 and Tier 2 softs can be worth the kinds of 'bat above the average' results that people often hope for. "

i am a (Junior) Motion Designer from Berlin, Germany.

I graduated last year in September with a Bachelor of Arts in Film+Motion Design and now im looking for a good start to get into freelancing.

Currently i am working fulltime in a company that needed a motion graphics artist for a project that is getting canceled at the end of april.
They wont need me anymore and my contract (the contract goes until 30. april) will expire. 
(The Client decided they will do the graphics intern)

Now i am searching for work again. I really liked the fulltime job because i learned alot and managed to get a better day routine that i want to keep.
With the new chance at the end of april i wanted to try to get into freelanceing  but i am not sure how to start.

From what i read here and from the Mike Monteiro Website i already learned some things but, for example ""to get referrals"" or "" be good to work with"" i think you have to have some jobs.

Now thats the point. Getting the first jobs.
I plan to apply for fulltime jobs again but with the additional info, that i would like to work as a freelancer aswell.

Besides that i always look thorugh Jobsites that i know(for berlin), grow my social media sites and soonish im going to build a webiste for me. 

Now i guess i need you help. What can i advert myself to alot/more people?
Are ther any websites i can use that i dont know?
If you have any link to helpful posts here i would like to see those too.

Im always open to questions if you got something important.

Thanks alot.

At the moment i'm doing an internship in Norway and for my project i'm running Western blots for Nematostella vectensis protein extracts. But we're struggling with our Actin antibody, which should be our positive control. 
It shows a few bands, while we want it to show 1 band around 45kDa. So we can imagine that the different band represent different configurations of the actin protein. but how do we get it to be in only 1 configuration? We think the antibody concentration should be fine since we use the same as in every reference. We tried Laemmli sample buffers with DTT and b-mercapto-ethanol but both gave the same bands.

Anyone has an idea, If any additional information is needed I can provide this

Maybe that's because it's 4am and everyone but me is asleep. Finally, after much tension and the nonstop drone of her caustic voice, the Red Queen grew tired of her tiring game; the game she basically terrorizes everyone that lives under her roof into playing. I'll explain.

The Game of the Royal Court

Part 1: Mommy Dearest

There is a woman who was heavily steeped in traditional Filipino culture; marinated in Catholic guilt; infused with the toxic femininity of an aging beauty queen with growing signs of denentia. 

The woman somehow became unaware of how much of her own mother's qualities she adopted for her own. I recall many years ago my mother lamenting ever becoming like her mother (my grandmother). It's a little too late for that. My mother has transformed over time into an ornery tyrant with an obsession with food, social status, and controlling everyone around her; ensuring they never truly leave her side.

Part 2: Call to Freedom

It's heartbreaking for me to write this, but I know I must for my own healing. I've spent many hours watching videos and reading books, articles, and websites intended to help those trying to escape and heal from narcissistic abuse. One of my favorite mentors in this effort is Richard Grannon (aka Spartan Life Coach). He gets right to the heart of the matter in a practical, no-nonsense way. He's an ordinary guy; not self-appointed guru or savior. That's what I like most about him. It's reassuring to know I have someone like this to turn to whenever I need a reminder of what sanity looks like.

To complicate matters, what has made my life more difficult than it probably would have been otherwise is the fact that I appear to have high-functioning autism (aka Asperger Syndrome). What this basically amounts to is that I am extremely solitary by nature and highly cerebral and sensitive. I can feel deeply, but I have trouble with knowing what is and isn't socially appropriate a lot of the time. It doesn't help that my parents were terrible role models growing up. Fortunately, however, I am taking my life into my own hands now on this day as a /7-year-old androgynous woman/XX-chromosome person.

Part 3: 

Less than twenty-four hours ago, the Red Queen and the man she cheated on  her husband with had a big screaming match. This sort of tension building and explosive arguments is common in the court of the Red Queen, but this particular incident was different.

It always seems to mirror my development. Whenever I make strides towards independence and happiness, my parents become even more clingy than usual. They start to fight more. Almost always it's the Red Queen who initiates these fights. She doesn't really have an outlet besides her music that allows her to truly self-reflect and release emotions in a respectful manner. I, unfortunately, adopted some of her bad habits. I choose to stop today.

Anyway, the Red Queen always needs a target for her rage. She needs a man (whether it's my dad, my brother, me, or her boyfriend) to be available for her to use. She bribes us into servitude, compliance, and silence with unsolicited gifts of food and money. She has trained her monkeys to basically worship her like some kind of fascist dictator. She CONSTANTLY needs to promote herself as better than how she actually is. Living in her midst is a full-time job. I can't even escape her influence at Dad's house since Dad is basically an extension of Mom and Dad is basically giving preferential treatment to Sarah, another entitled baby boomer princess. She is a light sleeper, and I tend to be clumsy, so I'm trying to avoid making too much noise since she has work (and because I want her to feel comfortable and free to use the house as much as possible).

Basically, I'm escaping the dreary royal court by, (1) learning to live off the grid and in the shadows, (2) building a stronger spiritual and community support system so that it doesn't feel like it's me verses the world, and (3) I'm carefully documenting and refining my personal story since I've been psychologically smothered by my emotionally abusive family of origin and narcissistic ex boyfriends.

Part 4: Goodbye Bob

For less than a year I dated a man roughly my age whom I used to work with as an intern. I remember Bob always posturing himself as the most knowledgeable one. I had a definite crush on him and fabticized about getting intimate with him. After my six-year super-enmeshed relationship with Spencer fell apart, Bob and I appeared to be going steady as lovers. Our relationship took a nosedive after both of us ended up staying in psychiatric hospitals due to suicidal behavior.

What shocked me about Bob's behavior was his startling lack of compassion and insight what was taking place between us. I wasn't expecting him to be so cold, cruel, and dismissive. Slowly I allowed him to brainwash me into thinking I'm worthless since that's how he treated me. I was lower than a prostitute since I wasn't really being paid for any of the sex, affection, and care I showed him. I thought that, by investing in our relationship, he would do the same. I was wrong.

It turns out that Bob is very focused on himself. His primary concern is his own self-image. I think he used me as a scapegoat and justified doing so since I volunteered to be at his beck and call (much the way Dad is ready 24/7 to cater to Mom's every demand).

I never want to end up like my parents. My dad annoys me even more than my mom since he has the power to set boundaries but refuses to. In fact, he seems angry at me for wanting to have my own space. So it appears that he deliberately invades my space by going into my room and messing with my shit. He also has an annoying habit of following he around the house.

Here's the thing: it's degrading having to live this way; constantly running back and fourth to avoid the toxicity of my parents while they spend their days partying and placating the Red Queen. It's a fucking battle just to establish any sort of routine or stability for myself. My parents are green-eyed monsters who seem hellbent on knocking down every sand castle I build. 

That is why I am so active on social media. I post a lot of shit on social media in order to eek out any ""dying words"" since the C-PTSD and/or borderline tendencies I developed as a result of living in this toxic family has caused me to fear for my life every day in extreme ways. I feel like I need to be my own advocate. If I don't, I may very well be eaten alive (emotionally).

TL;DR I live like a refugee under the dictatorship of my narcissistic family of origin while I fight to preserve my sanity and work towards my emancipation. Once I get a job that can sustain me, I plan on living an economical and low-impact lifestyle that will give me maximum freedom and control. That's what I've wanted all my life."

My options are Hofstra, Syracuse, and Suffolk. Right now I'm leaning towards Hofstra, but I'm also aware that Syracuse has a good film program, I'm just worried it will be hard to get internships and experince so far from any place producing movies while Hofstra is just outside of NYC. 

I'm hoping for a chance to experience every aspect of production. Then from there specialize into one area. I already have a goodbackground with producing so I'd like to start working asap.

I'm not asking for this sub to make my decision but if anyone here has been to one or more of these schools and knows about what they offer I'd love some input. Thanks is advance!"

HI there, I'm currently a senior in high school about to graduate in June.

Remember how much pain you were in on the night she decided she thought it wouldn't work out between you two anymore. The shotgun blast to the heart you felt, defeated wishing she didn't just say that. You caved in and agreed even though you wish it wasn't true. You started no contact. The pain you felt looking through all of your photos and videos of you two together, knowing it was the end. Then she came in contact to request for her stuff and yours. You did so, and broke down in person trying to hold back the pain you couldn't with hold. She sat there, watching the pain she inflicted feeling bad, but still not wanting to come back. You took your stuff, and felt conflicted all day long broken. 

Remember the pain you felt giving her the last message saying that you weren't ready yet so you blocked her and unfriended everyone that was associated with her.  Then you deleted everything off Facebook that was related to you two. 
Remember that pain... Is it worth experiencing it again for her? No, she isn't worth it anymore. 

You're coming to the close of your junior year in college, leasing your first apartment in may, working for the IT department on your campus for the summer, possibly internships await as well. You have so much ahead of you and your family and friends have been helping you every step of the way. 


Keep looking forward and don't look back; You have already gone so far without her! ""

I've got work experience as an intern in IT, will be getting my CS degree in a year, and this summer will be spent a lot on preparing for a certification exam starting as soon as I set my sights on one.

**My Analysis**

[One of my favorite seasons so far. Devin was a great saboteur. The entire time it was Cindy and Sandra VS Nicole and Devin, and numerous pawns were sent home in the crossfire. Eventually one pair triumphed over the other in the best way possible. Cindy winning the coup d'etat and sabotaging Nicole's HOH was the best. I would have preferred a Devin win, but Nicole didn't play a bad game either.](/spoiler)

My favorites this time were Nicole, Devin, Sandra, Cindy, and Marty.

I'm currently a software engineering student. As part of my college program, it's mandatory that I complete 2 semesters and 1 summers worth of paid internships at companies in order for me to graduate. I've already had one internship at a smaller company in my hometown where I was paid $20/hour. I've built a good relationship with this company, and I've been told by my boss/manager that I would be able to work for them in the summers.

My next internship is with a tech company in the San Francisco. This company is paying me $39/hour as well as covering my relocation and living costs.

Since I plan on working for company I had my first internship with during the summer, I'd like to negotiate with the company that paid me $20/hour to get a raise. I don't expect to get $39 an hour since living expenses are dramatically less than in San Francisco and I live at home with my parents. I remember hearing that the company pays full fledged developers anywhere from $60 to $80 per hour. 

Can you guys recommend on how to approach this? Thanks."

666mx8,18,2017-04-18,Bad teacher rant,catwithaglasseye,socialwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialwork/comments/666mx8/bad_teacher_rant/,"Hey loves, I need to rant about a very discouraging day I had. I'm in a BSW program now and will be a senior next semester. One professor I've had has been incredibly tough on me and I feel singled out. 

As a back story; I have an alcoholic mother who is in end stage of the disease. Shakes, early jaundice, the works. She's a mean drunk and in the middle of the semester I had to move about twenty minutes away to live with my dad. Whom is also sick with a heart defect and diabetes. My mother also gets extremely aggressive when drunk. She's thrown cabinets at me, slapped me, pushed me, spit in my face, the works. (Yes I have my own therapist I'm dealing with it)

Anyway; mom has a habit of texting me when she's withdrawling and because I'm not an idiot I know that ETOH is the only one you can really die withdrawling from. I can usually tell when she's being dramatic for attention or being serious. During the first incident i could tell she was dramatizing so I text her and let her know I am in Professor X's class and I can't talk, I'll call her at the end. Before I hit send Professor X grabs my phone from my hand after politely asking three other people to put their phones away. After class she asks me to stay and why did I need to be on the phone (all while with holding my personal property in attempts to get me to tell her what's happening and making me late for my next course) I politely apologize and say that I will try and be better about it. This is not enough. She keeps digging. My mother is an incredibly touchy subject for me and when I am confronted about her I get very easily upset. I realize I was probably coming off as rude but Professor X gives me my phone back I tell her it's not her business and I leave. 

(Please keep in mind, my advisor at the school and the director of the program know everything happening. At the point of incident 1, director is willing to go to the dean of the school to ask she waive housing fees so I may live in a dorm the remainder of the semester.) 

Jump to today; I was 15 minutes late to class. Moms is melting down, I am sick, I am stuck in traffic, and over it before it starts. Class went fine. I participated, turned in work, did decent on a quiz, went about my day. I get an update that Professor X has given me an academic citation for being late. I emailed her asking to talk to her and she instructs me to leave my current class to come to her office. (I'm upset so I do. Not a wise move but 2nd professors syllabus says you don't have to attend class to pass so I left) I go to her office and it's like a shit storm. She tells me I am rude and mean. She tells me I want to do whatever without consequence. I never apologize for being late or looking at my phone. I have a god complex and cannot take criticism. She has to be extreme with me and embarrass me to get me to deal with my ""bad behaviors"" (hence snatching my phone from my hand in incident 1) she also says I will embarrass the school at my internship, and leave a bad name for the school and director and placement will not want students after this because of me. 

I try and just take it, she will not be teaching semester and I assume if I can somehow appease her I'll make it through the remaining few weeks of the semester. Than she says it.

""I don't understand you at all. Nobody at your home is actively suicidal so you're just being difficult. This isn't going to work.""

I'm not proud of this, but I lost my shit. Totally just let it all out. 

I yelled at her. I'm a grown woman. I yelled at a teacher. 

I told her that her entitlement to my life outside of her class is astounding, and I was given no prior warnings to either incidents. It is unethical that she felt she had to embarrass me to get her way. My mother is actively suicidal, and my father is dealing with a heart defect that he will just die from one day. There is no treatment, sudden cardiac death and then it's over. I told her I was late because I had to go pick up my drunk mother because she couldn't get home and she somehow still has a high paying job that she will lose if she gets a DUI. I tell her that advisor and director both know as well. I tell her that this degree and internship are all I have left to get out of this god forsaken town and if she takes that away from me, I will have a mental breakdown. 

At this point, I think it clicks in her brain. But my meltdown had started and I wasn't able to stop. 

My mom blacks out and throws furniture. It has hit me, she has physically hit me, and the emotional abuse doesn't stop. I am an only child. Everyone on my dad's side besides me and my dad are dead. She won't seek help due to her families opinion. (She's very high functioning, despite a lot of this). I have to handle this. I am attempting to distance myself but as a therapist she should know this takes time. I want the academic reprimand removed and I will not apologize to her for being late, because it was not my choice. I will not choose between her class and fronting bail money I don't have. Until I'm at a point where I can give my mom an ultimatum I will continue to pick her.  I participate, with hold an A in her course, and have always turned work in early. I cannot understand her choice to do this, and her inconsistency is making it worse. 

I'm mid panic attack at this point. 

I tell her that she is awful, and she cannot fathom what I'm dealing with. (Realistically I'm sure she probably can but mid break down I think I was just being a bitch at this point.) But that she should be happy that her hurtful words pushed a student into a panic attack and finally forced me to tell her my problems. I tell her if she's got any other problems she can email my advisor and I will deal with advisor. 

She tells me I should have let her in on this issue as soon as it started happening. 

I told her I'm incredibly embarrassed by the entire situation and now even more that I've felt forced to tell her, and I will not tell my internship about it. I will have a more effective distance from my mother as there is five months for me to do so between today and internship start. 

My advisor finds me later on and shows me she sent the reprimand on my account. I tell her everything. The look on her face was of true shock. She assures me that both her and the director placed me in my internship for a reason and no other professors have had anything negative to say. She removes the reprimand from my transcript and account. She asks me that if anything happens with my mom between today and semester end that I can tell her and she will deal with Professor X for me. 

I'm just so hurt. I used to look up to this professor and never meant to make her feel disrespected. Her unwarranted attack on me felt very personal. I'm super grateful for my advisor and director who came to my saving grace today. But I can't help but feel discouraged. 

I think I went into a panic attack because as Professor X was saying all those mean things about me, I just heard my mom too. Saying every nasty thing she's ever said. I can take criticism and be reprimanded without issue, and be constructive in my response and find solutions but this just. This hurt. I know long term she's not going to be on staff anymore after this semester but I just ugh. Rant I guess. I feel discouraged. I feel sad. "
666n4w,66,2017-04-18,Whose makeup/style drives you the most crazy?,Spenny120,teenmom,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenmom/comments/666n4w/whose_makeupstyle_drives_you_the_most_crazy/,"I think it's pretty clear that most of these girls have no dress sense or makeup skills, but watching the latest episode i think I've developed a few pet peeves.

-Amber wears fake eyelashes that are not long enough to cover her entire lashline, and it makes her eyes look really small and squinty, along with her face being so round and her always wearing her hair back. I won't even comment on her ""people tell me I have an eye for fashion"" because I think her people of Walmart chic wardrobe speaks for itself.


-Farrah used to have pretty good makeup generally, but the blonde hair extensions look god awful on her and suddenly her makeup is on par with Deb's. Her face looks really oily and pink, and her lips take up like half of her face which, much like Amber, makes her eyes look small. Her wardrobe drives me the most crazy because she either dresses in cheap looking club wear, or like she's an intern in my office wearing something from the Candies collection. She's really the only one you'd expect fashionable, and she just isnt.

-Maci looked the best when she had short hair, it's just long and stringy looking, but otherwise her style is very basic. It's so boring it's not even worth commenting on, but I figured if I was going to be a bitch about something so trivial I should do it to all of them lol

-Catelynn. Oh, Catelynn. She's not unattractive by any means, but it's like she doesn't even try. If I didn't follow the series I would honestly think she was in her 40s. Her hair is so much better than when she had the Kate Gosselin haircut, but she is in desperate need of a makeover.

Can we please bring back What Not to Wear and have a Teen Mom edition?"

I am 21 and have had a few high paying intersnhips. Right now I have around $40,000 sitting in my savings doing nothing. I want to invest the money but I am not sure what the best method would be with markets at all time highs. I have been looking at putting money in index funds through Vanguard but have a few questions:

1. Should I invest all $40,000 right now? OR Wait til markets go down? OR Should I invest it in equal increments over time? OR Should I do a dollar cost averaging method? -- What would be the best way to do this?

2. How should I diversify my investments? I am only 21, so a more aggresive/risky strategy could be advantageous right now, right?

3. Is there anything that I am overlooking right now that I should be doing?


Additional info about me:

- I expect to make +$100,000 out of college

- I have one year left of college, but will make about $20,000 this summer so that will pay for my final year

- I am single and have no plans on having a family anytime soon

- Apart from that $40,000, I already have built up an emergency/ rainy day fund

- I have been maxing out a Roth IRA for the past three years

- I have no debt

- I have a reliable car

- The internship I work does not offer a 401k

666w5o,15,2017-04-18,So financial planning for next year is looking rough :(,jollybeans01,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/666w5o/so_financial_planning_for_next_year_is_looking/,"Trying to figure out finances for next year is just quite a rude awakening.

- Salary of $5k/month is more like $3000 after all taxes and stuff 
- Rent went from $900 to be around $1400 w/ utilities and a housemate
- Disability insurance and trying to put some money on IRA or whatever  $TBD
- Actually have to pay for parking at the hospital $30/mo
- ALL normal expenses remain (food, phone, car insurance, gas) $400-500/mo
- I'll probably be able to just pay the minimum for my REPAYE plan (~$380/mo )

I just feel like I should have some room to breathe a bit by having finally an income, like being able to have a small savings fund and maybe make a larger contribution to my loans (they are around $210K). I desperately need a car and probably soon enough a new computer (both are in their last days of life), and it sounds like I just won't have much fluidity at all to do any traveling during time off like I thought I could even though my cost of living already includes the financial sacrifice of having a housemate. With this plan, assuming no extra crazy costs come up, I have a residual $600 or so a month that I can use towards emergency fund, a new computer, or some educational resources, but I thought I would have a bit more leftover. I don't have dependents but also receive no $ support from anyone. My only possible way of saving that I can see is maybe moving to my sister's house later on (an hour away from residency) when my shifts numbers are reduced during 3rd/4th year, but as an intern I'm kind of stucked.   : /  

For those of you in expensive areas of the country (CA, NY, DC), are your  numbers looking this bad for next year? Are any of you considering forbearance for a year or two to achieve a slightly better standard of living (like having no housemates or a newer car?) , are you considering living under a bridge? to feed on cafeteria food exclusively?

66778o,1,2017-04-18,"My [17M] GF [17F] has the option of attending a great university in CA, should we try long distance or should we try to end on good terms so she can focus on school?",[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/66778o/my_17m_gf_17f_has_the_option_of_attending_a_great/,"My girlfriend has the opportunity to study either at Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) or the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV). She’s planning on studying civil engineering for her undergrad, and then go into law school from there. Most people have told her that the most important thing law school admissions officers consider are her GPA and her LSAT score, but she’s worried that the name of the university will weigh in negatively, e.g. a 3.5 GPA from Cal Poly would be better than a 4.0 from UNLV. If it wasn’t for the importance of the name of the school, I’m sure she would stay at UNLV. There are many more internship opportunities in Las Vegas for her in both law an engineering, and she won’t have that in Pomona, and she knows that.




More likely than not, she will end up going to study at Cal Poly, since that’s what her parents want for her and what they have wanted for a long time. I, on the other hand, will be going to UNLV, since I have a software engineering internship with a company that develops software infrastructure for Fortune 100 companies, and they are paying my tuition. 

This creates the possibility of a long distance relationship. I do not want to burden her in any way. I understand that if she goes out of state, it will be because she wants a better education. I personally disagree, because I think being a self-learner is much more important than the name of the school. I would obviously prefer if she stayed here, but I understand the amazing opportunity of studying at Cal Poly, and I will support her with what she ends up doing. I already told her that I would like her to stay, and even if we weren’t together, **it would make sense in some aspects for her to stay:** 

* One, UNLV is cheaper, and she could save that for law school. 

* Two, she could do more internships here. Experience &amp; connections &gt; name of school, imo. 

* Three, a less rigorous curriculum at UNLV would mean a higher GPA and more time for her to study for her LSAT. Lastly, we would be together. I really love this girl, and it hurts me so much to have to be in this position. I just want the best for her. 

* Four, (and thinking way ahead) I will be graduating with about $200K left over from scholarships and my internship paying for my university. I know that after we both finish our undergrad, I could help us move to another city so she can do her law school. 

I think that if she’s out of state, it would be a burden for her to maintain a LDR. Cal Poly is a rigorous engineering school, I know she’d have to study for her LSAT, I know she has to get accustomed to being in a new city, meet people in college, and I don’t want to make her have to choose between spending the weekend on Skype with me or going out and enjoying herself. I don’t want her to remember her college years as stressful because she had to keep our relationship alive. We have the chemistry, and when you have the chemistry, all you need is timing, but timing’s hard. I don’t think we have the timing right now :(

**I know she’d like to stay, but it’s not her decision, it’s her parents’.**  They want her to go to a top law school, so they’re afraid she won’t get accepted to a top law school if she goes to UNLV. So it comes down to either doing a long distance relationship, or breaking things up and letting her go. 

Reddit, please advice.

TLDR: GF will probably go study civil engineering out of state, will go into grad school thereafter. Her school has a rigorous program and I don't want to be a burden for her. Should we break up, or try LDR?"

I'm currently a junior in a university, however missed out on any research or internship opportunities last summer (I was transferring and didn't have too much guidance). 

Does anyone have some advice or comments on first time internships? I'm more or less scared of not really knowing what to do when I get there. I took all the same classes as everyone else, but still have the sinking of feeling of not having mentorship when I get there or something.

668jvl,1,2017-04-19,slacking and competition and mediocrity and whatnot,[deleted],GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/668jvl/slacking_and_competition_and_mediocrity_and/,"hey pals. throwaway account here. just need to get some thoughts out.

tl;dr - went from responsible A+ student to bad bad irresponsible slacker, constantly rejected from nearly everything competitive, no discipline or motivation, never built up the foundations for discipline, procrastinate to the nth degree, just want to get back on track and would appreciate advice or kind words i guess. 

i've been feeling so discouraged lately. i go to a crazy selective school for ""gifted"" students that regularly sends the top 30% of its student body to the ivy league, and nearly everyone else to top 50 colleges -- and honestly, i'm likely in the bottom 10% of the entire school. i was a straight A+ student at my old schools, and upon getting into my current one, i was comfortably average, which was fine by me. but some time later i lost the motivation to keep my grades above a certain level, and over the course of a few years, i fell to the place i'm in now: a self-proclaimed lazy asshole who never does homework, barely pays attention in class, and has no accomplishments to her name. granted, i've always disliked studying and homework, but i guess when it was so easy to get 95s and above i was able to keep myself working hard enough to stay at that level. the work is much harder at my current school, and unfortunately i think that's the main factor that pushed me into becoming more lazy and irresponsible than i ever was -- i'm constantly putting off work, handing in late assignments, nearly failing tests, and very frequently pulling all-nighters which are spent procrastinating instead of actually working. the worst part is that it's not only my grades that have slipped. it's my entire mindset. before going to my current school, i was super reliable, (basically an annoyingly responsible kiss-ass student in every way) and now i'm so irresponsible that i'm late to school daily and constantly lose things and forget to do things and etc etc etc. 

i know that being a slacker isn't really a big deal, but you have to understand that the kids at my school are constantly winning awards, getting internships, going to national tournaments, and taking college classes, all while managing to get straight As. i have done none of these things, and i'm slipping even further into my lazy rut as grades and extracurriculars are becoming exponentially more important. i guess the thing that triggered me to post here was being rejected by yet another summer program -- i've applied to three so far, and was immediately turned away by two of them. for the third one, i managed to proceed to the next step, but forgot to apply and was thus disqualified (and i probably wouldn't have gotten in anyway). i feel like a huge factor in my rejections are likely my mediocre recommendation letters, because frankly i'm a horrible student and just asked my nicest teachers to write something half decent. but i also applied to the programs super last minute -- i submitted each application literally a minute before it was due -- because i just couldn't manage to sit and focus and force myself to complete them beforehand. it feels like shit because i know that students from my school have managed to get into all of these things. i've also been rejected from basically everything competitive that i've applied for within my own school, and the irresponsibility factors into this, too, as i didn't proceed to the interview level of one of them because i didn't see the message about it (which was my own fault). but i feel like i'm not conveying the intensity of my irresponsibility enough -- i truly am a hopeless bonehead. for example, my school had a field trip recently and i arrived late with starbucks (which wasn't allowed onboard), lost the ticket for the boat 2 mins after getting it, waddled around until a teacher found me, and ended up not being able to go. crazy i know.

it's gotten to such a point that i have a solid reputation for being an irresponsible, lazy slacker, and i've somehow managed to surround myself with quite a few slackers as well. all of this contributes to a toxic environment, and i'd like to flip it all around and become the student (or rather, the person) i once was again. i've exhausted basically every resource on discipline and procrastination (no more zero days, the panic monster, etc), but thus far haven't been able to do what i've been telling myself to do for six years: JUST DO IT. just do the work, because that's pretty much the only solution......... but it's so hard when i'm so unmotivated and forgetful and irresponsible. i've looked into learning disabilities and concluded that i probably don't have one (although adderall might help lol), and just want to develop the discipline that i never had (even as a kid) and stop being so irresponsible (i don't know i've managed to do a 180 on the whole responsibility thing). at this point i've basically accepted mediocrity, but i wish i wouldn't -- how do i push myself to become better and do more?? i know that there's always time to change, but college applications are coming ever so much closer, and i really don't have the time to slack off anymore."

I'll try and keep this as short as possible but there is a lot of lead up so bare with me. Backstory about me, I'm 24 and took my first opiate as a junior in high school.  A lacrosse teammate had some when he broke his collarbone at practice and wasn't shy about sharing.  I had 1 or 2 5 mg vicodin and had the typical pink cloud feeling.  Safe to say I loved it.

Fast forward to 19 year old me.  I was working out almost every day, studying exercise science in college and was extremely passionate about it.  I was one of those people that looked forward to the gym.  Some days I went twice.  I LOVED pushing myself, which was ultimately my downfall.  I was squatting heavy one day, and had a missed rep accompanied with a small pop in my low back.  Diagnoses, 2 bulged discs.  Hurt too bad to lift anymore.  This tore me apart at the time. My main outlet in life was stripped from me and I found myself spending a lot of time smoking pot, playing video games, and laying down so as to not aggravate my back.  Tried physical therapy and a bunch of other stuff to try and heal over the course of the next year without any luck, and sort of gave up.  

Around age 20 I met a coworker had a hookup through his family members who were all prescribed blues. This is the time when it was all fun and games, and I could get lit off of half a blue and was cool with taking them once every week or two.  Besides, who the fuck spends 30$ on a pill consistently? It seemed ridiculous, so I only used it as a 'treat' of sorts.  Well, a month after I turned 21 in April of 2014, one of my best friends was hit by a car when crossing the street and died after being in a coma for 2 days.  I was devastated as were many of my friends, we were all a really tight knit group in highschool.  Around this time is when I began to abuse substances.  I was drinking a lot, smoking pot even more, and slowly the frequency that I would take blues increased.

Fast forward 5 months and I'm moved in with a long time friend (also mutual friend of the one that was hit by a car) while attending university.  He was doing blues as well and we would do them together.  Once again, at this time it was still seemingly all fun and games.  Sure, now it took a whole pill to get high, but the high was still amazing. I would even treat myself to 1 and a half sometimes.

About 2 months into living with this kid I met a girl I'll call Ashley.  Ashley and I hit it off from the very beginning and quickly fell in love.  The kind of relationship where after knowing eachother for a month we were spending almost every day together.  She was NOT a drug user and would occasionally smoke with me, and drink when we went out and partied.  Her dad was an addict and it affected her and her moms life incredibly.  So she was not okay with me using pills, which honestly is one of the reasons I didn't completely fall off back then.  We dated for two years, the entire time I was using on and off, and toward the end of the relationship there was a lot more time on. I should mention that throughout the relationship she found out once or twice and I would constantly be trying to cut back or quit completely.  The most time I got throughout our entire relationship was about a month.  We broke up last September and that is when it started to get really bad for me.  I felt like I didn't have anything ""holding me back"" and was able to get high whenever I wanted.  In addition to this, I found a new hookup that was on point.. I mean like hit him up and I could have blues within an hour 90% of the time.

My habit around then was 30-60mg 4-6 days a week (basically if I could afford it) and has progressed to 60-100mg every day (if i can afford it).  In this time I've tried to quit a lot.  I've had a lot of Day 1s, or at least days where I tell myself this is day one.  Almost always I get between 3-7, but hardly ever more than a week.  About a month and a half ago I experienced withdrawals badly for the first time and made it through, and got to day 9 then screwed up.  Since then I've been pretty deep into it and haven't been able to find the courage to start again.  Well, now I'm at the point where I'm starting to hurt within 12 hours of my last dose.  It's one of the worst feelings to know that I'm now completely dependent on them to feel physically normal.  It makes me sick to think about it.  One of those typical ""never thought it could happen to me"" bullshit stories.

So here's where I'm at.  I graduate college May 12th.  I have an internship in New York (I specifically found an internship far away to get away from my hookup and people i know), in the exercise and wellness field this summer and I leave May 15th.  Then after that I have to find a career and become a functioning adult human that saves money and pays bills and isn't fucking high all the time.  I can have 25 days by the time I leave if I start now.  So that's the goal.  Going to grind it out 1 day at a time until I'm on that plane with 25 days.  Getting away from the summer will only help solidify my sobriety.  Something that is really important to me is that I don't want to be hurting in New York the first week.  I don't want to quit because I can't get any pills. I want to quit because I fucking decided to quit.  I want to quit despite the fact that I could pick up if I wanted.  I want to show myself that I really can do this.

I plan on exercising daily, stretching and doing yoga (for my back pain) daily, going on walks, hikes, reading, writing in my journal, and playing online poker. Anyway, I doubt anyone made it this far but if you did thank you for reading.  I'm looking to post in the daily check in threads and find support in this community. If anyone wants an accountability partner I'd be happy to exchange messages via reddit, whatsapp, or text and discuss recovery with you. I want to beat it this time.  I'm done chasing the high, it brings nothing but despair.  I'm ready to be a normal human being again.

Love,

Anderzzz"

&gt; Hasler Iglesias clearly remembers the day he became a student militant, when at age 15 he joined a demonstration at his Caracas high school against the closing of RCTV, one of the last independent broadcast stations in Venezuela.

&gt; A decade later, Iglesias is recognized nationally as an effective critic of the embattled federal government.

&gt; &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s not that I&amp;#039;m unafraid, it&amp;#039;s that I won&amp;#039;t let fear stop me,&amp;quot; said Iglesias, who says he uses social media to get the word out about marches.

&gt; After the 2014 demonstrations resulted in many opposition leaders being jailed, Iglesias decided to take time off from politics, doing an internship with the Procter &amp; Gamble consumer products conglomerate and teaching citizenship ethics classes at a high school.

&gt; Iglesias said his primary obstacle is apathy on the part of students who have either curtailed their political activities for fear of repression or have left the country altogether.

&gt; &amp;quot;We all know we&amp;#039;re struggling against a government that generates fear but this fear is a small thing compared with the prospect of continuing to live the way we are,&amp;quot; Iglesias said.

I'm a 25 years old male living in London. I've just finished a BA in Advertising and I'm looking for a full-time gig. The only thing I did during my years at university are 3 different internships (one of them paid) and that's it.

London is so expensive and I'm wondering when I'll start to save some serious money. Right now it feel like I'll never will. The contracts I'm looking right now are all in the range of £18-22k per year... which is barely enough to live here.

Basically, I'll spend all of my salary in rent, food, transports, clothes etc. For how long will I've to stay like this? 2-3 years? I'll reach 30 without even noticing and without having any money.

Living without money sucks. I envy people who can spend money without the need of worrying about the fact... that they're spending money. I'm not talking about big expenses, but I'd love to be in a position where I know I can pay rent, food, transports, clothes, book flights, go to restaurants, book holidays etc without being like ""oh fuck, how am I going to eat this month?"".

I feel like I'll never reach this. Or maybe I will... when I'm already in my 40s or something. :\

What should I do?

Thanks!"

66bn9t,4,2017-04-19,[EVENT] The 'April Accords' on Labour Reform have been passed in France,Relativity_One,GlobalPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalPowers/comments/66bn9t/event_the_april_accords_on_labour_reform_have/,"With the new Presidential administration, perhaps the biggest challenge that it faces is to bring France's unemployment down to more manageable levels and in doing so, attempt to rein in the State's sovereign debt.

* While France's unemployment has been higher in comparison to other OECD members, part of the difficulty is that unemployment in France is diagnosed more as a structural issue than one tied to business cycles. Additionally, the matter has been exacerbated by the 2008/7 and 2011/12 recessions which pushed unemployment higher by two percentage points while the labour force failed to react in tandem with this increase. Labour tax cuts have made a dent with a slow long-term change occurring, bringing France more in line with the OECD average is an issue that various French governments have had difficulty in tackling. Perhaps the biggest factors influencing employment is **age** (youth unemployment is significantly higher than our European counterparts in Germany and the Netherlands) - **skills** (low-skilled workers have contributed to a drastic rise in unemployment in comparison to medium-to-high- skilled workers.) and **country of birth/citizenship** (those who are 1st generation EU28 immigrant workers are twice as likely to face unemployment and contribute 1 percent to the overall unemployment in France)

* While the government has attempted to address the issues of experience and skills in providing subsidisation of ""free jobs"" heeding IMF advice, this programme will be phased out in the third year in an attempt to manage the employment bubble. In doing so, le Ministre des Affaires sociales et de l'emploi (The Minister of Social Affairs and Employment) will be tasked by Président Macron in coordinating social policy in line with the Ministère de l'économie et des finances (Ministry for the Economy and Finance) in reforming the structural issues facing labour in France.

 * Part in parcel of the structural issues in France is the case of **'hysteresis'** - where the double-dip recession has created a cycle for French workers who are unemployed a harder time to find work which has lead to deteriorated professional networks and a self-perception of eroded skills. Thus 
**Pôle emploi (French Employment Agency) will be rolling out a new website where all unemployed job-seekers will be required to fill a form which gives a realistic match of skills with available job vacancies.** Vacancies shown will be linked with the geographical mobility allowing for vacancies from all of France registered with Pôle emploi. **Benefits will be linked to job applications provided through this website. (more information further down)** While this programme is not expected to be a magical cure for the skills mismatch within the vacancies posted, helping the unemployed in properly assessing their skills is only one addressing the problem.

 * Business and chambers of commerce will be presented with an **apprentice-traineeship programme for entry-level vacancies** -
 emphasis on low-skilled vacancies will be prioritised - will see the government offer tax credits per worker who completes the 6 months preliminary period before contract extension.

* One of the differences with France and other OECD members is that France's **employment protection** has been considered quite aggressive. Average compensation to French workers in labour arbitration in a typical **unfair dismissal of an employee of 20 years is approximately 16 months of salary.** While higher than most EU states - it is still lower than the average awards in Germany and Italy. What makes the matter more cumbersome for French business is that the state allows for a longer time after dismissal in which an employee can make a claim of unfair dismissal. In Germany, the length is only for 3 weeks, with Italy having 60 days and Spain 20 working days. **In France, a worker can legally act on an unfair dismissal up till 2 years**, creating uncertainty for French companies. **This limited will now be reduced to 1.5 months.** in a bid to remove a shadow of unforeseeable extra costs on French companies.

* [The 'El Khomri' law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Khomri_law) has **already come into full force** and will be limit the amounts of compensation claimable in dismissal procedures. A further benefit of the law is seen to target the amount of overtime payable to workers exceeding the 35 hour week.  Liberialisation of protected professions in [the Macron Law](http://www.oecd.org/france/the-positive-effects-expected-from-the-macron-law-show-that-france-must-pursue-its-structural-reform-initiatives.htm) as well as expanding regulation on week-end trading for retailers and reducing the limits on those acquiring a French drivers license has been a feature in the deregulation of French society and the economy. In doing so, **France must bring its unemployment benefits in line with OECD averages to push people to take advantage of a deregulated climate**.

 * While unemployment benefits are seen as a means to insure a smooth transitionary period for the unemployed while finding work, the degree of French unemployment benefits has created a too generous system, often abused as a means of avoiding work. While measurement of what degree of benefits the unemployed are awarded based on the net income replacement rate (57 percent) which is in line with the OECD average, the cap of benefits is far beyond comparison and removes the incentive for the French to return to work. In France, **the minimum qualification period for benefits is 4 months, with the maximum duration for benefits set at 24 months.** **The benefit cap is set a €7,134 per month which is ridiculously high in comparison to the OECD average.** 

   * **This cap will be reduced to €2,500 per month with the minimum qualification for benefits being 6 months and the maximum period set to 12 months.** 

 * In line with the new job-skills website by Pôle emploi, an active job search by all registered with Pôle emploi will be strictly enforced via the site. The criteria of a ""suitable job offer"" will be tightened that allows the wage to be no less than 65-100 percent in the first year of a new job, **lowering the legal minimum by 20 percent** and in **refusing the first reasonable job offer via this site, there will be a suspension of benefits for 3 weeks, with continued refusal seeing also a 35 percent reduction in the amount of benefits as well as optional further suspension.** 

* Ultra short-contract (less than a month) employment that receives the minimum wage and alternating to unemployment for benefits will be heavily monitored Pôle emploi with benefits per such an alternation to be cut by 25 percent per occurrence. This will be used as a deterrence against those abusing the system. Cases who are given such cuts will have 2 weeks to file an inquiry into the eligibility of such cuts.

* Seniors will see modified eligibility for extended benefits  and will be raised with unions in the bi-annual renegotiation of unemployment benefits, however the terms of benefit cap and length of eligibility for those non-seniors will be non-negotiable. **Seniors will now require to be aged 57 instead of 50 to receive extended benefits of up to 24 months instead of 36.** 

* A coefficient of 0.9 will be used instead of one day of contributions qualifies as one day of benefits.

*The calculation of the **minimum wage** in France is currently at 60 percent of the median wage - higher than OECD peers. **France will not reduce this to 50 percent in the upcoming 5 years and then to 45 percent. in the 5 years following the first reduction**.

* **Exemptions from minimum wage in France** is: ""Minimum wage is reduced by 10-20 percent for the young workers under 18 with less than 6 months of professional experience along with a lower minimum wage for apprentices"" will be modified to ""Those under the age of 18 years, apprentices, interns, and long-term unemployed during their first 6 months of re-employment are exempt from the minimum wage"". This will **increase the range of exemptions** within France to a European average.

******

##Political Reaction:
&gt; * Reception of the slew of reforms has seen the bills which have been coupled into the ""**April Accords**"" which has seen some left-wing papers and opinion columns call the accords more of an 'April Joke' on the electorate in France who wanted a moderate approach to tackling the high unemployment. 

&gt; * Previous election candidate and eternal fixture in presidential elections, Jean-Luc Mélenchon  has described the adoption of the April Accords as an assault on the French system and a further attack on the most vulnerable in society while former President Sarkozy has hailed the accords as a sign that France can reform. 

&gt; * *Le Monde* has deemed the accords as an act of political will in dragging France into line with its economic peers and praised the approach of attempting to bring France back to growth. *Le Figaro*'s analysts have pointed out to preliminary calculations from the *Cour des comptes* (Court of Audits) that the annual savings from the slew of reform modifications could account to a minimum of €4.5 billion per annum.

&gt; * PS (Parti socialiste) has decried the accords as harsh cold shower for the unemployed in France with the cuts to benefits being implemented harshly with no case-by-case basis. Manuel Valls has publicly called for a debate in the National Assembly, but failed to garner support for a debate to be held. 

&gt; * Marine Le Pen also added for the voices of disenchantment and pointed to France attempting to become a creature it cannot be - Germany. She accused Président Macron of abusing the public's goodwill and labelled him a traitor, only suitable for laying on the guillotine and not in the Palais de l'Élysée.

&gt; * Opinion polls on the April Accords see that 48 percent of the public are in approval of the accord with most pointing to the a lack of incentive to work among the unemployed and that the prolonged malaise in France on the topic called for harsher reform. 31 percent found the accords too harsh and unsuitable for the French society and called for softer terms for benefits to be reinstated. 21 percent of poll respondents were unsure of how they viewed the accords and were neither negative or positive on their ratification in the National Assembly.

66bwpm,2,2017-04-19,Asking for a raise,sensualpredator3,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/66bwpm/asking_for_a_raise/,"A little bit of background, I am an undergrad college student studying Information Systems. I started an IT Help Desk internship about a year ago making $17 an hour. The rest of the Help Desk team is salaried and makes anywhere from $50,000 to $60,000. When I started there were 6 people on the team including me, the company has been struggling lately and there has been some downsizing and movement within the department and the company as a whole. There are now three of us working in Help Desk, one of whom is going to be moving to a System Administrator position starting next week. 

In October I talked with my manager about a raise because I had been brought on as a full time team member rather than an Intern, he essentially said that a year from the end of my internship (August) would be the soonest it would be possible, but to negotiate for a large raise at that point.  

Now that there will only be two of us in Help Desk I will be the only one for the first 4 hours of every day, I will be on call every other week, and I am asked to travel for work about once per month. 

Additionally, when my manager approached myself and my coworker to let us know that it would just be the two of us, he said that as my coworker would now be the senior member of Help Desk he would work on getting him a raise, and then said that there may even be a small raise for me as well. Based on how the company has been running lately, I am not holding out hope on that happening anytime soon without me pressuring them. 

My instinct is that if I am being given more responsibility and treated as a full member of the team, I should be compensated accordingly. Rather than a possibility of a raise as an afterthought. Am I justified in asking for a sizable raise at this point? If so, how do I approach it? I get along well with my manager overall, but in October he was unwilling to consider a raise as a possibility. 

Any feedback at all is appreciated! Thanks.

I've been featured in the local newspaper, a newsletter in my University system, and currently the first thing you see on my University's website. Every other day, I get emails about publications or if I want to be a guest speaker for an event. I have a huge offer to speak at a tech event later this month in San Francisco. I don't get money for this, and it does take it a lot of time. I'm also getting invited to a lot of university publicity events and have been featured on every news source and social media outlet here in the local area. TLDR It's getting me a lot of attention.
i know I;m going to get shit for being a woman but I was pulling in like 2.0x the work load of a full time student (behind due to medical leave), working 25 hours a week, and volunteering 10 hours a week. Yet the internships I wanted as a sophomore, Google EP and Explore Microsoft, never got to me. I was pretty naive, and I had offers for other companies, but at the time I was so bummed out since all I needed was mentor since my coding skills were extremely subpar.
I just turned 20 and am currently a sophomore computer engineering student. I just went for an internship event for Applied Materials and they said they were really looking at my resume, however I was not a junior, which what they wanted. Otherwise, the recruiter said she wanted me.
I'm pretty savvy on LinkedIn with connections, and I've been receiving connections every day due my university's feature. Today I got a personal note from a financial executive at a company I've been eyeing at for awhile and would love to work with them. I orginally applied for one of their internships, but they never got back to me. How should I respond? I don't want to be sleezy and ask for an internship? Also I've been meeting a lot of people at the Big 4's through the events and I'm not quite sure how I should approach them. How should I go about it?"

66cka7,8,2017-04-19,"Boss refuses to pay me. Puts my immediate future in the balance. Thought I was hatching an evil plan against him. Deceit, lies, and betrayal. All here!",bob_da_snake,angry,https://www.reddit.com/r/angry/comments/66cka7/boss_refuses_to_pay_me_puts_my_immediate_future/,"So I'm a college student who recently is completing my final semester of school. Our school required us to do an internship placement as part of our school credit.

We have a neat sub-domain of our school's website where potential internship​ employers can post ""ads"" to recruit students for internships. In each ad is a description of the job, required duties, and whether or not you will be compensated financially.

I found a few good internships, but the decision came down to 2 of them; one interested me more but didn't offer any compensation, and another one interested me a bit less BUT said I would be paid at a bi-weekly rate.

I chose the latter because money is money and I had just recently moved out on my own. 

Now, I had come to the main office of the employer in late November to discuss the details. During the interview he went through what I'd do, what days I'd be there, etc. Finally what came up was what I would be paid.

He said that I would be paid every 2 weeks (much like a regular job). He also seemed pretty laid back, which I thought at the time would be a perk to working there. Turns out his casualness is what ended up fucking me over.

Now it's January, and I'm starting my internship. At the second day in my internship, he brings up my pay again. He says he has never had an internship student before and therefore doesn't know the finer details behind it; this mostly means he doesn't know what rate to pay me. 

He says he will email my professor to ask what he should pay me. My professor replies punctually within the hour and says ""Since he is an intern, you technically don't have to pay him anything. But (college) would appreciate and encourage employers to pay their intern students"".

This is all very true. You don't have to pay an intern. Technically, I am getting work experience in the field and that's ""good enough"". I'll come back to this in a second.

First two weeks go by and I'm given a check for $200. Pretty decent I guess, I only work there 3 days a week for about 3 hours a day. So it works out to be minimum wage. Still, I am grateful because some students aren't even being compensated at all.

Now, the pay has been stable until maybe the second month. One week he decides to give me $150 because apparently some of his clients had fallen through and therefore, he wasn't making as much money. I had known this was a bullshit excuse but in my head I thought not to argue it because I was being paid in the first place where others weren't.

Not to mention within the first month he had said there was potential to be hired afterwards. So I took the -$50 deduction for the sake of not upsetting him so I could get hired after.

The paychecks after that are the required $200. One of them goes to $150 again. I get upset about it internally but move past it.

Another one goes to $150. It sucks. But now here's the kicker.

I complete my final two weeks at the internship. At the end of the day, I wait for my paycheck as usual. He comes up to me after a bit and says ""Financials are kind of up in the air right now because I just paid $2000 to get new locks, cameras, etc. for the building. Text me tomorrow and maybe you can drop by and we'll talk.""

Now one more thing to add here; our relationship is casual. I'm 20 and he's 29, we fist bump when I come into work, we shoot the shit every now and then, he swears openly about stuff and I do too, it's all very casual. Once when he suggested I pick up my paycheck on the next Monday, I sort of hesitated to say ""Alright sounds good"" because truly it wasn't good. He noticed and said ""Oh, what, were you planning on going out this weekend?"". I said Yes and he said ""Alright"" and wrote me my check.

This makes me a bit upset because coincidentally, I have my one year anniversary dinner with my girlfriend that weekend and really needed the cash. I became a bit physically disheartened, sort of like the other time I just mentioned where he wanted to pay me later; and he noticed it again. I explained I was going for dinner but he still insisted I come the next day. I agreed, we fist bumped, I left.

Later that day I received a notification from my professor that our final internship reports were due in 4 days. These are what our bosses do (short checklist of how we performed) when we're done.

I texted my boss immediately after and notified him about it. Word for word I said:

&gt;ME: Hey (Name) would you be able to do that  internship thing I mentioned before sometime today?

&gt; HIM: Send it over and I'll do it

&gt;ME: Which email should I send it to

&gt;HIM: (provides email)

&gt;ME: Sent it. Thanks!

He didn't do it that day (Day 1). I waited until Day 3 to text him again.

&gt;ME: Hey (name), just wanted to know if you had filled in the internship thing yet.

&gt;Wish i didnt have to bother you with it but the school requires it.

I received no reply. It's now the day it's due and Good Friday. I don't want to keep bothering him and email my professor telling her I'll have to give it to her Monday after I come into work.

Keep in mind I still haven't been paid yet.

On Easter Sunday I text him:

&gt;ME: Hey man its a bit late (my bad spent easter with family) but am I coming i to work tomorrow?

&gt;Not sure what your plans were for easter monday. Anyways ill assume i am coming though 

I didn't know if he would close shop and spend time with his family so I awaited a text. Still nothing. I wake up the next morning and still no text, but I still come into work.

**Now THIS is the fucked up climax.**

About an hour into working I ask him if he was busy this weekend. He said he wasn't. He said that he didn't text me back purposely.

I was confused here and asked why? And he said ""Well when you left work last week and I said I couldn't pay you that day, it kind of rubbed me the wrong way""

I apologized that it did, and being that our relationship is casual and he told me to speak my mind, I said ""There is a possibility I was a bit upset about it but wouldn't you be too?""

This discussion went on for about an hour.

He admitted to me ""I didn't text you or give you that report to test you.""

He explained that he thought I was upset that he didn't pay me, so I was just trying to quickly get my internship report done and never talk to him again. He thought that once he was done with the report, I would have no reason to come in anymore and I would leave the projects I was working on unfinished.

I told him I would never do that, especially considering he had offered me contrived work after my internship was done. Which makes sense, I want to work for him because I want money.

I am very hesitant during this whole thing. Up until this point I had thought less about this guy as my boss and more of my friend. So to discuss pay in this fashion is kind of awkward. 

Anyways though, I finally came out and stopped beating around the bush like he said and asked him ""So am I getting paid for the last 2 weeks I was here?"" and he said ""I can't"".

This led to a pretty civil argument about why he should pay me.

My argument was he told me in November when he hired me the pay I would be given, and that means it is a stable pay rate and you can't alter my pay a month after you make an obligation to me because you feel like it.

His argument was that because my professor said he doesn't have to pay me anything, I am lucky I was being paid in the first place and he also cited a 2 times he paid for my lunch and once drove me 2 blocks to my bus stop as reasons why I should be content with not being paid the final 2 weeks.

He also said a client fell through and that along with the fees for the locks and cameras was why he couldn't pay me. I told him that an employer is supposed to pay their employee for work they've done no matter what. 

Losing $50 maybe 3 times I could sort of deal with, but I felt I was being flat out robbed $200 worth of my time.

He also said ""I've been paying you with paychecks this whole time and not properly getting invoices so this might end up costing me even more with taxes""

I didn't say this part, but fucking REALLY dude? I am your employee, it isn't my fucking job to figure out how you are supposed to pay people and do business related shit. 

All around it was fucking dumb.

By the end of the argument I had swayed him to pay me. But he said ""Now this shit is all fucked up"" and I asked what he meant by that, and he said he was referring to us. This very obviously implied him hiring me to do more work in the summer.

So now I'm fucking angry and want to tell him he's a shitty business owner, a shitty boss, and a fucking moron. But I can't because I still MAYBE have a chance to work for him in the future. If he does and fucks me over again, I don't know what I'll do. But at this point I have bills to pay and have no choice. 

I'm fucking ANGRY.

TL;DR: I encouraged you to read the full thing because it's absolutely fucking dumb, but basically: 

Boss hired me at a specific pay rate, months later said I technically shouldn't be paid and therefore refused to pay me for work I already did. Said that the fact that I brought the whole thing up and argued my case ""fucked shit (our relationship) up"" and now I may not be hired by him to do more work."

66dkdd,1,2017-04-19,Internship Advice - Hyatt Corporate or Pluralsight,jdizzie,managementconsulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/managementconsulting/comments/66dkdd/internship_advice_hyatt_corporate_or_pluralsight/,"Hi all,
I need help to decide between two internship opportunities. A little background, I am a junior and intend to pursue management consulting after I graduate. I am currently working for a digital marketing firm and am liking it. I have received offers from both Hyatt Headquarters in Chicago and Pluralsight in Utah. The positions are similar I will outline them below.


Distribution Strategy Intern (Hyatt):


• I would be working with the small (5 people) distribution strategy team to perform market research and identify growth trends for metasearch partners such as booking.com, tripadvisor.com, etc.

• Assist the Global Corporate Distribution Strategy team in account managing the performance of digital channels with a focus on maximization of competitive market share, optimization of promotional content, growth of relationships with current strategic partners, and evaluating new business opportunities.

• Assist Hyatt affiliate marketing program by coordinating with online publishers (content blogs, social media, cashback/coupon, loyalty, comparison engines) to promote Hyatt's brands and current promotions. Strategic marketing placements could include targeted emails, newsletters, on-site banner ads, cashback/coupon codes, text-linked blog content etc. with the goal of heightening awareness with targeted campaigns.

• Work on a case with interns all summer in the other divisions and present it to management at the end. As well as, sit in on client meetings throughout the entire summer.


Marketing Analyst Intern (Pluralsight):

• I would be working the field marketing team to decipher data of events to create dashboards and reports of where to allocate the budget for optimal investments.

• Using Tableau, SQL and other tools to decipher the data and create the dashboards and reports.

• Communicate across different divisions to display key findings and reconcile important information.

• Conduct market research on different segments, identify trends, and tailor recommendations and content accordingly.

Both would be valuable opportunities in their own respect. I believe I would learn a few more technical skills with Pluralsight. Also, Pluralsight would expose me to a rapidly growing environment and industry. Plus high caliber talent with a lot of autonomy of how I go about projects with. The Hyatt internship, would provide an overall amazing experience plus learn about how such a large corporation manages relationships and makes decisions. And similar things to the Pluralsight internship.

Since my goal is to pursue consulting for a management consulting firm, which would you guys believe would be a better opportunity to my pursue long-term goals?

I appreciate all of your help and please include any other information/advice you have.

Thanks!

66dkgu,40,2017-04-19,"Game 3 ~~Panic Thread~~ I mean ""Scouting Report""",BaconLawnMowerCats,MkeBucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/66dkgu/game_3_panic_thread_i_mean_scouting_report/,"We're barely into the playoff season and Milwaukee has already lost as many games as physically possible.  Well almost.  But I guess some people in this sub are happy the Bucks are in the playoffs anyway.  Well La-Di-Fucking-Da, I guess tanks and suicide buses aren't good enough for everybody.  Also for some people, finishing in sixth place is apparently a worthy aspiration in life.  Really this just tells me that Generation X has ruined this country by tossing participation trophies at their dumb, lazy children.  Seriously it doesn't take a math scientist to know that sixth place is basically as bad as seventh place which is basically eighth place which is basically last place.  And last place is the worst of all the places (like red corner in /r/place).  And it's not even like we get a good draft pick out of this disaster.  At this rate you have to wonder how on Earth we are ever going to catch up to teams like the 76ers, you know, the standard bearers of class and success in the NBA.


To put this whole ""sixth place"" thing in a more grounded, relatable perspective, my graduating middle school class had eight kids in it.  Let’s take one kid, Robert and call him the first best.  Robert was a little taller than the rest of us and had better grades.  Robert, the first best kid in middle school, eventually went on to a private university to study medicine.  And then let’s take another kid and call him the sixth best, Kenneth.  You don't want to be Kenneth.  You don't want to be sixth place.  Kenneth might have a GED.  *Might*.  And the most significant thing he’s accomplished in his life is change his name to Kenny.  Robert's out there on like a MD internship in Singapore and Kenneth's taken the life altering plunge of going by a shorter version of the name everyone already calls him.  How about invest in a real name change like Fernando or Axel?  Seriously I’m pretty sure his only aspiration in life is to be the most generic Facebook personality on my feed.  You know those people; it’s only anti-Trump quotes, buzzfeed headlines, and “omg where is Firefly?!  Firefly was soooo good why’d they have to cancel it?  I miss it so much.  Nothing will ever be as good as Firefly.”  **MAN SHUT UP ABOUT FIREFLY!**  We all miss it, Kenneth, you’re not special.  And you're not Kenny either!  I know you and this doesn't make me like you or want to spend time with you.  I'm not going to your kitschy ""Cinco de Drinko"" party and I'm not RSVPing to your Game of Thrones viewing event.  Why weren't we as good as Robert?!  Have you seen his feed?  He like vacations and travels and shit.  I think that gorgeous woman that keeps popping up in his selfies is his girlfriend.  He's so much better than us.  Fuck me.



…



… oh, right, basketball.  That’s what we were talking about.  Listen, sixth seed is bad.  And for future merit I watch First Take, so you can just assume I know what I’m talking about for the rest of this post.  And on that note, let’s get right into it: Jason Kidd is the ruination of humanity as we know it.  And it's not said often enough in this sub lately for some reason.  Maybe some fans are chickening out because of the team's late season push into the playoffs.  Cowards!  Look I'll be the first to admit that somehow dragging this broken, bloodied roster to the post-season hurts my argument for Kidd's firing a little bit.  *a little bit*.  But I wouldn't be a Wisconsin sports fan if I let inane factors like reason stop me from unleashing my opinions.  So here follows several arguments for Kidd's firing that may not be factually founded but are emotionally substantiated:


*  Jason Kidd doesn't understand the Xs and Os of modern basketball.  THE GAME HAS CHANGED YOU DUMB OLD MAN!!


*  Jason Kidd is actually living a real life version of the movie *Memento*.  Kidd as a result of past trauma (forced to work for the Brooklyn Nets organization) suffers from amnesia and has lost the ability to form new memories.  This is why he seems to routinely forget that certain players on the roster exist, or why he just seems to leave random players out on the court for bizarrely long stretches of the game.  Also why whenever the camera pans to him, [he always look like he just woke up in a different place than he fell asleep in](http://imgur.com/a/IfoO1). 


*  Jason Kidd, like some sort of monster, thinks *Shrek* is a bad movie.  Thusly he is a bad person, a poor judge of quality cinema, and lacks the onion-like, layered personality that makes a coach successful.



I could do this all day, but we should move on.  Let's get to the competition: The Toronto Raptors.  Whoever the hell they are.  Look I don't know where Toronto is.  Seriously you could hand me a map of the United States right now and I wouldn't know where to look.  Fucking Iowa maybe? I don’t know.  I’m kidding, I know it’s in Canada.  I just don’t understand Canada.  And as a general rule of thumb in life, I am averse to things I don’t understand.  Why does America’s hat have a basketball team?  I don’t know, so I’m against it.


So with that said we can basically chalk up Canada and their basketball team to a giant question mark.  That's why I've prepared a rudimentary scouting report for game 3.  Because all our hype and media momentum, much like a Trudeau campaign promise, will mean nothing when the game actually starts.  And before you start to criticize me, let me remind you that I've basically done about as much research on the Toronto Raptors as any on-air ESPN talent.  Let's begin.



[**Head coach: Casey Affleck**](http://imgur.com/a/4LhUg)


A lot of people say that method acting is a purely masturbatory art exclusively and meaninglessly practiced by out-of-touch narcissists.  It has little to no actual impact on the end product.  The fact that Casey has fooled so many people for so long into believing he is a qualified NBA head coach makes me a believer though.  Even if I find his use of black face slightly distasteful.



[**Kylie Lower**](http://imgur.com/a/4pe84)


Damn this bitch is as thick as a maple syrup milkshake... wait is that a real saying?  I don't think so.  How about... Kylie got a booty like a hippopotamus driving a Lamborghini.  I don't think that makes sense either.  Look, maybe colloquialisms aren't my thing.  And I don’t have an answer for Kylie and her phat ass but I do know a man with an incredulously flat ass.  Does that help?  Probably not, but it’s given me an idea.  Step 1: See phat ass in game. Step 2: Put flat ass in game. Step 3:  well I’m not sure what happens here or in steps 4 and 5 for that matter but if we’re not seeing significant fiscal or entertainment returns by Step 6, we've done something wrong.



[**Czar DeRozan**](http://imgur.com/a/zovVb)


Obvious Russian spy.  I mean just watch him play.  In today's NBA, what kind of modern shooting guard takes so many 2s?  And so little 3s?  A Communist, that's who.  Someone who is deep-set on giving back to the 2-point jumpshot what has been taken by 3-pointer.  ""From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.""  I see what you're up to DeRozan and I don't like it.  [You're not slipping past the watchful eyes of this Patriot](http://imgur.com/a/OFuk2).  I just think he could have chosen a less obvious spy name.  The most lethal traitors have less ostentatious names, like Andy or Alyssa.


[**Lt. Surge**](http://imgur.com/a/8LqkT)


I’m just going to copy and paste straight from bulbopedia


&gt; ""Lt. Surge is known as The Lightning American. Apparently, he is or was an American soldier who fought in at least one war, during which Electric-type Pokémon saved his life. As a member of the army, Surge was a strict CO, and was rather cautious. He was a pilot as well, and used Electric-type Pokémon to power his planes, a practice that in at least one occasion saved his life. Also, Surge saved the life of one of the Trainers in his Gym who was in the army at the same time.
A little paranoid, Lt. Surge installed a series of traps in the Gym. He takes a liking to Trainers with a lot of guts.""


Mirza Teletovic is probably the closest thing the Bucks have to a ground-type Pokemon, so we should be matching him up with Surge.  Go Mirza!  [Use Dump!](https://streamable.com/7chfz)


[**Scary Jonah Hill**](http://imgur.com/a/4CBW8)


Jonah Hill is a serious actor.  Okay?  He's not on that Judd Apatow shit anymore.  He does real acting.  And he wants to be treated like a real actor.  But people still want to typecast him as useless big guy who can't seem to do anything right. 
 And head coach, Casey Affleck, still won’t play him in a serious role no matter his performance.  Why?  Who knows, maybe it was *The Watch*... or *Strange Wilderness*.  Maybe *Allen Gregory* or *Funny People*.  Whatever it was, audiences just aren't taking Jonah Hill as seriously as Jonah Hill is taking himself.



[**Jae Crowder**](http://imgur.com/a/6p1CN)


I actually have bit of a soft spot for Jae.  And I think a lot of Bucks fans do, as he’s a former Marquette player.  That said this is a guy you definitely have to keep your eye on.  He’s pretty sneaky and hard to keep track of.  For instance, I was surprised to learn he plays for the Raptors now, I thought for sure he played in Boston.  No, I'm sure he plays for Boston, I just saw him in last night's game.  But then again, I must have been swindled before because I swore I saw him in a Nuggets jersey not that long ago...  And it doesn't seem too long ago he was part of that Atlanta playoff team... 


Well wherever Jae is just remind him how Devin Booker scored 70 totally legitimate points in a game this past season and that Gordon Hayward might be looking to sign a new deal to play under his old college coach this summer.  Jae may be able to supersede the laws of space and time but he doesn't yet possess the ability to confine his emotions to lowercased letters on social media.


Well there you have it.  Was this scouting report useful in any way?  Shouldn't it have been done before the series started instead of after two full games?  Why would anyone on reddit read a text post on a sports subreddit that is nearly 2,000 words long?  Isn't this just a colossal waste of everyone's time?  These are all questions that a Bulls fan would ask so, no, you shouldn't be asking me these things.  Bucks in 6."

So I'm at the end of my second year of college and I figure its better to start earlier than later on money management. I'm on track to graduate after 4 more semesters and I have several questions I need advice on. I'm getting an engineering degree so I'm not too worried about money I'll be making later on yet as I should be okay given salaries for the field.

* I have ~8500 in loans, 10k in the bank currently.
* I'm working at school during the summer and will make ~6000-7000. 
* I have the same job during the year and make ~600/month.
* I have no expenses other than ~400 for rent and ~300 for food per month (no car or monthly subscriptions to anything).
* tuition is roughly 11.5k a year/ 5.75k a semester
* I don't know my scholarship situation for another month (it has been 3k/semester in the past), but I know I will be offered 6.5k in subsidized/unsubsidized loans. 
* My parents will help me out if absolutely needed but I would rather to pay for everything on my own.
* I want to update my wardrobe and am thinking that could cost $500-1000 for me.
* I will be doing an internship next summer; I'm currently working with a career counselor and will be devoted to putting myself out as much as possible so lab experience could be helpful.

1. What should I do with my money currently?

2. How much money should I keep in savings/checking accounts?

3. How do I/should I begin using credit cards, I have literally no experience.

4. I'm currently trying to see if I can work in my professor's lab which does stuff I'm extremely interested in. He only pays student employees and will only take additional students if he gets grant money. I will take a pay cut if I do get into it. If/when that happens should I see if I can volunteer in a different lab? I will probably have to work less hours at my job if I do.

5. I really want to travel to Europe for 2 months before I'm 25 (still got 5 years). I'm considering doing that soon after I graduate college; is that a good idea?

6. Is there anything else I should know?

Finances are interesting and scary to me at the same time so I really just want help knowing what I'm doing. I feel I do a good job not wasting money by eating out and senseless expenses but I feel there is more I can do.

Thank you so much!!!"

I went to my university's mental health clinic for 2 visits, but it was the end of the school year and there wasn't much they could do for me because summer was about to start. The counselor I saw there recommended for me to find a therapist at home and to talk to me regular doctor about getting on medication.

I ended up being too anxious all summer to tell my mom I needed help, so I never did what he advised me to do. 

Once I got back on campus I was too embarrassed to go back to the mental health center so I never did. Something recently happened on campus that has made me really anxious, but it's the end of the year so I feel like I can't really go back and get an effective long term treatment. Even just this past year/semester it's been hard to focus and my pulse has been consistantly pretty high with the occasional full out panic attack.

I'll be in another state for an internship for 2 months this summer and I don't really know what to do about getting help for my mental health. I feel like I'm not in one place long enough to get adequate treatment. I know I messed up before and trying to think about what to do stresses me out even more.

Any advise is greatly appreciated "

I'v been thinking about it for a while now and can no longer keep it in, but my situation is a bit uncommon and decided to go on reddit to see if there's anybody out there who are dealing with the same stuff, or know anybody who's dealing with the same stuff. 
So my parents are one of those rags to riches stories, and their business has been running for about 27 years. The story behind how they built the company(more of my father's work, with some help from my mother) is very inspiring and I look up to the both of them for building something they are truly passionate about. 
A little over a year ago, my father mentioned that he would give me a business, in the same industry as his. Some time after that, ""my"" company was born. It's named after me, and other important documents, etc. 
For most people, this set-up makes sense since I've grown up around the industry, know the ins and outs, tips and techniques, and have been working as an intern in their company every summer for the past five years. 
Most businesses owners expect their children to take over their business after some time. While this wasn't an industry I hated, it wasn't what I was passionate about either. Not too good at it, just ""okay"" at it. 
So last 2016 ""my"" company was built from some profits of my dad's 27-year old company. I'm 21 btw. 
Obviously, I'm the head, and the manager is someone who has been working in his company for almost two decades (he's 45). It was like instant noodles. Instant company.
I don't really have much to do except oversee general day to day operations, sign some checks, and decide on things here and there, but the major decisions come from my dad.
Also, with a general manager much older than you, he would report directly to me everyday but he would consult major decisions to my dad. 
I wouldn't have any problem with this if I was an employee, but it just takes a toll on me when I'm the ""head"" and can never really decide on the most important things. I hope I don't sound like an entitled prick. I just don't feel like I deserve the title of being the head. I also feel guilty when friends and relatives find out I run ""my"" own company at 21, and they tell me I'm so successful already, when really, it was something given to me and I didn't have to lift a finger. 
I wish I was given a bit more time to pursue what I really want to do in life instead of having a pre-determined future for me. But it's how society is, it's expected for a business owner's child, especially where I'm from. HINT: It's an Asian country.

6 months after ""my"" company was established, I've discovered what I wanted to pursue, and that's online business. I've taken the necessary steps on how to achieve that, and up until today, I'm still working on it. 
Almost every day, I get a text from the general manager to ask what time I'm going to arrive at the office because I have some checks to sign, somebody to meet, etc. and I just can't take it anymore. 
I want to pursue something that I can work on from anywhere, because travel is also one of my passions. 
I don't know how to deal with the resentment my parents might have for me when I finally tell them, ""I don't want to do this anymore."" 
My siblings don't want to take up business studies. 
I'm the only one left. So they've been grooming me to be a good businesswoman ever since. 
The thing is, yes, I do want business, but not *their* business. 
Our relationship is also a bit strained, but even if, I still don't see myself working long-term for that industry. 
Won't it be great to see something you really worked hard for? ""My"" company is earning a lot of revenue but I still can't take credit for all of that. I refuse to accept it's my money because I didn't make this company. My employees probably see me as somebody only on top because of her parents. 
All this is preventing me to be the person I want to be. It's weighing me down so much. I want to be happy. 
And I don't know what to do. "

I've been having a lot of trouble trying to fix a schedule that works for me. I'm in uni, doing an 8 to 1 internship 3-4 times a week and having 2 3hour seminars 2 times a week. Apart from that I need to keep a detailed internship diary and give in a weekly assignment that needs lots of reading. 

My problem is, I have so much that I WANT to do in life and learn but I don't know how to fit them in my schedule. I want to 

* learn how to draw and become very good at it
* continue learning Russian alone since I can't afford a tutor anymore
* learn Spanish (and a few other languages after that, I love the idea of being a polyglot)
* learn how to program 
* build flexibility and muscle, basically work out at least 4 times a week and become even better at yoga.

How do you fit your hobbies - things you want to learn for yourself, in your schedule? I find myself getting back from my university-internship so DAMN TIRED and I always feel like doing nothing. In my internship I have to deal with 20 children running around, screaming, etc. and it's mentally exhausting. 

How can I balance it all, make a schedule to fit as mush as I can in it and have more energy? "

I've been doing a lot of research on Accounting and I think that I find that it is a good fit for me. I enjoy looking at number/data and seeing how they fit into a certain situation. I am also interested in the Info systems aspect of Accounting.  At my university all business majors have to take the same pre-business core, so it would be rather simple to add on a double major. Also for my BIS major there are 9 hours  of ""Computer-related"" courses. Accounting Info Sys 1 and 2 and Auditing 1 both fall into. I would only have to take 6 or so extra classes to fulfill a double major.  In total I would be looking at around 142 hours so I could probably still finish in 4 years with a few summer classes. The only downside that I see is not being able to take the internship that my university offers for accounting majors during senior year, because of this I am considering just the ACC major with the BIS minor. So what do yall think? Would a double major make me look more desirable to employees? Id be totally okay with going to grad school and specialize/Study AIS. Thanks! "

Bought a Pride and Prejudice today for a friend who is sadly unacquainted with Austen. I'm guessing (...hoping) the text is fine but I was seriously tempted to take a red pen to the ""Life &amp; Times"" they inserted in front of the novel. It reads as if a high schooler wrote it the night before the deadline. Memorable bits:

'Her family was typically large as was customary at the time in order to counter the possibility of early death by producing many offspring.' - Eh? *Typically as was customary* is redundant. And you don't counter the possibility of of early death by having loadsa kids, you just make sure you have spares.

'Elinor and Marriane' Typo. No proofreaders at HarperCollins?

'Austen began to feel unwell and suffered from a progressive disease, which saw her health decline.' Another redundant gem of a sentence.

'Her books continued to sell, but they were not considered fashionable, as people gravitated towards the gritty realism of Dickens...' *oookay...* 'as opposed to Austen's characters who (...) concerned themselves with matters of little real consequence.' The fuck? Has this person even read the books?

'[S]he lived vicariously through her characters...' *eyebrow raised* '...allowing them the intimacies that she craved...' *wince* '... but that eluded her all her life.' Yeah... no. 

The next one is going to be long, buckle up:
'It is interesting to note that many contemporary authors choose to give their novels period settings as their plots often rely on rules of formality and etiquette and characters must behave in a certain way to ensure that a narrative will work.

The whole ""Life &amp; Times"" is like this. Every sentence brings new joys, like when they mention how Austen 'always avoids being vitriolic in her prose' (ahaha); how she was not a 'romanticist', whatever that means; a non sequitur about the paintings of Joseph Turner; how the 'exploration of human feeling and emotion' was a 'relatively new concept to society at the time', because I guess there is a gaping void before the 19th century and who is this ""Shakespeare"" person anyways?; and then careening off in the last paragraph to speculate if she would have been a realist if she lived longer.

From what I have heard, get a degree in computer science, as it is far more flexibility than a degree in game design, and still more than enough to get a job in game design. But college isn't that simple, as you can get double degrees and/or minors, and, there are different types of degrees, ranging from Associate's to Master's/Doctorate. Then, of course, there are all the work study and internship programs to consider. *What* does the difference between an Associate's and a Masters's or between a minor and a major mean to your career? How it changes your attractiveness to an employer, potential for success in the field, range of opportunities for promotions and/or triple-A company jobs, and the time taken for/possibility of completing a game alone from start to finish as a hobby. 

I know that experience tends to matter more, and a lot of this is supposed to be subjective, but your education has an impact on your ability and efficiency to *gain* that experience. I'm the type who tries to minmax the shit out of life, so basically my subjective view is always equal to the objective view- I just want to be the best game designer I can be, and maximize my chances of seeing my dream game ideas to completion. As far as what hobbies I want to pursue, as another subjective point, (before anyone asks) I am a workaholic so, again, that doesn't even matter.

66inp8,66,2017-04-20,Both my parents are serial cheaters and i want to reduce contact with them as much as possible.,throwaway1uh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/66inp8/both_my_parents_are_serial_cheaters_and_i_want_to/,"Sorry i really need to get this off my chest  
  
Both my mom and dad have been cheating on each other on and off for quite a while now. The last one I did find out about was my mom cheating with a neighbour of a Flat which was recently purchased. They had been chatting even during the time my parents had gone for a trip to celebrate their marriage anniversary.  

See over the years, I had always kept it to myself. I felt betrayed and shit when very young but that got over soon. It changed to a “I don’t really give a fuck what happens attitude.” However this time I felt like I am finally old enough to atleast let them know that I in fact know about all the infidelity. I found out a couple of weeks ago when I was back home from college for a week before my internship began. I found those chats on her phone and took screenshots of it and sent it to myself. I wanted her to know that I knew so I didn’t delete the screenshots from her phone. 
  
Naturally she found out and asked me if I intend to blackmail her and I said no.
Later during the day, I got a chance to see those messages again on her phone and found out she had told the neighbour of the situation. The neighbour asked “Are you sure he knows?”. I couldn’t help myself and replied “Yes I know, don’t worry”. In hindsight that was probably not the best thing to do. Like in some movie, this was the exact moment my mom entered the room, saw the situation and slapped me. There was a few rounds of back and forth between us, her telling me “Family always comes first.” Etc. etc. The argument ended with her saying: “What do you expect? I’ll say sorry to you, fall on my knees and beg for mercy? No one in this family is a do gooder.” Later on in the evening she made another statement. “Every time you come home you shatter me.” I always knew deep down that she was manipulative but this finally registered it for me. I have decided that I am going to keep as little interaction with them as possible.
TL;DR: Found out mom was cheating again, tried to confront, it finally registered how manipulative she can be."
66iv8s,1,2017-04-20,I have horrible anxiety while doing job interviews over the phone,popeye8beans,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/66iv8s/i_have_horrible_anxiety_while_doing_job/,"I'm not the best interviewer, but when I do them in person it's much better than on the phone. In person I at least seem competent and that I would be a good fit. For me, in person it's a lot easier to think about specific situations and answer the interviewers question. The last 3 in person interviews I did I was able to be offered the position.

But whenever I do phone interviews it's the complete opposite. They could ask me super easy questions like describe what you did at your last job. Then when I answer I will say really dumb things. I will either give a super simplified answer that wont help demonstrate what I did or start rambling on and on about nothing. I know everyone talks about STAR, but I just can't use it while on the phone. Then to make matters worse I tend to stutter while on the phone and my mind goes blank many times.

A couple of weeks ago I had phone interviews (pre screen) for 3 jobs that I probably would have done well at. However due to my anxiety about talking on the phone in general, I wasn't able to show them I was worth bringing in for an in person interview. Today I reached the point of ""something has to change"". I had a phone interview for a job that has been at the top of my list for a while. It's a summer internship and would likely lead to a full time offer after I graduate. With the amount of experience I have and how I genuinely love what the job is about I should have nailed the interview. The interviewer didn't ask me anything that I didn't think about before or anything that should have caught me off guard. I wasn't even able to express in words why I love what the job is about even though I tell my friends all the time and even teachers as well. 


Has anyone else had problems with phone interviews too and how were you able to overcome it?

TL;DR: not claiming to be the best interviewer, but I'm much better in person than on the phone. While doing phone interviews I can't think of anything to say and sound like an idiot. Really need to improve on this any advice?"
66izrm,1,2017-04-20,started Apri 0.15 mg-0.03 mg tablet BC this week in hopes of curing my acne...stay tuned.,thyroidismhypeman,acne,https://www.reddit.com/r/acne/comments/66izrm/started_apri_015_mg003_mg_tablet_bc_this_week_in/,"I will post about the effects of Apri birth control (BC) on my skin each month for a while. This post will be the longest, because I need to first share my story. If you struggle with cystic acne, hypertension or mental health issues, this post might be of interest to you.

Background:
  
About three years ago, I stopped using the birth control pill Reclipsen because of environmental reasons. I was obtaining my environmental studies undergraduate degree at the time and had learned about the feminization of frogs in our ecosystem due to the over abundance of endocrines in our water systems. (This over-abundance is due to more people taking birth control coupled with the municipal water systems' inability to filter out endocrines). Additionally, I have ADD and narcolepsy, in which I struggle to remember to take BC pills each day. The allure of a non-hormonal, mindless Paragaurd (AKA copper IUD) seemed like an appropriate method of birth control for me at the time. 


My Observed Relationship between Acne and Birth Control, Plus Stimulants:
 
I started taking Reclipsen at age 16 and took it for about ten years in total. When I stopped using Reclipsen, I did feel less depressed initially, but all the sudden I had terrible acne (a whole different reason to spur depression)!! Being that I started taking the pill at age 16 prior to being fully out of puberty, I was not aware of the cystic acne that runs in my family. And as previously mentioned, I have ADD and narcolepsy, for which I am treated with stimulants (dextramphetamine/adderol). Anyone who uses stimulants knows 
that it can cause patients to have extreme skin sensitivity; therefore, I have a problem, although very ashamed to admit, in which I am tempted to pick at skin imperfections. That's a whole other thing probably related to anxiety, and I've been using some behavioral therapy techniques to curb that bad habit. But, it's relevant to this post, because it caused a lot of my acne cysts to be worse than they should have been, had I not picked at them. I probably caused some undue infections. Nonetheless, as a patient receiving stimulant treatment, to me an acne cyst is actually anxiety causing and caused actual physical pain. I am really sensitive to the pressure that builds within an acne cyst. I am not sure if everyone suffering from cystic acne feels this way or if it moreso a symptom of my skin sensitivity. I'm curious to know if the average cystic acne patient feels similar symptoms, please comment on this.

After about six months of living life with cystic acne, terrible cramps, a heavy week-long periods, I was over the natural approach to birth control and ready to forgoe my noble environmental ethics. I tried to switch to the hormonal IUD called Merina, but the doctors wouldn't let me. I had hypertension (high blood pressure). This is also hereditary.

Let me interject and tell you NO, it's not the stimulants that caused hypertension. I know this because I worked with my psychiatrist for months, took a $2000 sleep study and confirmed that it was a hereditary thing. I have nearly 100% English ancenstry that can be traced back to the 1300s, so I feel like there's definitely some bad genes at fault somewhere along that lineage. I don't know much about geneology, but I assume it's like pure breed dogs (pure breeds always have the worst health problems as compared to muts).
 

Admittedly, I had gained about 15 pounds over the course of the following two years. I think this way due to just being faced with common life struggles such as not being happy with the job I had at that time, dating an alcoholic at that time, and yeah, constantly 
thinking about the disgusting cystic acne plaguing my face.I finally decided to break up with my boyfriend after 2.5 years of dating and moved to Chicago for a summer internship in a new field of work. I had the time of my life that summer and finally was able to shed those 15 pounds, which allowed me to go off Lisinopril (the hypertension medication). 

But still to my dismay, my talented and smart OB-GYN would not let me take hormonal birth control because of the hypertension-causing risks associated with such medications. I valued her commitment to preventative public healthcare, but couldn't help but breakdown with tears that afternoon in her office when she gave me a firm ""No."" She questioned why I was crying, and I remember feeling so terrible about myself that day. I had come back from my summer internship with this grandiose plan to complete my summer transformation by finally getting rid of my acne. I had fixated on this moment the entire summer, because acne can destroy a person's self-esteem, especially when you are a 25 year-old woman using Tinder and hoping to meet the love of your life some point soon. In short, I had hit a dead end. The only alternative was to take Accutane, and I just didn't want to do that. It causes balding! My friend swears that she now has IBS because of Accutane. It fucks with your blood. I may be vain, but not to the point where I would risk the side effects of Accutane. So I made a new plan.

My plan is now commencing. I moved out of state to get a job post grad school, and did not give my new doctor my medical history. It's dumb. It's stupid. I will most definitely regret this at age 60 when I start to struggle with having a prematurely weathered heart. But, I don't want to spend the rest of my child-free days obsessing over my cystic acne. And to me, it is worth the risk to be able to live life to the fullest during my last bit of youth. So I went to the doctor, and thankfully have managed to keep the weight off. I still have good blood pressure readings, so they weren't concerned about hypertension. When they asked if I had a medical history of hypertension, I denied having one. I told them that I stayed on the copper IUD for so long because of my commitment to the environment, but that I desperately want to get rid of my acne now. My new doctor obliged, which brings me to today.


What's Next:

My doctor took out my IUD and prescribed Apri 0.15 mg-0.03 mg tablet as my new form of birth control. I intend to give monthly updates via this thread on how the medication is affecting my cystic acne. I am on day four of taking Apri and I woke up this morning with a lot of nausea. The night prior, I was too nauseated to finish my dinner (only had a few bites). I thought I might be coming down with something, but I'm almost positive it is due to the new BC prescription after reading reviews online. As I recall, you should take a BC for three months at least before giving up on it, so I intend to push through the nausea. 

Quantitative Tracking for Evaluation:

Before beginning Apri this week, I suffered a large acne break out. I am on the healing side of the breakout now, but for reference, I count about 19 blemishes on my face. They are pretty much in every major area of my face (cheeks, forehead, chin, jaw lines, temples/hair line, neck, and I also have a few acne cysts on my breasts and back). Here's to hoping! I shall update you in a few weeks."

The plan entails using a possible internship (it doesn't really matter whether or not I get the internship) as a cover to move in with my boyfriend. These are the steps:

1. Slowly move my items (clothing, books, etc) over to my boyfriends  home. This takes more planning that it seems.I have things scattered throughout the house.

2. I will move in my clothes the last two days of the month before I get packing for an internship that ""starts"" the first day of the following month.

3. During the last week of the month, the day my ndad leaves to visit my homeland ( the country of Turkey) for vacation, which would be a Wednesday. I will tell my mother that I will interview for said internship on Friday and that I will get a response the same day.

4. On that Sunday or following monday of the following month, I will pack my suitcase (passport, important documents included) so that it looks like I'm going to head down to the airport but I'll be officially moving into my boyfriends place.

5. A few days after that, I have plans to meet my boyfriends religious family in person. We will fly out to see them.

6. When we return the following week, I may or may not hear back from the said internship for real or I'll be starting a new job that I applied for a few weeks earlier.

7. Once my boyfriend and I return from seeing his family, we will still be continuing on the process of buying a home. We will be searching for homes and talking to lenders/real estate agents for another 3 and a half months.

8. After the three and a half months, I will have to decide within that time frame whether or not to move in with my boyfriend permanently or return to my families home without taking my things back because we will still be in a relationship.

9. Option 1: move back home and maintain my relationship with my boyfriend but feel miserable because I don't want to stay at my ndads home. And regretting that I didn't leave out of fear of what he might do to my mother and brother including his promise to never let me enter his home or see the rest of my family as long as he is alive (he doesn't want me to marry my boyfriend, which I intend on doing, someday).

10. Option 2: After I return from my supposed internship, after the 3 and a half months, I will ask my mother and father to meet me not at the airport where they intend on meeting me but at a coffee shop with my boyfriend. We will break it to them that I don't intend on moving in because I will be engaged to my boyfriend (i won't actually be engaged but I need to use this terminology or else my conservative father will make it difficult for me and/or call me a whore). 

I don't know what my ndad will do. I don't know what I'll do. It is terrifying to choose between staying at home with him and the rest of my family or if its time to move on. I am a  26 years old female living in a conservative Turkish family home. If anyone can relate or would like to add to the plan please add comments and/or pm me!

66jasf,11,2017-04-20,Stress shopping reared its ugly head again and I'm disappointed in myself,joan2468,MakeupRehab,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupRehab/comments/66jasf/stress_shopping_reared_its_ugly_head_again_and_im/,"The past 2 months, I bought a lot of makeup. 

I'm due to have exams soon and the stress of having to prepare for that, plus applying for summer internships (and not finding much success), plus just generally going through a rough patch in my life where things just do not seem to be going well for me, have all been making me feel extremely unhappy, tired, and constantly frustrated. Turning to makeup, and shopping, seemed to be the only thing lately to have a temporary fix on the recent spate of negative things that have been going on in my life. 

Superdrug are doing a 3 for 2 across all cosmetics and brushes this month and I always look forward to these sales to stock up. So I've bought a lot of things, some were replacements like mascara, some were things I wanted to try but could never justify buying if they weren't discounted because I already had ones that were working okay for me (a new primer, a new foundation and powder...)

Needless to say the stress and negativity has also taken a toll on my skin, which is getting pretty marked up with pigmentation and dryness so that led me to buy new skincare items too because I was feeling insecure about my skin and wanted to up my skincare game (didn't buy anything crazy like Sunday Riley or anything, just stuck to drugstore-price brands) 

I wouldn't say my makeup collection is at out-of-control levels - yet. I've always been great at destashing and recognising when makeup I have deserves a better home. But still I find myself trying really hard at times to have more willpower over my spending urges, but not always succeeding. 

Life has just been hard for me lately Reddit, and I've basically just been 'medicating' with makeup shopping. I just feel lost. "

66jho9,53,2017-04-20,My boyfriend of nearly 4 years has just told me he's into diapers. Help. [Fetish],Thr0waway2409,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/66jho9/my_boyfriend_of_nearly_4_years_has_just_told_me/,"I'm not really sure what sub this belongs in, so I'm giving this one a try.

I am female, 23 years old and my boyfriend is 27. I still live with my parents and he has his own apartment. It's a very healthy relationship, and my parents know all about it. If it matters at all, the reason we don't currently live together is because I am going for my Master's and I have an unpaid internship. I'd rather not move in until that chapter of my life is over and I have income of my own to contribute to the household.  

Our relationships is very solid and healthy. We both love each other so much. He's really helped me through the struggles of college and one of the nicest people I've ever met. We took our relationship very slowly. He is actually the first I've ever had, my first kiss and the one I lost my virginity to. Since I was only 19 when we met (him being 23 at that time), he was afraid of taking advantage of me, so he was really reserved until he knew that what we had was truly something special. I spend plenty of time at his apartment. On a few occasions, I even stayed a couple weeks at his place.  

About a year into our relationship is when we started having sex. I'm very... ""vanilla"" as I've heard the term. I don't really have any kinks or fetishes, and we had ""vanilla"" sex for about 2 years. Only for the last 6-8 months has be brought up certain minor kinks that I was ok trying. Thinks like wearing certain outfits and also wearing silly things like cat ears and whatnot and asking me to meow at him. Personally I found it kind of cute, like in a silly fun kind of way.  

I'm willing to give certain things a try. He asked me to wear a leash and collar for him once and I did. I wanted to make him happy, and I was ok doing it. For me I was just indifferent to it all, but to him he said it really enhanced the experience. However... everything has just come to grinding halt...  

About 6 weeks ago is when he told me he was into wearing diapers. It came out because he brought up a few more kinks and I told him to just come out with it all. And tell me everything he likes at once. So he mentions the diapers. We talk over it, I ask him what felt like thousands of questions, and he showed me where he kept them in the far back of his closet. He likes wearing them throughout the day and using them. He said he has never worn them around me (which is why I never noticed anything) and that he wants to start, and he wants to also incorporate this into sex. I basically told him this was going to be a no for me. That he can do this alone on his own but I just can't participate... this isn't for me.  

I really hate myself for feeling the way I do. We haven't had sex since he told me this. I just put it off by saying the usual nonsense like I have a headache or I'm feeling unwell. I'm such an awful liar. I know he can see right through it all. I just can't bring myself to think about sex with him. I'm so use to thinking about him all the time, normal or naughty thoughts, doesn't matter. But now every time I do, I just cannot think about him without images of him wearing those pink.. (yes they were actually pink) diapers in my head. It just kills my mood. I've basically just taken care of myself to satisfy the urges while thinking of imaginary people (no real men that I know, just actual imaginary men that don't actually exist). Because if I think of him my mood dies. I cannot get that image out of my head. I feel so ridiculous, and really immature. We've talked but he kind of insists that this is something he likes doing and wants to try... I also brought up, what happens when I eventually move in? I can't really ignore it, or get away from it. He tells me ""Well you went along with (thing), you can't also give this a try?"" He's not pushy or angry, he's just sad and nearly begging me to try it. He probably imagines I think he's a freak or something over this.  

This is really hurting our relationship, and it seems like such a silly problem. I feel like absolutely dumb. This amazing 4 long relationship is being ruined by something that I don't personally like. We've been spending a lot less time together since. I have not physically seen him in the last 5 days, just loose text messages here and there to communicate. I don't know what to do, and I imagine there's probably no meeting in the middle for something like this either that I can tolerate.

EDIT: To anyone who was curious or to anyone who comes across this post in the future and wants to know the outcome.  

We planned a day to talk about everything. I told him how I felt about everything and didn't hold back and I asked him to do the same. As it turned out, he was really scared and ashamed of this fetish. I asked if it was my fault that he felt this way because of the way I reacted, but he claims that he himself felt unhappy over it. I could tell he was really sad and hurt that he felt the way he did, and he wished that he didn't. He almost broke down over it. He felt like it was his fault the relationship was almost ruined because of this. I asked him what he wanted to do and where he wanted to go with all of this then. I actually didn't mention what I said in some comments here about how I truly couldn't live with it and that it had to stop. I wanted to hear what his ultimate conclusion was without my preference influencing his decision. He himself proposed that it would be healthier for both of us if he could not think about it anymore. I assume it must be somewhat difficult considering how long he has been doing this for. That goes for anything that we do as people, it's hard to stop something that's become routine, so I understand this might feel strange to him to change on a dime. I told him that I'd stay with him and we could ring this out together. So he agreed. He threw whatever diapers he had left away. I've been constantly repeating to myself in my head that that image in my brain isn't real so I can get over it myself. 

I have hopes that this will work out. It may take some time but I believe we can move on and this will all be something in the past we'll forget. He has his own way of dealing with it for now. In the meantime we're going to spend time with each other again.  

I understand that this fetish isn't inherently just a horrible thing. I'm sure it's a harmless thing between two people who enjoy it together, but for our relationship specifically this is incompatible. The way I understand it, he knows this, and this gave him a reason to try and stop. He's wanted to stop for a long time and this forced him to. Since this is what he and I both want, this is a good result. Thank you for all your comments and advice, it helped me clear my head and try to approach this rationally. I've reached out onto other platforms as well for some help, but this sub definitely offered the most useful advice. Some of your comments allowed me to put myself in his shoes for a moment and see things from his perspective as well. Thank you guys so much. I couldn't really discuss this with anyone irl because I wanted to protect him, and that whole ""I know a friend who has X problem,"" is so transparent and obvious. Thanks again."

66ki7f,0,2017-04-20,My Bf [25 M] of 6 months left me [25 F] for another girl. Can I write a closure letter if he said no contact?,Hyhyhuh,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/66ki7f/my_bf_25_m_of_6_months_left_me_25_f_for_another/,"Met John 4 years ago while I was vacationing in Germany. We were always friends and I always had a crush on him.

I broke up with my serious boyfriend this past August and moved to Germany for an internship and reconnected with John.

John helped me through the breakup and we started hooking up in October. I told him we need to slow down because I need to properly recover.

We kinda slow down but not really. I meet his family and we spend every weekend together until March.
I finish my internship and move in with him and his roommates in March while searching for another job (the internship was the last class I had to fulfill to finish my degree). 

A couple weeks into March I find out my best friends husband cheated on her and my grandpa is dying.

I tell John I should go home to America and just kinda.... Breath and help out. 
He asks me if it would be better for me to be unattached while I figure out my life. I tell him yes but that I will definitely not be single and available, my future hopefully lies with him and I just need to be home for a bit. I tell him he can date other girls if he wants, he says he doesn't want to.

I go home and we talk everyday for a month. The day I get home is the same day my grandfather gets hospice care and I am SO busy moving him in, moving my grandma out of their place, getting my parents house prepared for my grandparents to live there etc etc. In this month period I am JUST focusing on my family... Definitely not going out unless it is to a bar to speak with my best friend about her new divorce. John is there for me everyday.

One night I hangout with friends and we are all smoking weed at a friend Mike's house (Mike is mainly a mutual friend, nice guy but not too close with him). This is the first time since August that I've really spent with them. My girlfriend tells me I could ride home with her (60 min other direction from my house) and take the bus back in the am (4 dollar 2 hour bus... F*** Seattle transportation). I say ""no ill just sober up in my car and drive home in the am"" . Everyone in the room rants and raves about how dumb that is and that I should just stay the night at Mike's.... As my car is there. I agree and Mike throws me a blanket and I fall asleep on his floor after everyone leaves. This entire time I'm texting and calling John but he is at work.

The next day I tell him what happened and he is hurt and I apologize. But I think at the time I really didn't see how sleeping on a guy's floor is a big deal. Still don't, but he is hurt and that's all that matters.
A week later grandpa dies. We are still in the midst of moving my grandma out of her house... So we don't have a lot of grieving time.

1 week later John tells me his boss is trying to set him up with some girl and he asked me if he is allowed to call me his girlfriend to deflect all of this. I say YES! and am finally feeling like I am ready for this and him and everything. I had felt him pulling away after sleeping on Mike's floor but now that John and I are official I feel much better and very secure in our relationship.

A week later is my grandpas funeral and my entire extended family is over for the weekend. John calls me about an hour after they have all arrived and tells me he has met someone new and that she said he can't talk to me anymore... He says he has to respect her and that he will always be my friend, he is crying the whole time. He reminds me how I gave him permission to date other girls. I am crying also and tell him I'll be fine. I ask him why he called me his girlfriend and he just said ""sorry I should not have done that""

Next night I send him like 5 nasty messages about how he betrayed me. No response. I delete him off Facebook in a fit of rage.

Next night I send his best friend a text saying ""tell John I am sorry about the messages and that I was hurt and shocked. I'll always be his friend too"". No response.

Next night I add John and he doesn't accept my request.

Its been 6 days since the breakup. Im still in shock but I find that when I think positively of him I feel a lot better. With all the hustle and bustle of having so many family members here for the memorial I have not really allowed myself to wallow too much. The last family member left yesterday.

I want to write him a closure letter and apologize for the things I did wrong.
Would this be disrespectful after he told me no contact? Did I do much wrong? How do you write a positive closure letter when you feel you are the one f***** over?

If you made it to the end of this, congratulations and thanks for reading!


**TL;DR on and off again boyfriend whom I'm dedicated to cut me off after meeting a new girl. Can I still write him a closure letter?**







**UPDATE** 

Just in case there is a lurker who may be curious about this type of thing. John called me on his friends phone the other day while I was at work, he told me he felt so guilty after reading the nasty messages I sent him and finally decided to go behind this girls back and talk things through with me. 

He apologized  and said he was shocked I was so mad as he really felt I was showing no interest in him the past month or so (like duh.....my grandfather was dying and I was one of his caretakers) and he didn't think I would be upset since I had previously mentioned how he should date other women when I left him in Germany. 

At that moment I had to go back to work and I asked him if I could send him the letter I wrote and he said please do by snail mail since he didn't want his new potential girlfriend reading through his facebook messages and finding out we talked. I also learned he met the girl THAT same day he called and they definitely aren't together yet but talking. 

I sent him the letter and am waiting for a call back from him since he promised he would call on his friends phone back to hear my side (the entire time he was the one talking before my boss walked in) "
66krej,4,2017-04-20,"I [23F] met a guy [31M] I really like, but on our third date, he disclosed to me that he's separated but still living with his wife.

On the THIRD DATE he tells me his wife of 5 years and him separated abkut 3 months ago and that they still live together because she is finishing up an internship which ends over the summer. They haven't started divorce process yet because she is very depressed and it might spiral her out of control and ruin her internship, so he wants to wait until after. He is even paying her rent.

I'm infuriated that this wasn't brought up sooner (should it have!?) and feel strongly he should write it on his profile (he hasn't yet). He says it would be weird if I came to their place but that he'd be willing to push through the awkwardness or just hang out with me st hotels.

One part of me really wants someone to hang out with but this all sounds so shady and weird. Thoughts??

66l4i2,41,2017-04-20,WrestleMania XXIX from the nosebleeds to the ringside. [Story],im_on_the_case,ActLikeYouBelong,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActLikeYouBelong/comments/66l4i2/wrestlemania_xxix_from_the_nosebleeds_to_the/,"Inspired by the NBA Court-side story. Here's my Wrestlemania almost ringside, story

""I don't know much about Wrestling"", I said when the guy tried to convince me to join the bus trip he was arranging out to the sports showcase event at New Jersey's Metlife Stadium. He tells me it's all included, bus, tickets, beer on the bus and an open bar beforehand. Price was good, I knew a couple of dudes who were going and I really struggle to pass up an open bar. The thing about an open bar when you are one of the establishment's more frequent customers, you get well looked after. I happened to be in a vodka soda phase at the time and my buddy barman interprets that order as ""I'll have a pint of Grey Goose with a dash of soda"". You can do a lot of damage with that drink in two hours. 

It was a good group going on the bus, pretty much a full coach load. It was pretty obvious that I was the only one not a Wrestling fan. They were all talking about the event, who was fighting and showing off the wrestling merchandise they were wearing to the big event. Me on the other hand I was going to make this as painless as possible by getting wasted. No question I looked out of place having not changed out of the clothes I'd worn to play a round of golf that morning.

Off we go onto the bus with what appeared to be one slab of beer per person, a decent amount considering the one hour round trip. The man arranging this excursion sadly could not come as he had other plans but he assured us the seats would be great. He was full of shit. We arrived and started climbing into the upper reaches of the stadium, not easy when you have enough booze in your blood to sedate a horse. Finally we get to our seats and they [couldn't be much worse.](http://i.imgur.com/YroZcAs.jpg) The people setting up the stage looked like ants, what's more we were obstructed by a large pylon. I started to become angry drunk guy. Nobody else seemed to mind they were just happy to be there. The event started and I was even less impressed by the viewing experience my seat provided me. I did notice there was a fair bit of [space around the ring seating](http://i.imgur.com/7CV1z1I.jpg) and the ALYB devil in me hatched a plot. ""I'm off guys"", I said to much bewilderment, the reply was straightforward: ""Where? It only just started!"". They laughed when I told them I was going down to the ring for a better view. ""Yeah? Good luck! Don't drink all the beer left on the bus when you get kicked out!"". The thought had crossed my mind.

Now this was the first time I had been at the MetLife stadium. I knew the old Giants Stadium pretty well and based on the assumption that they weren't too different I knew security would be lazy and moving around easy so off I went on the gradual descent. I was thinking that a service entrance might be the easiest option so I tried to get down to the bowels but the first I came across was for VIP's. I gave it a try, hurried past some security and made it too the door. A woman appeared out of nowhere and asked for my pass. ""They didn't give me a pass just the ticket?"" I replied with pure innocence. She chuckled ""Oh you would be regular admission just go back around to the escalators"". I thanked her and walked back to the concourse to scope things out. As usual there were ushers doing ticket checks at the tops of each stairs leading down to the field but interestingly no one at the bottom to prevent seat holders from walking out there. This should be easy. It was. I grabbed a beer and set off to find a weakness, didn't get very far as the third set of stairs had a distracted usher. Down I went to the front row and out onto the field. I made it! The rest of the gang [was up there somewhere](http://i.imgur.com/cMW0LhX.jpg) There was plenty of security around but nobody paid me any attention. 

I started wandering around checking out the action, this was far from ideal as anywhere I went I found myself [blocking somebodies view](http://i.imgur.com/A1BF2Xa.jpg). Kind of shitty to do to real fans who had traveled from all over the world for the big show. What's more the only others cruising around were some chiseled older fake tanned guy letting people take pictures with him, I assumed a former wrestler of note and some security goons. I was bound to escorted back to my seat, which would have been awkward since my seat was 30 flights up. There were a [few semi decent spots](http://i.imgur.com/GpYtGMC.jpg) but they were all a little too awkward or had equipment blocking the view. So I kept looking. Suddenly I found myself surrounded by a swarm of military personnel pushing up to the secondary stage for some fighters introduction. Not the type of group you want to ALYB in [unless stolen valor is your thing.](http://i.imgur.com/uS0JmaK.jpg) I shuffled my way out and found myself in an area with people standing around and not just any people they were all dressed like they had just come out of the office. I quickly realized that this must be where the Wrestling staff were hanging out and of course they had an awesome view of the ring. Score! Nobody was paying me any attention, after all I was smartly dressed. I just leaned back and enjoyed the show. 

The folks around me were chatting away and many weren't overly interested in the action, some probably wrote the damn script. I just wanted to keep a low profile and remain unnoticed. That was futile as one rather attractive girl started making small talk. I can't remember the exact details but she was pissy about some VIP's attitude. I calmly made some wise crack about the amount of testosterone flowing through the place. She laughed (or faked a laugh) and went back to watching the show. I was blending like a ninja chameleon but there was one problem, some serious dude in a suit with a radio was hovering in the area and continually gave me suspicious stares. He was quite distracted as many staff members would continually come over looking for direction but he kept glancing at me with a hint of ""I'll get to you in a minute, buster"". I was about to get my ass out of dodge when none other than old wrestling dude wandered over beside me and rested his back against the wall, to take a break from the endless selfies and autographs. I decided to strike up a conversation ""I'm guessing it was never this wild in your day?"" In retrospect a very risky question considering for all I knew he could have been the reigning Elderweight Champion of the World. He laughed and broke into a long ramble about Midwestern cities and people with funny names. I assume it would have been treasure to a wrestling fan but it was wasted on me, nice guy though. I realized during our chat that serious looking suit dude was no longer paying me any attention. Perhaps he put 2+3 together and assumed I was the fake tan intern or the new leotard wrangler, either way I belonged.

I watched most of the remainder of the show from that spot, [including the main event](http://i.imgur.com/EdJeLho.jpg) the view was ideal [bonus gif of the main event](http://i.imgur.com/l4NmlX4.gifv). Thankfully in my inebriated state I kept my phone out to document everything which I usually never do. 

The event rumbled on and I realized things were starting to wind down as the folks around me scattered to attend to whatever duties their jobs entailed. I received a few ""see you later"" salutes as the area cleared out, I started to consider I was in the wrong line of work and perhaps born to be either a secret agent or a fake tan application professional. Anyway I decided to make my way back to the crew to ensure the bus didn't leave without me. Just as I started up the steps I heard my name called. There a couple of rows from the front in the lower tier were a few of the guys. I guess they had spotted me strolling around the ring and decided to follow my lead before happening upon some vacant seats. That evening in the New Jersey swamp land I had unwittingly become an ALYB pioneer and for those guys and me, what would have been a decent day out turned into a rather excellent day out.

Hope you enjoyed the story.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nTBmnvCsc0

Vos and Bobby are in-studio and both guys kill for the entire time they're on. The lines from those two plus Ant &amp; Jim are just pure O&amp;A greatness. Bits include:

- Introduction of Intern Stevie before Vos &amp; Bobby arrive
- Banter on the awfulness of Death Wish 3 and how horrible those 80s ""every major city is filled with crazed psychopaths who will murder you for fun"" movies can get
- Opie almost gets paralyzed on vacation and everyone cracks jokes about paralyzed Opie. Funny bit, even funnier to pay attention to Opie and how uncomfortable he is being the butt of the joke even when he wasn't really paralyzed. He gets super upset over being made fun of for a hypothetical scenario.
- Vos tries to flirt with some NASCAR employee handling some NASCAR drivers giving interviews and fails in the cringiest way.
- Vos is performing at an Italian Restaurant and gets ripped apart
- Ant had a BBQ, Danny invited a ""friend"" with a fat girlfriend who proceeded to steal money from Ant's house

Man though, this is a really really brutal episode throughout and just fantastic. "

I put Physics as my major and planned to minor in Computer Science, but since I still have time to change, I would like to hear other opinions.

I am a self-taught programmer and am currently using online classes and video lectures to learn Discrete Mathematics, Algorithms and Data Structures, etc.

I chose physics because I am interested in Cosmology / Astrophysics / Nuclear Physics / General Computational Physics.

Regardless of my major, I plan to work as a programmer after college and I also plan to apply for Computer Science Internships and Co-Ops.

Comparing https://oucc.dasa.ncsu.edu/cos-17physbs-nosubplan-2117/ and https://oucc.dasa.ncsu.edu/coe-14cscbs-nosubplan-2167/ I noticed that for the first 3 semesters the 2 majors have most classes in common (it should be kept in mind that the CSC plan is from 2014). So I started thinking about doing a dual-major.

What do you guys think? Should I stick with PY Major / CSC Minor or go a different route?

Edit:
I agree that a CSC Major is the best way to get a CSC Job. I want to get a Masters and then a PhD in Physics after getting a job and stable income. Is it possible to be accepted into a Physics Master degree program with a Physics Minor?"

This is a long story...


I am a college student that currently works two jobs. Previously, I had always paid my credit cards and loan payments on time. I would alway pay more than the minimum payment. My credit score was great. Life was even better.


Until he came into my life. I don't know if he is a blessing or a curse.


It all started in the beginning of 2016. His job slowed down, and he was unemployed for some time. I decided to help him out by letting him borrow money to pay his very pricey apartment rent. Then, all of the sudden it was one thing after another. Ever since, my finances have gone downhill and I could no longer make my own payments in time. He always promised me he'd pay me back. My credit card payments were late and I only had 3 more payments to go on a secured loan, but because I could not pay, the bank seized ALL the money since it went into default. I also made the stupid decision of getting a title loan to help, but I am still paying for it.


These past few months I've gotten back on track. He's also gotten a bit better, but sometimes he still asks me if I can pay for certain things and promises he'll pay me back.


At this point, I will be graduating this December, and I have also secured a good internship that's pretty well paid. He's a very sweet guy, I just don't want him to keep asking me for money. I'm getting so tired of it! Has anyone else had a similar experience to mine?


TL;DR: He is financially unstable. I want to break up with him, but I don't know how to try getting back some of the money I let him borrow. Do I just let it go?"

&amp;nbsp;

It will be exactly a year that I have graduated with a CS degree(Focus on Java). As much as I regret it, I did not work on any side projects in my free time. I was luckily able to grab an internship at a big bank the year before I graduated but I ended up having a bad experience(Don't think I can use as reference). I was hired as an intern with no knowledge of any sorts of technology they used. I believe that I tried my best as an intern to learn about their technologies(JCL, COBOL, DB2, Mainframe) and at the end, was given a little program to write. I had a great mentor who explained things very clearly but my manager just threw me power-points to make because she was constantly busy. At the end of my internship, my manager told me that she didn't think that I worked hard enough and should've worked harder.

&amp;nbsp;

My resume currently has 3 school projects and my internship(I'm unsure whether to leave it there or not because of what my manager would say). I know this is not enough to get hired as a software engineer which is why I haven't even really applied anywhere yet.

&amp;nbsp;

I just started up 2 projects recently. One is an e-Commerce website selling party products and the other is similar but for a restaurant(Both with credit card checkout systems). I was thinking after I finish these two websites, maybe I can make an android app for the restaurant website for the kitchen.

&amp;nbsp;

Am I too late? I've heard people saying not to wait too long to look for jobs because companies will think there is something wrong with you. Thanks for any advice/opinion!"

He ended up getting an important internship back home (we're at two different schools in the same city, but pretty far from his hometown) so he's been gone for the semester, but I feel like things are unfinished. The last thing he said to me was something like ""I do hope I see you again."" No idea what he's been up to, because we're not super connected on social media, but I would like to see him at the end of this year or beginning of the next semester, because when there's unfinished relationship stuff out there, it's hard for me to completely move on (the person is always in the back of my mind until everything's worked out, even if I'm dating, etc.), and I do feel like we have the potential to be great together.
Since we ended things, we've only texted once, just about some silly thing I needed advice about, but he was receptive. He usually watches my Snapchat story and likes my Instagram pictures. I think he might be dating or hookinhbup with someone, but I don't think he would be serious with anyone because he's just coming back here soon anyway, and I know he doesn't want to do a LDR because of his relationships before me. 
How would you reconnect with someone when you have no idea what they've been up to? Choices for correspondence are Snapchat or texting, and I obviously know that I could just text ""hey, how've you been?"" But it feels weird because I don't know when he'll be back and I don't know if it makes sense to start talking if we won't be around each other for months. Do I do nothing and just try to move on? Or reconnect? How do I try?"

I'm 22, have a top 10 internship in the country and make decent money. Anyways, my son just turned 1 in March. When he was born, my ex (his mother) chose to not give him my last name and instead give him her's and also decided not to put me on the birth certificate. I obviously was upset and had full intention in taking her to court and at the very least getting my name on the BC. We have a very weird situation, in which were not together but i go over to her place and get my own time with him everyday before I go to work for about 4 hours. It's not ideal, of course, and i want my family to be much more involved than they currently are. I have always just been scared of taking her to court for fear of not being able to see him for even the few weeks or month or so that the court situation might take. Ive finally gotten over that and am moving out in a couple of weeks and just want to have my son for as much time as possible under my own circumstances without supervision. His mother knows im a great dad and can definitely be trusted with this, but she is ridiculously controlling and will do whatever it takes to keep as much custody over our son as possible, even if it means me getting nothing. The point of my back story is to garner answers to a particular question. My plan was to move out and then take her to court and since i have a good job, college degree, and im a great dad, i figured i had nothing to worry about. The thing is, i used to smoke a good amount of marijuana and i don't buy it or waste money on it anymore bc i have more important shit going on, but i do still smoke maybe a couple times a month or so just because i have friends/coworkers who don't mind offering and it tends to keep my stress level lower than it needs to be. Going back to what i said earlier, my ex will do whatever it takes to keep our son to herself and has even said to me before that she would ask for a drug test if we ever went to court. I have no problem stopping and since a court proceeding wouldnt be for at least a month i would have no problem passing a urine test, but i would absolutely fail a hair test. My questions are how common a hair test would be in this situation vs a urine test and how detrimental the repercussions would be if the only thing that showed up on it was marijuana usage. For anybody who read through all of this, i really appreciate it and need all the help i can get. Thanks guys."
66nsui,3,2017-04-21,What should I do?,benjaminikuta,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/66nsui/what_should_i_do/,"


What should I do now? 

I'm feeling kinda lost. 

Should I attend community collage and try to get perfect grades and transfer to Cal? 

That would be almost ideal, if I could pull it off, I think. 

Should I go for a guaranteed transfer to another UC? 

Seems like the reasonable option. 

Should I return to UCR? 

If my parents would allow it, I could get an off campus apartment and take UCR classes via the extension center. 

It would be good because I've already friends and obligations there and it would be good not to abandon that. 

It would also be good because I really would rather not live at home. 

On the other hand, I never really liked UCR. 

Should I attend some other university? 

I have no idea. 

Should I take a summer internship or seminar or something in the liberty movement? 

It would be fun, and a nice change. 

Perhaps that's what I need, change. 

Still, it isn't something I really want to pursue, and I have other reservations. 

Should I put off doing anything and instead focus on addressing my mental health issues? 

Mental health is important, and I can't do much else without it, but treatment doesn't seem promising.

The man who came back to his old role as team principle with Ford-Cosworth Racing: Daniel Manning.

Having left the team in spectacular fashion during FRL's inaugural season, fired for punching a rival driver, he's back after Ronald Strong was expelled for his bad behaviour.

""They haven't had much luck with team principles, have they?"" said Manning, grinning widely as went into his office in the motorhome. ""Strong gets kicked out. Dent was a great engineer, but not really a leader. Me, and now ... well, me again.""

""Is it strange with all the new faces around?""

""Not really. That's motorsports. Besides: Marvin Andros, is still around, as is Tricia McMillan. Arthur Dent is still in the aero department. And, of course, Poppy Rose. You know she started here as an intern, occasionally writing for the website, but mostly here to keep me running my mouth too much? Gotta be the hardest job in FRL, that. I didn't make life easy for her, but look. She clearly impressed someone. Team manager now. Deserves it, too."" 

I want to talk about the events of Manning's final days at the team, what led to his sacking, but I don't really want to ask. Instead I ask what he did while he was away.

""I kept an eye on what was going on. Ford didn't want to drop me entirely, so I went and worked on the road car engines for a while. Anger management therapy and a long - and I mean *long* - holiday in Japan.

""I mean, look. I'm not going to try to justify what I did. It was high pressure. We were fighting for the title, and fighting hard.  Nobody really knew what was what, and we were all finding our feet. I'd never been in that situation before. I wasn't ready for it. I'm a passionate guy. I care, I care so hard about racing, and my drivers, and my car. And I let that bubble over too much, and made rash decisions like ... well, like punching another driver.

""But I'm in a better place now. There's less pressure on us to succeed immediately, although obviously Ford want to be right back at the shop end as soon as. Also, I've learned some more productive ways to handle it. Ford are happy with it.

""The long and the short of it is this: I'm glad to be back.""

I ask him if he can show us something about how he handles pressure now.

""Well, a bit of this, a bit of that. It's mostly in here, you know,"" he says, tapping his head, ""although someone did get me this.""

He points into the corner, where there's a punch bag on a stand.

""Someone's idea of a joke."" Again, he's grinning widely. ""And look,"" he adds, getting out a sheet of plastic with something printed on it. He attaches it to the punch bag stand, and it becomes an effigy of Arthur Dent.

""Is it wise,"" I ask ""to have Arthur's face printed onto a punch bag? What if he finds out?""

""Well: BS News would have field day, wouldn't they?"" He laughs. ""But I'm not worried about Arthur finding out. He already knows I have it. He's the one who gave it to me. I have quite a few, actually.""

He leafs through the various prints that can be placed over the punch bag. Most of the current drivers and team principles, plus a few journalists (though not myself - I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing), are represented.

Right at the back is Nathalie Henrikkson - the driver he punched.

""Isn't that in bad taste?"" I ask.

""No idea,"" he says, ""I've never been very good at knowing."""

I started writing in a small town in Wisconsin called Oshkosh. I'm not from there, I was just trapped there for a summer internship. For 3 months, my closest friend was a four hour drive away.

Due to the immense boredom, I took up writing! And yeah, that's it. That's literally my origin story. I was just bored and somehow found something that would dictate the next three years of my life. Go figure.

---

**PART 2**

While in the slogging monotony of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. I found a small coffee shop with fake leaves, unpopular music, and $7 shakes. It was perfect. I spent every weekend here, 8 hours a day, typing away. During the weekdays, I stopped devoting so much time to working out and gaming and began writing instead.

It was fun. My first story slowly formed into a novel 180,000 words long. By the year's end, I had finished it. Those were exciting times. I felt like I had conquered the world. An entire novel sat in my computer, and 3 separate flash drives just in case.

I wanted feedback. Truthfully, I just wanted people to tell me how impressed they were by my words. So I found a small writing community called /r/destructivereaders where they consequently tore my first few chapters to shreds. My book sucked, real bad. And the hardest part was--they were right. I sucked at writing, had literally negative talent for it. So I did one of the hardest things I've ever done. I deleted my novel. Wiped my flashdrives. A year's worth of work deleted for good.

---

**PART 3**

I wanted to get better, but I didn't know how. I had enrolled in a writing class in college but it wasn't the grueling grind session I had hoped for. It was more of the ""say two good things to say one bad thing"" type deal. So instead, I redoubled my efforts in /r/destructivereaders where people more were a little bit more *generous* with their critiques.

I wrote short stories like crazy. It was through short stories that I would learn the rules of prose, the basics of story design and arcs, and how I'm pretty much the worse writer in the world. However, what really helped me was the giving of critiques. I found that when I gave someone else critiques, I would point on flaws in my own writing, things that I wouldn't be able to see being so close to my own work.

Then one day, someone posted a compliment on one of my short stories. I still remember that story, hell it was posted in this sub as a bonus story (The Price of Coffee). They said it wasn't the worse thing in the world! And that's how I knew I was no longer the worst writer in the world either.

---

**Part 4**

Now, as the *former* worst writer in the world, I want to tackle on my next hurdle--time. It takes me far too long to come up with stories and write them out. Even a simple 1k word short story takes me a day to imagine, write, edit, write 3 more drafts of, etc, and most of that time is spent in writer's block. And that's why I'm here, writing for /r/writingprompts where speed is an integral part of a story's success. But I don't just want to write fast, I want to create tales to remember at a pace my former self could never match. Whether I can actually do that or not, well, you're subbed here (hopefully), so I guess we'll find out.

---

So that's my *origin story*. I hope you enjoy my writing. I'll keep posting WP stories, twice daily. I have a lot of things in the works as well, independent short stories, novels, novellas, you name it. I'll post them when they're ready.

Thanks for reading!

I'm in the process of interviewing for a commercial underwriting trainee program. Just had my phone interview the other day and my hiring manager interview will be some time next week.
 
For those in underwriting, do you have any tips to help me stand out? Maybe some good questions I can ask to show my interest in the industry.
 
One of my potential weak points: while I've got close to a year in the property casualty field, (claims intern, now stat reporting), I don't have a lot of customer service experience. 
 
I know they're giving more weight to people with sales/customer experience. In my first interview I framed a lot of my internal interactions with different departments as ""relationship building"", though I wonder if this will be enough in round 2. 
 
Help me get inside these underwriting managers heads and reassure them that I'd be a good fit?
 
 

Any feedback would be appreciated, thanks!

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

66ptiy,2,2017-04-21,Employer and my parents are pressuring me into a starting position that pays $1000 per month despite being full-time. Am I completely screwed or is this workable?,zincxironxcation,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/66ptiy/employer_and_my_parents_are_pressuring_me_into_a/,"Tl;dr at bottom

I’m a 24-year-old Asian male living in Southern Cal with my parents. I have a B.A. in Communication from UCSB, as well as an Associate degree in Accounting from a community college. I just finished a three months internship as an assistant for a CPA at a small accounting-advising firm, which leads to the crux of my dilemma.

During my 40-hours-per-week internship, my official duties were scanning tax documents and doing QuickBooks payrolls for client companies, but I was also expected to greet and interact with clients, answer phone calls, and try my hand at tackling bookkeeping as needed. After the tax season ended, my boss gave me a harsh but honest evaluation: I didn’t exceed expectations. In fact, I was underwhelming. I met the bare minimum expectations, which is doing payroll and scanning documents, but he deemed my skill with payroll as being shaky and my steadily improved scanning speed as still being really slow; these assessment are certainly true. He also noted I am very bad at answering phone calls: I lost count of how many phone calls I bungled by failing to extract essential details...

Now, there is another assistant of his that handles the bulk of the office work. For personal reasons, they have to leave for another country, leaving a vacancy that needs to be filled. My boss told me he is offering me an opportunity to try to fill in the gaps and assume that assistant’s duties. On top of my previous duties of scanning and doing payroll, I would have to handle more bookkeeping, manage sales, file tax reports for client companies, and interact extensively with both individual and company clients via phone and email. (During my internship, the only emails I sent were internal). All this for a salary of $1,000 a month, with a chance for a raise based on a quarterly performance evaluation. I was working the previous three months unpaid.

Why unpaid? Because my parents begged the company’s owner, who is basically a mentor-partner with my current boss, to take me in for free, no salary, so I can gain experience. The owner, being an old church friend of my mother’s, agreed. In fact, that’s how I got my old “jobs” as a custodial assistant at a community park and as an intern at a broker-investment firm: connections. I haven’t done a single job interview in my life. Just how fucking ridiculously spoiled am I, huh…?

My parents' financial situation is getting unbearable; see, our expenses exceed our income. My boss told me he believes I would be unlikely to excel in other office environments, as he’s been especially lenient with me. Other companies would have told me to leave a long time ago, he explained, for playing with my phone at times. Since the tax season is over, it is reasonable to expect that he can afford to be more hands-on now. Another thing to keep in mind is that sometimes I actually can’t find the time to eat lunch. He tells me to, of course, but sometimes I just plain don’t have the time. Now, my duties will only increase… That's all the details I can think of at the moment.

So, should I accept the salary $1,000 a month?  My parents think it’s a wonderful, golden opportunity and want to me to seize it. My friends and brother think I should reject the offer. What do YOU think?

TL;DR: Southern Californian Asian dude offered $1,000 a month at place he previously worked as an unpaid intern, doing payroll and scanning. New added duties would include answering (more) phone calls, doing (more) bookkeeping, handling sales, and interacting with clients. Old hours were 40 hours/week; new hours should be the same. Take it or leave it?

**UPDATE** $800 bonus was given to me today. Better than nothing, I guess."

I'm officially down 50lbs and updated my flair today. It took me a while to lose this 50lbs because until recently, I haven't really tried too hard. But I came up with a new plan (which I posted in a thread yesterday). So, it's story time.

**How does one get REALLY fat?**

For me, it was a sad, long journey. As a young kid, I had severe snoring issues. I had my tonsils removed and it didn't help at all. Then my house burned down and I had to leave my elementary school and friends behind. In addition, I was taking an allergy medication that had an extremely rare side effect (that wasn't found out about until almost a decade after I was taking it).

When I was a kid, I was one of those really skinny, small, underweight children. The above resulted in me putting on a bit of chub which exasperated my sleeping patterns.

I remember having friends at this age who always boasted about staying up to midnight or 1 AM and then they were fine at school the next day. Meanwhile, I would go to bed at 9pm and would be practically dead the following morning. As a kid, my hygiene was terrible as I spent plenty of mornings sleeping on the bathroom floor for a half an hour rather than taking a shower.

School was a struggle and I only managed to continue to gain more weight and become increasingly tired.

By the time I ""graduated"" high school, I guess I probably weighed 250-275lbs.

I put graduation in quotes because truly, I shouldn't have even graduated. I was a failing student and what I didn't realize at the time, is that the main source of my failings as a student was because of exhaustion. I would constantly forget assignments, tests, and other deadlines.

After HS, I worked a series of retail jobs and continued to gain weight because I was constantly hungry. I finally landed a job, part-time, in an office. And that's when things got really bad.

I was sleeping up to 12 hours a day since I only had to work 3 hours a day (and sadly, it paid more than my retail job weekly). I went into my doctor and told him what was going on. He told me I have diabetes and I need to lose weight and get my bloodsugar under control and I will be fine.

I tried that for a while and it didn't work.

A couple of years later, I discovered something called Sleep Apnea.

Getting treatment was like night/day. I felt rested for the first time in my life. My insane hunger cravings died down.

Sadly, I didn't get serious about losing weight at this point. I instead decided to attend college and work full-time. My days were packed. To make it worse, I switch programs halfway through which extended my time in college.

In 2015, I graduated, got an internship in addition to a near-fulltime job and in late 2015, I quit my second job and got hired fulltime into my field.

At this point, I was nearly at my peak. Over the following winter, spring, and then summer of 2016, I was under a huge amount of pressure at my job. And last October, I was at my heaviest.

435 lbs.

**How I got to where I am**

Since then, I've worked to try various things. Generally, the most important, was try to watch what I've eaten. Over six months, I worked my way down to just under 400lbs. Around 3-4 weeks ago, I really took a hard look at my diet and activity so I could begin to put a plan into place.

Last week I officially put my plan into place.

**The Plan**

* **16/8 Intermittent Fast** - Eating hours are 12pm-8pm
* **Carb Cuts** - Not going for any specific number, just cutting carbs in general. I tracked my carbohydrate intake and bad eating days for a bit to see what my diet that got me fat looked like. What I found, too much fat, too many carbs, too little protein. I'm guessing I was averaging 350-450 carbohydrates per day.
* **More Protein** - In the past, I've tried eating lots of extra chicken and tuna to get extra protein. It's a struggle. Not only that, my throat hurts. I had the genius idea a couple of weeks ago to incorporate Protein shakes into my diet. I find they do wonders to keep me sated. I drink a protein shake at 12pm, 4pm, and before 8pm. That results in 390 Calories, 9 Carbs, 6 Fat, and 81 Protein.
* **Find Healthy Foods I Like** - I've been a little more willing to try new things. Celery is my go-to. I love it with Ranch or Peanut Butter as a snack. I also have a lot of frozen steamed veggies I enjoy. I've been trying various things to find healthy food that I like and keeping lists so when I get weak, I can find something on my lists that I enjoy without going crazy. I've really enjoyed the Eat! brand of frozen meals (going to write a review on them next week).
* **Not sweating the bad days** - Easter was terrible for me, it started terrible and ended with a trip to Chilis where I likely consumed 2000 calories in the restaurant. No big deal, moved on, Monday was a new day.


Overall. Cut calories to &lt;2k which is a 1000-1200 calorie cut below my TDEE. Cut carbs from 350g+/day to &lt;175g/day. Start getting a little more exercise. Enjoy myself on occasion.

The weekend of April 8th, I stood on the scale and saw 397.8.

I stood on the scale today and saw 385.4

12 pounds in 13 days with no exercise. I'm okay with that. Also, this has been really sustainable. I don't find myself hungry or overly full and I feel really good.

This weekend I plan to take my first set of ""Before"" pictures so I can give myself a comparison in the coming months.

**Some of my helpful and favorite things**

* Chocolate Protein Powder - I drink three of these a day. 130 calories, 3g Carbs, 23g Protein per scoop. They fill me up. 1 at 12pm, 1 at 4pm, 1 at 7:45pm.

* [Eat!](https://www.eat2live.com/) brand frozen dinners. I will post reviews of these next week. I still have 2 or 3 flavors to try.

* Mrs. Dash Table Blend. They make those Lean Cuisines and Smart Ones (Not really on the Smart Ones, tbh, nothing can save these) actually have some flavor.

* MiO and Crystal Light Liquid Enhancers as well as ZipFizz. I only drink these from 12pm-8pm while off intermittent fast. They help me skip soda and consume a lot of water. Drank 125oz of water yesterday!

* Smuckers Natural PB and Bolthouse Farms Ranch Dressing. While the Smuckers is rather calorie heavy since it's real PB, the taste cannot be beat. I tried PB2 a few days ago and it just wasn't the same with my celery. The bolthouse Farms brand of dressings seem excellent though. The ranch has a small calorie count per serving with a decent serving size.

* Garlic Butter Spread and Light 80cal Hotdog buns. These are great for making a piece of homemade Garlic Bread to go along with dinner."
66qcao,0,2017-04-21,My boyfriend (23M) of 1 year's parents (50ish) told him that my (20F) scars meant that I'd teach our children (n/a) to cut among other things,Silverstormwing,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/66qcao/my_boyfriend_23m_of_1_years_parents_50ish_told/,"Pasting this up here so that you don't need to work through all of it. 


Tl;Dr boyfriend's parents think that my scars would make me a bad wife and thought that I was the reason he's stressed out - and to fix that, they discluded me from several family events I had previously been invited to.


Hey guys, I figured that this has been bothering me a LOT over the last week and I really needed to get some fresh opinions.


A little back (Feb 2016) started dating this kid ""Dan"" - I met his parents and they liked me, or so he said. We went a little fast, and honestly hadn't really figured out the relationship and well, each other. I had an internship last summer, and we had to do long distance, which absolutely did not work for me - so we first took a break, then broke up. I knew it hurt Dan a lot, and we didn't talk for a while. 


Fast forward to September where we started talking again, and ended up sleeping together. This kick-started a whole new relationship. I admitted that I was definitely wrong about breaking up, and that I regretted doing it. We pointed out flaws in the previous relationship, and worked through them. And now we are going strong again. He's graduating this May and has been freaking out, understandably. Thankfully he's staying in my college town, so I feel comfortable keeping the relationship going at this serious level. 


A little about me, I'm super insecure. I struggled heavily with depression in high school, and my parents really didn't have the skills to deal with it. In all honesty, they tried blaming it on my books, my friends, my artwork - anything that wasn't that I was uncomfortable with myself or my life. I'm adopted (asian origin) and have always struggled with my self identity, even from when I was in 1st Grade. Around 3rd grade I started pulling out my toe nails, and by middle school I was cutting. This left it's mark on my skin and my nails, and my whole left shoulder has a lot of visible scars. It wasn't until really my senior year that I learned to love myself. I finally found a therapist that I felt like I could open up to, and that helped my parents really understand my logic (they are both doctors and are VERY logical, but emotionally stunted in some areas). My parents would always tell me that nobody would love me, or be attracted to me because of my scars, and I've finally worked past that. 


Due to my innate insecurity, I didn't meet up with his friends again (I'd met them previously in the last relationship, but not after the break up) until December. I was worried they would hate me because Dan was not in a good place after the initial break up. The meet up was fine, perhaps a little awkward, but it was fine. Later Dan told me that his best friend (female) had said that she though it was a bad idea, but if he thought it would work and was committed to it, then her opinion wasn't too important and she would support him in his efforts. 


Apparently his other friend (female) supported it as well, but harbored to bad feelings that she never talked through. This past month Dan has been really stressed with graduation and finding a place to live, so he hasn't been talking to them as much. And when he did, he'd talk about me??? So she assumed that I was the one stressing him out, and actually stopped inviting him to hang out with them - to the point that he would come home, see them on the playground outside his place with all his friends, and they hadn't contacted him at all. To clarify, they weren't even inviting him, and he was kind of hurt by that.


So this weekend was Easter. But is was also his birthday (Saturday and Sunday respectively) so his parents came up (they live 4 hours away). Originally it was just his mom because his dad was on a trip, but his dad arrived Monday. His birthday was good! His mom invited us to a nice dinner with his brother and honestly it was fun. Yet I couldn't shake the feeling that there was something going on. The mom seemed to hold a grudge. Even though Dan had talked with her before and she pretty much said as long as he is happy, she'll be happy. She's not the most emotionally mature, and I'm guessing a lot of this comes from the grudge that I'm taking her boy away from her. That night, Dan received a panicked call from his mother, where she said that she forgot to make me an Easter basket (oh no the shame) and that he should just uninvite me from going to Easter brunch. This sucked, because I had already changed plans with my family so that Dan and I could go to Easter mass and brunch with his family, and then on a hike and dinner with mine. 


Begrudgingly I agreed, but I was not a happy camper. I couldn't go to mass because that would make it awkward, but I was alone on Easter morning because I didn't have an Easter basket (error 404: logical unit cannot be found). Issue was, that turns out they had also planned a dinner afterwards, in which Dan would have to miss because he was having dinner with my family (who like him).  Apparently at this dinner, his best friends were there, and his mom asked them whether they though I was good for his son. AND FUCKING APPARENTLY... THEY SAID NO! Not because of anything they saw. Or anything he did, or I did in that matter. But because he's been stressed out. From FUCKING GRADUATION.  From actual life. But that bitches (pardon the language, if you can't tell I'm still very much annoyed that they would do something like that) told his mom I wasn't good for him, because he's been stressed. And they blamed it on me. I have no idea what else they told her, but that's the information that he gleaned from them after the fact. They told his very emotionally immature mom that I wasn't good for him because they hadn't bothered actually asking him what was wrong. I honestly wouldn't have cared... If it didn't ruin the rest of the time his parents were here.


After Easter, on Tuesday they were going to have a nice family dinner. One with his dad, extended, family and family friends - and he invited me to it. Turns out I had been uninvited, and his mom ignored his texts asking if I was able to come. In fact, on Monday she didn't allow him to invite me on a walk along the river that he took with her. She pretty much tried to keep us as separated as possible. She said that they wanted it just as family, but they had friends there, so it definitely was just a straight denial of me coming, especially since I'd been invited beforehand. 


I was... Well I honestly shouldn't have had my hopes up, but I did. I wanted to put effort into getting to know his family - and they didn't let me. I asked him to talk to his mom about why this happened, and he finally just caller her because she wasn't responding. From what I heard, he pretty much asked her ""what the fuck?"" But with a much nicer wording. And that's when we heard about the whole friends told her that I wasn't good for him bullshit. Apparently she wasn't too happy, so she asked that he talk to his dad in the morning. His dad pretty much said that I'm not Catholic so I'm corrupting him and that they don't like that. He retaliated with something that we'd discussed, that essentially  if it were a requirement to get married, that I'd be open to converting to catholisim, and that I would be willing to raise the kids (loosely) Catholic. To this they were surprised.


But then they brought up my scars, and actually said ""what if she gets stressed with a baby. And starts cutting the baby instead of herself?"" (Mind you I haven't seriously cut in like 4 years) and then asks ""what if she teaches the kids how to cut? Or tells them that they should be and that it's ok?"" Which first of all. Fuck you. Fuck that. I never wanted to cut. And if I have kids, I'm going to tell them that I'm here for them. That they can listen to me because I understand depression. I know how to deal with it. And if they cut. I'm going to do everything in my power to help them stop, to understand them. Point is. I NEVER want to put someone in the position that I was. I never want to subject someone to the pain I went through. And his father finally ended with ""well I wouldn't marry her butttttt if you think it's the right decision. I guess you can.""


So right now, I'm sitting here. Hurt, really fucking hurt that someone could think that I'd maliciously hurt my children. Teach them how to cut. I heard my mom's screaming voice telling me that nobody will love me, accept me, or be attracted to me, because of my scars, and this is just playing right into it. And I worry that although Dan and I agreed that we'd work through it, and that even if his parents don't agree, that if we still are going out and going strong in a couple of years, that marriage is still a possibility. I'm hurt that I got discluded from one of the few times I could meet his uncle and his family friend that I'd heard to much about (they asked about me at the dinner) and honestly I worry that it's going to happen again. 


I guess I'm here to ask, what should I do? How does one fix this with a significant others parents? What should I do if it happens again, say at graduation? How do I change their perspective on this? Is it a good idea to convert to catholisim? Honestly there are so many questions. Any advice would help. I'm sorry for the massive word vomit.

I’ve written and re-written posts on here, but find that I don’t have much to say, or didn’t want to say the wrong thing.. so I end up deleting it. But now I’m losing my grip. I am looking for similar experiences and some others experience, if anyone’s been in a predicament that I’m finding myself in now. 

My husband and I have been together for almost 6 years. If it were solely up to him, we would have had kids years ago. But I wanted us to finish college, own our house for a while, and be comfortable in our career jobs… and I wanted to be 25. (I don’t know why, just wanted to make it to 25 for some reason.) Well, we checked all of those off our list and here we are! I’ll be 37 weeks on Sunday… due on Mothers Day, 5/14.

My pregnancy has been great, I always say “No complaints, thankfully!” whenever anyone asks me how its going. It really has been great and I felt like I haven’t had anything to complain about, other than the typical, mild pregnancy symptoms. I was very scared to be pregnant, so I feel very lucky to have had such a positive experience.

About a month ago, my MIL was diagnosed with cancer. This was a shock to us all. Her yearly tests had all come back fine, so when the “precautionary check” found something we were in disbelief. They told us that it was curable, but she needed to begin chemo soon. We all put on our positive pants and knew this cruel, BS journey is just something that some have to fight. The outpouring of support and cheerleaders that have come out of the woodwork for her is phenomenal and up-lifting.

About three weeks ago, I was at my OB’s for a routine 34 week appointment. My OB's PA couldn’t get my fundal height to measure more than 30 weeks. She kept trying, and trying.. and then told me “Not to freak out, because these measurements aren’t always reliable” but she was sending me over to the hospital in a few days for a growth ultrasound. 

They called me within 20 minutes of leaving the ultrasound, saying it showed her in the 22nd percentile, small abdomen, approximately 4lb 6oz, and elevated cord BP; so they began scheduling me for weekly NST’s and ultrasounds, and another growth scan on the 26th of this month to see if she is growing appropriately. I know ultrasounds aren’t always reliable, but I also know there’s a reason they do them. I didn’t want to obsess over the results, but I like knowing. I like being informed… so I wait, impatiently.

The weekly NST’s and ultrasounds look good. She passes within 10 minutes of each test which makes me feel better.. I love the hospital staff, they’re so positive, but informative, and they explain every question I have when I come in. I don’t dread going there. But I’m still curious about her next growth scan on Wednesday.

So Tuesday I went back to my OB, and he comes in to do the GBS test. While I’m laying down he’s talking to the nurse and I’m talking to his intern, and I hear him say something about blood pressure and hear her say trace of protein.. cue mental freak-out. My BP is, 140/90. My “normal” has been 110/65ish. He checked my reflexes and looked at my hands and asked how long they’ve been that swollen. I told him they began swelling a month or so ago, but I was always told swelling was normal and it’s getting really hot.. And for Gods sake I’m in Florida, it’s a literal sweat box. He asked me if I have headaches or see stars. I told him no headache at all, but I’ve had a couple stars, usually at work. I attributed that to what I do for my job. I’m in a dark room, in front of 5 monitors and radios all day long running statistics and listening to calls, my brain (and eyeballs) go in 10 different directions sometimes. 

I instantly felt guilty that I haven’t been paying enough attention, because I’ve really felt great! I haven’t slowed down at all, I’ve been able to do so much and I haven’t felt “limited.” He looked at me and said “I think you’re becoming pre-eclamptic. I’m sending you to the hospital for a work-up. I would probably deliver you next week.” I was shocked. I said “But she’s small… Isn’t that bad?”  He said she’s “smaller” but she’s not so small he’s concerned, and he’d give me the option of a cesarean if I wanted it. He then said I was on bed rest for the remainder of my pregnancy. I asked him to say that again. I think my eyes rolled out of my head. He put his hand on my arm and said, “Don’t worry, it’s ok.” My face must have looked mortified. This WAS NOT the way I expected the appointment to go. I didn’t know what to say. I was so still processing it all and went over to the hospital for testing. My blood pressure had gone back down to 123/70, so they didn’t keep me. Told me to pay attention to swelling, stars and headaches.. I go back to my OB next Tuesday, and have my NST/growth ultrasound on Wednesday.

On my way home, my husbands Nana called me. I could tell in her voice that there was something wrong. She couldn’t get a hold of my husband but didn’t want to scare him at work. She told me that my MIL’s pre-tests came back, showing the cancer may have moved to other parts of her body.. She has to go in for biopsies and more tests… but still starts chemo next week, on Thursday. I stared at the phone.

I know that there is nothing I can do. I know that my main priority is myself and our baby. I know I have to sit still and keep her cooking as long as I can, and keep my own stress down as much as possible for her sake. But I am so frustrated. I’m so, so grateful the agency I work for having FMLA. My plan was to work until I went into labor, and now my time has to start ticking early. I’m frustrated, but I know it’s there for a reason, and if I need to keep my ass at home, I will. 

My husband loves what he does and he’s great at it, but he physically works HARD. Ten to twelve hour days outside, in the Florida sweatbox. He’s also an apprentice so 2/3 of the year he goes to school on Saturday’s for 10 hours… for years. He works so hard. And I am so proud of him. And I’m so grateful for him. He’s my very best friend and my other half. He’s my “real-life Thor.” I’m one lucky lady to have him. I love him, a lot. This diagnosis of his mom has been so hard, but he’s handled it so well. He’s a “take it as it is and deal with it,” kinda man, but I know he can only carry so much on his shoulders. 

Because he’s only home one day a week, I take up all of the house-hold chores, inside and out.. and our mini farm of animals. I sincerely enjoy the upkeep (and I’m kinda anal so I like things done a certain way.. heh.)  But now I can’t do diddly squat at home and it makes me angry. I feel useless. I know it’s temporary, but it’s still so hard. If it weren’t for my mom, I’d be lost, and insane.  She’s been my saving grace.. My parents are retired and live 10 miles away, so she’s coming over to clean the house and do the laundry, take care of our animals… and will be our Nanny when I go back to work. We both have amazing parents and we don’t take them for granted. 

My husband and his mom have a little bit of an enmeshed relationship, but we live about an hour from her, and the distance alone made an incredible difference. My husband has been the only consistent, significant male she has had in her life. She is married but I know she relies on my husbands emotional support more than her own’s. During this time in her life, with this challenge she’s been given, I have no right to say negative things about their relationship. I would never dream of saying anything negative. I don’t care that she needs my husband’s emotional support. I don’t care that she calls him crying and says she wants to give up; she has cancer for Pete’s sake. She is a great person and she doesn’t deserve this. But I worry about my husband’s emotional health right now. I worry about him having to handle his mom’s diagnosis and try to juggle what’s going on at home. I know it’s not my fault. I know baby and I are his priorities.. I’m just afraid it will be too much for him. I don’t know how else to help. If I get induced next week.. she’ll be starting her first round of chemo and won’t be able to come. I know that will be hard on my husband. I’m sad for him. I’m afraid for him.

My family is HUGE (paternal grandma had 9 kids!), and unfortunately someone has always been very sick or passing; lung, ovarian, prostate, skin cancer, heart failure, suicide, alzheimers, dementia, old age, etc… I’ve dealt with sickness and death from the ripe age of four. All of my grandparents are gone, many aunts and uncles.. It’s just always been a part of my life and as harsh as it sounds, I’m “used” to it. But my parents are healthy and I’ve never been at risk of losing them. I can’t relate on that level, but I can try my best.

So I don’t talk about how stressful the idea of pre-e is, and being induced is, to me. Or how useless I feel sitting at home, not doing shit, while he’s out there working his ass off and his mom’s dealing with cancer. I don’t tell him I’m afraid because I want to have a vaginal birth and I feel selfish for still wanting to try. I was told I can try, for it but it’s a long process and I know I would be watched carefully, and it would be less tolerated since she is small. And we still don’t know if she’s growing right or not, until Wednesday.. So if she’s not growing as well, I don’t know if vaginal delivery would be taken off the table all together… 

I’ve never been a patient in a hospital. That alone scares me. I’ve had a great control on my anxiety for almost 4 years, but now I find myself fighting off panic attacks during NST’s and ultrasounds, and feeling just so afraid. I sit in the shower and cry, but I know I just have to keep doing what I’m doing. I know life isn’t fair and it’s hard and scary. I don’t believe I shouldn’t have to deal with bad things, any less than anyone else. I just don’t know why these things seem to happen all together or when you feel so helpless.

I don’t know how to help from a couch. I don’t know how to control my own stress from a bed. I want to help. I want to go clean her house. I want to make her cookies. Or mow her yard. Or go to doctors appointments with her. I want to keep everything in perfect order at home, and do our laundry and mop the floors. Play with the dogs. Go for a walk. Get groceries. I don’t want to sit here and be frustrated and afraid, all the while feeling guilty because I know this stress isn’t good for the baby. 

This is just so much, so fast. This is not how I pictured this going, but I know this is part of life and we have to work with what happens to us, and keep keeping on. 

If anyone has had a similar experience to mine, either with pre-e or handling a parents diagnosis at a high-stress time, I’d love to hear what you did to manage it and make it any easier on anyone and yourself.

I sincerely appreciate the time anyone took to read this……. All I have is time, for now, anyway. :) "

66r6jt,17,2017-04-21,"Introduction post? Well, I suck at introductions, but here's one.",Kekistanista,exjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/66r6jt/introduction_post_well_i_suck_at_introductions/,"I guess I should preface this by saying that I'm a long time lurker that hasn't posted much. I think I had an account about two years ago, but I didn't post much on it and I don't think I still have the login details for that account. Still kept lurking, though, and I'm finally getting to making another account.

I decided to do it now because in the coming year or so I'm probably going to have a lot more stuff to post about when it comes to this cult, because this is around the time when the pressure to get baptized starts. Lemme introduce myself first, though.

I'm from the American northeast. I'm not going to say my age, but I will say that I'm just finishing up with school. As for that, it's a little complicated. I did homeschool since I was much younger, and while I once posted on an ex JW site and some people were bothered by that, it's much better than it sounds. My parents originally decided to do homeschooling because of a health thing that I have that would have affected me badly in school, not to indoctrinate me in the religion. In a way, it's just a strange coincidence that I'm homeschooled and my parents are in the b0rg. 

It's been a good experience for me, I wouldn't trade it in for regular school if I had the option. Still, we haven't done things the traditional way, so I'm going to finish school without a degree. That's another red flag to a lot of people, but that's not my main problem by any means, it's not even close to being my main problem. I'm not worried about employment because my family intends to get me job experience with a family business, and I can trust them with that because they already have experience with small business despite being lower middle class and formerly very working class. 

They're smart people, actually, smarter than the majority of the people in my congregation. If it wasn't for the cult, I'm sure they would be much more successful people, even. That's my big problem, but more on that in a bit.

I want to say a little about myself. You can call me K, and like I said, I'm living in the American northeast and still in the religion unfortunately despite being mentally out for at least the last four or five years. One of the reasons why I took so long to get back on this site is because I don't necessarily fit in with this place, or many places for that matter. I'm not an atheist necessarily, I spend more time browsing 4chan than I do browsing Reddit, and I have major political disagreements with a lot of the people here. 

But I've decided to try to get over our differences and see how it goes. If it doesn't go over well then I'll just delete this account and go back to only using Reddit for my sports account while lurking here a bit, but hopefully it doesn't come to that. I also want to mention that my passion, other than one thing that I want to make into my profession that I'll mention another time when I can go into more detail, is writing. I've written hundreds of thousands of words worth of material by now. A big chunk of it from collaborative writing online and a smaller chunk with a goal of publishing. I'm no bestselling author, of course, but I'm at least improving and I plan on chasing a writing career down the line in my other plans don't work out. And about three years after I seriously started writing, I'm a hell of a lot better than I was when I began. 

I'm seriously thinking of writing a screenplay for a TV show about this cult, and I'll keep you guys in the loop about that if I actually decide to do it. It would be fictional, of course, but there would be a clear parallel. Now...

On to my problems and the other stuff I'll be updating you about. I'm doing alright in life but there's still some things that I'm going to have to deal with soon.

1: I managed to duck becoming an unbaptised publisher until now, when I'm in my late teens. Hell, I'm not even one yet, I'm supposed to apply at the end of this month. And secretly I think it's only because my dad is an elder and I believe one of the other elders or servants asked why I'm not a publisher yet. I'm fine with becoming one, but baptism is the next step after that, and I have to figure out a way out of it without admitting my beliefs.

2: I would just tell everyone that this isn't what I believe, but since I still need to move out, and I preferably want to move far away to a more expensive city that isn't as shitty, I don't want to cut myself off from my parents. As much as I hate hiding who I really am, I'm not going to alienate myself from one of the only sources of support that I have. I don't believe they're the type who would kick their kid out of the house for leaving, but I'm going to need their support at least until I move out eventually and get settled on my own somewhere.

3: There's a job that I really want. More in that in a future post where I can go into more detail, but long story short, my mother doesn't think it would be a good idea because I wouldn't have a schedule that lets me be a Witness. I want to try to intern and get job experience in that field and have to figure out how to do this without breaking my act. 

4: I have plenty of friends and no real ones. This is a minor problem right now to be honest, because I try to avoid being shortsighted and I know that I'm not even going to be living here in a few years, but it's frustrating still to have to hang around after meetings and pretend to be friends with JW kids that I would never be friends with if it wasn't for the religion. Especially when we share no common interests and all of the kids are in a quasi clique because they've all went to school with each other since they were babies and I only moved to this place later. 

So, that's about it. This is who I am and the above list is some of the things I'll be updating you about on here. Let's hope this account lasts longer than a few posts, eh?

I wish I’d done different stuff as a teenager (well, I wish I’d been happier, or sad in a more socially acceptable teen-angst way, rather than a mental illness way). And now leaving uni makes me sad because I am so lonely and my expectation of what uni should be like was so different to my reality; I don’t have a best friend at uni, I don’t go on fun nights out or hang out with my housemates. I just sit in my room staring at a gathering pile of work and getting sadder and sadder and more and more lonely. And then what makes it all worse is that by this time next year I’ll be looking back and thinking about all the things I should have done differently, how I could have worked harder or made more friends or had some experiences I’ll always remember other than self-harming badly enough to need stitches, or my flatmates telling me I was impossible to live with. I know I’m impossible to live with. I hate living with myself or as myself or however the fuck you want to word it. 


 I’m crying right now, as quietly as possible, because my new flatmates are not my friends, despite my best efforts. If they heard they’d just ignore it probably, but I’d rather them not hear at all. I spend all my time alone here. Even when I’m home I feel so out of step with people. All my friends are getting academic prizes and job offers and internships. I’ve been rejected for everything I’ve applied for, and my marks at uni are okay but not brilliant. 


 Summer makes me so much sadder than anything else because I wish I’d spent more summers having fun or drinking in the park with my friends or wearing short sleeved t shirts. And summer reminds me of last year, when my housemates and (or so I thought) friends left me out of everything deliberately and maliciously – barbeques and parties and nights out – because it turned out that I wasn’t their friend after all. Because I was depressed and spent too much time in my room, they told me I had to live somewhere else this year. I know I should be fucking over this, because it was a year and a half ago. But I am not. 


 Things that make me sadder are weirdly tempting to look at. Pictures of people I know with their friends, pictures from when they were sixteen and mucking around with their mates in the park or at house parties. My former housemates’ instagrams, snapchat stories and Facebook posts. I can’t stop looking at things that will make me cry even harder and I don’t know why. I am so jealous, I suppose. How pathetic is that? I’m jealous of people who have completely normal lives. I’m jealous of people who went to “worse” universities than I did, people who have big groups of friends for pictures for nights out, people who have fun, people who aren’t covered in horrible horrible scars. 


 Weirdly, I’m now jealous of people with friendships going back years and years because I have those too but it seems other people have them more strongly, or maybe my friends are too busy to see me. I’m jealous of people who can do mundane stuff like play the guitar or get a tattoo or not fucking waste money or who just know what music to listen to and how to dress. I always feel like I’m catching up on everything. 

 This is never going to go away. I can't imagine being happy again. I can't imagine fucking enjoying something without being terrified it's mania. So what's the point in waiting for the next fuckup to happen? Why not just fucking end it all now?

UI is something I've always loved and the day I found it had a name (UI Design) I finally found myself. However, UI doesn't have a direct step by step process in college. It's too upcoming, unlike CSCI today which has a set standard curriculum. 

I'm dying to find the right experience and guidance. 

What internships should I take or avoid?

Where is UI growing? Indiana? California? Where isn't it growing?

What programs should I learn? What shouldn't I? 

What coding languages?

I'm currently majoring in Digital Media and minoring in Computer Science. I've learned Javascript, Html/Css/C#/Php, C++ (OOP), Python, Terminal (if that counts).

I can use Ubuntu, Debian, Mac OS X, Windows. 

I've learned Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign. I want to learn Sketch but I heard it's dying out plus it's very expensive. There's no student version, as far as I'm aware.

I live in IN and I really wanna move overseas and work remotely is the long term goal, but I know I'm gonna have to live and save up in the old US of A for now. I'm currently in college and gonna graduate in two years. I feel like I've learned a lot but there's still major things I need to learn my curriculum is missing. So I came here! PLEASE throw me some advice! Is Indiana gonna blow up with UI Design? Should I move elsewhere? "

Im a 22 years old male.I have a moderate stature but i am a bit chubby and i have a belly.Yeah,im awful.Last year completed my IT internship on a private college and they offered me permanent a job there.Of course i said yes.I handle the IT support but i also do numerous other things like data entry,running errands etc.Yeah,its not that bad and i have a way to pay my bills.

Anyway,on my first two months there i met this girl (26 years old) who works as a secretary there.She is also chubby but she enjoys taking care of herself.She always wears make-up and smells good.At the time,she was working on a different floor than me so we didnt talk much,just a random ""Hi"" and some joking around here and there.

Everything changed about 5 months ago.She was transfered on my floor and i see her everyday.Our desks are opposite to each other so i got to know her better.We talk a lot through the day,joking and having a good time.Most of the time she responds with a smile to me,listens to what im saying and laughs at my jokes.

After a while i realised that i had started feeling ""strange"" for her and that i like her and over time i have noticed some ""signs"" that maybe she likes me back.One particular time,she brought her personal laptop in for repair and she had a photo of her and a guy as the user profile pic and she proceeded to tell me right away that thats her brother (i already knew she had a brother).Now why telling somebody that! I mean it's her own laptop,she shouldnt explain me why she has a personal photo with a guy in there.We also tease each other all the time in a fun way.My main concern all this time is that we work together and things could get awkward between us.

So after a long time,i finally decided to make my move tonight.It was a perfect opportunity,because we were only the two of us on the whole building till closing.We had a great time chatting about work and other stuff,we laughed a lot and teased each other a lot as well.As we were walking out,after closing,i noticed that she was walking at he same pace as me and it was like she was waiting for me to do something. I asked her if she had something planned for the night and she said no.I offered her to join me for a walk in the city center,but she politely turned me down,saying that she had to go home.And then she quickly said good night and walked away at a faster pace.

Now what was that??? Did i misinterpret her behavior as signs of her liking me? Please i really need your input on this and some advice about what to do next will be greatly appreciated!"

66tapi,3,2017-04-21,Major crisis in deciding where to attend (X-post /r/Applyingtocollege),college_throwawayyyy,columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/66tapi/major_crisis_in_deciding_where_to_attend_xpost/,"I'll preface this post by saying that I know that I am very fortunate to have been accepted to such selective schools. I understand that I am very privileged in my current position, but I am still experiencing some intense difficulty deciding between my current two top choices: Columbia and Brown.

Let me give some background for the situation I currently find myself in. Columbia has been my dream school for years. Ever since I first began thinking about where I might want to go to college, Columbia has been at the very top of my list. Columbia was the first school I ever visited, and I knew immediately that it was the place I wanted to end up. Taking all this into consideration, I applied ED in the Fall. I was deferred, and I was devastated. I let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and I spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. I remember walking around my house, saying things like ""If I get into any school other than Columbia, I'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" I know all of the Columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. I hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on Columbia for so long.

So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. I was also accepted to some other schools on March 30, including Brown. Up until this point, I had never visited Brown's campus, and I still had my heart set on Columbia, but I was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

Fast forward to Columbia's admitted students event: ""Days on Campus,"" which was held on April 9th and 10th. This was the first time that I had ever visited Columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times I had always visited over the summer months. While all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, I felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. This belief of mine was confirmed by looking at Columbia's Yik Yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""Prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""All these prefrosh are making me late to class."" Overall, I felt like I was not welcomed by most of students at Columbia, who made it abundantly clear that I was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. I experienced some of what I had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of Columbia. After attending Columbia's Days on Campus, I feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. Days on Campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. Dean Valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the Dean of Admissions, Jessica Marinaccio. I felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

Beyond this, I wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. Sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between Columbia and Harvard, but would probably just end up choosing Harvard. It seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that I had never really been exposed to before. There was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that I was, quite frankly, appalled by. I have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. I am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. Yet, despite my own privilege in life, I couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at Days on Campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. Since being accepted to college, I have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether I truly belong at such an amazing place. Yet, many of the prospies that I encountered at Columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. I met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. As a prospective math major, I felt inferior to these students, when I myself had struggled through Calculus BC. It made me question whether I wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because I was already so far behind many of the other students.

On top of all this, I got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. I heard several students comparing GPAs with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. This actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

&gt;When I see people walking around campus I don’t see much happiness or enthusiasm.

This comment seemed almost naive to me at first when I first read it a couple weeks ago. What do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like Columbia? People there are serious about their studies and have a New York attitude--a certain sense of independence. Yet, looking around Columbia's campus a few weeks ago, I realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. People there certainly seemed ambitious--I overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. Yet, so few of the people I encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that I had dreamed of. And still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful April day. It reminded me of a comment I read on the Columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""Get out while you still can.""

New York City, too was not what I had previously expected. I have been to New York a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. However, on my most recent visit, I got the sense that I had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. I come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. Yet, when I found myself rushing to the subway so I could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of Penn Station so I could get my train back home, I felt what I imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""New York minute."" To be honest, I didn't like it. To me, it seemed as though I was more irritable than ever before. I felt like I had a disregard for other people as I pushed past them toward my final destination. Maybe it was only because I had drank a cup of coffee (something I don't often do), but I felt self-centered in a way that I was acutely aware of and did not necessarily enjoy. I had always assumed that I wanted to live in New York later in life, but I'm not certain such a stark transition would be good for me, and I'm very afraid that the climate of New York would only bring out the worst aspects of my personality, namely anxiety, stress, and a self-centered ego that makes me feel like I am the only important person in the world (I have certainly been guilty of this last one before).

Enter Brown. I attended their admitted students day this past week, A Day on College Hill (ADOCH for short). A Day on College Hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. It is the happiest I have ever been. All of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. From eating in the Ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring Brown's beautiful campus, I absolutely loved it. I really cannot understate how much fun I had. I could really see myself on Brown's campus for the next four years. Brown had almost the exact opposite vibe of Columbia. My room hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful (not that my host at Columbia wasn't), and they went above and beyond to answer any questions I had. My host even took me to one of his classes, and told me about how his professor learned all of the student's names, even though it was a massive intro-level lecture. There was even an option to speak one-on-one with the admissions officer who had read your application. When I went to talk to the officer for my region, she was busy with another student, so I walked away. This lady was so nice that she e-mailed me the next day to meet up with me so that she could talk to me. She knew my name and the details of my entire application, and I felt really personally cared for. In addition, another senior admissions officer texted me personally and asked me if I had any questions and if I was enjoying my stay. When I was talking to that officer, she knew my name and exactly who I was, even though we had never spoken face-to-face before.

In addition, the students at Brown seemed incredibly friendly. One student stopped in the middle of his studying to ask if I had any questions or needed any help. He then walked with me outside to show me where I needed to go. Another student saw that I was confused when looking at a map and again offered to point me in the right direction. I felt welcome and cared for in a way that was 100% not the case at Columbia. The sense of elitism from Columbia was also not present on campus. All of the other prefrosh seemed genuinely interested in hearing each other's opinions and listening to what they were passionate about.

Many other students at ADOCH that were choosing between Columbia and Brown felt much the same way as I did. I spoke to two other people who both were choosing Brown over Columbia. One of these people goes to the high school in the county over from mine, and was almost as dead-set on Columbia as I was before attending ADOCH. Another girl I talked to seemed surprised when I said I was considering Columbia over Brown: ""But everyone is so laid-back and friendly here,"" she remarked, and I must admit she had a point. My host's roommate was also super chill, and honestly one of the coolest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet in my entire life. He said that a year ago, when he was deciding on a college, he was choosing between the University of Chicago (which, like Columbia is known for its stress culture and poor mental health) and Brown. He said he was so unbelievably happy he had chosen Brown, and that all of his friends were glad they did too.

In addition, I also was convinced of the effectiveness of the open curriculum at Brown, compared to Columbia's core. I had always been a fan of the Core curriculum, because it would give me the chance to learn about the great works that make up western civilization. I have always wanted to be well-versed in high culture, and attending Columbia would allow me to achieve this. I also have been enamoured with the Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses, where I could learn about all the philosophy without having to take formal philosophy courses. I have always loved philosophy, and Columbia would offer me this sort of easy accessibility to great western works. While visiting Brown, however, I was convinced that the open curriculum is not without its own merits. I am not entirely certain that I want to pursue a degree in mathematics (I also have interests in stats, computer science, and economics--though I am wary of selling out to Wall Street). At Brown, I could perhaps pursue these interests to a greater degree, simply because I would have more time and freedom.

This all being said, there are a few problems I have with choosing Brown over Columbia.

I recognize that much of the reason why I am making this post is because I am still in love with Columbia. I have a massive issue with confirmation bias, and I am mostly making this post because I want someone to tell me that my fears are unfounded, and that I shouldn't focus so much on the intangible aspects of choosing a college. Instead, I should just be happy attending the school that has been the object of my dreams for years: ""the greatest university in the greatest city in the world.""

In addition, I am a little concerned that all of this worry over the choice of college is a manifestation of my own self-defeating tendencies. I am simply afraid that I won't be able to cut it at Columbia, and so I am filling myself with doubt so that I will attend Brown, where the students at the very least seem happy with their choice. There, I will still be challenged and have the smug superiority of having attended an ivy league university, but I will be in a more hospitable and accepting environment. This reflects one of the comments I heard at ADOCH this past week: ""Think about where you want to be when you are stressed out and need help. Brown provides a community... unlike some other schools."" This comment seemed specifically tailored to me.

Another problem is the sense of regret. If I attend Brown, I know I will regret not going to Columbia, which has been my dream for years. Instead of facing the stress of the big city and a major university, I know I will feel as though I simply avoided the issue instead of trying to deal with it (even though this feeling seems irrational and unfounded).

Prestige is another issue. Both these schools are ivies, so this literally doesn't matter, and I recognize this. Still, there's something that really just gets me deep down when I can say that I was accepted to the third most selective college in the nation. I get the same feeling when I think about saying to someone later in life, ""Oh, I went to school in New York"" or ""I had an ivy league education."" Something about being an ivy league new yorker makes you feel on top of the world and that's a difficult emotion to give up, even if it is irrational.

I am also wary of basing my entire decision off of three days of my life. Is the accepted students day really representative of what life in college is going to be like? I am so inexperienced and know so little about what it is truly like to be independent in college, that it is impossible for me to even tell. ADOCH was certainly fun, but is it worth changing my entire life trajectory over a single event? I don't think so, even now.

On a more concrete basis, I'm not entirely certain what to think about the pure math department at Brown. While Brown does have the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. That being said, I am not certain exactly which side of math I would like to pursue. Yet, I am afraid that I may be pushed closer to the applied side at Brown, simply because their applied department is stronger. In contrast, my childhood hero Brian Greene is a professor in the math department at Columbia. While I am under no illusion that I would be spending time with Dr. Greene, I still think it would be really awesome to attend the same college that he works at.

I am also very interested in getting involved with the radio station wherever I go to college. I absolutely love listening to NPR, and both Brown and Columbia have had alumni go to NPR (including Ira Glass and Robert Siegel, respectively). Yet, the future of Brown's radio station has recently been called into question, as they are considering selling it. Though it does not look like the motion to sell will pass, it is something I am considering, as Columbia's radio station seems to be just as strong if not stronger than Brown's.

In addition, I would like to join marching band in college, especially since it was one of the activities I most enjoyed during high school. Both the Brown and the Columbia bands are similar--they have a ""scramble"" format--but Columbia's band also does Orgo Night, a beloved night of comedy the evening before the Orgo Chem final. I am interested in writing comedy and feel like this might be a good outlet for me to explore that interest. Several members of the marching band at Columbia even live in a suite together. Perhaps this would bring me the sense of community that I so desperately desire at such a faceless institution.

To complicate matters, there's an element of this entire issue that I haven't even discussed yet. I also got into the University of Pennsylvania, and now I feel like I never gave it a fair shake in this entire process. After having visited both Penn and Columbia before, I had decided that given a choice between the two, I would choose Columbia. I was so confident in this decision that I did not even attend Penn's accepted students day, and with ten days remaining before I have to commit, it seems like there is little chance that I will be able to visit any of these schools before deciding. Yet, I cannot help but feel that since I seem to have misjudged both Columbia and Brown, could I not have done the same thing to Penn? It always seemed to me that the choice between Penn and Columbia was obvious--a choice merely between New York and Philly. Both excellent institutions with similar student bodies and similar goals, just different locations. Now, however, I have come to realize the importance of intangible aspects of universities at a time that seems almost too late. Would I have preferred the social aspect of Penn, as it is known as the social ivy? I might never know, and that is a difficult truth for me to face. I am used to having complete information when making a decision, but it appears that this simply is impossible in my current situation.

And now, let me arrive at the crux of the entire scenario I currently find myself in. The single greatest issue that is making this decision difficult for me. The main reason why I am using a throwaway account to make this post right now. I met this really cute girl while I was visiting Brown.

I realize that this is the single stupidest thing ever. But we really hit it off, and I can't help but think that it made my entire visit to Providence seem way better than it actually was. I don't want this to define where I go for the next four years, and I need to make sure that it won't. I have worked so hard for years, and I can't let this stupid crush change the way I live the rest of my fucking life.

So, please help me reddit. I have relied on this subreddit heavily in the past, and I need your guidance now more than ever. The agony of this decision is killing me. I would like to thank you if you made it to the end of this post, because I realize that I have rambled on for quite a bit longer than I was originally expecting. But, I felt it was important for me to parse all of my thoughts out, and it seems only fair to give you the entire background of my story.

Any advice at all is appreciated."

I know you get tons of posts like this, and I have wadded through a few but I still feel I have a few questions about commuting. I am a late-20s Canadian female moving to St. Paul for the summer. I won't have a car but I will need to commute. I was working on trying to figure out some ways to get from my billet to my internship. 

I'll be living in Union Park/Merriam Park East (Near the intersection of Snelling Ave and Marshall Ave) and I will need to get to Roseville. I was hoping to get a bike and just ride everyday. However, my internship was concerned about me riding at night. Somedays my job might go late after the sun has set. Should I be concerned about riding at night? Besides getting hit by a car should I be concerned about things like theft &amp; assault? While I am from a very large city in Canada these things just don't really happen here and I feel comfortable riding in any part of the city at any time of day. Sorry if its a completely stupid question - I've lived in places where personal safety is a must and because of that I just like to make sure I check around before doing something stupid in a new city. 

Google says the ride should take about 30-40 min which seems reasonable to me and the ride suggest to cut through Como Park (the one with the lake - but you guys know that)...What is the safety like in that park? Would you recommend that I ride through there early or later at night? 

Are there any festivals that are a must? I really like street festivals, food festivals, or community type events.

Finally, how late do busses run? Do different routes stop at different times?

Thanks everyone for your help, I am really looking forward to exploring and living in your city for the summer!

I understand that I am very privileged in my current position, but I am still experiencing some intense difficulty deciding between my current two top choices: Columbia and Brown.

Let me give some background for the situation I currently find myself in. Columbia has been my dream school for years. Ever since I first began thinking about where I might want to go to college, Columbia has been at the very top of my list. Columbia was the first school I ever visited, and I knew immediately that it was the place I wanted to end up. Taking all this into consideration, I applied ED in the Fall. I was deferred, and I was devastated. I let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and I spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. I remember walking around my house, saying things like ""If I get into any school other than Columbia, I'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" I know all of the Columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. I hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on Columbia for so long.

So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. I was also accepted to some other schools on March 30, including Brown. Up until this point, I had never visited Brown's campus, and I still had my heart set on Columbia, but I was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

Fast forward to Columbia's admitted students event: ""Days on Campus,"" which was held on April 9th and 10th. This was the first time that I had ever visited Columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times I had always visited over the summer months. While all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, I felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. This belief of mine was confirmed by looking at Columbia's Yik Yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""Prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""All these prefrosh are making me late to class."" Overall, I felt like I was not welcomed by most of students at Columbia, who made it abundantly clear that I was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. I experienced some of what I had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of Columbia. After attending Columbia's Days on Campus, I feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. Days on Campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. Dean Valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the Dean of Admissions, Jessica Marinaccio. I felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

Beyond this, I wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. Sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between Columbia and Harvard, but would probably just end up choosing Harvard. It seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that I had never really been exposed to before. There was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that I was, quite frankly, appalled by. I have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. I am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. Yet, despite my own privilege in life, I couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at Days on Campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. Since being accepted to college, I have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether I truly belong at such an amazing place. Yet, many of the prospies that I encountered at Columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. I met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. As a prospective math major, I felt inferior to these students, when I myself had struggled through Calculus BC. It made me question whether I wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because I was already so far behind many of the other students.

On top of all this, I got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. I heard several students comparing GPAs with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. This actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

&gt;When I see people walking around campus I don’t see much happiness or enthusiasm.

This comment seemed almost naive to me at first when I first read it a couple weeks ago. What do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like Columbia? People there are serious about their studies and have a New York attitude--a certain sense of independence. Yet, looking around Columbia's campus a few weeks ago, I realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. People there certainly seemed ambitious--I overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. Yet, so few of the people I encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that I had dreamed of. And still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful April day. It reminded me of a comment I read on the Columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""Get out while you still can.""

New York City, too was not what I had previously expected. I have been to New York a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. However, on my most recent visit, I got the sense that I had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. I come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. Yet, when I found myself rushing to the subway so I could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of Penn Station so I could get my train back home, I felt what I imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""New York minute.""

Enter Brown. I attended their admitted students day this past week, A Day on College Hill (ADOCH for short). A Day on College Hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. It is the happiest I have ever been. All of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. From eating in the Ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring Brown's beautiful campus, I absolutely loved it. I really cannot understate how much fun I had.

I was deferred, and I was devastated. I let the college admissions process affect my own self-esteem far too much, and I spiraled into a bit of depression and anxiety that made it difficult me to do schoolwork or talk to my friends. I remember walking around my house, saying things like ""If I get into any school other than Columbia, I'll try to transfer after my freshman year."" I know all of the Columbia promotional material by heart and can recite it essentially verbatim. I hope this shows exactly how hard my heart was set on Columbia for so long.

So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic when I was fortunate enough to have been accepted to the class of 2021 during the regular decision round. I was also accepted to some other schools on March 30, including Brown. Up until this point, I had never visited Brown's campus, and I still had my heart set on Columbia, but I was pleasantly surprised to have the option.

Fast forward to Columbia's admitted students event: ""Days on Campus,"" which was held on April 9th and 10th. This was the first time that I had ever visited Columbia's campus while there were undergraduate students present--the other times I had always visited over the summer months. While all of the admissions officers and student volunteers seemed friendly, I felt as though the general student body held a general disdain for the prospies on campus. This belief of mine was confirmed by looking at Columbia's Yik Yak that day: several comments had been made along the lines of ""Prefrosh should jump off a roof"" and ""All these prefrosh are making me late to class."" Overall, I felt like I was not welcomed by most of students at Columbia, who made it abundantly clear that I was at the very bottom of the totem pole at a major institution with little regard for your individual troubles. I experienced some of what I had only read about before, and never quite understood: the bureaucracy of Columbia. After attending Columbia's Days on Campus, I feel like the word ""bureaucracy"" seems like a perfect fit for what the administration is like. Days on Campus seemed like a formality, accepting the next class of students into the whirring machine of advanced higher education that would spit out our generation's pushers and movers--but little else. Dean Valentini (who seems like a very nice man) gave a speech, as did the Dean of Admissions, Jessica Marinaccio. I felt that the staffers and organizers were doing the best they could, but it was difficult not to feel as though the entire event and the university as a whole was somewhat impersonal.

Beyond this, I wasn't entirely thrilled by the attitudes of some of the other prefrosh. Sure, there were plenty of nice people there, but there were also lots of students who seemed like they were just bragging about how they were trying to choose between Columbia and Harvard, but would probably just end up choosing Harvard. It seemed like a lot of the other people who attended the event went to private school (which isn't necessarily bad), but they brought with them a sense of prep school elitism that I had never really been exposed to before. There was an overwhelming sense of entitlement among many of the prospies that I was, quite frankly, appalled by. I have been fortunate enough in life to not experience hardship. I am thankful to have loving parents, teachers who care about me, and lots of friends who support me. Yet, despite my own privilege in life, I couldn't help but feel that many of the kids at Days on Campus were in a different stratosphere of wealth and were far more self-assured about their right to have a place at such an elite institution. Since being accepted to college, I have suffered to a certain extent from imposter syndrome, questioning whether I truly belong at such an amazing place. Yet, many of the prospies that I encountered at Columbia did not appear to feel similarly, and it honestly seemed like they had been afforded every blessing in life. I met kids who went to some prep schools, and had already mastered multivariable calculus and linear algebra before even entering college. As a prospective math major, I felt inferior to these students, when I myself had struggled through Calculus BC. It made me question whether I wouldn't be discouraged from attempting to pursue a math degree, because I was already so far behind many of the other students.

On top of all this, I got the overwhelming sense that the student population really was as stressed as people online reported. I heard several students comparing GPAs with each other, the general student did not seem overly happy. This actually reminded me of [a post from this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/63mj5v/columbia_university_a_student_perspective/), which made a similar comment:

&gt;When I see people walking around campus I don’t see much happiness or enthusiasm.

This comment seemed almost naive to me at first when I first read it a couple weeks ago. What do you honestly expect out of the student body of a top-ranked institution like Columbia? People there are serious about their studies and have a New York attitude--a certain sense of independence. Yet, looking around Columbia's campus a few weeks ago, I realized just how accurate this sentiment really is. People there certainly seemed ambitious--I overheard many a conversation about the latest internship or job offer. Yet, so few of the people I encountered seemed like they had the spark of passion in a subject that I had dreamed of. And still fewer seemed like they were actually enjoying themselves on such a beautiful April day. It reminded me of a comment I read on the Columbia subreddit a couple months ago, in response to someone who posted about recently being accepted: ""Get out while you still can.""

New York City, too was not what I had previously expected. I have been to New York a handful of times, always in awe of the buildings and culture there that is known the world over. However, on my most recent visit, I got the sense that I had never perceived before, of being entirely overwhelmed. I come from a very small town, where the pace is comparatively slow. Yet, when I found myself rushing to the subway so I could quickly get downtown to the hectic hellhole of Penn Station so I could get my train back home, I felt what I imagine is the hustle and bustle of a ""New York minute."" To be honest, I didn't like it. To me, it seemed as though I was more irritable than ever before. I felt like I had a disregard for other people as I pushed past them toward my final destination. Maybe it was only because I had drank a cup of coffee (something I don't often do), but I felt self-centered in a way that I was acutely aware of and did not necessarily enjoy. I had always assumed that I wanted to live in New York later in life, but I'm not certain such a stark transition would be good for me, and I'm very afraid that the climate of New York would only bring out the worst aspects of my personality, namely anxiety, stress, and a self-centered ego that makes me feel like I am the only important person in the world (I have certainly been guilty of this last one before).

Enter Brown. I attended their admitted students day this past week, A Day on College Hill (ADOCH for short). A Day on College Hill was literally the **best** three days of my entire life. It is the happiest I have ever been. All of the activities that they had us do were so much fun. From eating in the Ratty to going to the bookstore to check out all the cool merchandise to exploring Brown's beautiful campus, I absolutely loved it. I really cannot understate how much fun I had. I could really see myself on Brown's campus for the next four years. Brown had almost the exact opposite vibe of Columbia. My room hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful (not that my host at Columbia wasn't), and they went above and beyond to answer any questions I had. My host even took me to one of his classes, and told me about how his professor learned all of the student's names, even though it was a massive intro-level lecture. There was even an option to speak one-on-one with the admissions officer who had read your application. When I went to talk to the officer for my region, she was busy with another student, so I walked away. This lady was so nice that she e-mailed me the next day to meet up with me so that she could talk to me. She knew my name and the details of my entire application, and I felt really personally cared for. In addition, another senior admissions officer texted me personally and asked me if I had any questions and if I was enjoying my stay. When I was talking to that officer, she knew my name and exactly who I was, even though we had never spoken face-to-face before.

In addition, the students at Brown seemed incredibly friendly. One student stopped in the middle of his studying to ask if I had any questions or needed any help. He then walked with me outside to show me where I needed to go. Another student saw that I was confused when looking at a map and again offered to point me in the right direction. I felt welcome and cared for in a way that was 100% not the case at Columbia. The sense of elitism from Columbia was also not present on campus. All of the other prefrosh seemed genuinely interested in hearing each other's opinions and listening to what they were passionate about.

Many other students at ADOCH that were choosing between Columbia and Brown felt much the same way as I did. I spoke to two other people who both were choosing Brown over Columbia. One of these people goes to the high school in the county over from mine, and was almost as dead-set on Columbia as I was before attending ADOCH. Another girl I talked to seemed surprised when I said I was considering Columbia over Brown: ""But everyone is so laid-back and friendly here,"" she remarked, and I must admit she had a point. My host's roommate was also super chill, and honestly one of the coolest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet in my entire life. He said that a year ago, when he was deciding on a college, he was choosing between the University of Chicago (which, like Columbia is known for its stress culture and poor mental health) and Brown. He said he was so unbelievably happy he had chosen Brown, and that all of his friends were glad they did too.

In addition, I also was convinced of the effectiveness of the open curriculum at Brown, compared to Columbia's core. I had always been a fan of the Core curriculum, because it would give me the chance to learn about the great works that make up western civilization. I have always wanted to be well-versed in high culture, and attending Columbia would allow me to achieve this. I also have been enamoured with the Contemporary Civilizations and Literature Humanities courses, where I could learn about all the philosophy without having to take formal philosophy courses. I have always loved philosophy, and Columbia would offer me this sort of easy accessibility to great western works. While visiting Brown, however, I was convinced that the open curriculum is not without its own merits. I am not entirely certain that I want to pursue a degree in mathematics (I also have interests in stats, computer science, and economics--though I am wary of selling out to Wall Street). At Brown, I could perhaps pursue these interests to a greater degree, simply because I would have more time and freedom.

This all being said, there are a few problems I have with choosing Brown over Columbia.

I recognize that much of the reason why I am making this post is because I am still in love with Columbia. I have a massive issue with confirmation bias, and I am mostly making this post because I want someone to tell me that my fears are unfounded, and that I shouldn't focus so much on the intangible aspects of choosing a college. Instead, I should just be happy attending the school that has been the object of my dreams for years: ""the greatest university in the greatest city in the world.""

In addition, I am a little concerned that all of this worry over the choice of college is a manifestation of my own self-defeating tendencies. I am simply afraid that I won't be able to cut it at Columbia, and so I am filling myself with doubt so that I will attend Brown, where the students at the very least seem happy with their choice. There, I will still be challenged and have the smug superiority of having attended an ivy league university, but I will be in a more hospitable and accepting environment. This reflects one of the comments I heard at ADOCH this past week: ""Think about where you want to be when you are stressed out and need help. Brown provides a community... unlike some other schools."" This comment seemed specifically tailored to me.

Another problem is the sense of regret. If I attend Brown, I know I will regret not going to Columbia, which has been my dream for years. Instead of facing the stress of the big city and a major university, I know I will feel as though I simply avoided the issue instead of trying to deal with it (even though this feeling seems irrational and unfounded).

Prestige is another issue. Both these schools are ivies, so this literally doesn't matter, and I recognize this. Still, there's something that really just gets me deep down when I can say that I was accepted to the third most selective college in the nation. I get the same feeling when I think about saying to someone later in life, ""Oh, I went to school in New York"" or ""I had an ivy league education."" Something about being an ivy league new yorker makes you feel on top of the world and that's a difficult emotion to give up, even if it is irrational.

I am also wary of basing my entire decision off of three days of my life. Is the accepted students day really representative of what life in college is going to be like? I am so inexperienced and know so little about what it is truly like to be independent in college, that it is impossible for me to even tell. ADOCH was certainly fun, but is it worth changing my entire life trajectory over a single event? I don't think so, even now.

On a more concrete basis, I'm not entirely certain what to think about the pure math department at Brown. While Brown does have the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM), my host said that the professors in the pure math department for undergraduates were not the best. Instead, Brown has a very strong focus on applied math rather than pure math. That being said, I am not certain exactly which side of math I would like to pursue. Yet, I am afraid that I may be pushed closer to the applied side at Brown, simply because their applied department is stronger. In contrast, my childhood hero Brian Greene is a professor in the math department at Columbia. While I am under no illusion that I would be spending time with Dr. Greene, I still think it would be really awesome to attend the same college that he works at.

I am also very interested in getting involved with the radio station wherever I go to college. I absolutely love listening to NPR, and both Brown and Columbia have had alumni go to NPR (including Ira Glass and Robert Siegel, respectively). Yet, the future of Brown's radio station has recently been called into question, as they are considering selling it. Though it does not look like the motion to sell will pass, it is something I am considering, as Columbia's radio station seems to be just as strong if not stronger than Brown's.

In addition, I would like to join marching band in college, especially since it was one of the activities I most enjoyed during high school. Both the Brown and the Columbia bands are similar--they have a ""scramble"" format--but Columbia's band also does Orgo Night, a beloved night of comedy the evening before the Orgo Chem final. I am interested in writing comedy and feel like this might be a good outlet for me to explore that interest. Several members of the marching band at Columbia even live in a suite together. Perhaps this would bring me the sense of community that I so desperately desire at such a faceless institution.

To complicate matters, there's an element of this entire issue that I haven't even discussed yet. I also got into the University of Pennsylvania, and now I feel like I never gave it a fair shake in this entire process. After having visited both Penn and Columbia before, I had decided that given a choice between the two, I would choose Columbia. I was so confident in this decision that I did not even attend Penn's accepted students day, and with ten days remaining before I have to commit, it seems like there is little chance that I will be able to visit any of these schools before deciding. Yet, I cannot help but feel that since I seem to have misjudged both Columbia and Brown, could I not have done the same thing to Penn? It always seemed to me that the choice between Penn and Columbia was obvious--a choice merely between New York and Philly. Both excellent institutions with similar student bodies and similar goals, just different locations. Now, however, I have come to realize the importance of intangible aspects of universities at a time that seems almost too late. Would I have preferred the social aspect of Penn, as it is known as the social ivy? I might never know, and that is a difficult truth for me to face. I am used to having complete information when making a decision, but it appears that this simply is impossible in my current situation.

And now, let me arrive at the crux of the entire scenario I currently find myself in. The single greatest issue that is making this decision difficult for me. The main reason why I am using a throwaway account to make this post right now. I met this really cute girl while I was visiting Brown.

I realize that this is the single stupidest thing ever. But we really hit it off, and I can't help but think that it made my entire visit to Providence seem way better than it actually was. I don't want this to define where I go for the next four years, and I need to make sure that it won't. I have worked so hard for years, and I can't let this stupid crush change the way I live the rest of my fucking life.

So, please help me reddit. I have relied on this subreddit heavily in the past, and I need your guidance now more than ever. The agony of this decision is killing me. I would like to thank you if you made it to the end of this post, because I realize that I have rambled on for quite a bit longer than I was originally expecting. But, I felt it was important for me to parse all of my thoughts out, and it seems only fair to give you the entire background of my story.

Any advice at all is appreciated."

I have been telling myself I am not that bad for a long time now but today I am finally realizing that I wan to be dead and I might actually be dead if I was not so tired all the freaking time. So I need help, I am that bad. 

My questions:

*How and where do I get help?

*How much is this going to cost? I can't afford a lot.

*Is this going to ruin my future? I am going to college in the fall and I have a job and an internship to apply to. Will I be disqualified for all of this because I am like this?

My fear is that I will go through all of this ""getting help"" and spend money I don't have, ruin my entire future, and terrify my parents just to find out that I am fine. The doctors or whoever will say that this is normal and I was over reacting.

Any answers you can give would be so appreciated. "
66tufj,1,2017-04-21,[M4F] - A Week in the Life of an Intern,joecalla,joecalla,https://www.reddit.com/r/joecalla/comments/66tufj/m4f_a_week_in_the_life_of_an_intern/,"**Monday**  
I pondered, on the way to your office Monday afternoon, what would make you summon me. I think ""summon"" is the right word when an executive requests the immediate presence of a lowly intern without warning. It was only my third week, and I needed to check the wall map outside the elevators to even find your office.

I couldn't guess what you wanted when you closed the door behind me. I didn't take the hint when you told me to sit in your chair, or when you looked into my blue-grey eyes with amused certainty. I thought, somehow, that it was  some embarrassing mistake when you sat on the edge of the desk and shifted so that I could clearly see your red panties peaking out beneath the hem of your black pencil skirt.. I was innocent, far too innocent, 96 hours ago.

It was thirty minutes later when, on the way back down in the elevator, I finally began to process what had happened. I could still taste your cum on my lips, could still feel your fingers pulling at my short hair as you held my mouth to your pink womanhood. I had to check my watch to realize how long it had been, my sense of time and space lost as I tongued and sucked on your pussy until, with a playful shove at my forehead, you instructed me to get back to my desk.

**Tuesday**  
My Tuesday passed in tense silence as I sat at my desk and struggled to concentrate on my work. Thoughts of you kept intruding on my efforts at a comprehensive competitive analysis of my assigned market segment, until at 6PM I finally gave up on the thought of you calling me back to your office. *Was it all a dream?* I wondered to myself, until my phone buzzed on the way to the elevator. Five minutes later I was in your office, gritting my teeth to avoid withering under your intimidating gaze.

I couldn't say ""no"" to you,  and not just because of your position at the company. It was the look in your eyes. At your command, I withdrew my hard-on, solid and throbbing with the energy of youth. You looked on with an amused smirk as I stroked myself in front of you, fingers curling around turgid flesh slick with pre-cum, until I came on command onto the shiny hardwood of your desk. And then you sent me on my way, as though I'd delivered a report on the Asian markets that you wouldn't have time to review until tomorrow.

**Wednesday**  
There was no waiting on Wednesday; you were in my office when I arrived at work. I'd come in early to get some work done, to lay low, but you were there. Like you knew my schedule before I did.

I could see the confidence in your gaze as you lifted your dress up above your waist and leaned over my desk, your bare ass framed by a pair of garters. I could hear that confidence in your voice when told me to get to work. Ashamed as I might have been to admit it, I'd been aching to taste you again since Monday, and I moaned in pleasure as my tongue slid through your sex from behind. I remember the bemused look in your eye a moment later when you looked back at me and shook your head disapprovingly. You didn't correct me with words, simply pulled my face into your ass and pressed my lips to your tight anus.

I licked until you moaned, until I felt your ass hole clench around my probing tongue as you came. I tried to pull back then, but you explained with word and body that I wasn’t done, that I wasn't to stop rimming my boss' boss' boss until I was told to stop.

It wasn't even 9AM when you left me, somehow looking put together while my cheeks were red and coated in the juices you'd made me lick from your thighs when I was done.

**Thursday**  
Thursday's lunch-time lesson was a new one; you called it a ""reward"" for my good service the day before. I got no work done all afternoon, not with the picture of your eyes smiling up at me as your lips were wrapped around my manhood. I came hard, harder than any other time I remember, until drops of cum dripped from the corners of your smiling mouth and my balls ached with emptiness.

I felt suspicion from everyone on your floor as I returned to my office downstairs, as though they could all tell I'd just been blown by the Marketing VP.

**Friday**  
And now it's Friday, 6PM. The elevator beeps as it arrives on 24, your floor. The office is quiet now, late on a Friday. Only a few unrecognized stragglers spot me as I make my way to your office, and I can almost see them forgetting me as they pass me in the hall, their minds focused on tonight's plan or this weekend's upcoming adventure. My mind can't even focus that far out.

I knock on your door, and hear a ""Come in, Josh,"" from within in a voice that's still not particularly familiar; we haven't spent a lot of time talking so far.

I take a deep breath, reach for the knob, reach down instead and adjust my hard-on to make my arousal less obvious, then take the knob and push open the door."
66u5re,7,2017-04-22,(19/F) My manager (28/M) is hitting on me. What should I do?,DramaticChipSinger,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/66u5re/19f_my_manager_28m_is_hitting_on_me_what_should_i/,"So I've been working with this company for just under a year now, and while I started as an entry level employee I have moved up to trainer and supervisor, and have potential to become an assistant to the managers within the next little while. There's this one manager that works there, and me and him get along really well, and have for as long as I've worked there. He did my interview and we clicked from there. Now I'm naturally a flirty person, and sometimes I don't even notice I'm flirting until after the fact, so I'm worried at some point I gave this guy the wrong idea. I really like working with him, and we have really good conversations. But he's said things like ""You're very necessary"" ""Are you happy with the moments we share?"" ""I know you're not innocent"" ""You're amazing, this is why we love you"" and has also asked me for my shirt size in the past, as well as will take any opportunity he can to spend time alone with me and will spend more time doing pre-shifts and check ins with me than he will with other people. Once he called an entire meeting to address one concern I had, that wasn't even that big of a deal and only concerned one other person. He even told me that he only called the meeting because I was the one with the concern. And I also found out he got fired from his previous job for asking an under-aged intern if she was a virgin. He is also engaged to someone, who I've meet and she seems like a very nice women. Rumors have also started saying I only got promoted because I'm secretly with him and he was on the board that decided who got the promotion, and I got it over people who had been there longer, even though my other managers have assured me it's because of my experience outside work, strong performance at work and dedication to the company. What should I do? I really love my job and the company, and when he's not being creepy he's a great guy who I like being with, but when he gets too close I feel uncomfortable. Am I over thinking this? Are the things he's said to me really that bad? Should I report this? I'm really unsure of what to do. 

TL;DR Manager is flirting with me, he has a sketchy past, rumors have started about us and I don't know what to do.

66v1xf,1,2017-04-22,[M4F] the ultraviolet catastrophe,dorkgeeknerd,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/66v1xf/m4f_the_ultraviolet_catastrophe/,"In 1989, just as the Berlin Wall was falling, you were born in Volgograd, Russia to a prostitute mother and an unknown father.  Days after you were born, still latched to your mother's breast, a local gang raided the apartment complex where you lived, and your mother was killed trying to protect you.  Three days later, you were found by police, malnourished and dehydrated.  A nice policeman tried to take you home, but the rules had to be observed, and Russia's state orphanage system swallowed you whole.

If your mother realized what it would of been like to grow up those orphanages, she might of thought twice about saving your life.  You grew up ruthless, trusting no one.  You learned to fight dirty, and then smart.  School was easy and boring.  Boys (and sometimes girls) always seemed to take an interest in you, but most came away with the sense that you were damaged goods and not worth the trouble.  You tended to agree with them, which is why you were so caught off guard when a man in his 50s approached you.  He was wearing one of the nicest coats you had ever seen, and glasses that seemed to square what was a rounded and watchful face.  His name was Dimitri, and he was the man that recruited you into the KGB.  You had just turned 14.

It's 15 years later, and now you live in America.  Only you know what happened to you, why you came to America, what your mission is, and what it would mean if you succeed.  You've been in the US for over six years with zero trace of a Russian accent.  I certainly didn't hear it when you approached me on the street, asking if I dropped my wallet.  I could of sworn I had just put it in my coat pocket, but there you were, with this sly smile as if to say ""if you don't want it, I can just keep it"".  I bought you coffee, and we've been meeting each other for lunch once a week for the past month.  I like you, I might even have a crush on you, but that's because I think you are just an intern who graduated from Uchicago with a PhD in physics.  It's true, you really did get the degree, but what I don't know is that you could also kill me 200 different ways with your just your bare hands.  As a scientist at Fermi National Laboratories, I have access to more then just the cows that graze above the super collider (I do enjoy reading scientific papers in the pasture).  My unique skill set keeps me busy with a steady-stream of top secret work and little room for a social life.  In other words, a target.

I'm whistling to myself, I'm about to get ready for our first date.  I finally nutted up and asked you out, admitting over a mouth full of steak bomb that I'm god's gift to billiards.  You took the bait, friday was ear marked, and now I'm looking pretty sharp as I hop in my black dodge diplomat, clutching my iphone with your address plugged in.  As I head towards Aurora, Liz Phair starts to play on the stereo and my mind drifts to sex.  I think about how I specifically did not bring condoms with me.  It's not that I would turn down the chance to get laid tonight (lord knows, it's been a while), I'm just not that kind of guy who would make that assumption.  Ironic, since you rarely leave you house without at least two weapons strapped to yourself, tightly concealed.  As the final notes of chopsticks played, I pulled up in front of your house, a cheap rental that looks like a planck's constant above student housing.  I walk up to your front door and tap on the door bell.  Sure, I'm a little sex crazed, but holy shit, I was not prepared for your outfit.  I mean, I'm not a bad looking guy, I just like to dress comfortably (ie. tshirts and jeans).  At work, you always dressed professionally which did nothing to either highlight or obscure your body.  But the outfit you had on tonight pulled no punches.  It was simple, a black cocktail dress, a necklace, hair nicely braided and shiny, black flats.  It wasn't that your outfit was spectacular, it was you.  The way you filled your dress, the cut of the fabric, the tone of your muscle.  As I felt the bottom drop out of my cock, I stood there breathless for a second, swallowed, and then said ""Jesus christ, if you can catch me this off guard with a dress, you are probably going to wipe the floor with me at pool tonight, right Sabina?""  That was your name, or at least the name everyone knew you by.  Sabina Watson.  All you did was smile that same sly smile, locked your front door, and walked towards my car.

66v6t7,6,2017-04-22,How realistic does this plan sound? (studying),lallybee,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/66v6t7/how_realistic_does_this_plan_sound_studying/,"I've been really bad over the last 5 or so weeks, spending days in bed feeling miserable or continuously crying all day so I can't focus at all or do anything. I've let my university know, and they've waved the possibility that I might be able to retake some exams in August rather than May (not usually allowed)- although this isn't guaranteed. I have six exams starting on the 17th May. I have a 6 week internship in July that I really need to get better for so that I can get the job that comes afterwards (I do not want this stupid crying to ruin my entire life). So, I've seen the doctor, I've emailed to get counselling, I'm going to do everything in my power to get myself out of this. 

How realistic is the plan?-
At my university we have- 2 weeks revision, 3 weeks of exams, 3 weeks of fun, then the summer break. 

If I focus on taking three out of the six exams in may, and really force myself at it for the next two weeks, and then take 3 exams in august, I can spend the ""3 weeks of fun"" in the library every day 6 days a week doing 3 lectures worth of studying per day (each lecture takes about 3 hours to learn, especially at the moment with my difficulty concentrating, so that's 9 hours per day), then I have a week off (my boyfriend's father has paid for a holiday, I really want to try to improve before that so I can actually enjoy it and not just pretend to), then I have this 6 week internship. For the internship, I would spend 2-3 hours at the end of each working day studying for the august exams, and then 9 hours on a saturday or sunday. I'm staying a 10 minute walk from the office, so I don't have any time wasted on a commute. Then, when the internship is over, I take the next three exams in august. 

I'm really trying to sort my shit out here because I do not want this stupid crying to ruin my life. How realistic does all of this sound?

I thought I was keeping up, but apparently my housework hasn't been thorough enough. It's almost impossible to find an affordable apartment in this town, even harder this time of year near campus. 

My safe space has been completely shattered. My comfort in knowing where I would be and what I would be doing for the next 13 months is just gone. 
I was doing so well, going back to college, looking into internships.... Now I'm so fucked...

My very first thought was wondering if I should clean a knife before using it on my wrists. I never used to think like that. 

I'm just so tired of getting setback constantly. For once I'd just love for everything to go my way and for life to just fucking cooperate."

Well that was until last week.   Right now I am on a break from school, I received an internship with a pharmaceutical company that is based out of a small town in Northern California.   So I moved to this town about a month ago, everyone seems so nice.

It was last week when I went to the dentist for a routine cleaning, after he finished I was laying there staring at the ceiling when I hear the sound of a zipper.  I turned to see him pull out his big thick cock.  He turned my head to the side as he proceeded to slide his cock past my lips.   I wanted to scream, I wanted to run, instead I just wrapped my lips around his cock, sucking as he fucked my mouth.    When he finished he walked out and the assistant  came in and wiped away the spilt cum like it was business as usual.    The next day I was heading home from work when the local sheriff pulled me over.  He had me get out and lean against the car.   As he was patting me down when I realized he was undoing my pants.  There along the roadside he had me over the hood of my car pounding away at my ass, and again I just laid there.

But it didn't stop there it was my boss, the mailman,...heck over the past week I must have fucked and sucked off at least a dozen guys.   

I would love to play out what is next, maybe you have a scene that comes to mine you would like to share?  Just looking for a nice stimulating way to start my day.."
66vrtl,2,2017-04-22,"How could one fix a ""rigged"" system",JaxDaxter,ukpolitics,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/66vrtl/how_could_one_fix_a_rigged_system/,"After Dawn Butler and Mike Kane failed to say how the system was rigged or how they would fix it in their respective interviews with Radio 4 and Sky News I thought I'd give it a shot.

**Voting Reform** - It is clear to me that the current voting system does not [work](http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/sites/default/files/files/publication/2015%20General%20Election%20Report%20web.pdf). With people going away from the primary 2 parties we need a different voting system. The current FPTP system means that voting intentions is not represented in seats in the commons. I would personally advocate for STV. I believe this would be good for the country. It would mean that voters would feel their vote would matter more and might therefore be more engaged when voting. It might also mean more co-operation between parties.

**Unpaid Internships** - [Social mobility](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/state-of-the-nation-report-on-social-mobility-in-great-britain) is clearly a problem with certain professions, including MPs made up disproportionately with people from middle-upper class. One method to curb this would be to stop unpaid internships for those not in school. If people are expected to go weeks without pay they usually have to rely on other sources of income, usually parents. I would force firms to pay at least the minimum wage and limit the length of them to a month. For those still in school I would allow firms to give them an unpaid internship capped a month but they would have to pay for travel and food expenses.

The two above shouldn't really cost anything. The next do involve money so would be trickier to enact with the future fairly uncertain.

**Housing** - With [people](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/16/tenants-in-england-spend-half-their-pay-on-rent) at times spending 72% of their income on housing their is clearly something wrong. This, to me, is simply a case of to much demand and too little supply. [This article](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21716639-following-white-paper-there-have-been-around-200-housing-initiatives-2010-britains) shows that the new white paper does some things right such as forcing councils to build more houses or else the government will take control and curbing ""land banking"". Also [making buy to let less attractive](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/22/buy-to-let-slump-first-time-buyers-drivers-seat-lenders-loans-landlords) also seems to having an effect. I personally think things need to go further. As the Economist article says I would encourage older couples to move into a smaller house to make way for growing families and open up more land to build upon, though this would have to be properly overseen. Finally, to stop housing from becoming an investment, I would tax people who own houses which are unoccupied for more than 1/2 of the year unless the owner has a clear intention to sell.

**Legal Costs** - One of the things the Tories have done is make it more costly to take your employer to a tribunal by cutting legal aid and raising the cost of simply going to a tribunal. To me this disproportionately affects the poor and as [this article](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21719825-charging-employees-bring-employment-tribunalseven-if-they-winerodes-their-legal) shows that the governments claim of less frivolous claims is not true as the proportion of claims that have been dismissed or struck out since 2012-13 have doubled.

**NHS** - Similar to us committing 0.7% of foreign aid and 3% on defence I think it would be a good idea for a government to commit to spending 8% on NHS. [As you can see](http://visual.ons.gov.uk/how-does-uk-healthcare-spending-compare-internationally/) relative the to the rest of the G7 the UK spends less on health than others. Whilst in some ways higher spending does not mean better results I believe that as well their being increased demand due to an aging population the supply needs to meet it. Other things should be done so patients are caught so they don't need to be admitted into hospital and social care needs to be improved so patients do not spend excess time in hospital due to not being able to be discharged.

Sorry if this is a bit shit. It is quite infuriating when a party I broadly support is unable to come up with any ways to improve the ""rigged"" system. And this is all just off the top of my head.

Also as you can see I haven't mentioned Brexit and this is because I think Labour is not only in a tricky position, with some of its working class supporters voting out and some of its other supporters voting remain, but also because it has, in my view, done the worst of both worlds which is to not really say whether it is for remain or exit."

This is my first time hosting one of these, and I’m really excited to have this opportunity. I’ll be here between 12pm and 1:30pm EST to answer any questions your may have about the NFL, the upcoming draft, my draft guide, writing experiences and anything else you can think of. 

For some background, I began my career looking to get into scouting, majoring in Sport Management in undergrad and interning with Optimum Scouting and working with the football departments at both Ashland University and the University of Houston. As I learned more about the industry, gained some contacts and actually negotiated a scouting internship with a team, I found that working in the league as a scout wasn’t nearly as attractive as it seems on the outside. In the meantime, I was offered a draft writing role in early 2014 with Bleacher Report, and that eventually led to covering the Miami Dolphins in 2014 through summer 2015. Then I was promoted to my current role, and was fortunate enough to be a part of the NFL1000 project, grading cornerbacks every week. I also host a weekly podcast called The Pod, where my co-host Oscar Hazell and I discuss the Dolphins’ latest adventures.

As for the aforementioned draft guide, it is my second guide in the last three years. I included 202 players, horizontal player rankings and scheme fits for contextual information that other guides on the market lack. It is $7 and I’m donating half of the proceeds to my favorite charity, CurePSP. You can buy the draft guide at draftcentric.weebly.com, or take advantage of the 10-page sampler available on the same page to see if it’s a good fit for you.

Okay, let’s go!

Edit: Alright guys, it's 1:38 ET now. I had a blast doing this, thank you again! If you continue to post questions, I'll revisit every few hours to respond. "

66wzw0,7,2017-04-22,Is This Plan Sound For Planning For Grad Schoool (Budget Review)?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/66wzw0/is_this_plan_sound_for_planning_for_grad_schoool/,"Hi!

Using a throwaway because other account is linked to me


I am currently 22 and finishing undergrad and I am starting a full-time job this summer. The pay is about 95K + bonus + overtime. **Realistically, I can make about 115K this year and about 140k next year** (with huge upwards mobility after that). However, in order to advance in this field/my office to reach engagement manager, I will have to get an MBA. 

Given the small size of the firm, it is highly unlikely that they will pay for my MBA (but they will cover test prep/application fees/give me unlimited PTO to interview and tour). Thankfully, my generous parents said that they will cover half the total cost of grad school. Even though they will pay half, I will still be on the hook for 75k/80k.

**Current positions:
**

5k in Vanguard brokerage account

10k in savings/checking (going down to 7k after my post-grad trip)

4k in a 401k (internship match)


1k in Venmo (currently transferring to bank). 

Total ~ 20k. 


*Next year:* 



Category| Cost| Notes
---|---|----
Rent| 1500|  Signed lease (NYC/Boston/DC/SF)
Utilities| 150| estimate
Food/going out| 600| (expensive long term gf but food is free on weekdays
Cell phone| 50 | text
Clothes| 400| have to build up wardrobe quickly, will drop over time
Transit| 200| train pass +ubers ---   No car (selling it and will get 5k cash to me)
Health/life/dental Insurance| 0| text
401k Savings| 550 (to get full 5% match)| match is basically I pay 6%, they pay 5%
loans| 0| text
Travel | 250| average


Total expenses (ignoring tax benefits of 401k): 3700

total month per month post taxes 1st year assuming meh bonus: 6000
Non-retirement savings per month: 2300

2300*12 = 27600 1st year
If I go to grad school in 3 years, I think I will able to reach the goal. 



What I want to know is this:

1.  Is this budget realistic? I've never tracked my expenses before (yes I do pay for a few things in college - food, all fun money, travel, car,  books, clothes)
2. What vehicle should I save in? Should I open a 529?

3. is a 10k cash cushion ample for an emergency fund?

4. How much should I give to charity my first year?

5. is adding about 1k a month to my 401k enough? Should I be doing more?

6. Is there anything that I should be doing?


Thanks and sorry about how long this is!

Eli and I met two months ago. He's officially been my boyfriend for a month. We're both students. I leave in 3 weeks, for a 3-6 month internship on the opposite coast. I get back in either September or January, depending on if I can find a fall internship in our state.

I brought up yesterday that I wanted to stick it our for the summer. He waffled a bit, saying that he definitely wanted to be in a relationship with me on the other side of the summer, but that we should talk about what happens this summer when we aren't both exhausted. I agreed with that, but it's weighing on me now.

What if Eli wants to ""pause"" our relationship for the summer? I don't think I can do that. I know a long distance relationship will be different from what we have right now. It would suck to only see him in person once for the summer, and otherwise be able to see and hear him via skype but not touch or smell or taste him, but it would suck more to not even have that much. How could we possibly just jump back into things when I get back if we haven't talked in 3-6 months?

If we decide to go no contact while I'm gone, but stay exclusive, then what is it except an extremely unfulfilling, cold relationship for those months? If we decide to pause, but not stay exclusive, there's no way I could date knowing that Eli will be there when I get home, and it would break my heart if he dated or hooked up with someone while I was away. And it scares me that he might think that the right response to ""this is going to be hard"" could be ""push it away until it isn't a problem any more,"" especially because I'm graduating next spring and we may be in the same place in 12 months making the same decision.

I'm probably overthinking this. We haven't even had a full conversation about this yet - that's on Tuesday. For all I know, he does want to try to stay together over the summer and just didn't want us to make that decision while we were tired and short on time. It's just that this is my first relationship, it's going well, we're communicating fairly well, and I don't want to lose this because of work.

-----
What should we be talking about on Tuesday when we have this conversation? What should we be considering? What should I be asking and saying? Help please?

66y7j3,8,2017-04-22,Really long story about my life and depression as a 20 year old college student,Brightlampshades,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/66y7j3/really_long_story_about_my_life_and_depression_as/,"Only two weeks left until the end of the semester, and I can't seem to find my motivation. I lost it somewhere in the realms of my existence. I am not sure where my depression came from, it is likely i have been this way my entire life and have not noticed. When I was little, I would not talk and as I grew to the age of 9, I was inappropriately touched by my mothers husband. When I told my mom, she told my school, and a conflict arose. I was required to see a therapist, I told her all he did was come in at night, and grope my butt sexually. I would not speak anymore, and my mothers husband became a drunk, shortly thereafter she kicked him out of the house. I was confused because I didn't hate him, I just felt uncomfortable, and I felt sad that I caused them to break up. As I moved into my preteen years, I was always conscious about my wright because my mom realized that I was gaining weight and I loved to eat. She met a new guy and her fiance was bipolar, in which there was nothing wrong with that. Yet he was also abuse and would tell her she gained weight since they met. He was around for three years until she kicked him out. During my high school years I was rebellious, I met this cute boy and I was his first kiss. I snuck out of my house to see him because he wouldn't see me any other time. He asked me to suck his dick as we were sitting in his living room at 2 AM. I said no, I have never done it and dont want to ( I was 14). He kept persuading me, telling me he would tell no one and just to try it come on just try it. He took it out and kept repeating himself. Had I been in this situation at this age I would have left with my dignity by then. But I was 14 and did not know, so I tried it, which was my fault , I stopped but when I did he pushed my head in even further and so I was scared and kept going. Afterwards, I felt insecure and scared and I wanted him to comfort me, but instead he told me I had to leave. I ran home alone in the middle of the dark night, and I come to find out the next day he told everyone he knew. I would walk in the hallways of the school while guys would say ""SUCK MY BALLS suck my balls"" in my face. Throughout high school I was insecure and not popular, I remember asking one of th popular girls if I could go to her party everyone was talking about and she told me there wasn't enough space. I managed to get a boyfriend at the age of 16, he was a real smarty pants in the ""science"" track. In which I applied to be in and was denied. 6 months later I was so in love with him only to find out he cheated on me. The worst part was I was willing to stay with him, yet he broke up with me. It was heart breaking and I didn't handle it well. I found that playing field hockey helped a bit because of the required running which release neurotransmitters and increase in brain circuit activity, so when I was 17, I reached out to learn guitar. I took lessons that were unprofessional by this guy who was 2 years older than me and went to my same high school. We ended up texting a lot and eventually became very close friends. One thing led to another and then I was with him. Even though we were together my senior year of high school, I gained so much weight (30 pounds) and was very depressed. I started to develop panic attacks. I felt insecure because I didn't try to succeed in high school, and I didn't graduate with honors and I wanted to be in the science field. I ended up graduating high school with a 3.3 GPA, and my SAT scores were event sadder, in which I wont even post. I went to a college that was 4 hours away because my mother wanted me to go to a private school, and they gave me the best scholarship deal. I went in as a biology major but ended up finding a passion for chemistry. I had the worst roommate ever and she would bring guys over and have sex with them while she thought I was sleeping. She told me to move out of the room once I confronted her and I would not move out of the room for her convenience. She told me she has friends and goes out with them, a 4.0 GPA, on the USA volleyball team, and all of this wonderful stuff about her while we were arguing. She said she hated me, and that she wanted me out. I lived with that tension for the next 14 weeks of the spring semester and I dealt with it by running every single day. I left that school with a 3.9 GPA and I transferred closer to home so that if anything were to happen, I could have the comfort of my own home close by. I am not allowed to commute from home. 
The change in universities was very hard, there is less academic support here and I am drowning in difficult courses. This will be the first semester in which I will get a C in a few of my classes. I feel as though I am depressed, I was put on zoloft 25 mg by a psychiatrist nurse here and prescribed xanax for my panic attacks. I see therapy here for two semesters now by an intern and she is wonderful. But overall, I found myself with C's in many of my classes and maybe a B in chemistry, my favorite subject which I usually gain A's with no doubt. I have delusions of me hanging from a rope in the corner of a room, or me jumping off of the building as I'm walking to class. I have urges to open the car door while on the parkway and just let myself go. I still have my boyfriend, the guitarist, he does his own thing though and he somewhat helps me. I feel like an inconvenience, my mother is already disappointed from my school grades this semester. She is also disappointed because I am taking the medication when she claims that she doesn't believe in medicine. I have a lot of anxiety and I can't focus on any of my work although I care so deeply about it. How can someone care so much about something and fucking fail at it? I stopped running in which I used to have a passion for. I feel worthless and useless and like I am not living up to the person I want to be. My GPA from this semester could ruin my chances of getting this scholarship I was going to apply for. and as a biochemistry major, what jobs are there out in the job market anyway? Unless I am one of the elite science majors with high grades who get into amazing masters programs. I definitely dont want to go to medical school even though my mother wants me to. I have a 3.75 GPA right now but that will shortly be ruined. Im in ruins and I really can't take it. If you read this far, thank you. "

I apologize if I've been a bit repetitive lately, but this prompt took a *long* time to write, and I think it can be adapted to pretty much any whim and desire. Ask and ye shall probably receive. I also don't expect you to match the length and detail of this prompt. This was developed over quite a long time with a bit of thought. Roleplay responses simply cannot receive that kind of attention without going stale.

Anyway, the classic prompt is still open for heads of Research and Development that are feeling particularly involved and hands on, but I've got another idea for those who can't sustain the creative flood that prompt requires. I've been toying with the concept of loosened sexual taboos and a near-religious obsession with impregnation and breeding, so I decided to expand on the old Facility prompt and bring in the full-blown Olympus Corporation.

Olympus is involved in everything from military technology to sports events and maintains state of the art genetic and reproductive research facilities, so it is in a unique position in this fertility-obsessed world. In this world, celebrities rarely maintain their status without a baby bump. Championship sports teams and Olympic athletes are taken out of circulation for a breeding season, ensuring that their genes are studied and passed on. Prom photos are passed around like drugs if an eighteen-year-old is sporting a baby bump from the Facility.

Here's the catch, and also the reason: human fertility is way down. Fertile women are extremely rare due to a virus that nearly destroyed the human population, leaving only just enough people to return to a semblance of normalcy. Society is recovering, but it won't make it if this generation doesn't breed like mad. And that is where Olympus comes in.

Because of the obsession with impregnation, people have found ways to have fun with it. Mass competitions are staged, using sports or board games as a medium, in which the quality of the genetic partner is increased with final standing. In chess, early losers in the tournament are inseminated with a run-of-the-mill jock, but the winner receives a genius-level match and public acclaim. In sports like boxing, a similar structure holds. Furthermore, there are televised PR and recruiting events for those interested in working at the broadcast center, as well as interesting and exciting gameshows like ""Who Wants to Be a Mother?"" ""The Genes Are Right,"" and ""Whose Sperm Is It, Anyway?"" (Okay, maybe it's not that goofy. I just liked the wordplay.)

Of course, there are also the Baby Bashes for those who would like to spend the money. Loud, outrageous affairs with music, lights, and goop from broken glowsticks everywhere. The drinks are laced with fertility agents, and the quality of the ticket depends on a pre-approval screening process to determine genetic fitness. Colorful wristbands and collars are distributed to mark ticket quality, and the VIP rooms are only open to silver or above. Of course, lower tickets can't breed their way up the food chain, but higher tickets may pick a partner up to two levels lower. Special arrangements can be made for dates or serious relationships. Olympus corporation is looking to hire event staff to answer questions at the parties, demonstrate the equipment, and act as little Venuses to encourage good pairing. Partygoers should look up to the event staff as their goal in attending a Baby Bash.

Into the middle of this dives the Olympus Corporation. Flush with money earned from contracts supplied during the Gene Wars, in which many countries fought over fertile women, Olympus wields its mighty treasury to be the corporate... good guys? Run by a former mechanized infantry trooper whose helix was destroyed by weaponized viruses before he slowly pieced it back together in a lab, James Maddock works to restore the human population through gene therapy and research. A bit of a recluse, he isn't particularly comfortable with the wild and crazy services his company offers, but they are the most effective method for saving the human race. I'm sure you've heard about the quiet tycoon, and that's why you're applying for...

What was it you were applying for, again?

----

Clicking open an application, I am presented the medical records of a beautiful woman. Sitting up in my chair, and my pants, I begin to read the profile more closely. Your lack of major injuries (or maybe your astonishing recovery from such injuries) and impressive physical fitness are immediately apparent, as well as your record of eyebrow-raisingly high fertility. Your records also contain no indication of genetically inherited diseases, and you seem to be immaculately blessed in terms of DNA. Furthermore, your research experience is impressive and truly fascinating. Your prospects as the new Director of Research and Development are incredibly exciting, but a concerned frown crosses my face when I realize the ""Reason For Application"" section has been left blank.

Rubbing my face in exasperation, I realize I have no idea whether the inquiry was sent in regards to our insemination equipment, the BYOS program, a full application to our breeding program, or if you just wanted a tour. Hell, I didn't even know if I received your records by accident! These damn interns, this could be a serious violation of privacy. However, I shrug my shoulders and realized that if this blows up, it's actually the fault of whatever summer hire the doctor's office was using.

Walking out on a limb, I open drawers in my desk to prepare a comprehensive recruitment package. Considering I don't actually know what you may or may not have applied to, I toss everything in. In goes our standard Live Audition pamphlet, detailing our success in gene therapy treatments as well as our insemination consultations. This is followed by the Special Services booklet, a more technical document with high-quality illustrations depicting women strapped into the high tech equipment designed to replace a conventional father. Finally, I add our Research and Development memo, detailing our current research into eliminating genetic diseases. I also toss in a other essentials: a DNA cheek swab for testing genetic potential, a smartwatch with comprehensive physiological monitoring sensors, a combined pregnancy test and fertility monitoring device designed at the Facility that gives results moments after insertion into the vagina with a smartphone connection (we call it the Swiss Army Dildo, because the Facility R&amp;D staff is immature. Go nuts with this thing, as it can be hilarious), and a roll of cute, brightly colored temporary tattoos loudly proclaiming ""I Bred Today!"" ""Baby On Board!"" ""Brand New Mamma!"" ""No Vacancies"" ""Space For Rent"" ""Wide Loads Welcome"" “Genetic Cocktail” and other other slogans that loudly proclaim your passion for pregnancy, need for seed, and all-around fecundity of spirit.

Too preoccupied about which intern was going to be fried if this became a lawsuit, I failed to realize that nowhere in the package was it explicitly stated that any applicant that accepted an interview would be impregnated as a part of the interview. In fact, the call from R and D to ""Help produce genetic samples of individuals clean of or especially resistant to disease,"" could easily be interpreted as a simple swab instead of using the applicant's womb to create the samples, which were actually fully developed human beings. We had a few of those samples playing in the Daycare as I prepared the package, so I thought nothing of it. In fact, the recruitment package was riddled with this kind of ambiguous mistake.

These damn interns...

66ykho,10,2017-04-22,How can I [24F] help my best friend [27F] whose mom is dying of stage 4 breast cancer?,dontwantkids123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/66ykho/how_can_i_24f_help_my_best_friend_27f_whose_mom/,"Hi everyone, 

So Jess is probably my closest friend and she's even been my temporary roommate since she needed to be closer to her internship. 

Unfortunately, her mom has been fighting cancer for awhile. She had it probably a decade ago and, after chemo, was cancer free for about 8 years. It came back with a vengeance and has spread to her lungs. Recently, she had to have the fluid drained from her lungs and that did not even really help her as she still cannot take deep breaths. 

My friend just told me she just found out her mom has to start chemotherapy again next week. That is not a good sign. She was on hormone therapy but apparently it stopped working and they put her on another one but tumors were growing. 

I doubt she has much longer to live... and Jess is really close with her mom. It's so sad, her mom is such a sweet person and still pretty young (in her fifties). 

I really cannot imagine what Jess is going through and about to go through... my mom is my best friend and even the thought of losing her makes me tear up. And now Jess is going to be without her mom for the rest of her life. It's terrible. 

Jess's dad is a good guy -- but very stoic and clearly tries to suppress/hide emotions. Recently, he got into a car accident when someone pulled out in front of him and that person is now on life support, which has been really hard on him and the family. Also, Jess's mom's mother passed away less than a month ago. So Jess's family has been going through a really rough time and it doesn't look like things are getting better. 

How can I help? What can I do? I don't even know what to say... Jess tries to focus on other things such as school and work and her relationship... but I know soon her mother's impending death will probably take over her life and I know she's super upset and worried, even though she doesn't always show it. 

I've never had a close friend lose a parent. I'm not sure how to support her... I just feel really bad for her and I don't know what to do.

I swear they have fucking interns writing code.


Lumia 950 running 15063.138. I did upgrade to existing Redstone 1 install. Had been on the 15063.138 build for a week or so. Last night the phone wasn't updating tiles, had been up for 4 days. This issue has happened since I bought this phone, tiles just stop updating. Mail kept showing the same message as new both in the tile and on lock screen, it wasn't new. 

Reboot the phone, did soft reset to bounce it. Comes back up, all my exchange accounts, one corp imap, and Gmail account are gone. The only account is Microsoft account. Go into messaging and only TWO texts are there, I text alot. How the fuck that happens idk. I did see Outlook mail and calendar were update yesterday. Messaging was updated a week ago.

And the cherry on top, autobackups weren't running even though it was selected. So, I had one I made manually a week ago. In the end I lost a week of text.


What a fucking piece of shit. Until they can build reliable software, fuck this platform. Let it die. I'm seriously dumbfounded with how this shit is so unstable.

Microsoft put a bullet in Mobile since you're incompetent.

66z1ci,2,2017-04-22,I think I'm ready to admit I need help...,drainedrunner,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/66z1ci/i_think_im_ready_to_admit_i_need_help/,"Sorry in advance for a long, meandering, disjointed post and hoping to not come across in some sort of wrong way...

But yeah, like the title mentions, I think I'm ready to accept that I have some sort of mental issue and that it's something I can't keep fighting on my own, at least in the ways I have already been doing so. More often than not (and even more so in the past couple of days), my mind is endlessly racing with thoughts that and I'm losing the battle in trying to contain them. I constantly feel distraught, tense, and drained of energy. I can hardly fall asleep, and even after I wake up after doing so, I still feel exhausted. It's like something's constantly applying pressure on my state-of-being and I'm at the point where I can't keep denying that I'm okay. At the same time, I don't know how to improve my wellness. And all of this is taking an extra toll on me, since I'm trying to pick my life back together (which I'll explain more). I don't know if it's depression, anxiety, or something else altogether, but I feel some sort of need to tell someone about it.

To start with, I'm a 20-year old deadbeat (which really hurts to admit). I don't have a job and am not going to school, while living with my parents futilely trying to distract myself from the reality around me. I graduated high school in 2014 in a rather competitive high school program in my state (with relatively high grades even, without mentioning specifics), but felt extremely burned out by the time college application time started and ended up neglecting to do so at all. (I'm not sure if this is one of the roots causing my problems, or if this the effect of some underlying issue I suffered even then?) But anyways, I just felt extremely unmotivated by the time the rest of my peers were beginning to think about where they wanted to attend university, especially with some getting scholarships to Harvard, MIT, NYU, and etc. I don't know why either, especially since my teachers saw me with similar trajectories as them. Not to toot my own horn, but I was seen as quite diligent and maintained a very strong work ethic when it came to assignments and tests. A couple of my teachers even went to the effort of asking to write letters of recommendation letters for me, as opposed to me asking them, but yeah... My guidance counselor tried to reach out to help me, but in a combination of me not feeling comfortable speaking to her/ constant feeling of being judged around her, I went out of my way to ignore her. I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up (and even now still somewhat unsure) and I guess a part of me back then didn't want to make any decision at all. 

At my high school program, students enroll in one of five academies that focus on different career branches. Largely in part of my parents' influence (who I'll get into more later), I was a part of the Bio-Medicine academy. I had no problem with it and attended all of my classes, but by 11th grade I knew this wasn't something I wanted to continue doing in college and in a career, but felt pressure from my parents to pursue that career path. Both of them are first generation immigrants from the Philippines who both sacrificed a lot to enter the country and become fully-fledged citizens, and both hold jobs in the medical field. It's not directly apparent, but even though they claim to be alright with whatever career choice I want to pursue, I still feel some underlying judgement whenever I brought up what I was interested at the time (and still now, maybe, I think?), which was art. Granted I realize that being an artist is a career that is tricky to make sustainable, and now would probably put on the back burner while focusing on a more stable career path, but at the time I was extremely passionate about my art (which I wish i could say now...). 

I'm going to jump from topic to topic very suddenly, but I'm just going off from what I'm thinking about, but my relationship with my parents is very... well there's a relationship. It's definitely not a strained relationship, since I interact with my parents on a daily basis living with them, but at the same time it's not one I can say there's much substance to or one I'm proud to have. I've already briefly some of my feelings towards them, but in general I feel very averse to opening up to them for some reason. It's probably mostly an issue on my end, but there's just something about me or them (or both) that prevents me from feeling comfortable to express how I'm feeling with them. It's a hard to explain situation. I feel like I'm always being judged by them, but I know that they care for me. But at the same time, it doesn't feel like they care for me at all. The situations are different with my mom and my dad, but with both there's definitely not a healthy conversation. (Again, I really hope I'm not coming across in some wrong way. I respect and appreciate everything that both of my parents have done and will do for me and try my best to meet their standards/keep them happy, but it's sometimes very hard to feel their appreciation and respect back, even though I know they do to some extent).

Starting with my dad, he's very stoic and stand-offish. I don't want to go to the extent of describing him as closed-in, but it is difficult to get a word to him, let alone having open conversation. Even till now I have a hard time reading him. Again not trying to put a label on him, but he often comes across as disapproving, which prevent me from fully opening up to him. I know he cares and concerns for me, but a lot of the time it's hard to feel that he indeed does. I'm always trying to engage with him, but it seems like he rarely reciprocates these attempts, but it's definitely possible there's something that I'm projecting that prevents him from doing so. I don't know... Like there are times when we get along well, but in many of those cases it isn't a matter of our relationship growing, but stagnating with no form of progress.

With my mom... it's a little bit more complicated. Out of my parents she's clearly the more outwardly compassionate and assertive one. I have more interactions with her on a daily basis, but a lot of the times our conversations are very surface. I generally feel more comfortable around her and have previously attempted multiple times to open up to her about my feeling and having serious conversations about them, but many of them have only resulted in myself becoming more wound up in my head. Often times in conversations where I try to admit my perceived feelings of lack of emotional support from her and try to work things out, she turns on this passive-aggressive side that really messes with my emotional state. I don't want to get into it too much at this point (as it's a little hard to speak about), but it always seems to regress our relationship and dissuades me from confiding to her in the future. A lot of it is tough to explain... but I know she loves me and I think she shows that I love her, but it's... yeah. 

I didn't mention this earlier, but I also have a younger sister who's attending school off-state, but there's not much to say there. Our relationship had been pretty good and I felt somewhat comfortable confiding with her, but at the moment feel closed-off from her after her recently betraying trust I've had with her. I'm not at the point where I'm really ready to open up conversation with her, neither did she make any attempts to mend the trust that she broken. But honestly that is one of the last things on my mind these days.

Outside family, I unfortunately can't say I have a strong support group, if any at all. Since graduation I haven't necessarily cut off conversations with friends/acquaintances from school, but stopped putting effort to start conversation. If others reached out to me I'd have no problem engaging, but I had difficulties making the first move. At some point, all conversations ended... I still have a bunch of their contact numbers still and once in a while consider trying to re-connect, but have never gotten the ""courage"" (for the lack of better word I want to use) to do so. Seeing how they're doing on social media hurts as well, seeing how everyone's been growing and achieving and realizing that I've been doing fuck all for three years. Even if I did want to reach out, I wouldn't know what to say and how to explain myself. And the thing is, I don't consider myself as socially anxious/awkward (but I might be in denial?). I refer to myself as an introvert, but I rarely have problems in social/public situations (at least in my knowledge). I enjoy going to cities/conventions and meeting and talking to strangers. As an orator for church mass I have no problems speaking in front of a large group of people. Yet I have a problem re-opening up to people I've had previous relationships with. I also have a group of family friends that I still keep rapport with, but even those relationships are surface at best.

I didn't know when it would be best to bring this up, but I'm also gay (and in the closet). Yeah... I don't know how much this has to contribute to my mental turmoil (which is probably more than I'd like to admit), but I've never come out to anyone and and not entirely sure why. Being gay is something I don't think I need to hide, nor something I needed to announce. It's a weird situation I don't know how to describe fully, but the best thing I can think of is ""I'm in the closet, but the door's open and the lights are turned on."" I think I don't want people's perceptions/judgements of me to change once I came out, and for me to be reduced to ""the gay person"" to those in my life. I'd casually come out if the situations calls for it, but it's not something I'm going to actively seek out to do, especially since I'm not looking for a romantic/sexual relationship at the moment. 

Anyways, since high school I've been distracting myself in various ways in attempts to repress my feelings of self-disappointment, doubt, apathy, etc. For a short while I've held a job position in NYC from a previous tech internship I had during high school. I run/jog and work out on a (mostly) regular basis. Usually it's a very fulfilling activity to stop my head from rushing with thoughts and get fresh air, but as of late sometimes even it can't help against the pressures I'm feeling. I tried to uphold my passion for art I've previously had, but I hate to say it's all but extinguished at the moment. I've had temporary periods of inspiration to complete artistic goals for myself, but my former excitement to create has never been fully re-kindled. For the sake of being frugal and not wanting to spend too much money, I rarely treat myself out and try not to go on trips or shopping unnecessarily. I always tell family and friends not to buy me presents for birthdays and holidays, as I don't want them wasting money on me. Unsurprisingly, another way I distract myself is with TV, video games, books, longboarding, etc., and discussing these things on reddit threads. 

As of late though, I'm trying to put myself back together and started the process to apply to a community college with classes starting in fall (and possibly get a job for the time being). I've grown sick of sitting around of idling around and I want to get back to ""life"". At the same time though, I highly doubt it will be that simple with my headspace still not in the right place. I hadn't mentioned this yet, but the intensity of my depression, anxiety, whatever it is(?) varies by quite a bit. On most days it's something I can keep in the back of my mind, but gradually it grows until it reaches a point where I can't handle it anymore and I experience a nervous breakdown/attack. It has happened only three or four notable times, and they've all occurred within the past year. Most times I've worked through it on my own, but once was happened upon my mom when it occurred. It's never been something we've formally addressed to each other, and frankly I don't know how to (along with all of the problems I'm feeling). It gets brushed off to the side as I ""reset"" myself to a functional state and continue this cycle. 

I've never resorted to self-destruction of any sort and hope to never do so. It's something I'm ashamed I have previously ""casually"" considered, but I've thought about it enough to realize the damage it does not only to myself, but to everyone involved in my life, whether I want it to or not. Whether I can continue rationally thinking myself out of self-destruction is something I hope I can do, but I want to improve myself to the point where I don't even have to worry about that. I want to get help, but I'm not sure how to do so and somewhat afraid to. I've never taken any prescription drugs (or drugs overall), and I don't want to end up dependent on one in order to live my life. 

At this point I'm rambling and I don't know how coherent I'm being, but thanks to whoever reads this. Just writing this post has helped calm my mind. I hope that admitting my problems like this can provide the first step to well-being.

66zcjn,9,2017-04-22,Interviewing for jobs. Looking for advice [bit of a rant],pre_interview_freako,Python,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/66zcjn/interviewing_for_jobs_looking_for_advice_bit_of_a/,"The situation: 

I finally started applying to positions at new jobs and I'm having a bit of a freakout.  I'm looking for some advice/reassurance if you can spare any. 

Me: 

Self taught programmer. First job ~3 years ago began as an internship and ended up as mostly basic maintenance-type Angular and CSS work. Lasted 1 year.  After a short break from coding professionally (about a year) I ended up in a data analysis role.  Taught myself Python and the Pandas/Numpy/Scipy library.  Recently I made a functional but unimpressive Django site to display some projects I was working on.  

I've started applying for Python related jobs because I'm looking to move into a more development centric role.  I've got 2 that I'm about to go into coding tests for and I've got a bad case of imposter syndrome.  They called for full stack devs, and well...I've done front and back end, I've set up a server, I guess that's me? Somehow it doesn't feel right though.

The freakout:

The one that's really worrying me is coming up this week.  They told me there would be something algorithmic and non-language-specific to solve (I really wish I had a CS background) and then pair programming where would build up an API from scratch. I've never created an API before.  I've never modified and API before.  I've consume plenty of other people's but so what? I've also never done pair programming before (although I'm actually really looking forward to it)

I've spent the day working out a rudimentary Django Rest API for my site (luckily they also use Django Rest) but so far it's read only and I haven't touched authentication.  

The questions: 

1. Is this normal, is building an API something that everyone has done?
2. Am I looking at jobs that are beyond my experience level? Do I need to take it back a notch? Coming at this as a self-taught programmer, and one that never worked for a big company/team, I can't tell if I'm actually any good at this or just hackey enthusiast who dips his toes in a lot of things.

I was wondering if there are any EE or EE/CS majors who are willing to share their experiences at Hopkins. I saw the department is very small, and am concerned with how much attention is given to EE students, internship opportunities, and job placements. Anyone have any experience and willing to share?"

It was only used for about 5-6 weeks and is in damn near pristine condition. I kept all the contents and can be packaged back up in the box with the initial padding and USB cable, as shown in the pictures. There's also a picture up close of the keys to show how well maintained they are.

Upon reading Colorado’s educational requirements under rule 2.4 to sit for the CPA exam, I had a question about this paragraph about approved courses. The paragraph entails the following:

""21 semester hours of accounting courses, excluding introductory accounting
courses, covering subject areas such as:
• Accounting Ethics
• Accounting Information Systems
• Accounting Research and Analysis
• Accounting Theory
• Auditing and Attestation Services
• Financial Accounting and Reporting of Business Organizations
• Financial Accounting and Reporting for Government and Not-for-Profit
Entities
• Financial Statement Analysis
• Fraud Examination
• Internal Controls and Risk Assessment
• Managerial or Cost Accounting
• Taxation
• Tax Research and Analysis
• Other areas as approved by the Board”

My question was, does accounting internship credits go under “Other areas as approved by the board” ? I have 3 semester hours of internship credits (ACCT 494).

I would appreciate any help ! "

I'm an intern looking to stay in the Redmond area for the summer, preferably within biking distance of the NVIDIA office.

671c1f,5,2017-04-23,Is this abuse?,frankenfrau,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/671c1f/is_this_abuse/,"I'm new here, please go easy on me. 

I have had a depressive phase for about a month now, and so I haven't been cooking and cleaning like I normally would. I am also out of a job, trying to get an internship (Ive basically got it, yay). My fiance really helps me a lot, takes me to appointments, does the grocery shopping, ect. I am super grateful for him, and really try to support him. I make his lunches for work, clean twice a week, and try to cook 3-4 times a week. So I feel like I am doing well considering my depression.

I should add that I had meningitis in January and spent 3 days in a coma. My mind was fucked after that, I have trouble remembering things, concentrating and I sleep a lot more. My fiance was supportive and tried really hard to take care of me. He can be a bit of a man child, so it wasnt always easy for him. 

I have to admit that I am a narcissist and can be very demanding. I like things done a certain way, and while I was sick I voiced that. But now that I think back I remember that my mother actually spent most of the week with me cleaning and cooking for us. My fiance found reasons to leave the house a lot. He was helping his grandpa too because grandpa cant walk or drive anymore, so his workload was pretty high. 

Eitherway, it has been stressful. He gets angry sometimes when I dont function. He gets loud tells me Im selfish, lazy, that I say too much bullshit and blah blah blah. He will say that Im dumb or that I need to snap out of it. This ruins my day, I stay in bed and cry after these episodes. He is only this abusive during his outbursts. I dont have an easy personality, I can be a real bitch. I like to make fun of him for not knowing how to clean, or make little remarks about his mother's terrible cooking but nothing really mean. I do expect a lot though and always think of my well being before others.

I feel safe with rest of our relationship and trust him not to cheat on me, which has been my biggest insecurity in the past. It might be relevant that all my romantic relationships turn abusive. I think that I may be mentally abusive, since I am the constant variable. I feel like I am the problem, maybe Im being too selfish. What do you guys think?"

I was a transfer student from SPC. Took me forever to figure out what I wanted to go for. I decided on the IS program. However I am aware that a degree in and of itself is not that impressive to future employers. I am currently a junior and have finished about 7 courses in this program. 

This is what leads me to ask does anyone in this program or in general have any recommendations, perhaps on clubs or organizations I should join in order to network (I also live off campus, an hour away if that matters), Or perhaps any other advice as well. I have not had any internships yet unfortunately, currently just working at geek squad until I can get one.

What I've tried:

1. I entered the rules on the web console, didn't work, wireshark didn't see any other ip besides the sniffer, router and any ip accessing the sniffer.

2. Web console: Used 192.168.1.0/24 (network where sniffer is) on -d and -s options, instead of using the interface eth0.

3. Enabled ssh. Copied and pasted the rules to the cli, checked with iptables -L -t mangle always getting an empty list

4. Tried multiple sniffers on different systems: security onion vm wireshark + sid triggering, windows laptop wireshark, ubuntu vm tcpdump, android phone packet capture app.

5. Used multiple versions of the command, ex. I used ip, interface name on ifconfig, removing --tee, etc.0



I know that the sniffer is configured correctly, and would like to run it as a network tap instead of running it inline. I'd like to run it when i only need it, so i cant have an transparent inline ids.




I'm really lost here, I don't see an error when im doing the input in terminal/webconsole.

I've been accepted to the computer science program as an incoming freshman, and I've narrowed down my choices to Cal Poly and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. One of the largest factors in my decision making process is co-op availability (like internships, but usually full-time for a whole term). RPI actively helps students find co-ops and is even restructuring their programs to fit them in, but Cal Poly seems to have less of a program. From what I've learned through the website and talking to some students at open house a couple weeks ago, it sounds like the only way to find a co-op at Cal Poly is through clubs. My question is, are students who are interested in co-ops (especially in CS) likely to get them, and how helpful is the administration in reworking student schedules around co-ops? "

I've been dealing with depression for upwards of five years now and while it has changed in appearance over those five years, the one thing that has stayed constant is my fear and sense of urgency over the future. 

I have a terrible problem where I constantly compare myself to others of my age group. I invent this golden standard in my head that everyone else seems to live by that I haven't been able to reach. For example, I figure that everyone who is 23 is: out of college, has had sexual experience, has a close group of friends, and is moved out of his parents home. 

What happens is that whenever these thoughts that I am not living my life in accordance to this standard that everyone is living by, I get this overwhelming fear that I am not living my life to the fullest and that time is running out for me to fix these issues. While I am tackling some of the issues slowly (graduating this year, moving out next year for an internship in Montana), the other issues have only become more urgent as time as a result. 

At some point, the feelings of fear and anxiety over the future become so overwhelming that I just shut down and give up. I've recently gotten into the habit of just constantly shitting on myself, because it makes the idea of not hitting those goals easier to swallow. Thoughts like ""Oh you're an ugly boring piece of shit, so whats the point of trying to make friends."" and ""You're already 23 and you haven't had sex yet, that means you're an unlikable piece of shit and you should just try to live with the fact you'll be alone forever."" constantly creep into my head and its starting to become too much.

My question to all of you is, how have you all dealt with these thoughts and feelings (if you are experiencing them)? How do you find the strength to believe in yourself enough to push yourself?

Sorry is this is long. Feel free to pass this by if you don't want to read my shitty story. "
674f1n,232,2017-04-23,My boyfriend [30M] was really hurtful about my upcoming graduation. Now I [25F] don't want him to attend. Is this fair?,rudeboyfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/674f1n/my_boyfriend_30m_was_really_hurtful_about_my/,"Hi everyone. I'm using a throwaway because my boyfriend is really active on Reddit, and I'm hoping he doesn't see this. 

My boyfriend Joe and I have been together for nearly 5 years. I went the conventional route - completed my undergrad, took a year off, went straight into grad school. Joe did not take a similar route. He completed one semester of college, enlisted in the Air Force, got out, then started working a skilled labor job. He never explicitly says that he regrets not finishing college, but its apparent that in certain settings that he feels judged for not completing school. I have urged him many times to go back to school, but he says that he ""doesn't want to spend a ton of money on things he already knows."" He doesn't seem to understand that college isn't like a skilled job - you attend college to learn to think, analyze, and write, not to learn practical training. Sorry - that may have been too much background, but I feel as if his stance on school may be important. 

I received my undergrad degree in a field I was mildly interested in, but the pay was never the absolute best. I will eventually cap out around 60,000. I found myself frustrated and decided to go back to school in a field that I was passionate about, but was completely unrelated to my undergrad degree. Joe and I picked up and moved from our large NE city to a small PNW city so I could go to school. We have been very lucky here - I found an amazing job and his skill set is in high demand in this area. Together, we make well over 100,000 a year. We have no children and two dogs, and have had the opportunity to travel and improve our lives while here. 

About 6 months ago, I was offered a promotion at the job I am working at. Its in the field of my undergrad and unrelated to my grad program. The pay was a very nice increase, but it came with some amazing perks as well. Joe and I discussed it and he urged me to take it. Shortly after I did, he began making a few snide comments about why we had to move to the PNW when I could have worked the same job in our home city. This is true. I'm not going to be working in my grad school field for at least another year, if at all. It made me a little sad, but I think the promotion is the best way to go.

Either way, I want to celebrate my successes in grad school. I completed some very rigorous fieldwork for my thesis, I had an amazing internship, and I'm graduating with a 3.9 GPA. I worked very hard for this. My family is coming from the NE, my friends are throwing me a party, and we are going to take a small 4 day vacation after graduation. 

Recently, my boyfriend sent me a long string of text messages, saying things like


-I don't want to celebrate your graduation. Its a big sham for a degree you're doing nothing with it.


-Celebrate with your family. I'll take care of the responsibilities. 


-I want you to realize that what you want in life isn't always in the direction you are pointing


- You know I don't care about this, otherwise I would have two doctorates by now


- Do graduation with your family, I think its stupid. But I'm proud of you.



He decided to cancel out of the trip with my family so that we could save money on boarding the dogs. We could easily afford the boarding, but I didn't fight him on it. I told my family that he didn't want to be a part of graduation celebrations. Now, two weeks after he made those comments, he feels remorseful. He seems to think that he is still participating in graduation, the dinners, the parties, and everything else. I don't think he should be involved. I feel like he made comments that he believed to be true and that he should be held accountable for his words. 

Am I being too harsh? Should I just let him join in like we had planned? Honestly, I feel like every time I'm going to look over at him, I'm going to be reminded of how he truly feels about the whole thing. 
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My boyfriend made some really hurtful comments about graduation, and I uninvited him. Now he wants to participate. Help?"

I still lack motivation to do homework, and I only go to the gym because I feel like I can channel my depression into something more positive. Violin is just something I was raised with so I can't let that go but yeah.

I don't know, I'm still miserable and lonely, because I only do these activities alone, and talk to maybe 3 people a week. My therapist and 2 friends who live in other states.

My calculated gpa after this semester is a 3.3ish which is awful for premed, but I'm just going to try and if I don't get into med school I might give up, because I really want to help people like me and if that isn't a possibility there's nothing I want to do with my life.

But for now I'm just going to spend the next 2 years hoping that my goal can become true.

Luckily I don't have anyone that reinforces my depression, like a screaming parent or anything. My parents are helping me and I call them everyday to let them know how I am, and one of my friends in California is teaching and encouraging me to code something over the summer so I feel accomplished and maybe that will lead to an internship.

I don't know. My emotional state is a wreck and this could be just a temporary thing, but it's worked for the past month and I might as well try and continue.

I realized happiness isn't really something that happens for me. I only get it when I push past an obstacle. And if I don't do something I get back to that state. And I don't want to be there. I'm sure no one does.

Sorry for the rambling

674ip8,3,2017-04-23,Interview Questions for Research Paper,PepperCheck,UNCCharlotte,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNCCharlotte/comments/674ip8/interview_questions_for_research_paper/,"I was wondering if any computer science majors could answer a few quick questions about UNC Charlotte for my research paper. I attend a small community college in southern North Carolina and plan on transferring to the school in 2019. 

What are some of the strengths of the Computer Science department at UNC Charlotte? 

What resources (besides courses) does the College of Computer Science and Informatics offer students majoring in Computer Science? 

What sorts of internships are available for students within your department? 

Do projects tend to be cooperative or independent? 

Were your experiences at the university positive? 

Did you enjoy being on a larger campus? 

Thank you to anyone that responds to this. You can send me a PM of responses to any of these if you'd like. The only reason I resorted to Reddit was because I've emailed a couple professors with these questions and they haven't responded, understandably. I asked my professor if he'd be okay with using Reddit users as a source; he ok'd it because of the tough luck I had with the emails."

All throughout school I was talking to engineers who said that they looked for soft skills that proved the person was capable, and that club activity and decent extracurriculars were worth just as much as other experience. However, now that I'm graduating I'm finding that those same companies and people aren't giving me the time of day because I don't have work experience. I'm finding online applications that consist of ""Education"" and ""Work Experience"" and nothing else where I might advertise my soft skills or extra curriculars. I even had an employee referral, where a hiring manager who was telling me these very same things, wouldn't even look at my resume once he found out that I didn't have work experience.

So I'm posing the question, do hiring managers actually care about anything other than work experience as they claim, or is that just a reassurance they give out?"

1. I entered the rules on the web console, didn't work, wireshark didn't see any other ip besides the sniffer, router and any ip accessing the sniffer.

2. Web console: Used 192.168.1.0/24 (network where sniffer is) on -d and -s options, instead of using the interface eth0.

3. Enabled ssh. Copied and pasted the rules to the cli, checked with iptables -L -t mangle always getting an empty list

4. Tried multiple sniffers on different systems: security onion vm wireshark + sid triggering, windows laptop wireshark, ubuntu vm tcpdump, android phone packet capture app.

5. Used multiple versions of the command, ex. I used ip, interface name on ifconfig, removing --tee, etc.0

I know that the sniffer is configured correctly, and would like to run it as a network tap instead of running it inline. I'd like to run it when i only need it, so i cant have an transparent inline ids.

6760o3,3,2017-04-23,I'm [22F] trying to move on from breakup with ex-boyfriend [30M].,starfish390,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/6760o3/im_22f_trying_to_move_on_from_breakup_with/,"I was with my ex for almost 1.5 years, and I thought things were pretty good but he acted really distant in the last few months of our relationship, and that's when I knew it was going downhill. He was unemployed for basically our whole relationship because he lost his job two months after we started dating and I was in my last year of undergrad. 

He was my first love and I was head over heels for this guy--I was willing to bend over backwards for his every whim. Unfortunately, I didn't see all the signs: 1) he lied about his profession when we first met, 2) he lied about completing college (dropped out), 3) lied a lot about girls in his past, 4) would say stuff to put me down, 5) never wanted to hang with my family or friends, 6) had me pay for a lot of stuff even though I was working an $8/bookstore - 10hr/week job while handling full college courseload. 

Looking back now, I can't believe I experienced all of this and willingly went along with it. I was very hurt, he never showed me a lot of affection, and he said it was because he isn't an affectionate person in general. There was little to no foreplay, I had to ask for kisses and touches, he would go straight to the point. I realized sex is not supposed to be like this, that a couple uses foreplay to enhance their intimacy.

I guess he was really selfish and he admitted this, but didn't want to ""lose me"", but also held the ""grass is greener on the other side"" perspective. He had thoughts of cheating but never went through with them. I was devoted to him and nobody else, I couldn't believe he wanted anyone else. Another thing that irritated him was the fact that I had minimal hobbies. I'm still living at home, and have a lot of responsiblities to my family, and also don't have the funds or time to really get involved in a hobby. When I was finishing up my last year of undergrad, I was very busy with classes and projects. 

Additionally, I started an internship that progressed to full time status (40 hours) that consumed a lot of my time, so I didn't have a lot of energy when I came home to spend on hobbies. He felt like I should have devoted more time to doing more outdoorsy stuff, but he himself never initiated any thing and liked to play video games and smoke weed. His dad gave him money every month so he was able to use the gym and pursue his associates degree (his plan of action after being unemployed). I didn't have this luxury, so I was stressed a lot of the time. 

I did a lot for him and cared for his family deeply, I was lost after the breakup but have done a lot of evaluating. I think I have a lot more experiences I need to go through and develop myself as a person before I can jump into another relationship again. I don't think I'm a boring person, I would like more hobbies but I just currently don't have the time or financial resources (I'm just getting my career) started to pick something. I think the breakup was for the best, we were incompatible, but I was willing to give him the world. Just trying to learn from my first heartbreak and wondering if readers have input. 

---
tl;dr: evaluating my breakup and wondering if lack of hobbies is a bad thing."

Backstory|
:--
I am 30 years old with no degree. I have worked in food service management, front end web development many years ago, and tutoring for math. 

I went to college when I was younger, ended up dropping out to make money and used my school loans to pay for rent and living expenses for my family as my mother (felony, unhirable until expungement apparently) and step-dad (labor worker, broke back, injuries compounded) had no income for a family of 6. That is where my school debt comes from.

I previously worked in the city and made ~$55K. An unfortunate life event occurred and I ended up being out of work for 8 months near the beginning of the year. Worked as a contractor for most of the previous year before my life event and when it came time to do taxes I had the option to either pay them and have no way of paying for living expenses/housing or to not pay them and live off of my savings until I was able to work again. This is not a case of disability and I was denied unemployment so those were not available to me. Ended up moving across the country to live with family (gracious people!).
  
Current|
:--|
Fast forward and I am now working two jobs while going to school (FAFSA saving my life!). Job A = $12/hr @ 37h per week. Job B = $15/hr @ 5h max allowed per week. I am taking a minimum of 8 credits in college in pursuit of becoming a Registered Dietitian. Job A is important to me right now because it is fulfilling (albeit not in the wallet department) as well as extremely important for the required internship process in order to become a Registered Dietitian. I manage a meal program and want to get into food service management in a clinical setting as my end goal.

I used a spreadsheet from the sidebar to calculate some things. Something to take note of is that my rent is prepaid for the next 6 months (Awesome!). My student loans are deferred but still accruing interest it seems.  
  
Macro Financial Breakdown|

Here is the macro breakdown of my income and expenditures:|
  Income: $1600 (2nd job may disappear)|
  Expenses: $1047 (includes rent despite prepaid)|
  ""Savings"": $563|

At this rate, with what I've described, what is my best course of action? I am excited that I was able to write down some numbers and figure simple math out but it is very overwhelming for me to look at this in any scope. I am not opposed to opening additional credit cards w/ 0% Balance Transfer offers once the current ones end (if they even have a balance left). My last Experian pull (Feb) was @ 759 and my recent FICOs are 720-730.

Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide or some of my math does not check out. Sorry if this information is completely jumbled. I will update formatting as time goes on or as requested so long as it is within my tech capabilities. I've cut out everything I could think of that didn't infringe on me feeling like a human being.

Thank you all in advance. I look forward to the grilling."
676rti,64,2017-04-23,From Loneliness to Acceptance,KingForevalone,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/676rti/from_loneliness_to_acceptance/,"Hello all. First time poster here, long time FA.

I want to share with you my FA story, and the journey that I'm sure many of us take during our lives. As of this moment, I am typing this story as a 26 year old kissless virgin male. This post isn't about ranting or venting though, this is about explaining to you my feelings over the years and what I feel like now, as well as how these thoughts and feelings have shaped me into who I am today.

**For the TL;DR, read the last four paragraphs.**

At some point during childhood, I imagine most of us make some kind of attempt to fit in with the other kids at school and also begin to notice and or desire being around the opposite sex. When this happens can vary, but for me it started to take hold somewhere very early in elementary school. There I was, eyeing some girl that my naive brain thought I would have a chance with. Being this young, I had no idea or concept of rejection yet. I didn't know that's how it could work. I assumed that all one had to do was talk to a potential GF and it would just ""happen.""

It started with a wink at her, and in turn I was given an evil look of ""why is this weirdo looking and winking at me?"" I noticed this look, and thus began my 26-year FA journey. For the remainder of elementary school I did not seek any other potential GFs and instead focused on school.

Moving onward from that came something that I wish I never did. At some point in early elementary school and for some reason that I can't remember (perhaps aggression that I apparently could not control or lashing out my very first rejection) I (stupidly) decided to bully some other kid (verbally only). Of course, since I'm not the kind of guy to actually be this way it meant that I got in trouble. The kid's mom talked to my mom, and in turn I was made to apologize. I did, and we both moved on from the incident. I really am sorry for it, I wish I never did that. I feel like I have been paying for this ever since.

Unfortunately, the tables started to turn on me after that and I became the bullied. They, on the other hand, never had to apologize. To this day, none of them ever said sorry to me. This bullying lasted all the way up to somewhere in my junior year of high school and included everything from name calling to physical abuse to even pantsing me around everyone (including girls) in the gym one year in middle school. Thankfully I was smart enough to pull my pants back up immediately, so I'm not even sure if anyone noticed (god I hope not).

At one point during middle school I had enough. One of them decided it would be funny to mock me after I tripped and dropped my books. He walked by and said ""let me help you with that"" and knocked my stacked books back over. I picked them up and proceeded to slam him in the face with them. Teachers were nearby, stopped it before it became a fight. I got suspended for a few days, and I don't think he got anything.

Bullying might not have a lot to do with being FA, but it definitely does not help it. Being bullied brings lack of trust in others and plenty more other social skill impediments. Not to mention a lack of any kind of a social circle due to being an outcast kid.

Throughout all this, came a lack of desire to want to be included in social situations. I actively avoided them and stuck to myself from my day to days. When I would come home, I'd do what homework I had and went straight to video games. Nights would involve me crying, thinking about all the other happy kids who have GFs and relationships. I thought about how those bullies probably had GFs too who didn't care that they were assholes. The loneliness consumed me, and every day was more pain and sadness. Anything following this became normal, I just took it.

Fast forward to my next few attempts at finding a GF. I was in high school as a freshman at the time. At this point I was very clumsy, often simply telling girls upfront that I found them attractive. This didn't end well because it led to rejections, me being simply ignored, and even one of the girls' boyfriends threatening me to back off or else he'd ""mess me up."" I was still my same old self so I just took it and moved on from them.

My grades suffered, I even almost failed some of my freshman classes. I was able to pick it back up and brought my grades up and started to fix it. I've gotten As and Bs ever since then (sometimes a rare C would slip in, usually in chemistry or something else hard for me). When the grades improved, it was also the same time I stopped worrying about relationships for the time being.

Another attempt involved me being there for one of the girls and always holding the door for them and always saying hello to them. Full on chivalry, I thought it might pay off... but it did not in any way. Eventually she straight up asked me ""do you like me?"" and I thought to myself this is it! I said yes, she said ""well I don't."" Found out later she had a BF anyway. You guessed it, he was a generic Chad of course.

That pretty much sums up my high school ventures, except for one thing that bothers me to this day.

During my high school years there was this girl that I knew and that I really liked. She was nice enough but for whatever reason I never took any initiative with her. There were a few moments where I had a chance to just talk to her and possibly ask her out but I never did. Looking back now, I don't know why. I have a feeling in the back of my head that tells me she was the one, she would have said yes. I beat myself up for it every day that goes by. I hate myself for it to this day. I can't believe I missed that chance.

Anyway, moving on. After high school was over in 2009 I didn't do jack. Sitting around at home playing video games, stuffing my face (by the way, I've always been a little chubby), and staying up all night and sleeping all day. I could lose the weight I have if I really tried. I'm not totally overweight but it's enough. There's just no motivation to do it.

After about a year of this, I got off my ass and started going to my local community college and decided to go for my Associate in Science. The courses I had to take for this ended up being a little bit too much on the math side (I am not good with math) so I switched to Associate in Arts. I originally wanted to go to a four year college, but quickly decided I did not want that headache. Which ironically meant that I'd not be around a ton of girls as well and my community college didn't have many to begin with.

At this point I ignored pretty much any social situations and focused on my work and classes. At one point during one of my final classes, I saw what was perhaps the most amazing looking girl so far. When I say amazing, I don't just mean hot. She just looked perfect. Nice, good looking, friendly. You name it. I'd often see her smiling at me and stuff, so it ignited my interest again. I've since learned that a girl smiling at you actually means she does NOT like you. I hate these backwards signals.

The following week was full of new feelings, thinking about my future, how I will be alone if I don't do something. It's that feeling of being alone that was getting to me. Realizing that I might be 30 years old soon and not even had any experience with any girl. I got up the courage one day to talk to her. This time was different, I talked clearly and had the most confidence so far and asked if she wanted to go out sometime. Well, turns out she was engaged. I could have sworn I never saw a ring, but then again maybe I was blinded by how amazing she seemed. Or perhaps she was one of those who wears fake rings to divert attention from men all the time. Who knows, I wasn't going to ask.

In retrospect, I should have asked her if she would have gone out with me if she wasn't engaged but I didn't think of it at the time. I'm pretty sure I know the answer though. Still would have loved to hear what her answer would have been even if it was bad.

Following this, I pretty much gave up. I completely stopped trying to find a GF or a date period. I didn't care about social interactions at all. I stuck to myself, did my own thing, worked hard at everything else I did and passed all my courses with practically straight As. I did well for myself in that regard and I'm glad that I did. I refocused my life to this since then. Still playing video games too.

After I got my Associate in Arts, I didn't know what to do. I pretty much returned to the way I was after high school. I didn't know what I wanted to do or what job I was going to end up with in the future. Eventually I went back to the college again, but this time to get an Associate in Applied Science for Computer Information Technology. I know I'm good with computers (been using them since I was a kid) and really enjoy programming in particular. I would always put my own unique spin on every program I wrote for my programming courses. Even did some tutoring near the end. Getting that degree was easy as hell for me, if only getting a GF was just as easy for someone like me.

The first semester and very first class of this new program had yet another girl that I noticed and wanted to try being with. I went through the entire semester contemplating asking her out. There were times where I saw her on one of the computers looking up stuff like shirts (for guys) to buy. I made the assumption they were for her brother or something (if she had one) and not a boyfriend. I had to tell myself that didn't I?

Near the end of the semester, I decided to try something new. Something very risky and direct. I approached her directly after a class at the end of the day and straight up asked her if she was single. The answer was just as you would expect it, she wasn't single. Yet again I find myself having interest in someone who is already spoken for. In fact, I am willing to bet that every single girl throughout my life has been taken. I was late yet again. Maybe she was lying, but I don't think so. Not this time, I could tell it was the truth. The earlier ""shirt research"" was proof enough, she was 100% buying a shirt for her BF just as I suspected in the back of my mind.

It was after this that I decided once and for all to just stop. Since that day, I haven't attempted asking out or even developed interest in a single girl. I know the truth, and it doesn't even hurt me or bother me anymore. Maybe I am one of those rare people who aren't meant to be in a relationship period. I am working now, doing something that I enjoy more and more every day which is right up my alley; working with HTML and PHP designing web based forms. There are or were a couple women who worked there too but both of them left to return to college soon after I arrived; I think they were both interns or something. These days I take these sorts of things as clues to stay alone. Even if they were around longer I doubt I would have done anything anyway. I've heard to not try to make relationships where you work, and it's probably good advice.

As the title suggests, it started off with loneliness but now it's all about acceptance. I have come to terms with being a life-long loner. I just don't care anymore. I am not suicidal and I highly doubt I ever would be, I am not the type. I have other things in my life that are keeping me from being this way. For me now it's not about complaining about being FA, it's all about accepting it and living my life in accordance to it. I can do much more good on my own that I ever could in a relationship, this I know for a fact.

I'm not here to complain, name and shame, or blame. In fact, at this point it's safe to say that I actually DON'T want a relationship. To be honest, finding a girlfriend now would be a disaster for me and her both. I don't want to burden her with my bullshit and bore her to death, and I don't want who I've become to be changed into something I know I could never be. I want to just be me and live on my own terms. A lone wolf.

And so, here I am. Speaking to you as a fellow FA and telling you my story. Thank you all for reading, and I hope all of you can find the strength in yourself that I have found in being alone. It's not all about being with someone anymore, for me it's about being who I was always going to be and understanding the meaning of it. Maybe I'm being crazy, maybe I'm not. All I know is I am a lot better being the way I am now than trying to get something that clearly I was never meant to.

Thanks again for reading. Stay strong everyone, your truth is out there somewhere too. Maybe the reason you are FA is not so different from mine. Just maybe there's something in your life you can find that you can build upon and give yourself new meaning. It's not all about relationships. Be different, be alone if you have to be, but most importantly be yourself."
676sfl,17,2017-04-23,"[Casual Conv.] For all my bros graduating next month, are you nervous about the future?

I'm graduating with a Bach. of Applied Sciences in Information Technology Management, where I would like to pursue Healthcare Technology and Information Systems. I don't know if it's because I didn't do an internship (I was working full-time as registered pharm. tech.), if I didn't learn/apply myself enough, the program wasn't good enough (I attended a 'state college', not a university), or because I'm an older undergrad (27 y/o), but I feel completely under-prepared of what is being asked as I peruse job postings. 

This leaves me feelings of doubt and insecurity, the same vice-grips that were around me initially when I was younger and wondering about the 'validity of my sexuality' and the nonchalant attitude of even going to college and trying to be successful in my life. For instance, Stanford Health currently has a job opening I would like to apply for and my thoughts are: ""They have a bevy of intelligent students, probably Stanford folks, in California they could choose from, what's the point?""

Sorry if this post sounds whiny or stupid, but I feel like I need some reassurance that I can't be the only one that is thinking this; this reluctant, counteractive measure that my mind is doing is making me go a little crazy, and I'd like a few words of wisdom from y'all.

I got accepted into a 1-year graduate program last July. Since this university was 2 hours away from my/my husband's (lets call him M) current rental home, relocation of at least myself was the only logical option. I luckily managed to find an older lady in University-town who was renting her son's old bedroom for a reasonable rate. I currently stay here during the week, and M will either come down to see me or I will drive up to Rental House and see him, each weekend. 
Though my rent in U-town is affordable, we still had the issue of lowered income due to me leaving my restaurant job to return to school, as well as increased rent. M and I decided it was better for him to stay in original hometown and keep his decently-paying job with an awesome boss.

To help our finances, we took advantage of the second bedroom in Rental House and decided to rent it out. I posted to Facebook that I was looking for a roomie, and within a few hours an old college friend of mine (named S) responded that she would love the room, and was looking to move out of her parents' house. Cleared it with our landlord, who just wanted a new lease drafted and signed. We met up a few days later to sign the new lease, and seal the deal. S moved in shortly after (August).

Kind of an odd situation, but S caused no major problems, just minor annoyances. Dirty dishes in the sink, stealing the good parking spot, playing loud music early in the morning, thermostat wars, etc. S paid her rent on time, I was not there often enough to become bothered, and M is pretty non-confrontational.

Fast forward to today, April 23. Sunday is M's day off and I was due to go scuba diving with U-club. M later texts me, ""Did S say anything about moving out?"" I respond with, ""No. She signed the lease until August. That was our agreement."" M comes back with, ""Well her parents were at the door this morning. I thought they were just stopping by after Church. Then, they start carrying out boxes and emptying out her closet...""

Apparently S just cleaned out her room and left, out of nowhere. She is in school now too. Her parents live an hour north of Rental House. She pays rent in the beginning of the month (by the 5th) so I have no idea why she chose today. I do have a few ideas as to why this might have happened, but it still is random and sudden, coming from someone I had considered my friend. She has a pending lawsuit where she will potentially owe thousands, so probably cannot afford to live here any longer. She has been complaining about it for weeks. Also, she has mental health issues so it could be due to that. M wisely stayed out of it while S and her family were loading boxes earlier, and I was in U-town 2 hours away so could do nothing. I guess I could have called her but seriously? If she would have just come clean to me about what she was planning we would have accepted it, and moved on. Overall, the timing is shitty but not the worst. I am ending my living arrangement in U-town shortly for the summer, and waiting to hear on an internship or job so I can complete my Master's project and graduate. We had been counting on S paying rent for another 3 months, and suddenly that income is gone. M and I even looked on Facebook and S had either blocked us or deleted her profile.

Not really even seeking advice at this point, but just ranting. Several years ago M and I moved into the first place of our OWN, no roommates, just us and the cat. We swore we'd never live with one again. And look what happens!

---------TL;DR- Rent out second bedroom to offset financial strain of graduate school. Get majorly burned by roommate/former friend when she suddenly moves out 3 months early. No warning or explanation. People friggen suck.

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside the fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

677nhc,17,2017-04-24,I sleep through everything and it's destroying me,flagy754,sleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/677nhc/i_sleep_through_everything_and_its_destroying_me/,"I'm a university student and I have been dealing with this for years. But as of late, it has become so out of control I can tell my body is suffering. Tl;dr: Recommend me strong alarms. Recommend me long term solutions.

 Since I was young, I have always been able to stay up late with no issues. Waking up was a bit more of an issue but it wasn't really bad back in high school since my parents could still wake me up and I had basically the same schedule each day. Weekends were also more focused on sleep catch up and it had no negative effect on my school work so it was fine. Senior year I started to sleep right after school (accidentally initially), wake up for dinner which was late due to my father's work, and work until about 3 am before sleeping for another 3 hours. This was probably the best times I've been awake all day and the most productive. I also noticed I had issues actually waking up and staying up, having random bouts of intense sleepiness that half the time I couldn't throw off. I can even list the times that the sleepiness hits, and I assure it is not the average time. I also sleep anywhere, anytime, and for any length of time. I've woken up in the middle of a golf tournament where I apparently played three holes already half asleep and I have fallen asleep standing up. 

In university, it's a bit different. I get hurt socially and academically if I take my long preferred naps all day (as I can't make office hours, can't meet group studies, can't talk to people, can't eat because dining hall hours aren't flexible). Freshman year wasn't so bad, being able to stay up late and work with no perceivable change in ability if I have an hour of sleep versus 9 hours of sleep. Now though, I've had issues with numb fingers, inability to make it to lectures even if it is at noon, and loss in focus (like right now I should be doing an assignment due at 10 but I can't focus for the life of me). If I sleep when I feel the most comfortable (aka twice a day at essentially 4 oclock am and pm for like 3-4 hours), I lose both friends and ideal times to work on homework. While I need to face my procrastination issue first, I'm now incredibly nervous because I have accepted an internship position this summer. Obviously I can't exactly wake up late repeatedly nor can I continuously stay up for ridiculously long hours every single day for a week. 

Here's what I ask of the sleep community. I need an alarm clock that can actually wake me up short term so I can actually start fixing/adjusting my circadian rhythm; google says shake me alarms etc but I've also heard they don't work, on top of that, light doesn't really wake me up and apps that require me to shake my phone or solve math problems don't stop me (I officially do them in my sleep with any recognition I've had an alarm go off). Long term, I want to know if it seems I have a sleep disorder or if this is just something I need to rapidly fix and upkeep. 

For now, I'm back to my homework, but thank you for any replies. "

I never scored with an internship for lack of confidence and experience (go figure!) 

I graduated and ended up getting married before getting a job, and moving countries. 6 months later we get the wonderful news we're expecting a baby, so I ended up never looking for a job or internship because my husband makes enough to support us. 

Now my baby's 4.5 months old and I feel super happy to be a mum, but I'm starting to feel demotivated about any semblance of a career. I loved learning and earning my degree but I never felt like I earned the knowledge and experience to plunge into the working world and now I've got a bit of a gap in my cv. 

I'm sorry for the rambling, but I'd really love to get some advice! I want to start doing something once my daughter's old enough for school because I don't want to put her in daycare. This is a time with her I don't want to waste. 

When the time comes her schooling will also be quite expensive, so I'd like to contribute financially.

I just transferred here last semester, so this past year has been my first at this school and I was so excited for this weekend - so many of my friends hyped it up to me and told me how much fun it always is, how great of a time we were going to have, etc. I made the mistake of inviting a few friends from home to come up for the weekend so they could meet all of my new friends and party with us.

Thankfully only one of my friends ended up being able to make it - thank god. This weekend was honestly the worst few days I’ve had at this school so far. Friday night, my friend and I hung out with a frat boy that I’ve been talking to this semester - huge mistake. It was an awful night. His frat brothers were being really, really creepy towards us and going out of their way to make us uncomfortable. I’m guessing because neither my friend nor I are affiliated with Greek life, so there wasn’t any repercussions to creeping on us like there would’ve been with sorority girls. 

Saturday we woke up early with the intentions of day drinking. We had two parties to go to during the day: one of them got cancelled because of the weather, but my friend Jane invited us to another at a frat she hangs out with, so it should’ve been no big deal. We head to the address she sent us a solid hour and a half after she told us she’d be there, but then we get there they start interrogating my friends and I about which brothers we knew in the frat. I tried to explain to them that my friend hangs out with that frat all the time and I showed them our messages of her sending me this address, but they wouldn’t let us (I had my friend who came up for the weekend and a guy friend with me) in without talking to Jane. I call her but get no answer, so I text her explaining the situation and asking her to please call me back. She doesn’t and we get turned away. She still hasn’t texted me or interacted with me over social media since that happened, which hurts because she is (was?) one of my very closest friends that I’ve made at this school so far. 

Pretty soon after this happens, my friend Dick calls me asking what we’re doing and invites us (my friend Layla and Chase) to a darty. He offers to drive us there too, so we go to his apartment, drop my car off and roll out with him. While we’re in the car, one of Dick’s good friends (who I dated very briefly in the beginning of this semester) calls and invites Dick to another party. Dick tells Noah that he’s with us, and when he says that I’m there Noah makes a disgusted noise and Dick starts laughing. We go to Noah’s house to pick him up, but when we get there Dick gets out of the car and goes into his house alone - leaving me, Layla, and Chase in his car - for a few minutes. He comes back out, we all get out, and then he starts walking in an opposite direction explaining that him and Noah are going to a party but, “there are parties on every block in this neighborhood, you guys should be able to find something.” I was kind of dumbfounded that he dropped us off 4 miles away from my car in a neighborhood that we didn’t know that well and told us to go find a random party, despite the fact he invited us out with him. My relationship with Dick has been strained for a while now because he’s incredibly hurtful and is constantly saying rude or demeaning things to me,  but this really surprised me. I don’t know if I’ve ever had someone do something quite like that to me. I deleted Dick off of social media after that because I figured that was his way of ending the friendship.

That night, we invited James and his friend Matt out with us with the intentions of going to a party that was supposed to be - in the spirit of the weekend - a huge rager. We pregame, everything’s going well, we go out to this party and they charge us $20 at the door for all of us to get in (first red flag). We walk in and it’s literally probably 300 random people, a good amount of them townies, with no booze readily available (second and third red flags, respectively). Not 30 minutes after getting there the cops show up and the five of us dip. Layla and I go with James and Matt back to their frat and everything is fine, I guess. I’ve never hungout with James at his frat before because we pretty much exclusively either go out with my friends or spend time together. I didn’t realize quite how different our social circles are until this weekend. I typically go to house shows or local concerts on the weekends and spend a lot of time with people who are heavily into music, while James’s frat is one of the largest at our school and is, as expected, pretty fucking fratty. 

I tend to try to avoid finding myself in frat houses given the nature of them, and this weekend did nothing but confirm my very worst suspicions. Friday night, one of his roommates (Sam) was going out of his way to put me down while simultaneously hitting on my friend in the creepiest way I’ve ever seen. In the same breath, Sam would mock something I said and then ask my friend - while purposefully avoiding making eye contact with me - if she would want to go to the bars with him and James. Sam is the same dude who put a xanax in James’s drink Friday night and didn’t tell him until after he drank it - he was super fucking rapey and I kept trying to physically put myself in between him and my friend because I didn’t trust him. However, Saturday at the frathouse wasn’t so bad, aside from the inherent discomfort at not being a Greek in the most significant Greek weekend at my school (and being judged accordingly). After the four of us (James, Matt, Layla, and myself) left the frat to go back to James’s house and hangout was when the real fun started.

The creepy roommate from the night before - Sam - was home by the time we got back, along with a handful of other guys from the frat. The four of us were hanging out in James’s room and smoking and talking, but the guys wanted pizza so we went out to the kitchen and spent time in the common areas while we waited for it to cook. While we were talking, I happened to glance at one of the other guys in the living room and made eye contact with him just in time to hear him tell another guy, “looks like James and Matt are about to have a foursome, why don’t we try to slip an extra two in there?”

I was pretty horrified to hear that and did a very, very bad job of covering it. The guy who said it must have noticed, because he got this fucked up smile on his face and then proceeded to launch into graphic description about how the orgy would go down (all while sustaining eye contact with me). I don’t know if this was an overreaction or what, /r/relationships, but I was terrified. I texted my friend Chase about it to try and calm down because I was legitimately shaking - to have something like that happen as one of two girls in a house full of frat boys was scary. I don’t know if I’ve ever been in a similar situation where I was so genuinely concerned for the safety and wellbeing of my friend and I like I was in that moment.

Matt leaves so James, Layla, and myself are hanging out in James’s room and smoking.Without Matt there, James got increasingly agitated and essentially asked us to leave after about 30 mins. Important context: he’s told me that he used to have a really negative view of girls after his ex and him broke up, so I think he was uncomfortable by Layla and I just hanging out with him because I don’t think he believes that guys and girls can have totally platonic relationships. I don’t know what he thought was going to go down, but as soon as the three of us walked out of the room and into the common area it was so, so obvious that all of the guys there thought we just had a threesome. I’ve never experienced a true walk of shame before and holy shit - I never want to again. All of them were gawking at us, a few of them made snide comments as we passed and two of them (Sam and the guy who made the comment about the orgy) high-fived James as we passed. I’ve never felt so entirely consumable before, it was such a fucking predatory environmental and just thinking about it is making my skin crawl again.

Saturday was an awful day too, but nothing particularly creepy or bad happened. James and I are on thin ice, I think - we’ve been casually dating for a while now, spend a lot of time together, and really like one another, but this weekend was just so god damn trainwreck-y. I already talked to him about Sam, but I haven’t told him about what the other creepy guy said and I don’t know if I should or not. I also don’t know what to do about Dick or Jane. 

I feel so disappointed by this weekend. I’m so ashamed of myself that my friend spent money on a flight to be here. I’m hurt, moreso by the fact that she still hasn’t reached out to me, that Jane did what she did when I thought we were on the track to being close friends. I’m not surprised that Dick and I probably aren’t friends anymore, but it still stings that he did what he did. This was a bizarre way to end the semester and I don’t know where to go from here. Trying to make friends as transfer student at a school where a LOT of people are either in the Greek system or hangout with their friend group from back home has been insanely difficult. I’m ending this year with three out of my four closest relationships having been damaged and I feel like all of the time and effort I invested into these people has been for nothing. 

I don’t know anyone where my parents live, but I have an amazing paid internship and an incredible job both lined up for this summer so I’ll probably be too busy for much of a social life this summer anyway. I’m living by myself in a studio next year and I’m worried that living alone, combined with how this year ended, means that it will be really easy for me to isolate myself (which I tend to do) and so much harder to make friends next year. I spent most of high school alone because of how frequently my family moved, all of my freshman year alone (I went to community college), and now this - I don’t know if I’m really meant to have friends. Where do I go from here?

tl;dr: Murphy's law in full force this weekend, three of my closest relationships have been damaged, not sure where to go from here or what to do differently when building relationships as a transfer student in a school where the odds are already stacked against me"

I had an offer from an industry company to start full-time in May (although I graduate in August because I have one class left), but that fell through the cracks because they realized they did not want to hire another person on full-time (blamed it on lay-offs and slow business). I was going to work at the industry company in the mean time to help pay off current student debt and take classes to get my 150 hours. I rejected two other offers I had to take this one and rejected multiple interviews I had pending.

Some info about me to paint a clear picture. Accounting Major, sub-par GPA. But I have great experience when compared to other students. All of my professional experience has only been through internships. I have roughly 10 months of experience working in financial reporting for a publicly traded company (SEC reporting) and 3 months worth of busy season audit internship with a small CPA firm (reputable). Also worked different retail jobs part time throughout school and was a leader with my campus BAP and worked as a TA for Accounting department.

I am finding it very hard to secure a job now because it just seems like I missed the prime recruiting time table. I am in a very awkward predicament because I graduate in August, technically if I wanted to. Should I continue looking for a full-time job? Should I start applying for Masters? Should I delay my graduation to December 2017 and looking for an internship this summer? Should I say fuck it all and drink copious amounts of alcohol? 

Need some clarity and thanks for any input."

I've been dealing with depression for upwards of five years now and while it has changed in appearance over those five years, the one thing that has stayed constant is my fear and sense of urgency over the future.
I have a terrible problem where I constantly compare myself to others of my age group. I invent this golden standard in my head that everyone else seems to live by that I haven't been able to reach. For example, I figure that everyone who is 23 is: out of college, has had sexual experience, has a close group of friends, and is moved out of his parents home.

What happens is that whenever these thoughts that I am not living my life in accordance to this standard that everyone is living by, I get this overwhelming fear that I am not living my life to the fullest and that time is running out for me to fix these issues. While I am tackling some of the issues slowly (graduating this year, moving out next year for an internship in Montana), the other issues have only become more urgent as time as a result.
At some point, the feelings of fear and anxiety over the future become so overwhelming that I just shut down and give up. I've recently gotten into the habit of just constantly shitting on myself, because it makes the idea of not hitting those goals easier to swallow. Thoughts like ""Oh you're an ugly boring piece of shit, so whats the point of trying to make friends."" and ""You're already 23 and you haven't had sex yet, that means you're an unlikable piece of shit and you should just try to live with the fact you'll be alone forever."" constantly creep into my head and its starting to become too much.

My question to all of you is, how have you all dealt with these thoughts and feelings (if you are experiencing them)? How do you find the strength to believe in yourself enough to push yourself?
Sorry is this is long. Feel free to pass this by if you don't want to read my shitty story."

I cut off contact with her at nineteen. She was an alcoholic, physically abusive, and extremely, extremely emotionally manipulative and verbally abusive. Getting her out of my life was the best thing I ever did, but I still suffer from a lot of emotional trauma. A year ago, I started having delusions that she was stalking me (I'd found out she knew where I lived) and my anxiety was making me extremely agoraphobic and paranoid. I wound up realizing this was an issue and sought the help of a psychiatrist, who is wonderful and has helped me a TON. This subreddit has also helped me a ton, although I mostly just lurk.

About six months ago, I got a job offer doing something I really love-- teaching my art part time on the weekends. I taught in college and tutored after, but having a full time job hasn't left a lot of room for that, and more's the pity. It's something I'd like to make a career out of-- I currently use my career in my full time job, but I'm not teaching.

The woman who ran the company that I was hired by was a delight at first. We got along really well, she was open to a lot of my teaching ideas (which are pretty artsy-fartsy, new age, etc). She was chatty, but I am too, and she seemed a little vain (she liked to talk a lot about the people she knew in our industry and was a big name dropper, but hey, a lot of people in our industry do that so whatever). She clearly had connections and I wanted to do good by her so I could use those connections for my career. But I also just liked her, and I think she liked me too.

Then, one day, she decided she didn't like me anymore. I don't know what I did to trigger it, but she would get mean with me during classes (she 'supervised' them, despite me being an adult teaching other adults). She would call me out on personal things in front of my students (""So why don't you like answering my emails?"" or if I was explaining a concept or something, ""Why would you even think this is relevant to them?"") which was really, really inappropriate. She once informed me in front of my class that I had been unprofessional in an email I'd sent to a prospective guest to the class. So, since she was gonna go the mile in front of the students, I dared her, ""What did I say that was unprofessional so I can stop doing it?"" and she said, ""We can talk about it offline.""

The thing is, all these things she was accusing me of, I wasn't doing them. When I asked her (outside of class) what I did that was unprofessional, she was like, ""Oh, it was really nothing, you just didn't start the email with, 'Welcome to [Company],'"" which is something I was never told to do and wouldn't have made sense in the context of the email anyway. But she'd made it into a big thing in front of my students, as though I had, I don't know, sent this poor woman a picture of my butt or something.

She would talk rudely about my students to me and expect me to return it. She made disparaging jokes about LGBTQ people-- in front of our LGBTQ intern. She never paid when she said she would, and never the amounts she said. 

One day, she pulled me aside and said that we needed to chat about something serious. I mean, I guess I should be grateful that she finally chose to talk to me alone about something, but obviously the topic was absurd. I won a small award from my college for a piece of art that I created back in the day. It was a scholarship-- not a big one, but one that helped put me (someone with no financial support, working two jobs) through school. The award itself is not nationally famous, but is famous to the art community of the city that I was living in at the time, so obviously, it's on my resume and in my teacher biography.

She told me it didn't exist. Said she'd looked it up on the Googles and it was nowhere to be found (except for, 'one woman who was ranting and raving about it for some reason! Like a crazy person!'). She said I needed proof of it or she'd have to take it out of my bio and I'd need to take it off my resume.

I told her she could contact my school's record office if she needed proof. I am sure that I have a certificate somewhere but I just moved and it's packed away. She said she would. 

When I got home, I sat down at the great Googly-Moogly myself and found a brochure about the award, first link down (followed by an obituary of the person the award is named after and a description of how the school is starting a scholarship fund in her honor). I meant to send them to her, but I became busy with other things and I figured (naively) that calling the school would clear up the issue for her anyway. And anyway, she didn't bring it up again.

Since the beginning of the class, we were having a problem where she would change the dates of my class. These were big changes, always done last minute, and I was never consulted on them, just brought into it as though it had been the plan all along. Of course, my first thought was always that I was writing the dates down wrong, but then I spoke to some other people who worked for this woman and found out-- no, she was changing them and not telling me. Like, gaslighting me. It would be pretty simple for her to be like, ""Hey, this date isn't going to work for me anymore, can we do xx?""

It got to the point where she did it, yes, you guessed it, in front of my students. They (and I) were under the impression that the classes would be on X dates. She ended my class by saying, ""Ok, so we're meeting on Y right?"" as though we were all in the know. One of my students even called her out on it, bless him. She didn't like that at all, but she agreed we all needed to be together on this one, so we sat down as a class (and her) and decided on what dates the next four classes would be.

Of course, three days later, she changed that.

This was the final straw for me. I was getting calls and texts from students asking WTF was going on and I didn't know (I was working when she sent out the email). So I emailed her back asking what was up. She threatened my job:

""I thought you loved this company, I thought this was what you wanted to do with your 2017, if that's not the case, let me know."" 

Basically saying that if I didn't conform to the dates she'd decided on, she would fire me.

So I was pissed. One thing my abusive mother DID teach me was how to be assertive. I fired back an email saying that this is an on-going situation and it was unfair to both the students and myself that she keep doing this because I needed to know ahead of time when I needed my lessons planned by and many of my students had already planned on vacations during her new days, thinking they were safe with going. I asked how we could fix this. It was short and curt, but it was professional. I sent it to my husband who works in HR. He tweaked a couple things and made it more professional and respectful. I sent it.

She didn't reply-- until the day of my next class, when I got a text, basically telling me to, ""See me after class."" Like I'm a fucking third grader, not a teacher. That day, she didn't come supervise my class. She didn't say hello to me nor my students. She didn't even come to collect their tuition which was due. She sat in her back office and was a spiteful, angry presence. The students commented on it. They knew what was up. The only interaction we had was when she came in to yell at me for going two minutes over (her own classes typically run 2-3 HOURS over-- oh yeah, I was expected to attend those on days when I wasn't teaching).

But otherwise, the students and I had a really great class. I was feeling pretty pumped up and ready to fight by the end of it because I figured they were worth fighting for. They're great artists and they don't deserve to be bogged down in bureaucratic bullshit. And then I went in to see teacher.

She started off by saying that my email was probably very cathartic but I probably regretted sending it. I told her I didn't. She then went through and grammatically corrected my email-- which was not to actual grammatical standards but to her own, out-dated grammar (you've probably guessed what my art is by my username). When I bit back about that, she just name dropped people in the industry who would disagree with me. Whoop-dee-doo. Those people are wrong too.

Over the course of this meeting, she proceeded to insult me multiple times. She made it out that I was unwilling to cooperate with her, that she had wanted to mentor me but I was unmentorable, isolated, snarky and rude. And she said all of those things were true because I didn't have a graduate degree (""And I NEVER hire people without a Masters, at least! But I thought I'd make an exception because you're scrappy and street smart. I guess I can't do that anymore!"") Which, dear reader, having a graduate degree is a BIG thing for me. I got into grad school but, hey, this was during the recession and I didn't have anyone to pay for my Bachelors (unlike her), still couldn't pay for my graduate degree, so I decided to hold off and go back when I was more financially stable). I was also taking care of my grandmother, who was dying of dementia.

She made a big deal about this time when I'd refused to buy her coffee-- in actuality what happened was that I don't drink coffee and she had asked the interns to go get it for her. When they (who DO drink coffee) were noncommittal about it, I offered (and went) but that wasn't fast enough for her.

She also disparaged me for never offering to help her out to the car (the two interns always do, I always ask if they need more help, they always say no--she isn't disabled), saying that that was proof that I had a, 'non-collaborative spirit.' This will be important later.

Of course, she brought up the award as well-- this time, she flat-out said that I'd made it up. I asked her if she took my suggestion to call my school records' office, said we could do it right here, right now. She refused. At this point, I was pretty sure the only reason she didn't think it was real was because SHE'D never heard of it before. 

She disparaged how much money I made (despite the fact that she pays me), compared it to how much money SHE makes (despite the fact that she is FIFTY YEARS older than me and has been in the business for quite a while).

Then, of course, we got to the dates issue. She brought up, ""Maybe sometimes I'm forgetful. It's probably some early-onset dementia, haha!"" which, you know, for me, was just really, really cruel. It's like she knew exactly what to say to really ruin my day.

She also called me, ""the child of an evil woman,"" pretty much out of nowhere. I realize now it was because I had made a brief, tiny reference to something involving my mother during a class I was teaching. It was pretty much nothing, and yet she knew enough to invoke her spirit into the room, which A) just made this whole conversation turn evil and B) reminded me of the fact that the best thing I ever learned from my evil woman of a mother was how to get away from other heinous people.

Basically, she decided to cancel my class until I could, 'get [my] shit together.' She also said my list of complaints was a whole load of shit, and when I confronted her about this (""I'm sorry you think my legitimate complaints with the way this business is treating its customers are complaints.""), she pointed out somewhere in my email where I'd said, ""I am dissatisfied with the way things are going right now,"" and said, ""Well, you basically called me an idiot here.""

In the end, I said, ""Thanks for talking to me about this,"" because I wanted to GTFO. She agreed that we were just learning how to work together and that it would take some time. As I was getting up to go though, she stopped and said, ""This is the perfect time to offer me help out to my car.""

I offered through gritted teeth.

She laughed and said no.

I resigned the next day. I cut off all contact with her after I sent in my resignation letter because the temptation to call her out on her shit would've been too strong. Blocked emails, left the community, blocked her number.

I would like to say that's the end, but it's not. I spent the next week or so being pretty abusive to myself. A lot of crying, a lot more drinking than I normally do, and a lot of sleeping. I was just really emotionally tired. A week later, I realized that this was becoming a problem and stopped drinking, started trying to get out more, seeing emotionally supportive friends and my husband (who have all been incredibly supportive), and spending time doing other things besides dwelling on this crap.

But I am still spending nights up, listening to le spirit de l'escalier, plotting how I'll explain myself to my students should they contact me and ask (a couple of them have-- I've just said I needed to quit for personal reasons. One of them guessed it was because of her; I didn't confirm).

I think I am grieving the loss of this job and the opportunities it presented me. I think I am also hurt that I let myself get hurt again when I have always prided myself on shutting out Ns before they could hurt me. I don't like feeling duped, but I was. I feel like a kid confronting her mother again. I'm massively, massively hurt. I don't feel any closure. My anxiety has been off the charts and my temper has been flaring at the smallest things. I am constantly looking for people trying to take advantage of me and hurt me again and it's starting to interfere with my relationships. 

I could use some help processing this from sympathetic people.

I need to get back on track. Thank you for reading and I apologize for how much of this became a rant.

67bvti,7,2017-04-24,[Need Advice] 22 Yr Old College Senior About to Graduate. (WARNING WALL OF TEXT),SanaHana,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/67bvti/need_advice_22_yr_old_college_senior_about_to/,"Warning: Wall of Text Incoming

Hi guys. I'm a 22 Yr Old College Senior about to graduate University. I'm struggling right now with a lot of things at once, but I want to break them down bit by bit and want pointers toward the right directions in terms of solving my issues and problems with self-motivation and work ethic.

So brief story of my youth. I'm a Korean-American who lived in New Jersey most of their life. I had a difficult time when I was younger. My family has been together for my entire life with my dad, my mom, and my younger brother. My dad was irritable and angry about everything (nothing below an A, mistakes like breaking glass, accidentally scratching his car, etc.) and if I did those things he would fly out into angry rage and beat me and yell at me calling me worthless, stupid, retarded, and someone who wouldn't survive the real world if he wasn't covering my ass. My mom wasn't too much better either, my dad would rail on her as well, then she would either take it out on me or tell me dad what I did and throw me under the bus so she wouldn't get as intensely attacked by my dad. I feel like my dad has some sort of mental disorder. This ""mental disorder"" along with my mom's poor financial/business decision making put her and my dad into $1 million dollars of debt (which happened when I was 1-2 years old). This led to my dad just constantly picking verbal arguments with my mother and later my dad being angry at me like scratching his car and beating me or using corporal punishment to discipline me. This severely affected my natural curiosity as I learned more and more that exploration was seen as a potential liability for my parents. I also had no place to go back to for comfort as a child as going back to my workaholic/toxic parents didn't really give me any sort of ""pat on the back"" or ""good job"" for doing what infants and little children do best. So tl;dr I was abused and also had no emotional support as a child. All both my parents cared about were perfection (clean house, clean image with brand name clothes, dad wanted me to go into law, mom wanted me to get into an Ivy League School, etc.) and this contrasted with many of my white classmates and friends who were provided a lot of things by their parents, were free to explore the world, and had no worries about saving money or finances. This was even more compounded by my dad introducing me to video and computer games at a young age (like 3 and 4) and then later yelling at me for being unable to control myself as a child. This was a very confusing time from elementary school and middle school.

This changed a bit in high school when I tried super hard. I entered a well-known high school in New Jersey and people started to notice I was a part of that school. I was self-motivated because I wanted to go to that school for fencing since it was the only school that offered fencing that I could apply to due to where I lived. I got in and I was incredibly motivated to stay in school because my dad would accept nothing below straight A's since it was a private school he needed to pay for. I succeeded, I got straight A's and I was a varsity starter for the fencing team there (when I cam in it was the first year where the school qualified for states in like 2 or 3 years). Afterward, I was really happy for a while: All my teachers appreciated my work ethic and kindness, my peers respected me for my dedication, and my fencing coach was constantly encouraging me to do my best. However, it changed during junior year. I was in AP courses and I was really challenged there, many concepts and ideas in those classes I could not grasp or understand and I was very frustrated with the work there because I couldn't just grind at it until I understood it. My classmates in AP were pretty aloof and pretentious and they thought they were the best and scorned my work ethic thinking I was a dumb try hard Asian who wasn't actually smart and didn't deserve to be in that class. When my coach left my school in order to open his new club for fencing, our team was also left without a coach and the team's structure was rearranged, leading to some changes that I was very uncomfortable with and caused my father to get angry at the coach for leaving, my team for making changes, and me for not being powerful enough to take over the entire team (I became the team captain next year anyway by vote). From my junior to senior year I cruised, I slept in class, I stayed up late for no good reason except get emotional and listening to Paramore and Blink 182, and I slacked off on work till the last minute. I got a mix between A's to B+'s, which my dad got super passive aggressive about, but he didn't rail on me too hard for those times though for some reason. 

Fast-Forward to college. I was pretty much planning my grand comeback. I wasn't accepted to the Ivy's, but I was accepted to NYU. I decided to study abroad in Shanghai cause my teachers, my dad, and my family friends hyped up that China was the future and if I knew Chinese it would be a tremendous asset to my skills and allow me to easily find work. My dad wanted me to study poli-sci and law in order to become a lawyer and follow the path to a CIA agent or a US Diplomat. I followed all of this with zeal believing I would get the same feelings I had my freshman years of high school. The goals were set: Get straight A's, travel China on my free time, and get internships. I thought again that I could grind at it and eventually get it. I was wrong, dead wrong. Shit started falling apart very quickly. I couldn't get and internship as a freshman, getting straight A's took a lot of time because I'm not naturally good at memorizing and reading large volumes of text so I couldn't travel, and even straight A's were out of reach because Chinese was such a bitch of a language and class to learn/take. First semester came through and I got a B+ on Chinese. My dad was super passive aggressive about the B+ and was like ""well, you could have done better if you tried harder"" I was so upset with everything and the second semester I burnt out so hard I had to be hospitalized and take the rest of the semester off because I was suicidal. 

Fast forward to now: I cruised by the rest of that time choosing a psych major cause it was an ""easy major"" and also because I realized that me, my parents, and my family may have problems and I wanted to find an explanation behind it all and I believed Psych would give me the answers to my problems. I also took Japanese to fill my language requirement (2 years) because I was a weeb and thought I knew my shit, but I regret it immensely because the language was incredibly difficult, I actually didn't know shit, and I didn't learn by then that I'm horrible at memorizing even with grind. I'm graduating about a year late. I took a year off to work at different internships and part-time jobs to get a feel for how shit the grind is at lower level jobs and to understand the value of money (which to be honest I didn't really feel since I spend a lot still). I managed to get about four internships over that year and previous summers, one in law, two in two different fields of psych, and one in IT. I'm glad I did take the year off, because now I know how hard work is, how much money I would want to take home, and the urgency of my situation right now. 

So right now I'm having a hard time motivating myself to do things, I'm sorry for the long wall of text before about my past, but it plays into the killing of my motivation cause my parents made me into a self-destructive perfectionist and now with my girlfriend I'm repairing the damage my parents did for the entirety of my life.

So now here's the lay down of my situation:

Bad:

- Dad is railing on me hard to get employment ASAP (literally right out of college) because he did it and he also had to support himself through college and said if he could do it I could do it. (My mom told me that he wasn't a straight A student like me, so he's an asshole and a hypocrite so I'm able to rationalized it). He doesn't want to support me financially (which is reasonable, I don't want to leech off my parents, that's really dick to do), but he's expecting me to get a well paying job and to be completely independent of him and my mom AS SOON AS I'M OUT OF COLLEGE.
- Even though I was straight A, my GPA has tanked. As of now I'm barely passing my last classes. These classes are incredibly difficult and work intensive. Doesn't help I try to avoid it by playing games and just lolly-gagging with my girlfriend all the time.
- I barely have any money left in savings (about $300) from spending on vidya. This was kind of bouncing back from all the years of missing on limited events my parents would never let me play in, I missed exclusives and stuff. Now all those years of not being able to get things, it came back out and cut into my savings which stood at like $3000 earlier.
-My resume and job experience is all over the place. The 4 internships I mention before, plus a 3.1 GPA Psych Degree, plus a CompTIA A+ Certification makes it hard to market myself to a specific job since I look like a jack of all master of none.
- I commute from my home in NJ to NYC for school. I'm exhausted everyday, I have to cook for myself, clean the house and pay the bills (with my parents money, but I basically have to do their accounting) in order to stay at their house in NJ, and barely have the motivation anymore to study in university because this process is so exhausting and difficult. 
- Because of my commute and my living location I can never hang out with my friends for nights or weekends out, money is tight because my mother allocates an allowance I have to pay bills, buy food with for me and my girlfriend, and pay for my subway/bus passes. This makes me a bit more anti-social, even though I'd like to hang out with them more, I can't. Sometimes it gets lonely.
- Unstable emotional states and lack of intrinsic motivation or things to look forward to make it very, very difficult for me to maintain a good work ethic and not default to escaping games such as League or Overwatch.
- Along with the above, I like to manipulate and dissect ""motivation tips."" For example, I'll ""reward"" myself with a game of League, but then end up playing a lot of games of League, excusing myself saying I did a lot of work even though it wasn't much. So I self-sabotage a lot of times and I don't know how to stop myself from doing it.

Good:

- I do have a CompTIA A+ Certification and currently working on my Network+ Certification. I'm aiming toward IT and I really want to work in that field because the studying doesn't feel like a grind and everything that I learn there just feels very intuitive. I want to get my Security+ and Cisco Associate certs.
- Even though my dad wants to kick me out, my mom owns the title for the house. She says that my dad cannot call the police on my to kick me out and she can call the police herself if he flies into a fit of physical rage while he's at their NJ home.
- Currently both parents live in Alabama/Tennessee for work reasons and move back and forth between the states. My parents only come back up here at NJ for taxes now, so they won't bother me.
- After an argument and a long talk with my mom, we've come to terms and she's warmed up to me a lot. She said she's willing to let me stay in her house (the one I'm living in right now) while I get myself situated and wait for my girlfriend to graduate. She's even willing to let my girlfriend stay at her house while she finishes her business degree at Stern.
- I have a car, there's a few conditionals where there's a lot of car swapping (my parents have 6 cars for no good reason). 3 cars are junk work cars, but they're willing to give me one of their decent car (mom is pushing for this hard on my dad). The car she wants me to have is the Toyota Camry 2010 LE, it has 120k miles, but its a good starting car so I don't have to pay for my own car for at least the first few years I'm working.
- I have a girlfriend who has been very supportive and given me the confidence and bravery to ask help on reddit and therapists about advice on how to proceed. She's lazy and a gamer like me, but she's willing to support me if I go grind hard on work and furthering my career and would be inspired by my hard work and work hard herself if I took the initiative.

So like I'm at this point where I'm stuck in terms of motivation. There's a lot on my plate as a 22 year old in terms of emotional stress. I know I'm not in the worst of the worst of situations, I have friends who would kill to have a place to stay or a car to use for work, but the pressure to make money and keep moving forward is really hard for me, its like an invisible wall of laziness and excuses is clouding my judgement. My primary goal is to pass my classes and graduate on time, then look for work immediately while studying for my Network+ Certification in June. I know the first step to fixing this is becoming financially independent, but what scares me is after that. How do I maintain motivation that's positive and focused without that fear of my dad anymore? How do I foster a sense of self-worth and goals I want to pursue? How do I find out what I want to do with my life in order to become someone who positive and constantly looking forward in their life instead of looking back at the past?

Again sorry for the big wall of text redditors, this is my first time ever reaching out to reddit for personal help and advice and I didn't know if this was the right place to post this. I would appreciate any directions or advice in terms of where to go with my life. 

Again thank you guys and I hope you guys have a great day! ^__^"

Its the 14th of December. Its 2am, the night is coming to an end. 

I bring my glass to my lips, finishing the last of my gin and Tonic, downing about half the glass in one go. We all put our glasses down on the table at the same time.  Me and a few of the work guys are completely smashed. A long evening of food, alcohol, cigars and dancing starting to take its toll. My phone vibrates, a notification from the minicab firm that the company had arranged the week before was 5 minutes away.  I tell the guys i'll see them tomorrow. ""8:00am sharp. Last one gets the bacon rolls in!"" we all laugh as i shake their hands and walk away

I need to find her. Our company has had a bad year, so to save money they've pooled everyone's cabs by area. Us two are the only ones living in North West London, so we're sharing the cab home. 

I walk to the cloakroom, taking care not to stagger and reveal how drunk i really am. The senior directors are still around, I cant give a bad impression. Fumbling around the pockets of my tuxedo trousers for my token. ""I'll find her as soon as I get my coat, she's probably waiting outside for me already."" I think to myself. Trying my best to muster any ounce of logic i have left.

I feel a tap on my shoulder ""Hey, there you are!"" she says, her sultry voice like music to my ears, her warm breath running down my neck, making me shiver. I spin around, shes standing behind me in the queue, my eyes quickly glancing from her heels to her face, taking in her sophisticated heels, her slender, toned legs protruding so seductively from her tight fitted, classy red dress. Her pink lips, and her long brunette hair flowing down just past her shoulders. ""Jesus"" I think to myself. She looks even more beautiful than she normally does in the office. She has to be the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen. She’s like a work of art, and I can’t take my eyes off her.

 I’ve fancied her since I joined the company just under a year ago. She was so helpful and kind when I was new, and I was so grateful to her for her help in settling in. We were both in our mid-twenties, graduates working in an investment firm. We only worked a few desks away, but we were so busy that we didn’t get a chance to speak much at work. Whenever we did though, it made my day, I loved speaking to her, she was so funny, so charming, and I was always so glad whenever I ran into her in the kitchen and had a brief 5 minute chat. She never failed to put a smile on my face. It didn’t do any harm that she was absolutely gorgeous either. About 5”4, probably around a size 6, she always wore tight fitted skirts and dresses that sent my imagination running wild. I could never really place whether she was in to me, or if she was just being kind and friendly like she was to everyone. I hoped she didn’t think I was some sort of creep. 
""Hey! There you are!"" I reply, smiling politely as I catch her eye, she smiles back. ""How are you? Have you had a good night?"" I ask. ""Yes! It was great, my heels are killing me though, i've been dancing all night, I can't wait to get in the cab and take them off!"".”Haha, yeah I bet you can't. You look a little worn out."" I reply, grinning. ""OH! Well thanks!. You're not looking too fresh either!"" she replies, pointing to my now crooked bowtie, giggling sweetly. 

""Next please"" Calls the cloakroom attendant, so engrossed in our conversation that we're both slightly surprised to find ourselves at the front of the queue. Hesitating, i gather my wits and respond ""Oh.. After you."" She smiles, and her taken to the attendant. I step up behind her, and place mine on the counter too. He returns with her coat, handing it to her. ""Just a moment, Sir, I'll just get your coat for you now"". I nod, smiling at the attendant in response. I look over, seeing her struggle to put on her coat as she holds her purse.    “Here, let me do it” I say, smirking to myself. “I put my arms out, holding her coat for her, she slides her arms in effortlessly, and wraps the black coat around herself. “Oh.. my knight in shining armour.” She remarks sarcastically. “Come on, lets go.. the cab drivers probably been waiting ages for us!” only barely containing my laughter as I speak. “Oops!” she replies. I take my coat from the attendant, holding it on my arm, thanking him as we leave the prestigious, swanky 5 star Belgravia hotel together. 

I Hold the cab door open for her, looking away instinctively to preserve her modesty as she steps into the cab. I needn’t have bothered, maintaining her ladylike elegance so effortlessly even after a long night of drinking, she steps through the door gracefully and settles down on the seat. I step through the door, stumbling clumsily into the seat beside her. “Oh dear. Did someone go a little overboard tonight” She asks innocently. Her eyes sparkling so beautifully. “Hmm. Perhaps, just a little...” “Right, I’m gonna drop you off first mate, and then her afterwards” calls the cockney driver from the front as he pulls of the car park, and onto the main road. “Oh, actually, would you mind dropping her off first, please?” I ask. Even in my drunken state remembering my parents preaching to always make sure the lady gets home safely first. “Can do mate, but it’s going to add an extra thirty minutes to the journey, and cost about 40 quid extra.” “No”, she interjects firmly. “Honestly, its fine, you don’t need to do that. Don’t be silly.” I agree very reluctantly, still not entirely comfortable with the situation. 

We settle down as the driver speeds along through central London. We spend our time catching up, it’s been several months since we had a proper catch up. She tells me about her job, she’s recently been promoted to managing a few of the younger interns. Her family, how frustrated she gets with her boss. And then we start talking about relationships. I feel so comfortable around her, so relaxed and able to speak freely. We are both in long term relationships, she’s been with her partner for about 5 years. I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 2. Somehow, the conversation gets to sex. I tell her that I haven’t had sex in over two years. “She isn’t ready,” I reveal. “It’s really hard, I try my best to not pressure her, and I want to take it at a pace she’s comfortable at. But she’s had a very traditional upbringing, and her parents have always told her it’s wrong to have sex before marriage.  It’s getting so hard for me.. It’s like torture.. I have a high sex drive…” My voice trails off.. suddenly becoming aware of my drunken rambling, scolding myself in my mind. I’m such an idiot, why am I telling her all this? She doesn’t give a shit, and she’s going to thing I’m a real loser.. Fully expecting to spend the rest of the journey in an awkward silence, I’m shocked when I hear her voice, almost a whisper, respond “I have a high sex drive too…” My heart skips a beat, I turn my neck to face her. Our faces so close to each other’s. “You’re boyfriend is the luckiest guy in the world” I respond, trying to hide any hint of jealousy. She bites her lower lip, looking me straight in the eye, did she shuffle closer to me, or did I just imagine that?. My fingers brush the bare smooth skin of her thigh ever so lightly.. And she her uncrosses her legs. Her eyes sparkling, her lips glistening.. so tantalising. We both look down to her legs, she parts them, just slightly.

My brother and I got accepted into pharmacy school but apparently we have to do some intern work that they assign to us. This can be anywhere in the state.

We have 1 car already but they said we might be separated and in that case we would need 2 cars.

I really have no requirements other than it can move. At my price range it seems like I am stuck looking at cars with over 180k miles. This is a big city where good deals seem to bought immediately. 

I do seem to see a few cars that look good but don't seem to sell which scare me. For example there are a few Ford Focuses that with 87k miles but it looks like these have problems and people suggest you avoid them. 

Can you guys maybe give be advice on what I should prioritize? I know I am very limited by my 3k budget  but can you give me tips on maybe what models I could look at or which ones I should avoid?

In the end I am hoping that I can get a confirmation from the School that we can be placed together but they havent been talking to me much since the spring semester still going. I kinda wanted to start looking now so I have an idea of what I'm looking at in the next couple months."

* Could you suggest me some colleges in Ireland (or maybe even Sweden and Finland) that have cheap tuition?

* If so do they have a late admission application deadline around late this year? Preferably Sept+? I won't be able to send my documents as my university holds them back till I finish my ongoing final semester. Weird, I know. I'd like to hear some success stories for people who have done this.

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside the fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

How can I bulk up my resume?,mastertatto,softwaredevelopment,https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/67fi9k/ive_been_applying_to_sd_internships_for_months/,"I'm currently an online student in SD going for my bachelor's.

I'm starting to wonder if my resume just isn't impressive enough, even for an undergrad internship position. 

Right now I have basic experience in Java, C++, and Python under my belt. I'm also certified in CompTIA A+ and Network+. However, I have zero hands-on experience, and everything I know comes from my classes.

Is this just not enough? Are there any other languages I should consider delving into outside of school to help bulk up my resume? What were your experiences like when you first entered your career? Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
67fkw7,33,2017-04-25,Jesus saved me,lordflynn,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/67fkw7/jesus_saved_me/,"So last week a few of my boys decided to go to my friends house for 420; he lives in a pretty nice house looking over the beach so it was perfect for the night. This was my last night with my boys before moving away to start doing my internship for university, so I was inevitably keen to get pretty fucked up.

We got there in the afternoon, ran some errands, went and got some alcohol and food for the night and got back around a couple minutes after 4:20 in the afternoon. So we start to settle in, smash a few bongs to make up for missing 4:20 etc etc. 

As the night progresses we continue smoking billy's and start drinking, playing beer pong etc etc. This continues for a few hours as we continue to get more faded before we decide to go on a walk down to the beach.

Now before we head to the beach most of us decide to do some lines of K. We are all inexperienced with it (I had done it the weekend before but that was it) and as we're trying to weigh out the lines the scales start fucking up. So we just dump 4 lines on the table and are discussing whether or not to adjust the size. 

In the end I just said fuck it and snorted a whole line and convinced my friend too as well(rookie move I know), two of the other boys decided to make their lines a little smaller, which in the end was smart.

So after railing some lines we hang out for a bit chatting and shit before we head, all feeling pretty good. As we started to head I knew I was pretty fucked up, I was unable to walk down the stairs, had to sit on my ass and drag myself down lmao. 

But fuck being a bitch I decide to tough it out and soldier on, struggling to walk but eventually we make it to this headland looking out over the beach. This is where shit went downhill.

So we sitting up on this headland and I feel like a massive pile of cow shit. I'm just sitting there eyes closed, listening to the boys chat shit. And just as I start falling into the k-hole, I have my head in knees, just listening. The boys notice a whole bunch of police and ambulance searching at the bottom of this cliff, they start to wonder what they're searching for, presuming it's a person/body.

So here I am mid k-hole and the boys are talking about some person being dead just below us. This starts tripping me the fuck out, I start to feel super sick, alcohol definitely didn't help. Anyway I just lie down in the recovery position and start vomiting everywhere. At this stage my mind is fucked, wigging out hard. 

So I finish up spewing, sit back up head in knees, still wigging out hard, listening to the boys still talk about this search going on below us. So here I am in my k-hole freaking the fuck out, feeling sick as fuck, thinking about death. Then out of nowhere in my mind I see fucking Jesus just praying for me for about a solid minute and all of a sudden I feel heaps better. 

So not long after we decide to leave, I can still hardly walk but seeing Jesus made me feel heaps better mentally and in terms of feeling sick, we eventually get back and I go lie down cuz I'm tired after that bloody experience. Just as I'm about to get up and keep partying I fall asleep and wake up around 2am and go back to smoking billy's and a couple more beers before we all go to bed. 

Next morning roll's around we're all feeling a little dusty so most of us have a few bongs to feel better. I forgot I was driving home later that night and decided to join. So later in the night I'm driving home (I live in a small country town) and spot this random breath test (for alcohol) on the way. There was no way of me avoiding it and I get pulled in and they decide to test me for drugs as well.

As soon as I pulled in I remember the bongs I smoked in the morning and thought I was absolutely screwed. Talking to the cops they were telling me the test will pick up anything from at least the last 12 hours however, if a regular smoker the traces of cannabis can stay in the system for up to two weeks. So I thought fuck, I'm definitely in shit here.

So I sat there in my car and waited for a good 15 minutes + for the results of the drug test to come back thinking I'm up shit creek. Then I started thinking of how I seen Jesus the night before and thought shit, somehow this guy might save me again here lmao. So after just sitting there for ages the cop comes back and tells me I'm clean and fuck me sideways I was so happy.

This guy jesus definitely saved me from the k-hole and then the drug test next day, I think I may have to start reading the bible and going to church on a weekend. 

TLDR; got whacked on K seen Jesus, then got drug tested the next day and past. Thx jesus bro

I'm extremely nervous about this interview because I don't have any actual experience in a company doing this. The only ""experience"" I have is what I have learned in school. I know internships are a learning experience, but I at least want to be as prepared as possible for the interview. 

In school I would remote log into the schools Linux terminal and learned about different commands and how they are used. I did well. It wasn't a Linux GUI, it was only the terminal/command line.

Its the 14th of December. Its 2am, the night is coming to an end. 

I bring my glass to my lips, finishing the last of my gin and Tonic, downing about half the glass in one go. We all put our glasses down on the table at the same time.  Me and a few of the work guys are completely smashed. A long evening of food, alcohol, cigars and dancing starting to take its toll. My phone vibrates, a notification from the minicab firm that the company had arranged the week before was 5 minutes away.  I tell the guys i'll see them tomorrow. ""8:00am sharp. Last one gets the bacon rolls in!"" we all laugh as i shake their hands and walk away

I need to find her. Our company has had a bad year, so to save money they've pooled everyone's cabs by area. Us two are the only ones living in North West London, so we're sharing the cab home. 

I walk to the cloakroom, taking care not to stagger and reveal how drunk i really am. The senior directors are still around, I cant give a bad impression. Fumbling around the pockets of my tuxedo trousers for my token. ""I'll find her as soon as I get my coat, she's probably waiting outside for me already."" I think to myself. Trying my best to muster any ounce of logic i have left.

I spin around, shes standing behind me in the queue, my eyes quickly glancing from her heels to her face, taking in her sophisticated heels, her slender, toned legs protruding so seductively from her tight fitted, classy red dress.

Our faces so close to each other’s. “You’re boyfriend is the luckiest guy in the world” I respond, trying to hide any hint of jealousy. She bites her lower lip, looking me straight in the eye, did she shuffle closer to me, or did I just imagine that?. My fingers brush the bare smooth skin of her thigh ever so lightly.. And she her uncrosses her legs. Her eyes sparkling, her lips glistening.. so tantalising. We both look down to her legs, she parts them, just slightly.

So I really need to vent without yelling at my Nmother which would only make the situation way way worse.  This story is quite long, bear with me.


Background: I am withdrawing from my spring semester of college due to BPD inhibiting my life.  It is a recent diagnoses and I've only just recently started working on the DBT workbook, and a therapist trained in CBT.


My mother is a full-blown covert narcissist.  I didn't know this while I lived at home.  My life was walking on glass, and trying to estimate how she felt constantly to keep the peace (This is how BPD develops).  I was always scared.  Failing was not an option, it meant she would hurt you.


Only recently because of my diagnoses did I realize (through research), that she isn't just a ""strict"", or ""crazy parent.""  NO.  She is a narcissist, and now that I recognize this, I see clearly why she never built me up instead of tearing me down.  Why she treats everyone around her badly because she is upset.  Why I never won an argument.  Why my words were twisted slightly, and used against me.  Why I was lied to constantly.  Why I was never apologized to, and was punished for apologizing to her when things got out of hand.


I am getting off track here.


Point is that I am in the process of withdrawing from school and getting better, mentally.


So I went to have a meeting with my advisor yesterday which I summarized neutrally in an email so that I wouldn't have to call my mom.  In this email I included the information regarding re-enrollment as well, as I need to do this ASAP to get into the right classes in the Fall.  


Well this set her off.


I am going to write the letter she wrote back to me and respond to it as I go.  Keep in mind, I have been refuting her attempts to manipulate me by not being vulnerable.  Hence my ranting here.



""Thank you for sending.  As I mentioned, Dad and I would like to have a face to face meeting with you before agreeing to re-enrollment.  You have not shown us you're quite up to the challenges of college.""

- I should mention that my Dad is not as strong of a personality as my mom, but he is overall a good guy.


""I am especially concerned about your wanting to finish up in a summer session.  You cannot graduate at the end of summer.  Graduation is only available at the end of fall or spring sessions.  Employers will be recruiting from the 2018 graduating class beginning this fall.  Most candidates have jobs lined up to start after graduation and these jobs are landed way before they graduate.""

   - First of all, you can DEFINITELY graduate at the end of a summer.  I have confirmed this with an advisor.  There are even links to the dates and times of commencement ceremonies for my school in late August online.  I have no idea where she came up with this claim.

   - Secondly, I think one of her favorite things is to remind me how well ""everyone"" else is doing in comparison to the fact that I am not.  She is aware that I have always been over-emotional and anxious.  She knows that I struggle but still very much want to earn my degree.  She does not consider that other people may have had a better support system, or an easier major.  She doesn't even consider that she is generalizing in order to ostracize me.


""You made no attempt to even try for an internship and no attempt to even discuss your academic issues with us until the 11th hour, so to speak.""

   - First: I have attended/participated in MULTIPLE career fairs.  And I have discussed attending these with her.  She even bought me interview clothes before one of them.  Thus this is a complete lie.
  
   - Second: I had explained to her that I was trying to pass a class and that it was still up in the air until after the 3rd exam.  I brought up withdrawing recently.  However, I have mentioned that I've been struggling all semester long.


""If you truly want to continue then I do not see why you cannot knock out some classes this summer session.""

   - I don't think she understands, or just doesn't care to.  I withdrew because of mental health and an over-abundance of stress.  And she doesn't want me to even take a summer-long break?  It's as though she cares zero about me getting better.  On top of the fact that it shows she does not believe that I struggled because of a mental disorder.  She has a bad image of me as some delinquent and has not been able to let this go my whole life, as my brother upholds his role as the Golden Child quite well.


""You have made this very difficult.  It has been extraordinarily expensive sending you out of state for school.  We need to know what your actual commitment is to getting this done.""

   - Oh here comes the money guilt.  She hates that she cannot brag about me to the friends she does have, and she hates that my FATHER works so hard to send me to the same school he went to because he cares about me and wants me to succeed.  I remember a time that she claimed he loved her less than he loved me because he tried to mediate a disagreement between us....

   - Blah blah blah, more about how she thinks I do not care about school even though that is just ignorance.


""BTW - [your brother] knocked it out of the park with his race"" (karting) ""yesterday.  Broke the track record.  The Bluths came to watch and cheer as well.  Sarah only has 3 more classes for her undergrad degree - since she is so far ahead they are extending her full scholarship to let her complete a masters degree as well.""

   - Oh boy.....
   - I talked to my brother about his race.  I always do, we are quite close.  He placed SECOND.  Which I'm not saying is bad or anything; I am saying that she is LYING about him breaking the track record just to inflate the fact that I am not ""breaking track records"" or anything remotely similar in greatness.

   - Okay.... The Bluths (name changed) are family friends.  My brother is dating their youngest daughter and Sarah (name changed) is my age.  One time, about 4 YEARS AGO when I was still a stupid little high-schooler I said that Sarah was ""boring"" (because she is), she doesn't have any hobbies, or get excited over much.  She never has much to say, and when she does it is about church camp or something.  This one little comment has never been dropped.  I have since been increasingly compared with her, how she does well, what vacation she went on, where she volunteered etc..  I have no problem with her and I am proud of her (I do not treat her badly, this comment was simply an expression of emotion on my part).  However, my mom has used her success as narc fuel to invalidate me for years because she knows that it bothers me.


""I know - you are two different people, but you have to understand how hard you have made it for everyone around you.""

   - This relates to the ""failing is not an option"" mantra.  My mom had a really rough life due to her own failures as a young adult and thus acts as though she is now a superstar - earning constant promotions recently, and passing her associates degree with straight A's in her 40's.  She even said she took my withdrawal PERSONALLY while on the phone the other day.

   - Failing a semester wasn't easy for me.  It's made me feel so useless and scared.  I have a ton of student loans (supposedly over $100,000 as I have been paying for my own education for 4 semesters out of state now).  And every time I fail, I become so terrified and anxious because of these loans.  I feel as though if I don't pass, my life will be ruined.  And she acts as though I CHOSE to fail just to spite her.


""I would like to fly you home for a day or two, just you - not Jake too - to discuss with us further.  We are not bringing you home to party and stay out late with your friends.  Those days are long gone.  That's why I want a short visit.""

   - Okay.. So, I present with severe anxiety and you want me to fly across country (which is extremely expensive), to a house where we don't get along when I'm there, where they will keep me from seeing my friends, and all without my support system (Jake is my boyfriend, we live together).  She talked earlier about how expensive this has been.  I don't understand why she would then want to spend a bunch of money on a conversation that is going to be comprised of her making me feel bad!!

   - Additionally, I have not snuck out in about 3 years.  Which I only did because I am home maybe twice a year, and she hates all my friends eventually for some shallow reason, and she holds grudges like mad.  So I am not usually allowed to leave the house.  And if I do hang out with these people and she finds out, she emotionally abuses me for weeks after the fact.  Thus, I leave at night, when no one needs me around, and when nobody has to know.  Regardless, this is an irrational argument.  I don't ""party"" when I am home.  I visit people I care about because I miss them.


""This is a really big thing that you have done dropping out of college.  When you review your loans in your meeting today, notice how your loans of almost $33,000 are now down to about $5,200.  You're welcome.  We wanted to try and have you loan free by graduation and have been paying these down for you.
Mom"" 

   - wHaT...

   - What?

   - My loans of $33,000??? She has told me multiple times how large they are (mentioned above).  She made me agree to pay for every semester following one that wasn't good enough grade-wise.  When I mentioned withdrawing she said that I would have to pay back my huge &gt;$100,000 dollar loan immediately and we wouldn't want that.  She let this HUGE stress weigh on me throughout every class I struggled with, through every problem I didn't understand.  Not only this but she used it threateningly to get what she wanted from me and to be in control.

   - Secondly, if you were just trying to be nice and surprise me for graduation, why didn't you wait until then to tell me.  Instead you brought it up at the exact moment I would feel worst about it, to inspire guilt in me for failing.  I mean honestly what is with the money manipulation with Narcs?

   - Lastly, she has not told me she loves me, (not even in response to me saying I love her), in about half a year now, ever since I took a nap on my last day home over thanksgiving break.  (My first post ever details how she reacted - https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5ucufu/you_may_as_well_have_not_even_come/?st=J1XOLP6K&amp;sh=60d84bda .  I don't need her to, but I know she does it on purpose.  She needs me to need her.


I guess moral of this extremely long story (sorry) is that I'm becoming more and more fed up on the daily.  Looking at photos of her makes me sick.  Getting texts from her makes my heart jump into my throat.  Everything she does is to manipulate me, invalidate me, and make me feel guilty; and no one around me (aside from Jake) sees this.  I will not be her puppet any longer!!

I do not know how to respond to this email in a way that doesn't get her going (because any response inspires the narc).  Any advice would be so appreciated.  I was thinking of ignoring everything said in the email that could have gone unsaid, and just providing any new info I had found. Let me know what you think!

Edit: she just texted me ""Any thoughts?"" from work after tracking my phone (I figured out how to get notified for this app she uses) (she won't let me disable location settings).

Edit at 4:20 (hehe), April 25th:  So I looked at the comments I have seen thus far and I have replied to her email.

   - ""I just had my meeting with the financial aid office.  There was not much more information to be obtained.  She did check my completion status and confirm with me that I am eligible to receive financial aid next year as long as I maintain above a 2.0 cumulative GPA.

   - ""I also emailed my advisor this morning and she confirmed that anyone may graduate in the summer, she also encouraged my re-enrollment soon as to get into the classes I need.  I included that information just to be thorough in my last report.

   - ""We can have a conversation with the three of us, however, it will probably be over the phone: I had an interview today, and another one scheduled for tomorrow.  Thus, if I get a job or two soon (I am aiming for two), I don't anticipate being able to travel.

   - ""The classes I am enrolled in this summer are full by now; I will not be able to get back into them in the time allotted after I turn in these forms.  Since I can graduate during the summer, and because I need a break from school, I would much prefer enrolling in summer semester 2018.

   - ""Tell [brother] and Sarah that I say Congratulations; I am very proud of both of them. [Brother] really has a knack for racing!

   - ""Lastly, thank you for paying off my loan.  It will be so nice not to worry about that so heavily anymore.  I appreciate it.

   - ""[My name]""


I agree that I need to gray rock her.  I think it is the only way that I can draw boundaries and not look like the bad guy.  I tried to be as neutral as possible, and to not let it show how much she hurt me.  I pretty much played dumb, such a rush.

Luckily I have a lot more confidence lately since I have realized her true colors because I know the temper tantrum WILL come.  But while that is terrifying, I will hold my ground.
I also made a list of things I need to do in order to support myself, and I even got called back for another interview tomorrow ((:

Thank you all so much for your support and kind words.  With all of your support I feel so much more determined to free myself.

 Final Edit (7:25 PM, April 25): She did not reply to my email, but instead, looked up a photo of a seller on Ebay selling their EDC ticket (the festival I was supposed to go to, but didn't get to because of BPD), and attached the image saying that she hopes I'm selling my tickets so that I at least cover what I spent (with my own money, entirely, btw).  Completely unrelated and obviously pointed at trying to hurt me (again), but at this point she is scrambling and confused, I have never made it this far. *Smiles*"

67hgnx,15,2017-04-25,10 Years,PaulMatthews78,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/67hgnx/10_years/,"It occurred to me today that this month marks 10 years since I officially deconverted. It was in 2007 that I stopped regularly going to church and accepted that I no longer believed. This was after a gradual process of deconversion that lasted about 6 years. Sadly it left me stuck with a ministry degree that I have no desire to use and all the student loan debt that came with it, but I don't regret deconverting. 

I grew up in the church. I was indoctrinated from a young age and bought into it fully to the point that I wanted to become a preacher. However, it was getting that degree that started my path to deconversion. I was taking classes on the bible that opened my eyes to scriptures that preachers never did sermons about. I admit that prior to college I had never fully read the bible so it was a shock to the system. The next shock came when I did a preaching internship at a church and saw what goes on behind the scenes. An arrogant preacher who hand picked his yes-men elders to surround himself with really turned me off the whole venture. By my senior year I realized I had made a mistake in choosing that major, but it was too late. I had already changed my major once and took too many loans. I went into a depression about my future.

I clung to Christianity for a few more years out of fear of hell. It wasn't until I met an atheist co-worker who put things in perspective that I realized it was all BS. Deconverting was a weight off my shoulders. I still struggle with depression, but ridding myself of the guilt and fear of religion helped immensely. "

1) How hard is it to later change majors? For reference, I plan on changing mine to computer science.
2) How hard is it to get internships?
3) Is it feasible to live on campus or near the campus without a car (aka relying on public transportation)?
4) How hard is it to find jobs out of Florida post graduation?
5) Is it manageable to do 15 credits per semester while maintaining at least a 3.0GPA and working?
6) Now one for the international students: how hard is it to find a job while on a student visa?

I work on a team that has been using Deep Learning for problems such as classification, object detection etc.
We are looking to expand our team and considering hiring an intern this summer. I am looking for suggestions for an intern project. Something that a college senior can handle in about 12 week timeframe with guidance from research scientist and engineers. Ideally, it would be something that can be solved using classic ML techniques as well as Deep Learning techniques. Part of the project would be to explore all options and propose the most appropriate one or a combination of solutions.
My questions are;

For those of you who have taken up an internship involving ML/DL projects;

* What was your project about?
* How much background (academic or otherwise) did you have in that field ?
* Is there something that you would've liked to work on?

For those of you who have mentored interns working on ML/DL projects;

* What was the project about ?
* For an intern with little to no industry experience, how much coaching/mentoring would be required (for ex; is it reasonable to expect them to do a research on state of the art and come up with options) ?

This would be the first time my team is looking to hire an intern so any tips would be useful.

Thanks"

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that its destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return millennia ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was out of the question.

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a decade and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Hi guys. I'm a 22 Yr Old College Senior about to graduate University. I'm struggling right now with a lot of things at once, but I want to break them down bit by bit and want pointers toward the right directions in terms of solving my issues and problems with self-motivation and work ethic.

So brief story of my youth. I'm a Korean-American who lived in New Jersey most of their life. I had a difficult time when I was younger. My family has been together for my entire life with my dad, my mom, and my younger brother. My dad was irritable and angry about everything (nothing below an A, mistakes like breaking glass, accidentally scratching his car, etc.) and if I did those things he would fly out into angry rage and beat me and yell at me calling me worthless, stupid, retarded, and someone who wouldn't survive the real world if he wasn't covering my ass. My mom wasn't too much better either, my dad would rail on her as well, then she would either take it out on me or tell me dad what I did and throw me under the bus so she wouldn't get as intensely attacked by my dad. I feel like my dad has some sort of mental disorder. This ""mental disorder"" along with my mom's poor financial/business decision making put her and my dad into $1 million dollars of debt (which happened when I was 1-2 years old). This led to my dad just constantly picking verbal arguments with my mother and later my dad being angry at me like scratching his car and beating me or using corporal punishment to discipline me. This severely affected my natural curiosity as I learned more and more that exploration was seen as a potential liability for my parents. I also had no place to go back to for comfort as a child as going back to my workaholic/toxic parents didn't really give me any sort of ""pat on the back"" or ""good job"" for doing what infants and little children do best. So tl;dr I was abused and also had no emotional support as a child. All both my parents cared about were perfection (clean house, clean image with brand name clothes, dad wanted me to go into law, mom wanted me to get into an Ivy League School, etc.) and this contrasted with many of my white classmates and friends who were provided a lot of things by their parents, were free to explore the world, and had no worries about saving money or finances. This was even more compounded by my dad introducing me to video and computer games at a young age (like 3 and 4) and then later yelling at me for being unable to control myself as a child. This was a very confusing time from elementary school and middle school.

This changed a bit in high school when I tried super hard. I entered a well-known high school in New Jersey and people started to notice I was a part of that school. I was self-motivated because I wanted to go to that school for fencing since it was the only school that offered fencing that I could apply to due to where I lived. I got in and I was incredibly motivated to stay in school because my dad would accept nothing below straight A's since it was a private school he needed to pay for. I succeeded, I got straight A's and I was a varsity starter for the fencing team there (when I cam in it was the first year where the school qualified for states in like 2 or 3 years). Afterward, I was really happy for a while: All my teachers appreciated my work ethic and kindness, my peers respected me for my dedication, and my fencing coach was constantly encouraging me to do my best. However, it changed during junior year. I was in AP courses and I was really challenged there, many concepts and ideas in those classes I could not grasp or understand and I was very frustrated with the work there because I couldn't just grind at it until I understood it. My classmates in AP were pretty aloof and pretentious and they thought they were the best and scorned my work ethic thinking I was a dumb try hard Asian who wasn't actually smart and didn't deserve to be in that class. When my coach left my school in order to open his new club for fencing, our team was also left without a coach and the team's structure was rearranged, leading to some changes that I was very uncomfortable with and caused my father to get angry at the coach for leaving, my team for making changes, and me for not being powerful enough to take over the entire team (I became the team captain next year anyway by vote). From my junior to senior year I cruised, I slept in class, I stayed up late for no good reason except get emotional and listening to Paramore and Blink 182, and I slacked off on work till the last minute. I got a mix between A's to B+'s, which my dad got super passive aggressive about, but he didn't rail on me too hard for those times though for some reason. 

Fast-Forward to college. I was pretty much planning my grand comeback. I wasn't accepted to the Ivy's, but I was accepted to NYU. I decided to study abroad in Shanghai cause my teachers, my dad, and my family friends hyped up that China was the future and if I knew Chinese it would be a tremendous asset to my skills and allow me to easily find work. My dad wanted me to study poli-sci and law in order to become a lawyer and follow the path to a CIA agent or a US Diplomat. I followed all of this with zeal believing I would get the same feelings I had my freshman years of high school. The goals were set: Get straight A's, travel China on my free time, and get internships. I thought again that I could grind at it and eventually get it. I was wrong, dead wrong. Shit started falling apart very quickly. I couldn't get and internship as a freshman, getting straight A's took a lot of time because I'm not naturally good at memorizing and reading large volumes of text so I couldn't travel, and even straight A's were out of reach because Chinese was such a bitch of a language and class to learn/take. First semester came through and I got a B+ on Chinese. My dad was super passive aggressive about the B+ and was like ""well, you could have done better if you tried harder"" I was so upset with everything and the second semester I burnt out so hard I had to be hospitalized and take the rest of the semester off because I was suicidal. 

Fast forward to now: I cruised by the rest of that time choosing a psych major cause it was an ""easy major"" and also because I realized that me, my parents, and my family may have problems and I wanted to find an explanation behind it all and I believed Psych would give me the answers to my problems. I also took Japanese to fill my language requirement (2 years) because I was a weeb and thought I knew my shit, but I regret it immensely because the language was incredibly difficult, I actually didn't know shit, and I didn't learn by then that I'm horrible at memorizing even with grind. I'm graduating about a year late. I took a year off to work at different internships and part-time jobs to get a feel for how shit the grind is at lower level jobs and to understand the value of money (which to be honest I didn't really feel since I spend a lot still). I managed to get about four internships over that year and previous summers, one in law, two in two different fields of psych, and one in IT. I'm glad I did take the year off, because now I know how hard work is, how much money I would want to take home, and the urgency of my situation right now. 

So right now I'm having a hard time motivating myself to do things, I'm sorry for the long wall of text before about my past, but it plays into the killing of my motivation cause my parents made me into a self-destructive perfectionist and now with my girlfriend I'm repairing the damage my parents did for the entirety of my life.

So now here's the lay down of my situation:

Bad:

- Dad is railing on me hard to get employment ASAP (literally right out of college) because he did it and he also had to support himself through college and said if he could do it I could do it. (My mom told me that he wasn't a straight A student like me, so he's an asshole and a hypocrite so I'm able to rationalized it). He doesn't want to support me financially (which is reasonable, I don't want to leech off my parents, that's really dick to do), but he's expecting me to get a well paying job and to be completely independent of him and my mom AS SOON AS I'M OUT OF COLLEGE.
- Even though I was straight A, my GPA has tanked. As of now I'm barely passing my last classes. These classes are incredibly difficult and work intensive. Doesn't help I try to avoid it by playing games and just lolly-gagging with my girlfriend all the time.
- I barely have any money left in savings (about $300) from spending on vidya. This was kind of bouncing back from all the years of missing on limited events my parents would never let me play in, I missed exclusives and stuff. Now all those years of not being able to get things, it came back out and cut into my savings which stood at like $3000 earlier.
-My resume and job experience is all over the place. The 4 internships I mention before, plus a 3.1 GPA Psych Degree, plus a CompTIA A+ Certification makes it hard to market myself to a specific job since I look like a jack of all master of none.
- I commute from my home in NJ to NYC for school. I'm exhausted everyday, I have to cook for myself, clean the house and pay the bills (with my parents money, but I basically have to do their accounting) in order to stay at their house in NJ, and barely have the motivation anymore to study in university because this process is so exhausting and difficult. 
- Because of my commute and my living location I can never hang out with my friends for nights or weekends out, money is tight because my mother allocates an allowance I have to pay bills, buy food with for me and my girlfriend, and pay for my subway/bus passes. This makes me a bit more anti-social, even though I'd like to hang out with them more, I can't. Sometimes it gets lonely.
- Unstable emotional states and lack of intrinsic motivation or things to look forward to make it very, very difficult for me to maintain a good work ethic and not default to escaping games such as League or Overwatch.
- Along with the above, I like to manipulate and dissect ""motivation tips."" For example, I'll ""reward"" myself with a game of League, but then end up playing a lot of games of League, excusing myself saying I did a lot of work even though it wasn't much. So I self-sabotage a lot of times and I don't know how to stop myself from doing it.

Good:

- I do have a CompTIA A+ Certification and currently working on my Network+ Certification. I'm aiming toward IT and I really want to work in that field because the studying doesn't feel like a grind and everything that I learn there just feels very intuitive. I want to get my Security+ and Cisco Associate certs.
- Even though my dad wants to kick me out, my mom owns the title for the house. She says that my dad cannot call the police on my to kick me out and she can call the police herself if he flies into a fit of physical rage while he's at their NJ home.
- Currently both parents live in Alabama/Tennessee for work reasons and move back and forth between the states. My parents only come back up here at NJ for taxes now, so they won't bother me.
- After an argument and a long talk with my mom, we've come to terms and she's warmed up to me a lot. She said she's willing to let me stay in her house (the one I'm living in right now) while I get myself situated and wait for my girlfriend to graduate. She's even willing to let my girlfriend stay at her house while she finishes her business degree at Stern.
- I have a car, there's a few conditionals where there's a lot of car swapping (my parents have 6 cars for no good reason). 3 cars are junk work cars, but they're willing to give me one of their decent car (mom is pushing for this hard on my dad). The car she wants me to have is the Toyota Camry 2010 LE, it has 120k miles, but its a good starting car so I don't have to pay for my own car for at least the first few years I'm working.
- I have a girlfriend who has been very supportive and given me the confidence and bravery to ask help on reddit and therapists about advice on how to proceed. She's lazy and a gamer like me, but she's willing to support me if I go grind hard on work and furthering my career and would be inspired by my hard work and work hard herself if I took the initiative.

So like I'm at this point where I'm stuck in terms of motivation. There's a lot on my plate as a 22 year old in terms of emotional stress. I know I'm not in the worst of the worst of situations, I have friends who would kill to have a place to stay or a car to use for work, but the pressure to make money and keep moving forward is really hard for me, its like an invisible wall of laziness and excuses is clouding my judgement. My primary goal is to pass my classes and graduate on time, then look for work immediately while studying for my Network+ Certification in June. I know the first step to fixing this is becoming financially independent, but what scares me is after that. How do I maintain motivation that's positive and focused without that fear of my dad anymore? How do I foster a sense of self-worth and goals I want to pursue? How do I find out what I want to do with my life in order to become someone who positive and constantly looking forward in their life instead of looking back at the past?

Again sorry for the big wall of text redditors, this is my first time ever reaching out to reddit for personal help and advice and I didn't know if this was the right place to post this. I would appreciate any directions or advice in terms of where to go with my life. 

Again thank you guys and I hope you guys have a great day! ^__^

I am a 24-year-old student, graduating on doing an 6 months internship in Bangkok. I'm currently looking for a place to live but I do not know where in Bangkok would be the best neighborhood to live. I know where to find the apartments but I wonder where living as a student would be best. I have read a lot of information from expats but that often does not fit my budget and standards. My budget would be around 15000thb and my work is around the Lumpini park.

I bought a PC roughly 8 months ago. Specs included below. I just returned from a holiday and suddenly my PC is having massive FPS problems with all games. Prior to my holiday everything was working perfectly fine; I run BF1 on Ultra for instance, but now I cant even make 20 FPS (With CPU usage only at 20%, not sure if it was always like that). 


I've already tried a complete reinstall of my drivers, I checked for dust. Temps are fine, at least theyre not overheating (perhaps theyre even on the low end, i just checked Overwatch and the GPU was at 40 when normally it would be up to 60). CPU and memory usage in task manager looks normal. 


I did not install anything right before I left or since I returned, but also checked for malware and virusses just in case. There was one windows update, also tried uninstalling that but didnt seem to make a difference. 

Here's my specs:

-Intel Core i5-6600K / 3.5 GHz 

-MSI Z170A GAMING M3 

-8GB Kingston HyperX FURY - DDR4

-Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1060 G1 Gaming 6G (rev. 1.0)

-Antec High Current Gamer HCG-520 - Voeding (intern)



For what it's worth, there was some ticking noise coming from my PSU occasionally at some point in the past but then that stopped and everything continued to work fine. Perhaps that's related and my PSU is to blame? Everything is under warranty but I take I wont be able to return it unless Ive ruled out other possible causes.

Any help would be much appreciated!"
67isw8,2,2017-04-25,[24/M] Don't know if I should stay with my girlfriend (23/f) after some life changing events when we have different life plans/personalities.,throwaway123001234,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/67isw8/24m_dont_know_if_i_should_stay_with_my_girlfriend/,"Hi all, I really hate to do this, but I really need some advice right now and most of my friends are equally as close with my girlfriend as they are with me.

To begin, my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for nearly 5 years now, on and off. Every time we've taken a break, I've been the one to initiate it. We met in high school, dated throughout college, and moved in together right after graduation to Oregon.

Living together was great. In a lot of ways we balanced each other out, I'm very sporadic, she's very organized. We would hang out most weekdays and weekends, smoking weed, maybe drinking a couple of beers watching tv or whatever. Sometimes we'd go out, do stuff outdoors, etc.  It was comfortable, but somewhat boring. I found myself constantly daydreaming about moving abroad, doing something crazy, whatever.

Fast forward a year and a half and my dad dies very suddenly. Him and I were super close, talking a couple of times a week, making each other crack up, etc. Obviously, I was quite shaken up and probably will be for years to come. After all the ceremonies, a couple of weeks with my mom and brother, I moved back in with my girlfriend.

At this point, things were going just about as well as possible after the loss of a close love one. My girlfriend was very supportive as was my manager. Things kind of went back to normal, when out of nowhere the company I was working had to do massive layoffs. I knew exactly what was coming when my manager called me in to let me go.

Getting let go sucked, but I tried to see the positive in the situation by letting myself relax for a bit. While my girlfriend went to work, I sat at home, played video games and smoked weed. It was nice, but after about a week and a half I was incredibly bored. I started looking for jobs and realized how little I wanted to commit living in the city that I was in. On a whim, I applied to an internship abroad and got a couple of days later.

I moved using money from my dad's life insurance and that's where I am now. I'm happier than ever, but in a lot of ways more confused than ever. I realized after about a month of living here that I don't miss my girlfriend at all. I know she misses me because she consistently skypes me crying and messages me talking about how she needs me home, etc. I feel terrible about it. She's a great person, I love her, honestly but I barely think about her. I know it sounds horrible, but I've been having so much fun, feeling closer to myself than ever. Interacting with her feels more like a burden than something to look forward to.

I have a month left in the program, but feel like I need to live here full time once I figure out my visa stuff. I can't imagine moving back home with her, not because it is bad or anything, just because it sounds so boring. I don't know what to do about this and I need your advice. Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks in advance."

First, i'd like to point out I read the sidebar and the info, my questions are more something the locals could give better answers for.

So my girlfriend got accepted into an Internship and will be spending winter in Australia, and of course, a lot of questions arise. 

1. She found a place in Redfern however, her friend warned her that it's a ""gang area"" Is it really? if so how dangerous is it? does 250 AUD / Week sound like a good deal to you? 

2. Expenses! How does it work is there anything we should take into account other than the 32.5c tax for every dollar she earns? (other than food and rent)
(source: https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Individual-income-tax-rates/?page=1#Foreign_residents)  

3. How hard would it be in theory for me to score some job to work in a cafe or something similar? I'm studying computer science at the moment and I'm a former interaction designer/web dev so perhaps that could be of interest somewhere.

Other than that I hope to meet up with some of you guys on a Reddit event, seems like you guys are quite active with such stuff :) 

Thanks for taking your time!"
67j7f9,10,2017-04-25,Farming (Part 1?),A_Decent_Man,CollapseSupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollapseSupport/comments/67j7f9/farming_part_1/,"I am WWOOFing right now. For those who don’t know, this is a work-trade program which allows me to intern on organic farms, where I receive room and board in exchange for labor. [Look here](http://wwoof.net/). I am currently located near the Northern Cascades of Western Washington. Some of you expressed you may have some interest in hearing about my experience so I figured I would share it with you. Even if you didn’t previously, hopefully you can gleam something from this writing and I welcome your participation 😊 I am going to use a bulleted list for this post (and any potential subsequent ones) because I find them easier to write and also easier for you to engage with.

•	Living pretty rustically. Not excessively by any means, but certainly for my standards. I live in what is self-described as an intentional community, in a shared living space with one other WWOOFer. We have our own rooms but a shared kitchen. The walls are thin. I piss in the yard and poop from one story up into a composting bin. No wifi, data is hit and miss, and there is not enough electricity to power a microwave. No hot water. We heat a kettle using propane for all of our needs. I go days without bathing. There is a sauna constructed on-site, though, that I have used to wash myself in once so far. 

•	Animals abound. There is a dog, 4+ cats around at any given time, and one of them ‘mews’ like none other, often waking me up at 2AM. There are mice. I look after 7 ducks and 13 chickens, and a lack of fresh eggs is never an issue. I enjoy living around animals. They don't have to think about existence too much. They are just sort of naturally inclined by their instinctual programming. The farm owners are practically vegan, though, so there are no meat animals. I am entirely vegetarian while on the farm, though, and it has been a nice switch. I have never taken more notice of how much meat I consume while home with the family.

•	I work 6 hours a day for 5 days a week. This is flexible, though, in case I need certain days off or need an extended leave, like to see friends in the area for example. The work is never too demanding, atleast so far in the early season. I am sure once the weather warms even more and the garden starts flourishing, things will really be getting going.

There is more to share, but I think I will save it for later as I continue to get a better idea of my life here. 

Lastly, I wanted to touch on where my head is at. Since graduating from college a month ago, and even in the months leading up to it, I have felt directionless and a sense of anxiety stemming from that. The other WWOOFer who I will be rooming with for the length of the season is a relatively new, yet committed practitioner of meditation, specifically Vipassana or insight meditation. I have been experimenting with meditation for about 5 years and have got a lot from it. But I was never really in a stable enough time or place to really incorporate the practice into my lifestyle. Now, though, having someone to encourage me, and being in a location and having the time that allows for it, I feel ready to bring it back around. I am reading from the Dhammapada and the Tao Te Ching. I am noticing benefits, even 10 days later, and I want to keep pursuing that. I am even making plans to attend a retreat this fall once the season wraps.

I am just a layperson, but for those struggling, I would strongly encourage finding ways to come to terms with your innate spirituality, and try and carve out some form of a meditative practice. In a society punctuated by greed, overconsumption and resource overshoot, I take solace in the words of those who have recognized long ago that Life is Suffering. And there is a path towards reconciliation. As my life allows, it would be my pleasure to discuss any of this with you, and hopefully we can encourage one-another.

He also posted an update on FB: https://www.facebook.com/lukesultralite/

&gt; LUL update and status

&gt; I would like to start by saying that I'm extremely sorry to the customers that have, or had to wait extra time to get there order. The last few months have been very hard on me personally. The company had grown way faster than i ever thought and well..... got completely overwhelmed and honestly should have tried to hire more people. But I'm so so picky about my stitching that it poses a challenge getting the help i need. 

&gt; The main Reason for the delay, i was involved in 2 car wrecks within a 1 month period and my lead sewer left for a college internship. Right after this, Paypal ( Which i had done business with for a very very very long time) decides to not be our payment processor anymore, for reasons i am still battling. This posing all kinds of problems even and up to allowing me to print shipping labels. Any way! We now have a new payment processing system and are doing our absolute best to get things back on track. I sincerely apologize for the delay. if you cannot wait and would like a refund that is completely fine. Just shoot me a quick email and ill get your money back. 

&gt; Overall the business grew much faster than i had prepared for and thus causing a few problems. I was completely overwhelmed with emails and production. 

&gt; I hate being left in the dark and to those of you that did, i am sorry and will gladly give you a refund if you'd like. 
We are just recovering from this little set back and wanted to thank our loyal customers.

 specifically to East Palo Alto. I have an internship out there so I'll be living and working there till December. I could really use some advice / suggestions regarding training and racing out there.

My target race at the moment is the SF marathon. I'll be trying to get down towards 2:30, though it's my debut marathon on a hilly course, so not sure how close I'll actually get. (Half PB is sub 1:12, and ideally I'd like to get close to 1:11 next month) Normally I'm a 5k / 10k / Half distance guy, but I also race a lot of XC and a few hill races as well. So I'm interested in getting involved in the trail running scene as well. 

Training wise I'd like to continue doing 2 quality sessions / workouts a week, plus a sweet long run at the weekends. Rest of the week would be easy with a couple of doubles. So it would be nice to have some company for the workouts or some of the easy miles.

Please bombard me with all the info you can, as it would be a huge help and I'm pretty clueless at the moment!

-Any clubs in the area? Where / when they train?
-Any running groups I could get involved with?
-Any races you can recommend (on or off road!)

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside the fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

So I just turned 23 a month ago and it finally set in that I have no idea what I should be doing with my money.

Like I said I am 23 and for the last few years I have been taking classes at a local community college and working as well. I live with my sister so I only pay for my car and insurance. As of right now I have a few thousand in my savings and what I assume is an okay credit score. I do have 3 credit cards tho. I only really use 1 since it has a decent cash back on purchases but I try and never let it go over $500 or 20-25% of my limit. The other card I have had since I was 18 and I dont really use it but I have a high limit so I like to keep it as an emergency card but it does have a $30 a year fee. 

Anyways, in the fall I am transferring to a 4 year school and going to be majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Since I am doing engineering I am looking at my loans as a sort of investment in my future. Mainly because I don't have much help other than an Aunt who is willing to cosign for my loans to finish. Luckily I am only gonna have to pay for about 10k a year in tuition and housing and then living expenses. I plan on working while in school and have a few connections with possible paid internships. 

So basically I am looking for some direction for what I should be doing with any extra money Ill have and what to do with any internship pay or extra loan money...This is probably rough and hard to follow haha I am new to reddit. Thanks!!

67loaf,2,2017-04-25,I could use someone to listen and talk to,lolcatfiesta,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/67loaf/i_could_use_someone_to_listen_and_talk_to/,"I struggle to talk about these things in person. So I thought it might be freeing to speak online because it's been getting harder and more exhaustive every day to stay positive. I've never truly felt comfortable to share everything with one person so I would like to put it here and get some guidance. 

Depression and anxiety is something that was passed on from my grandfather, to my dad, and then to me. However, I wasn't aware of this until I was older.

The first time I reached out for help was when I was 18. I had just ended my first relationship that lasted about three years of high school. High school relationships are often immature, but that relationship shaped me in a lot of ways. My boyfriend was very vocal about how he felt about my body. If I gained weight, it didn't go unnoticed. I think it really shaped my self worth. I know I'm worth more than what my weight is, but I can't help feel disgusted with myself over diet and exercise. Things got physical after we broke up. I was 18 when he confronted me at a friends house and dragged me by my hair up a driveway. A few months later he forced himself on me at a party. I'm so embarrassed by it.  I feel like I can't speak about it. I don't want people to view me as a liar or dramatic. I said I didn't think it was a good idea and I didn't want to do this but then it was just like this pure shock of what was happening and I never even fought back.  I wasn't aware of what abuse was at the time and looking back I always feel a lot of shame.

I never told my mom what happened but I did tell her I was struggling mentally. I did reach out to my school counselor at the time but I felt very uncomfortable with her, like she just didn't want to help me. My mom told me to ask my obgyn for anxiety medication. She prescribed me lexapro. It made me jittery and almost made me feel worse. I didn't last on it. I never try to reach out to my mom about these things anymore. She doesn't take me seriously and I never felt like I could open up to her about anything like this. 

I now live in New York City. I graduated college last year and I've had a rough year. My grandmother passed away last May after my college graduation and a few months later, my cousin and his wife committed suicide together. It was devastating for my family. My grandfather has been in a slow deterioration ever since with memory loss. 

My work life is difficult. I started a job last year and soon left due to my boss. He made unreasonable requests and was often inappropriate. I always thought it was me being inadequate for the job, but the two replacements they hired after me soon quit as well. Out of options, I took a 12 month internship that was supposed to lead to a full time hire after the year ended. I'm just now learning that I was told a lot of false promises when I took the position and there most likely wont be space for me in the next few months. I took a pay cut and have been struggling to get by and was depromoted for this position. I was promised so many things if I could just get through the 12 months. I feel I wasted my time and I'm still in debt from college. 

I went on Zoloft and last year as well. It made me gain a lot of weight which has been very hard for my self esteem and self worth. I had been seeing the counselor and psychiatrist through my college but I can't go there anymore. 

The hardest part for me is the inability to sort out my emotions. I feel so overwhelmed and I can't tell if I'm sad or angry. I feel a hopelessness that I'll never truly be in a good place. I also feel a lot of guilt for feeling so sad when I have a good life. My parents love me (although they have been resenting me for having to help me out with my pay cut). My boyfriend loves me and is good to me as well. I have friends, but I have a hard time making an effort to get closer with them. I don't have anyone I truly feel comfortable sharing all of this with. I always wonder if this is how everyone feels and I'm just unaware because it's so easy to not talk about what's really happening underneath the facade of every day life. 


I'm not sure I can continue on feeling this way. I've been finding it harder to avoid turtling (avoiding responsibilities and laying in bed) from everyone and everything. I don't know what steps to take from here. I'm having difficulty seeing the best way to get my life on track.

67m6to,19,2017-04-26,Series finished,leftwing421,community,https://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/67m6to/series_finished/,"Just finished up watching the whole series for the first time.  I don't know anyone that has seen the show and want to talk about it with someone, so this whole post will likely be pretty rambly.

I loved the whole series, even the 'bad' episodes were great for me.  The hilariously clever writing and the realistic characters got me more emotionally invested than I have with any other show besides maybe GoT.  The writing style of Dan Harmon gave a different feel than maybe any other TV show I've seen besides Rick and Morty (for obvious reasons).  I just wanted to go through some thoughts on the show as a whole/

1. Abed as a character is one of, if not the, best TV character I've ever seen.  Completely unique and feels like such a real person I felt like I was going through some of his struggles myself.  I also find it hilarious that for someone that admits to not understanding other people or how to interact with them he becomes 2, arguably 3, study group member's best friends.

2. Jeff was also a really interesting one for me.  On the surface, he seems like a semi standard TV/movie character of the sarcastic and charismatic leader with underlying mental issues.  Despite this, Joel McHale and Dan Harmon did a really good job bringing the character to life and not just seeming like all the other characters like that.  A lot of the life lessons he goes through are stuff everyone can relate to, which leads up to the finale..

3. I loved the finale, and I don't think it could've been ended in a better way.  It did what Community did best, combine humor with some seriousness.  I loved the final message that at the end of the day not everything works out the way you want it to, and that's OK.  Life keeps moving, people leave.  The Jeff/Annie ending was also very satisfying while also being somewhat sad.  Of course I wish there could've been some romantic happy ending there, but this feels more realistic, the timing is just a little off.  I have seen stuff online about Dan Harmon saying they do end up together, so we'll just have to see (Do people consider stuff writers say after the show like this as canon?  Just curious).

4. That does bring me to my next point though.  The way I see it, Annie is almost certainly coming back to Greendale for the next year.  I could be wrong, but I don't remember seeing anything about her finishing her forensics degree, and as great of an opening an internship is for someone with Annie's work ethic, she would have to finish that degree to actually get a real job out of it.  I understand her leaving was largely symbolic of people moving on from Jeff, but still I'd have to think she'll be back, even if it's just for a semester.

5. All in all, I don't think there was a single character I didn't enjoy.  I thought season 1 Chang was one of the funniest characters I've ever seen.

6. Remedial Chaos Theory is one of the best episodes of TV I've ever seen, but my favorite episode would have to be Paradigms of a Human Memory.  Idk why, but I love that episode.

All in all it was a hell of a ride through the whole series and I'm glad I did it.  Thanks to anyone that actually read all this and to anyone that replies!"

He seems to be lusting after co-worker with blue eyes, was emotionally cheating on brown eyes with her, continued contact with her and  admits to masturbatory fantasies after confronted about emotional cheating. 

Brown Eyes wants to know if this is something she can and should work through with her partner, or is this relationship doomed to end with her being dumped for a blue eyed girl? 

Hey, so I'm having some issues with my relationship lately, and I'm hoping that people on here will share offer advice and outsider input.

August 2015:
My bf and I met as roommates - started off as friends, hung out with each other a lot. I thought he was cute (not my usual type, but cute) and he thought similarly about me. One thing led to another one night after a few drinks and the sex was amazing. So after a few weeks, I told him that I really liked him, but that I was looking for a relationship and not really interested in anything casual, did he want that as well? He said yes (hesitantly as he was in the process of graduating from the school where I had just started meaning that we wouldn't be living in the same city a few months from then). So we started more officially dating and I found out how that he has a really kinky side involving tights, body encasement, and remote vibrators as a sexual fantasy that he likes to act out (this is fetish 1 and not an issue in our relationship).

December 2016 and January 2017:
He goes away for the holidays and takes a post-graduation trip abroad. He still texted and called me, including on New Years, to talk with me. Once he got back to the states, he invited me down to his parent’s place to hang out (I live in the cold Midwest and his parents live in tropical paradise). His parents weren’t thrilled to meet me; apparently, he caught them by surprise by inviting me down and that he had a girlfriend. Overall, it went pretty terribly – I was nervous about meeting his family so soon and worried that they wouldn’t like me as I’m from a very working class family and he is not, they were apparently surprised and felt left out of his life (I think). They have since seemed to warm up to me, and I genuinely enjoy hanging out with them, so all is good now on that front.

March 2015:
We were doing long distance (he now lives 5 hrs away), we are talking everyday, texting several times a day, going to visit each other at least once a month. He relationship requested me on Facebook, etc., then, in May, I went down for the summer to intern in the city where he now lives.

May 2015:
We kept dating, however I discovered that despite the implications of the FB relationship request, he had immediately after moving he had set-up an online dating profile, had messaged and gone a date with a girl from that site a week earlier. He claimed that he had gone out with her because he was uncertain about us (I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to move to his city for the summer because I hadn’t found a job at that point). He said that as soon as he went on the date he realized that he had made a mistake. However, he also mentioned, when asked why he knew it was a mistake, that the woman had turned out to be curvier than pictured and he didn't find her attractive. 

I decided to forgive him as he made the case that he had been lonely and as we had only been dating for around 4 months at that time, so he wasn't certain that things would work out. I figured, ""fair enough, new city with few friends, life changing transition from school to work, etc."" we dated the whole summer spending pretty much everyday hanging out together. I thought everything was fine, we'd hit a little hiccup but worked through it and all was well. 

August 2016:
Then enter J. - new co-worker of his and looks more or less exactly like every girl that he's ever mentioned of being ideal. She's petite, blue eyed (I’ll get to the part where I learn it’s a fetish later), ivy league degree. He didn't mention any of this, just that he had a new coworker named J. and that she went to Yale. Also, that she had had a famous prof. and he was jealous of that. I found out what she looked like by going to one of his company dinners. I showed up (invited by him) and he told me that unlike he had expected it was a sit-down affair at a long table (not an open bar) and he wasn't sure that I would want to stay as I was the only non-company person. He asked if I wanted to stay, and as I wanted to meet his colleagues, I decided to grab one drink with them. We went over to the table and he was sitting across from J. Prior to her joining the firm, he had never really mentioned coworkers to me. During the dinner he talked to her a lot, seemed very attentive in conversation and less physically close to me than usual. 

After we left, based on her appearance and his demeanor, I said to test the depths of my intuition, ""That's your dream girl isn't it?"" and he responded: ""I think she's out of my league."" He claims he meant this in the she has an ivy league degree and I don't sense, however I don't believe him.

November 2016:
 A few months went by, he started mentioning her more and more, so I got very suspicious, started asking pointed questions, then eventually (super suspicious) I went through his phone and found out that he was texting and fb messaging with her at least five times a day (admittedly he was texting me roughly the same and I frequently texts people a lot), as well as talking in the office (five days a week) and going out to lunch with her several times a week. Additionally, he had been lying about going out with her after work to social events and generally hiding the extent of his contact and relationship with her from me for about 3 months at that point in time. 

We had a huge fight. I completely lost my temper and broke his phone... and screamed, and cried. I said “we were broken up” and he said “ok”. I said something along the lines of ""that's how little our relationship means to you?"" to which he said ""no, but that he agreed with me that he had behaved terribly and that I should dump him."" But as I looked at him, realized that I would be losing my best friend, playmate, and one of the most intellectually stimulating people whom I have dated, as well as a cute man, so I grabbed him and told him ""that I didn't want to lose him, that I was sad and angry about his actions."" 

We had a very long talk about it, several long talks, and he apologized. He said ""that he didn't really think of flirting as a big deal because he hadn't ever gotten anywhere with it in the past"", that he had told himself ""as long as nothing physical happens, it's not cheating"" and had hidden it from me ""because he knew given my initial reaction that I was threatened by her and would be suspicious given the prior online dating actions, so he didn't want to upset me by telling me about their friendship"", my response was to point out that he had gotten me to date him with similar flirting, therefore it obviously worked. He agreed to cease being so friendly and flirtatious with her, however he insisted (as they were coworkers and he was worried about his job) to talk to her about the situation first before ceasing hanging out with her. 

I don’t know how the actual conversation went, however he told me that it went like this: 
Him –“I ended up bumping into her in the building lobby just now and we talked very briefly in the elevator a minute ago. 
I told her ""I'm sorry for the weirdness over the weekend, but I haven't been honest with M. about how much we've been texting and hanging out, and that made her freak out."" 
She said ""I don't see what the problem is that you come hang out with me and my friends."" 
I said ""She saw you as a threat from the moment she met you, so when I hid how much time I had been spending with someone I'm attracted to, she got really really mad."" 
*Show her the phone* 
“Her: ""Oh my god"" 
Me: ""Yes, out the window. So I need to just keep some distance.""
 Her: ""I mean I sort of get where she's coming from but I sort of don't."" 
Me: ""I get it though."" 
Her: ""This kind of sucks."" 
Me: ""I know. This isn't how I wanted things to go, but now you know."" 
Her: ""Is she still in finals?"" 
Me: ""Yeah all week.""
 Her: ""I'd hate to go through this kind of thing during finals."" 
Me: ""She feels so much better now that we have cleared the air and made up.""
Him – “She did not react when I mentioned I am attracted to her. She seemed to be more concerned about losing someone to talk to at work and how much it sucked for her than either yours or my feelings or actions.
Overall I think that went well. She does not resent me, she is disappointed to lose me as a friend, but she does not seem to have a problem with me putting up walls. and her apathy towards my attractions makes me think I probably was in the friendzone but I can't tell for sure”

It sounds to me like he was making it an issue with me, so that he could play me off as the overprotective gf, etc. however, I’m not sure if I’m reading to much into it. 

So, once again, I’m hurt and disappointed, but I’m like: ”ok maybe this it. We’ve dealt with online dating and he has not done that again. Maybe given that he has told me that he hasn’t dated a lot in the past and that his other long term relationship was an open relationship, maybe these are just instances of him being lonely and acting impulsively.” We are very close and talk daily, at this point over a year into the relationship, we’ve formed a lot of good memories (going to shows, cuddling in bed, actually hanging out with his parents and getting to know them, dinners out on the town, and just general fun). We had plane tickets for Christmas to go back to my home so that he could meet my family and for us both to spend New Years with his parents. Given all the other implications: Wonderful birthday gifts and visits, the long, intellectual conversations, meeting his parents and relatives (we had done Thanksgiving at his uncle’s place), the future plans for Christmas and New Years, etc. I felt uncertain about his intentions towards me and towards J., hence the decision to stay and try to work through this. 

December 2016 and January 2017:
It’s awkward – we decided not to cancel our travel plans, I’m still hurt and upset, and not sure if we’re making the right choice. He is not very enthusiastic about meeting my family. He is always pleasant and polite, but he is quite as outgoing as usual. My family is not generally impressed as unlike past boyfriends, his effort to get to know them is underwhelming. I’m disappointed, but I tell myself that “he’s just feeling shy”, “that I have never really seen him around people that he’s never met”, also as my parents live out in the suburbs there really isn’t much to see or do. I remind myself how horribly things went with his parents the first time that I met them. He leaves a few days before me to have some time alone with his parents, then I head out there. 

Things go much better with his parents this time; they aren’t surprised and caught off guard by my visit, I’m no longer scared of them hating me for being working class. It wasn’t a perfect visit as we were still fighting about J., but much better than the first time. 

We go back to his place after his parents, and I hang out in NYC for the next 3 weeks. We seem to be getting back to our normal selves – we spend lots of time together just chilling and enjoying each other’s company. At the end of January I leave to go to school, still worried about our future, but hopeful that past mistakes can remain that way. 

April 2017:
Fast forward to this past weekend, nothing seemed to weird except that he is still very protective of his phone and all of a sudden started wanting to work out/get fit. So I’m at his place for the weekend, while he’s out on Saturday, I decide to snoop (I know it’s so wrong, but I genuinely thought: “this time there will be nothing because he has decided to stay with me and I’m just fretting over past actions”). I was wrong. I didn’t find flirting exactly – I found emails in which he encouraged her to come to his company soccer game saying “you could be the star athlete”, her inviting him to her going away party saying “I forgot that we aren’t friends on facebook” and him responding asking when it was, him wishing her “a safe trip and asking her to send lots of pictures”). When I confront him, I learn that there is more. He messaged her via. Instagram asking how her trip was going so far. She replied and they messaged back and forth so much that I couldn’t even read all the messages before I started feeling completely sick. I asked him why he still did this? Why he hid that he was still friends with her? Why was he still hiding things from me? He responded saying that he had stopped flirting with her, but had kept talking to her on a weekly basis at work, and had made a concerted effort to hide this from me because he knew that it would upset me. I then asked if he was attracted to her physically still, and he say said yes. I asked if he jerked off while thinking about her, and he replied that yes he did about twice a week (he claims to fantasize about me daily, but I’m sure that I believe him, I’ll get to why in a moment). So I start trying to get to the bottom of why given that he repeatedly gives me signs that he is not only happy in our relationship, that he says I’m the “perfect girlfriend”, and after a year and a half, we still have great conversations and great sex - why on earth he is still essentially flirting less extremely, reaching out to her when she away, and generally doing things that he feels a need to hide from me? 

His response is that his second fetish is for blue eyes (mine are brown) and that she has pretty eyes. That he doesn’t want to be that shallow so as not to date me because I have a different eye color, but that he really does fantasize about blue eyed women (note – he’s a gamer and literally all of his characters are women with blue or green eyes). That he thinks about other (fantasy women with such eyes) while we’re having sex and when he gets himself off, and that he doesn’t see this changing in the future. However, given how much his relationship with her bothers me, he agreed to stop talking to her for good, and leave his fantasies in his head. It worries me that he is still conversing with her and hiding it from me, and worries me a lot, because when I first found out about fetish 1, he mentioned liking to take it slow to ease girls into this. That he found that he had better relationships with people who got to know him well first, etc. Hence, I can’t help wondering if that’s what’s happening here – that he’s making sure to remain “that sweet guy who got her a cookie and made her a card for winning at bocce ball with the overprotective gf” (note he’s never made me a card nor did he put in that much effort before we started dating).

We had a couple more long talks in the days since this weekend, hence the need to get it all out on paper and to process what is going on, and hopefully get some good advice from people patient enough to read all of this. In these conversations, it came out that not only does he have this fetish for blue eyes, that he “finds me attractive, but that our relationship for him is less about physical attraction and more about the total package” “that he finds my body and hair attractive and that if I had blue eyes, he probably wouldn’t have done any of this” “that for him, while he sexually fantasizes about other women, the only woman in his fantasies of the future (going on vacation, planning fun nights out, etc.) is me” “ that he hasn’t known how to express this before without making me feel unattractive, but that it’s really the combination of personality, interests, intellect, and less so looks – that he finds attractive about me”

He was right of course that I was sad and hurt that he doesn’t find me to be gorgeous, but I feel similarly that our relationship is far more than physical, and that at 5’5” and prematurely balding, he’s not exactly the tall, dark, handsome guy that I pictured in high school. However, I don’t fantasize about other men, I don’t pursue or flirt with other men, and I don’t hide things from him. I feel like I have met the first person in seven years with whom I can really be myself (in all my weirdness) and I don’t want to lose that. But how can I trust him again? How can I trust that he isn’t just hanging on to our relationship because he’s worried that he’s “friendzoned” with J. and not sure of his dating prospects given his kinks, etc.? 

So right now I feel like shit. I’m supposed to move down and into his apartment in about 3 weeks. J. is out of the country for the next few months (according to him), and we’re supposed to live together for the summer. I don’t know what to do – on the one hand, I want to keep trying to make things work because I feel like we have something special, and on the other hand, I feel like if I stay then I’m a fool. 

What are your thoughts? Can a guy overcome a fetish for a physical feature that his partner is lacking and have a healthy, faithful relationship? Do you believe him or do you think that he’s leading me on until something better becomes attainable? Are these normal struggles of long  distance, long term relationships? And if you have gone through something similar with a partner, how did that end?

Thanks!

67mius,3,2017-04-26,Do any of you feel like your Eagle Scout award means little to nothing anymore. Can anyone relate or help me?,AVENGER_BOSS12,BSA,https://www.reddit.com/r/BSA/comments/67mius/do_any_of_you_feel_like_your_eagle_scout_award/,"I achieved the rank of eagle scout at my troop years ago. (2012 to be exact.) I am now a junior working a crappy part time restaurant job and at the same time in college looking for internships for Computer Science. My gpa is a 3.0 and my resume is small with nothing noteworthy other than starting a computer science club and my eagle scout rank. I feel like I have little to nothing of value.

I say this because I've been having a sort of reflection on my past and I am starting to feel some sort of regret. Maybe its because when I was working towards my eagle scout rank, my scoutmaster and other leaders said that there would be scholarship opportunities (of which I have never received). They also said that it would be great for a resume, of which has never been brought up a single time at a job interview since I have been working at my rather crappy job for 2 years. They also said it would be great for joining the military but yet I have a moral/ethical reason against joining. I feel like I could have simply done better at the catholic private school I went too, made a better ACT score, then I could actually be set for whatever I wanted to do and actually feel like I stand out from the rest of the crowd in a good way.

 Instead, others are already on the road to their successes both in my own major and elsewhere and I am not so sure about myself. I've asked other Eagle Scouts (most of whom are older) and they say that such and such a person at work is an Eagle Scout.

 In summary, I don't really feel particularly proud for my eagle scout award at least for the time being. I know that I worked for it and that my project was very helpful to a local VFW branch in my town. I can also understand if that ""proud accomplishment"" can fit with the older generations (I am 23 btw), but now it really feels no one can relate or understand what I had to put up with just to reach that level. Maybe I should have done things differently...

Do any of you here feel that same way? Can you share your thoughts here? "
67mtsl,13,2017-04-26,I dont think life will ever get better... help?,whatdoyoumemethough,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/67mtsl/i_dont_think_life_will_ever_get_better_help/,"Hey guys. I kind of just wanted to see if theres any words of wisdom or affirmations of my current beliefs out there. I feel like I'm going to kill myself. Despite being born into pretty good circumstances, Ive been suicidal for the last 5 years. I have a lot to be grateful for but I feel like i'm just becoming a more apathetic and enervated person with each passing day. I'm finishing up my freshman year in college. I recently turned 19. I have a highly sought after internship with the public defenders office starting in a few weeks after I finish school. I was born into a somewhat wealthy family and I'm an attractive and popular dude. Im charming and pretty smart but a chronic slacker (despite this things seem to work out regardless idk). A lot of teachers feel the need to remind me of my potential. My parents are very loving and accepting of me (I came out in december) which is both rare and lucky. I feel like I have no room to complain in my life but I guess that's why this page exists. I had an unsuccessful suicide attempt at 15. I was forcibly raped when I was 16. I met up with an older guy (30) on Grindr who had promised to give me my first gay kiss. The closeted kid I was jumped at the opportunity to kiss an attractive guy. I got there and he immediately began to feel me up. He undressed me despite my albeit weak protests and proceeded to hold me down while he took my virginity, a fact I will always remember as he whispered it in my ear as he was doing it. Afterwards he admitted he knew I was not 18. I got into the BMW (depression gift) my parents got me that year and sat in my own blood and his semen on the ride home. By the way, he didn't kiss me once during the whole ordeal... I couldn't look at my parents. I had told them I was hanging out with friends. By this time in my life I had a problem with cutting which the (now faint) scars wont let me forget. Most of them are concentrated on my thighs because I didn't want other kids to think I was doing it for attention. I told no one except the therapist my parents made me see immediately after they found the bloody razor and rag stuffed under my bed. I've only told a few close friends about my rape and my now ex boyfriend. I met my ex boyfriend on Grindr this year. He was perfect for me. Obviously perfect people don't exist but I just felt like he was the most beautiful, charming, successful guy I'd ever meet. (dating in the gay community is difficult because everyone is psychologically fucked, myself included, and on meth *not me yet lol*) He left me about 2 months in. The breakup came as a shock because I had felt that finally I was happy. I was being delivered from my suffering. Every lonely night crying and cutting was worth it. But he left. I cut myself deepest after he left. The scar is really bad, I think it needed stitches but I didnt want to worry my parents. I dont blame him for anything though, my inability to deal with life is independent of his actions. A month later he wanted me back. He still represented everything i've ever wanted (McMansion, Kiddos, Doggos, happiness) so I took him back, but cautiously. The new relationship lasted a month before we got in a stupid fight that escalated. It escalated because I never felt loved by him the second time around. I always felt like I was the one trying to win his affection. It didn't help that he was 25 and in a much more stable place than I was. I will never feel good enough for him or deserving. I doubt I will ever find anyone that meets my high expectations like he did. I have frequent night terrors now. Im doing everything in my power to keep from hurting myself. I know that on paper I have a lot to live for. I don't feel it. I don't care. Im going to get hurt again many times in my life. More people will leave. I may even get raped again. I feel like i've closed my heart and I'm becoming a bad person. I judge everyone else and I know that I bully them in my head because of how shitty I feel towards myself. I hate that I wallow in self pity but I can't bring myself out of it. I want to break things. Life is so unfair. I don't want to live anymore but I'm too cowardly to take my own life. I've recently decided on taking my father's blood thinners and slitting my wrists in the bath. Seems like the least painful way to go given my experience with blades. I look forward to nothing. I just want the constant pain and anxiety to stop. Meds didnt work. Therapy didnt help. Nothing helps. I'm an insecure mess of a spoiled child who didn't get his way a few times. I can't even blame my ex for anything because I just keep seeing his side of things. I even see my rapist's side of things, he must have had a very hard life... They can't be all bad people. Everyone is the hero of their own story. I've just been hurt by a tiny fraction of their many life decisions. Im sad that Im going to be taking my parent's beloved son away. The one they have tried so hard to save. My dad used to work from home just to be able to pick me up from school if I was having a bad day and take me to lunch and a movie. I feel sad that I've hurt their kid. The baby they love so much that can't stop tearing it's own skin apart. I feel like life is just too brutal. Its so ugly. People will always hurt you. I understand that the struggle of it all makes it all the more poetic or whatever, but I really just hurt too much. I dont know why I cant deal with any of this like a normal fucking person. I spent all last night standing on the subway platform trying to work up the courage to jump, in a city thousands of miles away from anyone who would even care. Im just waiting to get home and draw my nice and warm bath. Anyways. Im just wondering if theres any perspective into the situation that anyone could add.. 

TLDR: my life is pretty good on paper but a really fucking shitty thing to live out. "
67nr1p,9,2017-04-26,"DISCUSSION: ep.5 ""Entertaining Jungle Style""",RubberDucksInMyTub,Jungletown,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jungletown/comments/67nr1p/discussion_ep5_entertaining_jungle_style/,"[Edit: Do not see a discussion for latest episode. My fault if it exists elsewhere.] Latest episode WAS such a disaster on so many levels.

We get to see Jimmy field some tough questions from a pair of interns. He basically gets strong armed into talking to these 2 that were possibly leaving- and J clearly couldnt have cared less. The convo started out ok, until he decided they just needed a good reprimand for wasting his time. His hard working, tuition paying students couldnt possibly expect any real access to him..how would anything ever get done?!

His ex also arrives, who happens to have a logging business nearby but has never physically been there.. She is literally the worst ""Skinterns!!.."" and I am so glad they showed her entitled laughing fit when Jimmy declared that he is no longer helping w/dishes on his rotation.

And who was the other chick with her? The one talking about how excited she was at the idea of having students PAY to make her toilets, instead of being her expense? Bad vibes from her too.

Final note: My heart went out for that girl from Enola, PA. I live 20 minutes from there and her story about her father in jail and mom not wanting to see her was shitty. Her reaction when his gun popped up at the house omg. I am glad she got the hell out of there and hope she finds some happiness in the jungle. She seemed like a sweet kid and one of the only ones generally better off in this mess"

Has anyone ever heard much about the value of this internship or has gone through it themselves. I'm honestly not sure how valuable the internship is, especially since I was originally planning on just enjoying my last free summer. Any input would be appreciated "

I am currently living in the US doing an internship, due to end in August. I am going to be marrying my gf (probably would get married here) who is a US citizen. Initially, I was planning to stay in the US but only wanted to for another year or so, so figured it wasn't worth going through the process and paying the fees for such a short amount of time.

I would love to live somewhere in Europe outside of the UK, and figure now may be the best opportunity before Brexit kicks in. I would also like to avoid having to wait the 6 months earning 18600 for a little longer, we aren't really ready to go that long apart yet - plus as mentioned, I would like to live in Europe for a little while before moving back to the UK. 

My question is, would I be able to move to Europe after leaving the US and be able to bring my wife with me? Would it be easier than having to go through the spouse visa process for the UK?

Thanks"

When we first started dating, things were great as I assume all new relationship are. For the first year of our relationship I spent half of it living in another state as I was undergoing an internship. I eventually moved back to my parents house which is no more than a 5 minute drive from her house. We live in the same town and we actually first met in high school, but we never considered dating back then as we were in two different crowds and never really connected. I believe this is one of the reasons our relationship is struggling, the fact that me and her are very different people. 

Back in high school, I was never very social, I didn't have too many friends and I liked keeping to myself mostly. It's just how I was. On the other hand, she was part of the ""popular"" crowd which gave her an ego that I believe she still carries to this day. The town we are from is not the worst but not the best, but I do see the people whom I graduated with are not doing anything with their lives other than party and drink. These are the kids who were in that whole ""popular"" group. In no way am I judging them as they are free to live their lives as they see fit however I am very much different from this lifestyle as I am currently full time school and work (I have been full time IT for about 3 years now). I don't party much, don't drink often, I just work and study and spend time on my hobbies (cars, racing, computers). Now the reason I mentioned all of this is because it ties back to how different me and her are. She is still friends with people in that crowd and it lead to a few issues with our relationship. 

I am a firm believer that you should put yourself around positive people who will influence you to grow. I have very few friends whom I speak to on a regular but I enjoy having them as friends because their mindset is similar to mine. They are looking to achieve which helps motivate me to want to achieve. The friends she hangs out with only look for her when it comes to partying and drinking. Again, I am not telling her who to be friends with or who not to be friends with. That is completely up to her. The problem lies that she has trouble seeing things from my perspective. She gets upset at me when I do not want to hang out with her and her friends at times. I explain to her how I feel uncomfortable sometimes going to clubs because I never really did those things. It's just not my cup of tea. This upsets her and we usually get into arguments because of this. I have put in my part however and eventually gave in to going to clubs and drinking with her and her friends because I wanted her to feel that I am understanding and I am doing it for her. Because I love her. Yes I would feel uncomfortable but I make the best of it and we end up having a good time. 

I try to work with her the best I can. I try to change and accommodate her interests. The problem is that I don't see her doing that back... I feel that I can't talk to her about big future things (my next job move, plans for an apartment) because I feel that she either doesn't care or she just simply does not understand. She is far from dumb but it is obvious we are on different levels of intellect and maturity. But I love her regardless. It is starting to bother me though how I feel that I cannot turn to her when I need support. I fear that when it comes time for me to need her to help me through big decisions, she won't be able to help. It just makes me feel like I'm her emotional support but I also have to support myself. 

We aren't too many years apart but it is obvious we have different mentalities. Our backgrounds are to blame I guess. Her parents are divorced and her older sister was also part of that ""popular"" crowd and continues to believe attention is everything. She parties every day and does not have a job. So that leaves her mom as the female role model. On the other hand my parents are together and I have 3 siblings. My older sister has her masters degree, my younger sister (19) is well on her way to her bachelors in biomedical engineering. So you can see the difference and how my background affects my mentality and why I am the way I am. 

I can continue on and on (and honestly wish I could because I don't have anyone else to talk to about these things..) but I do not want to bore you guys if I hopefully haven't already. So on to the fall of the relationship. These past months have been a rollercoaster. On and off arguing and making up. Most of the times it was something in significantly small. The reason we end up arguing is because I try to explain myself and my feelings to her and tell her why it bothered me so we can talk things through and get over it. This upsets her alot. The moment I try to explain myself she immediately gets aggravated with me and throws words around like ""I'm sorry I'm not your perfect girlfriend!"" ""I'm sorry I'm not good enough for you!"" ""I'm tired of you always telling me how I ruin your life!"" ""you're so miserable with me so just leave me!"". Things like that when in reality I just want to vent about my feelings to her so we can prevent fights from happening again... Well yesterday another one of these stupid little fights happened and she ended up saying that things will never change and she feels she is constantly being judged and that she no longer feels wanted. I asked her why she feels that way and she simply told me that it's because I'm not fighting for her to stay. She told me she doesn't feel loved and she is tired of feeling like she's a problem in my life. She left and said ""were over because you aren't fighting for me anymore"". 

I just sat in my car wondering what the hell happened. I feel like this is all my fault but at the same time I feel that i shouldn't have to hide if I'm bothered by something just so she can not feel guilty about things. I didn't know if I should have fought to have her stay. I don't know if it was right for me to let her go. I don't know. I have been considering texting her asking her to please talk to me but I don't know if that's the right thing to do....believe it or not this was the short version of what's going on my my mind. There's so much to say and I rarely get a chance to talk to someone in person about my emotional struggles but again, if you made it this far, thank you stranger. 

TL;DR: Been dating for almost two years. Me and her are at different maturity, intellect, and mentality levels as well as different backgrounds making it hard to communicate and connect. This led to the downfall of the relationship where it is extremely difficult to simply talk to one another rather than fight. Now trying to decide if I should look for her and ask her to talk, or let things go and let time do the work.

https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/67cjvb/had_to_call_911_its_getting_worse/


Things are getting way too weird here for me to stay much longer.
There's like no way I can work toward my goal with writing here. It's an
inhibitor.  I can't allow it to be.

I wait for hours, and until this moment, still, have not even had a
drink of water.  I try to listen out for movement earlier, go up, mom's
in the kitchen so I turn around from my going to get milk to avoid a
confrontation, so I text my dad, ""Can you let me know when the room is
clear so I can get a drink?""

So instead of texting me, he comes down and says to ""Get what you need,
they're gone.""  It's a full prisoner type situation.  We have about a
80% normal conversation, with the 20% being how I shouldn't have called
the police blah blah blah... Understanding his perspective in it.  He
however really wasn't accosting at all in his tone, but more malleable
and what not -- an actual dialog somewhat, albeit keeping my answers
pretty short and matter-of-fact.  It was interesting, but gave me the
full tone of everything now.

My mother and brother intend to keep me as this quasi-'prisoner,'
because I am a 'snitch' to them.  Little do they know a snitch is only a
'snitch' if he's reporting something legitimate, so that's self-damning
in and of itself.

I had a journalism paid internship (nothing livable) application come through yesterday morning that I was accepted into their staff, which gave me a slither of hope, but...

It is of the utmost importance that I find a way to create an
environment, without exhausting the very few resources I have, to begin
to get work done to some degree.  I need sustainable focus.

So I fill up like a fucking survival ration of water and get some milk,
already having apples down here.  I tell him to make sure nobody throws
out my food, because my mom has a tendency to throw anything away that's
in there for more than a day.

I get my milk, one 'canteen' of water, so I figure since they're gone I
should get a second.  I get like a spritz of water in the second glass
milk jug (which is larger) and then he is at the front door being
sentry, 'They're back already.'

So I don't take my time to get down.  I pop the top on with the spurt of
water in it, which isn't significant, but at least I got the first one
(per his suggestion to get water, actually) but am interrupted from the
second.

It is nicer today, but I have not had a shower and look like a greasy
bum, so I am reluctant to go out and about because that, in and of
itself, is unsettling, but I might be able to call you once I get some
sort of liquids/sustenance in me.  I am extremely shaky right now too,
looking like someone with Parkinson's.

I am tempted to ask him to get me, or find a way to get me, shampoo so I can go shower outside with the garden hose like a dog.  The physical filth is not helping my mental state."

**What I'm looking for**

I am looking for an Entry Level job in EE. I do have around 1.5 - 2 years of experience as a process engineer working in an R&amp;D team environment to essentially consult the manufacturing floor with the automative machines or components to increase production and efficiency through various assembly lines.

**About me**

I live in Washington State, and am attempting to land a job in Denver or the surrounding area.
I graduated in 2016 with a BSEE (Power emphasis if that matters) and am seeking, preferably, a consulting type position.


I'm a self-motivated Electrical Engineer focused on contributing my commitment to excellence and desire to learn in a team environment where I will be able to contribute my value to projects. Highly ambitious to work in a collaborative team setting focused on multiple projects. Enthusiastic in encountering technically stimulating issues by applying engineering principles to grow my professional competence.

My previous work experience was held through an internship at a company involved with the R&amp;D for the automation of manufacturing machines to build electrical grid relays and components. 

**Skills and Values**

I have a lot to bring to the table and hold a myself to high values, some of my skills are that I have an independent and professional work ethic, am an ambitious learner, hold a strong commitment to excellence and completeness, I'm an adaptive &amp; quick tactile learner, can troubleshooting &amp; diagnosing hardware issues on my feet.  I also have experience with One-Line diagrams &amp; schematic design,  programming PLC’s – Festo &amp; AB, IEC 61131, and have designed and routed control cabinets &amp; wire frames for HV panels and automative machines.

I'm always looking for a challenge and actively willing to learn new skills.  Although I focused my degree in Power EE, I am more than willing to hop on board that steep learning curve and make myself proficient with whatever task comes at me.

**Questions**

I do have some questions however regarding how to get my foot in the door or make it known that I am seeking employment in a state I currently don't reside in. 
Without hopping on a plane for a week and traveling door to door of companies, how can I increase my changes of becoming noticed that I am actively looking for employment in the Denver area?

Or better yet, Indeed/Monster/etc. are great, however instead of being bombarded with 1000+ job openings to sift through, does r/denverjobs have any advice on companies I should focus my attention on?

I would be willing to email my Resume / Cover letter if interested.

67rfhj,1,2017-04-26,Should I pay extra to graduate college early?,mcknit,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/67rfhj/should_i_pay_extra_to_graduate_college_early/,"Hello all, big fan of this sub  
&amp;nbsp;

I am debating paying additional money to take extra classes during the next fall and spring semester to graduate early. Before I get into the details here are the my current loans.  
&amp;nbsp;


$15,586 - Federal Direct Sub and Unsub  
$1,000 - From my institution (5%)  
$7,456 - Parent Plus, which I intend on paying myself  

After grants, It costs me ~$7,800 for full time tuition at my school (I use federal loans and pay the remainder). One option would be to graduate in 3 semesters.  
&amp;nbsp;

Another option is to pay an additional $10,920 between the next two semesters. This is given my financial aid remains the same. I would be taking 22 credits in the fall and 23 credits in the spring.  

My rationale behind this is that I can start working full time in the summer of 2018, rather than the start of 2019. I was fortunate enough to get a paid internship this summer at a great company as a data analyst. I'm hopeful that it can turn into a job offer. Entry level would be ~50k  
&amp;nbsp;

Some other factors  
I will have ~15k saved up after this summer.  
I work long hours on the weekends, may not want to do this if I'm taking additional courses.  
Is there something wrong with me thinking the time I spend between next spring to end of fall (graduation) is wasted? I suppose getting another internship could be valuable; thoughts?  
I'm at the point in school where I just want to finish/stop obtaining debt. I'm a transfer student and I really like the academic program, but not loving the whole commuting from home and working weekends to pay for school.

Thanks for reading

I'm closing up my notebook and getting ready to do what I do pretty much every day after class. My pussy is already starting to get that tingle way down deep inside it, anticipating all the fun I'm going to have.

It started last year. I got into a habit where I'd seduce a teacher and maybe a vice principal or a janitor on campus, then make a couple stops on my way home too. And now I have friends all over town! The family that owns the deli, the nice man at the convenience store (and his friends that visited him sometimes too!), the guys who changed the reels at the movie theater, a couple neighbors...

Making new friends isn't really hard for me. Usually I just smile and talk about the things I'm interested in and before long they're happy to let me unzip their pants and play with their big, beautiful cocks.

Some of my friends have wives or girlfriends that don't pay as much attention to them as they deserve, some of them are lonely, and some of them just seem to like having sex as much as I do!

So which one of my friends are you?

* My teacher or principal?
* My therapist?
* My soccer or volleyball coach?
* Someone I meet at the library?
* My doctor?
* The boss at my after-school job or internship?
* An employee at my favorite clothing store (I go through panties faster than most girls, it seems like)?
* A guy I meet at a college party? His friends?
* A chaperone at the school dance?
* Someone I babysit or nanny for?
* Your idea here!

I'm not really into celebs, but I do want to make you happy, so pick one from each of the following categories:

* Race: white, hispanic, asian, black, or mixed
* Hair: blonde, brown, black, or purple
* Hair: short, shoulder, or long
* Body: petite, athletic, or jiggly
* Boobs: As, Bs, Cs, or melons

No incest, pain, or poop.

Yes to fun sex! Cheating, cumming in me, cumming on my face or body, risky sex, semi-public sex, spanking, light submission and name calling, groups, 2-on-1, MFM, FFM, MFMM, anal, oral, and more are all great!

Last thing, I want this to be all wrapped up in about an hour and a half, so no need to spend a lot of time on back and forth before we jump in! Just tell me what situation you like, what I look like (from the lists above, or a picture if you prefer), what your role is, your name, and a little about what you look like.

My parents divorced shortly after I was born -- my dad stayed where he was and my mom moved to a different state, about 25-30 minutes away (NJ -&gt; NY) so I spent my childhood going back and forth between them. The family dynamics were very different so I guess I didn't have much consistency growing up. I had a lot of friends in New York, and only a few in Jersey, which is where I went to school. My mom ended up moving to a neighboring town in NJ when I was in the 7th grade, which is when (I believe) depression started to *really* affect me. 

Before the move, I hung out with people almost everyday, including my best friend, who I was with all of the time. After the move, I was alone pretty much all of the time. I had friends in class, and one ""best friend"" that I hung out with sometimes outside of school, but that was it. I kept contact with my old friends (and still do) but was alone most of the time (and still am) and spent my time scrolling through the Internet.

I have a boyfriend who I've been with for three years who is pretty much my best friend now. I love him very much, and I love solitude and I love being alone, but I know that deep down inside, I wish I had an extra close friend or two as well. I don't think this will ever happen for me for various reasons. I have friends that I text or catch up with, etc. but I don't have any that I see on a regular basis like my boyfriend.

I used to be very skinny and fit and then gained about 150lbs due to trauma that I experienced when I was 16 (don't want to delve into that on here), but, yeah. 150lbs. This was due to depression/trauma/anxiety as well as a binge-eating disorder. Albeit I am very tall (5'11) so it shows differently, but still. I don't look like the same person. I don't feel like the same person. I can't go outside without feeling like everyone is assuming that I am lazy and worthless as opposed to severely depressed and I inevitably think, ""if only they knew."" I don't feel like a person anymore. Just a thing that moves around. I posted to r/loseit a few times and am in the process of trying to lose weight again.

My father is verbally abusive. My mom has an unchecked anxiety disorder and has another daughter to take care of (my half-sister is probably the biggest joy in my life next to my boyfriend) so all of her energy is going towards work and my baby sister. I don't have much of a connection to anyone else in my family because no one has ever put in that effort, and also because I was the only kid who moved back and forth between parents.

I feel mostly apathetic towards everything. My voice has gone monotonous. I used to read and write so much, now I can barely read a page of a book. I can barely focus on anything. I spend a good majority of my day playing World of Warcraft. Sometimes I smoke weed because it helps with the anxiety. I also go to a two-day paid internship at a T.V. production place. 

My real problem is the reality of work and responsibility. I can't do anything. I have laundry that I've been meaning to do since yesterday. I need to take out the trash. But I can't budge. I'm only productive in short bursts where I get ""excited"" or ""motivated"" (it's not mania). I can't tell if this is because I am depressed or lazy. 

I've been looking for jobs to apply to, but anxiety always gets a hold of me and I start to think, ""well if I were still skinny, I would apply to this job. I would do so great,"" and I start to feel anxious. I don't feel comfortable doing anything in this body. I want to work out and feel good, but I feel so depressed. I just feel stuck. I don't know how else to describe the feeling.

My parents don't understand, especially my dad -- he makes me feel so bad about it. To him I am a lazy worthless loser. My mom tries to understand. Thanks to her and her connections I have an apt with a therapist next Friday in the city. It's a bit of a commute but I do not want to enable myself anymore so I am forcing myself to go through with it and hopefully I can keep up. 

I feel very overwhelmed. I don't feel like I am lazy because I want to make money and I want to do good and have good things and build a nice life for myself.

I've come very far mentally and no one acknowledges it except for my boyfriend. I used to engage in so many unhealthy coping mechanisms that I've broken out of and I'm really proud of myself but am still made to feel useless. 

This was a lot and I don't really expect anyone to read it but it did feel good getting this off of my chest. If you made it this far, thank you. I know that I need to get into therapy to deal with all of this but it did feel good to vent a bit.

I don't have a specific scene in mind yet, but I really want to suck cock while i am dripping with cum from my other holes. And I would very much want to do a scene where we both enjoy a cream filled dessert out of my pussy (or ass ;) ). Scene suggestions include : a day out on a boat with older men, new outfit shopping with daddy, or a fun and uninhibited spring break vacation but whatever the scene is I want daddy to teach me how to become a whore-things like make up, outfits, attitude, along with sexual acts for money should be things you want to teach me, but please talk to me like an adult, no baby talk!
  
I want to do something involving either twins (played by me) or two sisters (also, both played by me). I would like this to be either a kind of competition or a learning experience for me and my sister. However I don't really want this to be a dom/sub thing that much. We can compare our holes, mouths, armpits, and flavors! So if that is something that interests you, and you want to teach two girls-PM Me!
  
or
  
Today I want to focus on armpits. They are incredibly sexy and a mostly overlooked erogenous zone here on dpp. Things we could do can range from chatting about them or doing a role play centered around smelling/licking/cumming in my armpits or if you want to get a little strange, my armpits could have pussies for you to use too.
  
A couple of ideas could be that I am applying for a summer internship but part of the interview involves my scents. Or we could do something like a glory hole but with my armpits and other holes as well. Of course a gang bang would be fun too but this might work best as an intimate one-on-one kind of thing. Message me with what you'd like to do and let's get off!"

I want to end it. Every second of everyday. I live so that they don't have the burden of knowing the guy that killed himself. My parents wont have only 2 kids left. My brothers won't only have eachother. My friends wont have a whole in their group. I feel like my suicide is inevitable. I feel like I should do it know so that I don't hurt even more people down the road. I just feel like I can't do it anymore. No one will understand why I did it. No one knows how I really feel. Not my therapist, not my best friends, not my mother, not my father, not my brothers. They know I have depression but they don't know the chaos in my head that I fight for each and every breath. I feel like I should end it now. End my suffering. I don't want to let them see me like this. Only my family knows I have depression. Everyone one else knows me as ""the happiest person on the planet"". That's what my friends called me. They don't know how it feels to be empty. I feel nothing but pain. I'm 19 and I struggle with substance abuse. I'm not even 2 weeks sober and I'm dying without drinking or smoking. I stopped for my health and a possible drug test. I had an amazing interview. It was the first time I felt happy this month. And now the deadline is passed. I didn't get that call for the internship. I am worthless. I want drugs more than ever. They are the only thing that make me feel anymore. And it hits worst this exam week. I don't know why I'm alive. The only reason I've had for the past 7 months is for my family, but even that doesn't seem like much compared to the thoughts in my head anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm lost. I really think I should just kill myself now and save others from hurt in the future cause this isn't gonna get better. The people that know say it will, but it hasn't. 6 fucking years and I'm just numb now. Medication makes it worse. I couldn't even lift today cause I couldn't even look myself in the mirror. It's getting harder to paint my face with a smile and be the person I want to be. I just don't know what to do anymore. All I can ever think about is just sitting in my garage this weekend with the car on. Let the co2 work it's magic. It's simple, painless and it leaves my corpse in tact for a funeral.

I've gone through several medications, ECT treatments, and been admitted a few times. I currently see a pdoc regularly and go to therapy. The past couple weeks I've been getting more and more symptomatic with rapid cycling. It got to a point yesterday where I said some things I probably shouldn't have at work and acted erratic in the office. I had to leave work because my coping techniques and my anxiety pill were not helping. I'm still waiting for a call from the doc because we know my lithium levels are low but I'm already at max dose so I'm not sure what's gonna happen yet. In the meantime, I'm staying home and just trying to stay calm or distracting myself. I can still feel the fluctuations and the instability, but I keep telling myself I'm doing what I need to do and I'm okay.

BPD makes it that much harder for me to maintain relationships of any kind. I think I've recently lost a good friend who tried to warn me about my abusive ex but I wasn't capable of understanding what she was telling me. I've since tried to make amends by taking her out for bday dinner, telling her I'm sorry, and telling her thanks. But, now she has been telling me she'll let me know when we can hang out. I never hear from her. I talked to her more when she was studying full-time with an internship and she's not that busy now. I have to think it's because I was so negative all the time before, which I'm trying to get better at.

A big part of the difficulties in my romantic relationships is due to the other person not understanding fully what it means to be with someone with mental illness and the two of us not being honest about our feelings. Now, I have to also cope with the aftermath of that abusive relationship when my ex used my illness to get what he wanted by using techniques like gaslighting - which when you already suffer from an illness that makes it hard for you to understand people's intentions, having someone tell you that you don't perceive reality correctly really fucks with you.

My current boyfriend is wonderful and, unlike the last one, everyone loves him. He is kind, caring, funny, open to adventure. He tells me that there is nothing wrong with how I see things. But, most of all, we made a pact in the very beginning to be honest with each other on everything because finding out the lie later hurts more. And we've stuck by that. 

Now, the question I want to ask you, specifically those who live with, are friends with, and/or are romantically involved with someone who suffers from Bipolar, is how do you it? Have you ever had to give up on someone because it was too much? What is the last straw? I saw someone on here post that they were excited about a 45 day break from their loved one with bipolar and that they lost all compassion and sympathy. I find that so heartbreaking on both sides. 

I don't want to be the person that no one wants to be around. I don't want to suck the life from people. But, sometimes I really just need support from someone I know. I have lost many people in my life because of this illness. I really don't want to lose this guy. And lately I've felt him pull away a little. But, you know how unpredictable bipolar patients can be. Sometimes I'll handle it myself because I'm strong and sometimes I'm completely incapacitated because of psychosis or depression. 

How do you deal with it? What can I try to do to not lose the people important to me? What do you wish you could tell the bipolar person in your life that you can't? If that person is no longer there, what made you leave? "

67sygf,10,2017-04-26,Has hiding become normal for anyone else here?,JodieOver9000,MtF,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/67sygf/has_hiding_become_normal_for_anyone_else_here/,"Ever since I really discovered I was trans years ago, it has been slowly becoming normal hiding that fact. When I first realized I was trans, it was really difficult hiding, as in it was unbearable. Now it's just normal, like something I have gotten used to living with. I mean of course I still want to come out and be able to live openly as being trans, but I almost feel like hiding is a necessity for me now. As a college student, I don't have the money to transition, my parents probably wouldn't help pay for it, although I could probably do it as long as I remained on my parent's insurance and could pay for it myself. There is just no way I can find a job at this age that would pay for it. Internships are hard to come by and some of them don't even pay. 

So that being that, I just have gotten used to hiding, because at this point I can't really do anything. I should probably come out to someone, just to have some amount of support, but I am scared to do it. If I come out as trans, I am afraid I will be denied opportunities I would normally be able to get. I feel like I have to continue hiding until I can get somewhere so nobody puts up a ton of roadblocks because of me being trans. I feel like it is necessary so I don't have to jump extra hurdles just get from point A to B. The scary part is I have gotten so used to it that it's completely normal now. The dysphoria is still there of course, but I have gotten to the point where I convinced myself to say ""screw it, life sucks"" and to deal with it. At the same time, I absolutely hate it with a passion but feel it's a necessary sacrifice to get somewhere in life. 

I don't know, maybe I am just over exaggerating things or how hard things will be if I come out as trans, but I cannot see me doing it for years because of the reasons given above.

I just had no idea if anyone else felt the same way. "

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside the fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

This is a sub I never thought I'd want to visit. Not that I have anything against consensual incest, it just isn't my thing.

I grew up as an only child. My dad was a trucker and was gone a lot. Mom took care of me most of the time, while dad was on the road. No siblings around, and mom was busy with work trying to start a company. 

A couple years back, dad retired from the trucking life and decided to take a trip to France. He's a genealogy buff and wanted to dig into the family history. Mom was planning to go with him, but one of her potential venture capital connections got a hold of her. She'd gotten a big windfall of money from something or other, and was willing to invest 4 times the amount of money if Mom would hire the lady's daughter as an intern. She was wild with excitement and Dad was fine with going to France alone.

The part that worked out well for me, was that I suddenly had a MUCH bigger college fund. I applied to a lot of my Top Pick schools that I hadn't bothered with because there's no way I could afford it. One of them, on the west coast accepted my application. I moved out here in late 2015 and got a job at some boring fast food joint so I could spend a few months away from school before going back in. 

During that time, I started checking out the night life and the scene in the local barmuda triangle. This is a hippyish liberal town, so there's more diverse type of scene out here than there was back home. A couple of gay bars and places that are gay friendly.

Back in September, a friend of mine invited me to a night out on the town, and at one of those gay friendly bars, I met this really hot chick who was really into me. We played a rousing round of tonsil hockey between dancing sessions wherein she was grinding all up on me. 

I offered to take her home and she smiled then said ""Let's have another cigarette outside and talk first.""

Outside she asked me ""How do you feel about Trans Women?""

I looked at her for a moment. ""I've never met one before. I'm... open to new things though. I'm into you, and that's all that matters to me. If you're trans, that's not a turn off. If you're not trans and just trying to find out if I'm an open minded dude, that's also cool."" She smiled and kissed me.

That night, we had some pretty nice sex. The following morning, we had a really delicious breakfast. A couple days later I took her to a movie and dinner (by the way, don't do dinner and a movie. Do a movie and dinner, so you have something to talk about afterwards).

Around Thanksgiving, we decided to go steady, although she laughed when I called it that. Apparently out here it's called ""exclusive"" and saying ""steady"" makes me sound like a character out of a '50s TV show. 

New Years Eve we went to a party, and crashed at her place afterwards. The next morning she started pulling down posters and photos and moving furniture. I asked what she was up to, and she [note, from now on I'll call her Jayla, because I feel like some name should be in here] and Jayla says she does that every year. She'll redecorate her whole house. It helps a new year feel newer, and it makes it easier to keep track of memories, because she or her friends can be all ""That was when you had that Lords of Acid poster on the living room wall."" or something and pin down the year something took place. 

I decided to give that a try, cause it seems like a cool idea. Also, I hadn't done much decorationing in the year that I'd been there. The walls were pretty bare already.

One night not too long ago, Jayla's over at my place and after some sweaty fun sex, she steps out for a smoke and looks at the wall next to the coatrack on the way to the door to get her jacket.

""Hey Guy? Who is this, and why is he on your wall?"" She was pointing at a photo. I walked over to it, and saw that she was pointing at a photo of my Dad in front of the Eiffel Tower.

""That's my dad. Why?""

She spun around with a wide eyed look of shock on her face. ""Are fucking serious? HOLY SHIT!""

I asked her what was going on. ""That's ***MY** dad too!"" She started shaking and walked outside to light her smoke. I went out behind her and lit one of my own.

We had a long conversation about how her Mom and Dad got divorced shortly after she was born. He'd stop by every few years to visit her, and would generally get along well with her mom. Sometimes they'd go on dates, or just into the bedroom for some quick sex. Apparently they make better fuck buddies than they do lovers or spouses. 

She pulled up some photos on her phone and showed them too me. It was definitely him. Some of the photos were scans of old pictures from when she was a kid. When she looked like a boy, I could see the resemblance clear as day. 

She took off after the cigarette and asked me not to call her the next day. The day after, I didn't call her. The following day, I sent a text and got nothing back. A few days later, I got a text from her that said ""Give me more time. I'm sorry.""

I've been crying rivers, sweating bullets and more nervous than a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs since then. It's been hard, but I've respected her wishes for space.

Last night, she came over after sending a text to make sure I was home. As soon as I opened the door she grabbed me and kissed me harder than I've ever been kissed in my life. That kiss lasted from the living room to the bedroom and only stopped so we could tear our clothes off.

We didn't have sex last night. We made love. For the first time in my life, I know what it feels like to say that. I know what the difference is now.

As we lay in bed together, she kissed me softly and said ""I'm not ashamed, and I'm not afraid. What about you?""

I thought for a long while. Finally I said ""I'm not ashamed, but I'm kind of afraid. That's okay. I will not give into fear. I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when my fear is gone I will turn and face fear's path, and only I will remain."" 

She smiled and laid her head on my shoulder and said ""We will not give into fear. We must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. We will face our fear. We will permit it to pass over us and through us. And when our fear is gone We will turn and face fear's path, and only We will remain."" 

When we woke up this morning, we had the best damn breakfast I've ever eaten. I asked her if she wants to move into a place together. She said yes. He lease ends in June, mine expires in August. 

I'm in love with my sister. And she's in love with me. That's all that matters. If there is a God and he's everything the Christian Bible cracks him up to be... then I won't ask for mercy from him, because I need no mercy, for I've done no wrong. If I have to stand before the Almighty someday and be held to account for all I've done, there's a lot of things I'll ask for mercy about. Times when I was a bully. Times when I said mean things to hurt people's feelings. Times when I took what wasn't mine. I'll have a lot to say ""I'm sorry"" for... but I won't ever be sorry for being in love."

I'm going to be extremely lengthy. Scroll for the TL;DR or prepare yourself for some reading. 

Basically, we are in a short distance relationship living just an hour away from each other. She is working on her undergrad while I work full time and try to figure out what it is i""m supposed to be doing with my life. She has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

I live with my parents now since I dont make enough to make car payments, insurance, student loans, and the cost of an apartment. I'm not proud of that but I work full time and have averaged ending in over time with my employer. Besides picking up a second job(i do have a few applications out right now) and losing all of my spare time, I don't really see a way to just get my own housing and be independent. 

My family is full of hot headed, stubborn people, myself and my dad being the biggest issues. While we have times where we are cool, there are also times where I legitimately think i""m about to get kicked out or have to make a break for it.

My girlfriend and I have talked at length about where we can see our relationship going. Marriage is something we talk about with ease, though we agree that we aren't at a good point in our lives for it. We talk about making sacrifices for each other when it comes to getting started in a career. 

I try to help her out financially when I can, and until I recently got in a wreck and had to get a car payment, I have been pretty able to help her out. I bought her a new laptop when hers for school went down, I buy gas and groceries when I visit, I take her out for dinner so she can have fun and drink and be merry. When she got an internship with the smithsonian I put back 2 grand inside of three months(look buddy I work retail, I'm not a bajillionaire) and took a week off work so we could go and she wouldn't be alone and so she would have money to actually enjoy her spring break in DC working for the coolest museums in the country.

I encouraged her to resume therapy after she quit therapy with a really shitty therapist (bruh, this lady would call my GF's dad after every session and go over what they talked about, even against my GF's wishes, and then her dad would call her and confront her about what she was talking about). I walked her to the therapist's office and held her hand through her intake appointment. 

I am not particularly in tune with my emotions, but I try to empathize with, and help, the GF when she's having a hard time of it. However, you can't help someone when they won't give you a chance.

 She was verbally assaulted twice within a twenty four hour period after the last presidential election. I found out a day or two later when my sister asked me how my GF was doing. I don't particularly like to find that kind of stuff out from a third party.

Her anxiety about school got so bad that she wasnt sleeping for days at a time and then she dropped all of her major classes and all core classes. I found out about that fall semester shortly after winter break. That's when I really pushed for her to get back into therapy. Then a few weeks ago, just a month from summer, she says in passing that her schedule is a lot more open. yup, it's because she dropped all of her classes again(this time by the therapists request.)

The part that makes me angry is that she never shares this with me directly. she never just calls me up and says ""hey, man, i just want to talk about how hard of a time I'm having. Since I like to call you my best friend and confidant, I'm going to actually back that up by including you in my life."" /s

It hurts me because she always likes to say things like ""well I told you about that already."" but really she was texting a friend about it and forgot to ever include me. And whenever I try to have real talks about our lives and our relationship and about the world she always just deflects and tries to not give a straight answer. Whatever answer she originally gives always changes from some kind of deflection to her actual opinion. I'm a forward person. She knows this. I try to get her to engage me in a forward manner.

So back to my hot headed family, today my dad got angry and was yelling and shit, and said that I can either work as hard as he deems is good enough or I can find my own fucking place. I ask my GF if I can pack my stuff and come to her place. Her first response is ""why?"" followed immediately by ""im not causing any problems between you and your parents."" then when I ask if she would turn me away if I showed up and she just repeats that she doesn't want to get into a squabble between family members.
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT MOVING IN TOGETHER AND SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXCITED ABOUT THE PROSPECT. Her only issue has been whether or not her current landlord would allow us to cohabitate. So I asked if she would shoot them an email and ask them. I asked this, multiple times, over the past couple of months. She still hasn't done it and is using it as cover if it ever comes up. Of course, I could always stay a few days and it would never make a difference. I have in the past and it's meant nothing. But when I might need to get out of Dodge? Why? Hey, I dont want to get involved. 

What am I supposed to do? Am I leaving something out that proves I'm actually a terrible offensive ogre that shouldn't be allowed in society? Feel free to ask for more info, make stabs at me, ask me blunt honest questions that force me to pick apart my own flaws. I just want to know how the hell I'm supposed to handle someone who never does anything to indicate they want me, but is always saying that I'm their true love. Am I just being insensitive? Do I not understand how hard it is to live and function and have a significant other while dealing with a mental illness? Tell me what's up.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My GF never includes me in major events of her life until they've already come and passed, never talks straight to me about the serious parts of our relationship, life, and the world, and never seems wiling to help me with my life. How do I resolve this while being respectful of her mental illness and her as a person? How do you set expectations with someone who won't engage you?"

För några dagar sen kungjorde reddit att de planerar att göra stora förändringar i hur mycket man kan anpassa subreddit-utseende: https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/ 

Detta innebär bland annat den kontroversiella ändringen att subreddit-specifik CSS ska avvecklas gradvis, och ersättas med andra mer standardiserade anpassningsmöjligheter.

Vi moderatorer har fått in ett antal modmail som handlar om detta och undrat hur vi som subreddit ställer oss till det. Bland annat har flera användare nämnt /r/ProCSS, en subreddit som en sorts aktivistplattform för att protestera mot förändringarna. Efter intern diskussion har vi moderatorer kommit överens om att inte ta någon ""officiell hållning"" innan vi låter användarna diskutera det. 

Så Denna tråd är till för att samla diskussion om denna förändring för att se hur subredditens användare ser på saken. Är Sweddit mot eller för förändringarna som planeras? Bör Sweddit göra ett aktivt ställningstagande på /r/ProCSS?

67v01u,87,2017-04-27,Red Pill Logic: The Good Boys,Blacklabellogics,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/67v01u/red_pill_logic_the_good_boys/,"Some men go through life in a very predictable pattern, always seeking validation for their pro-social behavior. Whether it be as children when they follow the directions of parents, teachers, other adults, or when they grow up and adopt the familiar narratives that so many men fall victim to in their journey through life. In my time in academia I saw many of these men, often seeking predictable safe degrees in engineering, business, accounting, that they had been planning to do for most of their life. Their time prior to college had often been spent getting the best grades possible, maximizing their extracurricular activities, keeping up their perfect attendance scores and otherwise maximizing their chances of getting into a ""good"" college.

A majority of them had a life-plan laid out that went something along the lines of get into a good college, get a solid degree with good grades, intern with one of the top companies available, graduate, get a job with this company, work their way up the corporate ladder, be rewarded with a beautiful sexpot wife, 2.4 kids and a beautiful home. This goal was their motivation and they put their nose to the grindstone every single day to make it a reality. However, as is often the case with plans, in their meeting with reality few if any hold up.

As Mike Tyson once said ""Everyone has a plan 'till they get punched in the mouth.""

The trouble that such men often face, is that rather than designing their own path in life, they accepted the various narratives that they had been presented with while growing up and then permitted their super-ego to govern their life, for years if not decades. The ""Good Boys"" are convinced that there is an inner morality to the world, and that the social narratives present the good way to live, thus if one lives according to the narratives, one will be rewarded for one's good behavior. This world-view is embodied in the concept of karma, where good things come to good people and bad things happen to bad people.

**Pro-Social Behavior**

Perhaps the most obvious narrative is related to behavior that is a benefit to the social group that the man lives within, for instance being a hard worker and tax-payer is pro-social. This is because the man is not only producing the product of his labor for society, his salary also helps finance public goods regardless of his need for these or not. These public goods are intended to increase the overall happiness within the social group, in an ideal world, perhaps this man could utilize the money he pays in taxes to obtain goods that would cause an overall increase in happiness for him.

One could take two men, one is the worker outlined above, the other earns money to live through a life of crime. The former will help contribute to maintaining the rule of law through both law-abiding behavior and assistance in financing law-enforcement. The latter will negative affect the rule of law through breaking it at his leisure, and as one does not pay taxes on ill-gotten goods, he is not financing law enforcement.

Thus, social narratives are largely based around pro-social behaviors, children are encouraged to say their prayers, eat their vegetables, listen to authority figures and follow the rules. The ""Good Boys"" do this and frequently go above and beyond in the way they conduct their lives. The social narratives are in their most reduced form, a set of guidelines for how to live a morally correct life, with the promise of rewards following those who are ""good boys"". A society that explicitly encourages anti-social behavior is one that will not last very long, as the basic social contract is based on advantages gained through organizing in a social group.

**Intersexual Dynamics**

The ""Good Boys"" are very often classic Beta males who buy into the various intersexual narratives that society seeks to ingrain in them from birth. These narratives historically served the same purpose as the pro-social narratives, as there is such a thing as a pro-social intersexual dynamic. Our ancestors recognized that the family unity, and on a slightly larger scale, the tribal unit was the foundation of any group. In a way any nation can be broken down into component groups ending with the family as the smallest unit. Pro-social intersexual behavior is the foundation of the family unit and thus it was encouraged and rewarded throughout history.

Such pro-social intersexual behavior includes the principles that are central to most religion, such as fidelity, loyalty, honor and duty, by ensuring that a great majority of men could have a wife, one ensured that they would have children, by ensuring that men had children one secured their future investment in the social group. After all, it was widely recognized and enforced that a man had a duty to support his wife and his children. Likewise it was enforced that in exchange for the man's labor, the wife and the children would follow his lead. When a man was seeking to marry a woman, he would ask her father for permission prior to proposing, and if permission was granted, the wife would move from the house of her father to the house of her husband.

This helped ensure that future families be stable, and in the best interest of the involved parties as the wisdom of both extended families carried much weight in the process. However, as we depart our history, the changes that in many ways began with the first wave of feminism, and have been part of an ever increasing feedback system, started to take on dramatic effects. First, divorce became much more commonplace than it had once been, where a woman or man in an unsuccessful marriage could seek a divorce if certain conditions were filled. This was then replaced by no-fault divorce, where no conditions must be met except ""I want a divorce"". Sexual freedom went from the ability of a woman to not be damaged goods if she had a long-term relationship or two, to what the manosphere today refers to as ""riding the carousel"" and an epidemic of single-mothers.

However, one thing that didn't change much were the narratives presented to the ""Good Boys"", the soul-mate myth is still sold in our culture through what has been called ""The Disney Narrative"", that encompasses ""Happily ever after"", that consists of both building the foundation for oneitis, that elevates a woman onto the pedestal, but also the idea that marrying the ""right woman"" is the key to a fulfilled life.

The ""Become a man"" narrative, that has changed from the old order where once a man married he was expected to also take care of the best interests of his wife and children, to a narrative in which the man must put his own best interests last in a hierarchy that he enables through his labor and duty. A man would in history be expected to be responsible for his wife and his children, to do the work required in order to fulfill this duty, and in exchange he would be the family patriarch. This is the narrative that is still presented to the ""Good Boys"" yet the reality differs, as the husband has become the source of comedy in our popular culture, and little more than the enabler of his wife's delusions.

*****
&gt; Facebook cancelled a Harvard student&amp;#039;s internship after he created a Google Chrome plugin that highlighted serious privacy flaws in the social network&amp;#039;s messaging service, Boston.com reports.

&gt; Here&amp;#039;s the student on Facebook&amp;#039;s initial response: [On] the afternoon of the 27th, one day after the Medium blog post&amp;#039;s publication, Facebook contacted me.

&gt; On the afternoon of the 29th, three days after my initial posts, Facebook phoned me to inform me that it was rescinding the offer of a summer internship, citing as a reason that the extension violated the Facebook user agreement by &amp;quot;Scraping&amp;quot; the site.

&gt; According to the email, the privacy issue was not with Facebook Messenger, but rather with my blog post and code describing how Facebook collected and shared users&amp;#039; geo-location data.

&gt; &amp;quot;It is possible that before my extension and blog post, the degree of location data collection and sharing by Facebook Messenger was hard for an average user to notice and thus did not raise significant concern. Without public pressure, Facebook may have lacked significant incentive to change. My extension and blog post made the data collection and sharing practice real and transparent.""

&gt; He concludes with a set of questions : &amp;quot;What does this say about privacy protection? Can we reasonably expect Facebook or others with an interest in collecting and sharing personal data, to be responsible guardians of privacy? Could this work have been done inside Facebook to understand how its users view the collection and sharing of their data?&amp;quot;Must future privacy guardians always be on the outside?&amp;quot;.

67x2tc,40,2017-04-27,Am I overreacting to a 1L backing out of a job offer?,inhousethrowaway360,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/67x2tc/am_i_overreacting_to_a_1l_backing_out_of_a_job/,"I am GC for a tech start up with an offices in NY and a small state. Do a 30/30/40% mixture of entertainment, international IP, and traditional start up contract work in house myself with about $250,000 a year in outside work on IP litigation and finance. 

I had been trying to groom a 2L to try and assume an associate counsel position with a paid internship this school year, but he turned out to not have the chops and I decided to look for a new candidate for the summer back in Feb. 

Did a few laps of the networking circuit and found a 1L from the local Law School who was ambitious, intelligent, and seemingly eager to get into the door this summer. Ended up offering him a 10 week contract for 6k, which he accepted two weeks ago, start date TBD based when he got back from visiting his parents out of state. Once he confirmed I let my current intern know that I wasn't going to have a place for him this summer (he already had gotten a second part time internship after I told him in Feb that I couldn't commit to hiring him for the summer).  

Yesterday the 1L calls me and says he got a job with the State for the summer but wanted to see if I had any ""extra fun projects for him to tackle in his free time."" 

To be honest I am absolutely livid about this. Not only do I now need to spend more time finding someone to tackle the projects I have been setting aside, I have to go crawling back to my CEO and explain that my first pick backed out. 

Am I overreacting or is it legitimately shitty behavior from the 1L?

*Edit* TL;DR: Tougher situation for him than me, overreacting and should just move on and find someone that is a better fit. 

Thanks everyone for the responses. It is nice to have the opportunity to vent and get some anonymous feedback to give me some perspective. 

The ""it's business"" comments are obviously on point as far as why I shouldn't be SHOCKED AND APPALLED at him deciding to take a different path. I get that, it is the same reason why at the end of the day I am not kicking myself about letting my current intern go, people deserve the right to do what is best for them/their clients.

I think I was overreacting because I hadn't approached hiring this particular student as ""just business"" I built it up in my head to be a mentor relationship and felt like I was doing him a huge favor and I was just the absolute hottest shit on the block etc etc. 

Then when he told me in a way that felt disconnected from how I saw the relationship I got unfairly indignant. If it was so important to me that he followed through I should have had a frank conversation about it before asking him to commit. It isn't like I was offering him a clerkship, it was a summer job.

The fact that I personally hate the hiring process isn't his fault, and I would rather find someone that really wants this job over someone who feels obligated to follow through to avoid making me have to jump through a few extra hoops.

I'm mainly looking for what to expect in my interview as well as what to expect if I am offered the position in general. 

I do admit I am a bit discouraged as I've been talking to other people that have worked for Cerner as students and they mention having a lot more experience than I do. Sadly, I don't have  ajob doing anything related to computer science or technology in general, as I just work as an overnight stocker at Target in Olathe. Therefore, I am a bit discouraged as to if I will be seen as a good candidate since I have no real ""professional"" experience other than a IT internship I did as a high school sophomore in 2009.

I'm also wondering about the hour structure that Cerner gives for the apprentices. I've heard that its 20 hours during the school semester, and 40 during the summer. Does this format still hold true?

Also, in general, assuming my performance at the job is satisfactory at the least, how many people are usually offered full time positions as they complete their Bachelor degrees? Just planning for the future here.

Cerner's always been a huge part of my community since they bought up the old Marion Park buildings in SKC and I've always wanted to work for them. I appreciate any help, and thank you guys so much!"
67xssx,5,2017-04-27,[NeedAdvice]Trying to re-learn how to code while holding down a day-job,DoggieEmpress,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/67xssx/needadvicetrying_to_relearn_how_to_code_while/,"So first off a bit of background on why I feel I need to up my discipline game, I'm 27 right now and I'm living at my mother's house in my home town working a office job that I don't like (but neither really hate maybe that's the problem) just so I can say I have a job and I'm not being a load to the household

I try not to obsesses over the past but things seemed much more bright when I finished college 5 years ago, I finished in the normal 4 years, got my engineer's diploma even went to a study program in my last year and did my thesis at a more prestigious university abroad.

Things were looking up and I decided to go back home for one last long summer before getting a job, had some fun but the plan was always to go back to the city where I finished college to finish my masters because that's where all the engineering and programming firms were.

Then my scholarship was downgraded (won't get into details but there was a influx of students with artificially high grades) and I didn't have the money to remain in the city.

I kept coming back for job interviews but every interview was after a pretty exhaustive drive and now that I had to be back home I had to devote some of my time to helping with the household.

One year of going to interviews and being *""you're good but we need/found someone just a bit better""* I entered the masters again but again we didn't have the money so I could stay in the city, so it was learning from a distance making that long drive again but for labs and seminars.

All this time I'm still going to interviews (automation, Java, C#, C/C++,QA) but I'm depressed by the constant rejection (friends tried to help both with morale and setting up interviews God bless them) and I take my current job because it's a family friend and it's just a short drive away and older sister already works there.

I try to finish my masters but I'm stuck with a half finished thesis because I'm too tired from work and I'm doing everything alone.

tl:dr:

**So I stopped trying to get a job which I'd worked for in college to finish my masters.**

**And I didn't finish my masters because I had to work at the job I didn't wanted.**


Now I'm a 3 year veteran at this job which really is just sitting at a desk and filling out paperwork, the job doesn't pay well enough for me to pursue my hobbies or travel or anything beside buy enough gas to drive to work, I'm stuck living with my mother everyone around me just says that I should be grateful to have a job in our small town and bad economy.

I have this friend from college almost the only one from those days I keep constant contact with, he's a bit weird but he's got a good soul and he keep motivating me to get back to coding because if I focus on one field in coding (front end) that would be the one I have the most tangent with and is one of the easier one's to go into especially for women apparently he can score for me a internship or a junior position.

We talked about it I warned him that I would effectively need to learn everything from scratch and he agreed he won't rush me to sci fi stuff and he'll be patient, so we started work.

But it's very on and off and I have to admit it it's from me :(

**I have this idea this intellectual truth that yes this is how I want to progress but when I sit down after work, after working around the house, after taking care of my dogs and try to read a tutorial or watch a course or code a little bit I just feel 0 desire/0 willpower/0 mood**

And time keeps flying by, the basics I re-learned are getting old again some of the project ideas he sends to me I find too easy and not worth it when I see something I want to do I inevitably get stuck and can't finish it.

My friend is also weird a lot of the times, he explains in detail things I don't understand but doesn't grasp what I'm asking him to explain, I think he is at the same time afraid to imply I don't know the basics but too afraid that I might know them so he keeps hammering them.

His study plan also was meant for a lot of one on one talking sections and us building sites together, but I share a room with my sister a 1hr Skype call is not a option for me, he offered to come to my town and we could program in a cafee but that's no option either.

Right now he's sending me vlogs of himself which he thinks that help but really most of the time I can't synch with him (when I can it's great) 

**I want to study on my own** with him just providing feedback or advice but I don't know how to discipline myself to get over the lack of mood so I can see for myself some progress and secondly to show him so that we can synch up more easily on improving my skills.

* I'm concerned that if I apply to these positions, the firm will get a call asking if /u/RedditThrowaway_123 worked for you last summer. It's would be obvious that I'm shopping around elsewhere, and I'm not 100% dedicated to working for them.

Do I just deal with doing public accounting for a while, even though it requires a lot of work and it's not what I want to do long-term?

Am I overthinking this, and they probably won't call for references?

Would the companies not call before an interview anyways?

Thanks for your help guys, I just want to be tactical when going about this."
67xwl0,4,2017-04-27,I am trying to move to Brussels to obtain a career at the European Institutions. How should I begin and what should I do ? Also is there any other advice you can give on moving to and living in Brussels ?,Iamaspookyskeleton,AskEurope,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEurope/comments/67xwl0/i_am_trying_to_move_to_brussels_to_obtain_a/,"Hello

I graduated last year with a degree in International Politics (from a Russel group University that shall not be named, as you will understand soon). I have wanted to move to Brussels to work within the institutions for many years, however due to personal circumstances and a lack of money I had no opportunities to undertake an internship or an Erasmus while at university. I was however fortunate enough to visit Brussels as part of a field trip while at university. During my degree I learned about many European issues such as the institutions, the single market, neighborhood policy, the history of various countries and their relationships etc (this was my major I also studied war, terrorism, weapons, Public Administration etc).

The biggest disadvantages I face is...
1. I can only speak English since I never had the opportunity to learn or practice another language. However I am more than happy to learn French and Dutch, a large part of my interest in Brussels is to learn another language.
2. I lack any contacts within the institutions and my old university seems unwilling to help me.
3. I have no previous internship or trainee experience.
4. Any time I search for information I am bombarded with far too much.

After spending a year working I now have enough money to move to Brussels. I am interested in obtaining an entry level job within the institutions.
So far I have applied for an internship at NATO, and I am also planning on applying for an entry level position within the office for my region.

Is this the right direction or can you offer any alternative advice ?

Getting a certification would look really good when I decide to apply for an internship and separate me from the crowd. My question is if the A+ certification is even worth it for me. It seems like most if is hardware stuff that I probably won't even need later on. Instead, I will go for the Network+, which would be a lot more relevant and help me in my Intro to Networking class next semester."
67ybbh,2,2017-04-27,The Last Sailor Scout,dragonthrowaway1993,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/67ybbh/the_last_sailor_scout/,"[11:59] Chubby Sailor Scouts: It was a quiet afternoon, peaceful, warm, and pleasant. Ami Mizuno, secretly one of the famed Sailor Scouts, had just finished up an internship at a local medical school and was feeling quite hungry, having gone most of the day without eating anything. As she walked to her bus stop to head home, she passed by a diner she never noticed before. Though, she lived a fair bit away from the restaurant, so it made sense why it never crossed her path before. The short-haired bluenette walked in and looked around. It seemed like a good enough place. She'd jsut order something simple, she decided. Something that would be hard to screw up. ""Hello?""
[12:02] Mark the Cook perked up when he heard the bell ring. A customer? He looked out the kitchen window and saw the girl walk in. A cute customer. He closed his book, dusted off his apron, grabbed a menu, and put on the best fake smile that he could as he walked around behind the bar. ""Welcome to the Roadhead Diner,"" he said, placing a menu down in front of a stool. ""What can I get you?""
[12:06] Chubby Sailor Scouts: ""Hello,"" Ami said, looking around the diner. She only just noticed the place was empty. Not really a good sign for the quality of the food, but she couldn't judge. Maybe it was simply a slow day. ""Well, ah, what do you recommend? I'm open to suggestions, really, I'm just hungry. Been a long day at work,"" she said, smiling at what she assumed was the owner judging by his demeanor.
[12:10] Mark the Cook looked the girl up and down. What COULDN'T she use, really. ""How about this,"" he suggests. ""I'll get you a burger, a milkshake, with a side of onion rings?"" He takes back the menu. ""Nobody's been unsatisfied after that.""
[12:12] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami shrugged. ""That sounds delicious."" It was a little more 'junk food-y' than she normally had, but the young woman's appetite was feeling quite voracious at the moment. ""Could I get the burger medium-well please, and with bacon as well?""
[12:18] Mark the Cook nodded and smiled. ""Of course."" He headed to the back, preparing her food and occasionally muttering something under his breath as he worked on each dish. Once he was done, he carried the food back outside and set it down in front of her and stepped back staring at her and waiting to see what she'd eat first.
[12:20] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami smiled as she grabbed her burger and took a look. The bacon was nice and crunchy and there was a fine layer of ketchup on it to help accentuate the flavor. The buns even looked like they might have been homemade. All in all it looked pretty good so she took a big bite to start. ""Mm!"" Ami took another bite, chewed, and swallowed it all. ""Oh, that's great! So juicy and delicious,"" she added.
[12:27] Mark the Cook flashed a thumbs up. ""I'm glad you like it!"" He watched her take a big bite of the burger, and took note of her blush as the first bit of kinky ketchup hit her system. After the second bite, she idly adjusted her seating position as her ass began to swell significantly in her seat, rubbing her thighs together. the effects of the bacon, though, would remain to be noticed, but he did notice her eyes seem to lose focus ever so slightly as the mindmelting mayo began to work its magic.
[12:31] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami smiled as she continued to work on her burger for a while, delighting in it's amazing taste and juicy texture of the patty. As she continued to eat, she lifted up her backside off of the stool in order to adjust her pencil skirt. It was feeling tighter around her butt, but she couldn't' realize the swelling going on underneath, turning a decent rump into two soft, doughy mounds that were still growing. She licked a bit of ketchup off of her lips and blushed. The bluenette was feeling a bit odd. Warm, and lightheaded. She assumed it was simply stress from working all day, so she ate an onion ring and then took a few thick gulps of her milkshake to cool down. The girl had to adjust her skirt again, and as she reached back to pull on the fabric, she accidentally pinched her softer ass. The girl's blush grew more as she enjoyed the pinch, and pushed her thighs together even more.
[12:39] Mark the Cook appreciated her reaction and didn't say anything as she chowed down on her burger, and wished she'd held off on licking the ketchup until after she'd eaten an onion ring. The first bite ramped up the sensitivity of her lips and tongue by several levels, and swallowing it caused her lips to swell up ever so slightly. Drinking down almost half of the milkshake in one go caused her breasts to swell almost instantly to E cups with stiff, sensitive nipples that rubbed up against the tightening fabric of her shirt, undoubtedly straining whatever bra she wore close to breaking, if she wore one at all. the whole time, she was squirming in her seat as her thighs and ass increased in overall sensitivity, her pussy almost definitely getting wet by now from the stimulation. ""Enjoying the meal?"" he asked.
[12:48] Chubby Sailor Scouts: ""Nngh, uh-huh,"" Ami said, gulping down another two onion rings, after dabbing them with ketchup. Her body was shivering, goosebumps were traveling up her arms and thighs as the transformative food worked its wicked ways on the formerly-svelte woman. She looked down at her chest, and realized something was wrong. Her white, button-down shirt was stretched far too much, and both buttons had popped off, exposing cleavage that she didn't have before. As Ami reached to cup one of her breasts, she let out a sultry moan through her thumb-thick lips and drooled a little at the sensitive contact. She barely realized her bra had broken off, or that she had a massive wedgie from her panties trying to surround her large booty that would have looked right at home in a rap music video. ""It's, it's good,"" she mumbled. But she stopped eating for a moment, looking down at her body, trying to stop her hips from moving back and forth and grinding her ass into the seat. But she couldn't stop, her body was not responding to her thoughts. ""What's, mm.. I, mm...."" she said, constantly distracted by her nipples rubbing into the shirt and making her coo in pleasure.
[12:51] Mark the Cook helpfully held up the milkshake and stuck the straw into her mouth. ""Good, good."" he said, encouraging her to drink while she played with her breasts, ""There's plenty more where this came from.""
[12:57] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami licked her lips several times before the straw reached her mouth, like she was peppering them with small kisses over and over again. She tried to pull back as she watched the milkshake approach her lips, but all she did was remove her hands from her breasts and put them back on her booty instead, finding the attraction was magnetic. She squeezed heartily and opened her thick lips wide, sucking on the straw and adding more and more cup sizes with each gulp. Ami moaned with each swallow, squeezing her ass so hard it made her legs twitch up each time.
[13:03] Mark the Cook let her finish off the shake, topping off at a pair of heavy G-cups that shook and wobbled on her chest. One it was done, he held up the last quarter of her burger and began helping it into her mouth. slipping it past her pillowy lips with little interference, and watching as her rear began to grow even more in her hands until her skirt was more like a belt. ""Just relax."" he said, ""Enjoy, feel the warmth spread through you."" That much kinky ketchup should have had her half-past gushing now, and he wondered if the girl had the remaining self-control to not reach between her thighs right then and there
[13:13] Chubby Sailor Scouts: ""Mmph, mm-mm,"" Ami said. The secret Sailor Mercury was trying hard not to let the burger go into her mouth, but the magic of the onion rings had made it so her lips felt more natural opened up and accepting of whatever was placed before them. She whimpered pitifully as she felt her mammoth backside swelling up like dough in the oven. Her panties snapped off inside the skirt, which was getting stretched further and further over her bulging booty like cellophane. Eventually it ripped a bit, and then shot up like a scroll, wrapping around her waist to completely expose her giant ass. The bluenette's butt was almost as big as a set of car tires now, so big it was lifting her up several extra inches. She was so turned on she felt stupid, but couldn't move her hands away from her ass. She felt like plunging her fingers into her pussy would be a bad thing, but the constant pinches and slaps to her butt weren't helping either. ""Mmmm...."" she groaned, dripping with lust.
[13:14] Mark the Cook: ((more transformation? Or sex?))
[13:14] Chubby Sailor Scouts: (She's still got some onion rings left if you wanna do that too)
[13:20] Mark the Cook held up the plate of onion rings and began slipping them past her lips one by one, chuckling as she licked the crumbs off after each swallow until her lips were so thick that the couldn't quite close, settling unto a relaxed ""o"" shape that was capable of at pouting. No doubt when she spoke she'd have quite the lisp. Once she had finished them all, he raised his hand up to her drooling lips and lightly circled them with his thumb before gently pushing them into her mouth and letting her begin to suck it almost on reflex. ""That's a good girl."" he said, ""How would you like a little something extra to suck on as well?""
[13:21] Mark the Cook flicked his eyes over to the ass that she just couldn't stop squeezing. ""Or maybe you'd like something else?""
[13:23] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami looked over at Mark and began to pant as she ate the onion rings. Her thoughts were beyond muddied, most of her head was filled with fantasies of getting fucked or pleasured in some way. She couldn't leave her butt alone, and even though her lips felt so good that she could cum just from sucking on his thumb long enough ,it wasn't what she wanted. ""Mmmuh... "" she groaned, popping his thumb out of her mouth. ""My ash, I 'anna get fffucked in muh ash...""
[13:31] Mark the Cook nods. ""The customer is always right."" he says, walking around behind her and removing her hands from her ass, guiding one between her legs and letter her do as she will with the other. He gave her ass a slap as he undid his pants, slipping his cock in between her massive cheeks and rocking hi hips back and forth, letting her hotdog him. ""How badly?"" he teases, caressing her fat cheeks and lightly pinching them to coax a reaction out of her. ""Tell me how much you want it.""
[13:37] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami was a warrior, a savior of the planet, but even she was helpless to resist the allure of a good cock ramming up her thick ass, if it could even get past the giant mountains of pale, sensitive flesh her butt had become. She groaned with soggy pleasure, rocking her hips back and forth as she felt his cock slide between her butt. Her body felt so hot and warm, she didn't even realize she had begun to finger herself until she squealed from the first of several orgasms. Her other hand reached up under her shirt and pulled a breast free from the shirt's confines, teasing the nipple and fondling the mound. ""Mooore, wannid more dan anehthing ah've evah wanded... pwease, mmm, ah wannid!""
[13:47] Mark the Cook shrugged. ""Who am I to deny a lady in need?"" He spreads her cheeks apart and readies his cock at her backdoor entrance. Without warning, he plunged as much of his length into her as he could, and began to thrust in more deeply. ""Or maybe you're not a lady."" he says, grunting as he fucks her ass. ""Maybe you're something else. What kind of girl lets herself get fucked in the ass by someone she hasn't even met?""
[13:49] Chubby Sailor Scouts: ""Unnngh!"" Ami's whole body trembles with desire as she feels the cook's dick slide right into he rasshole, which accepts him easily thanks to the magic in the food .She leans forward and shoves her now bared breasts into the coutner so he can thrust into her easier. Her body is shaking so hard with arousal that she can barely respond to his pounding, only able to grunt and moan as she fingers and fondles herself. ""Mmmm, ahh! Y-Yeaaah!"" she cooed, unable to respond to the accusations of being a slut. ""More, more, ahh, hawdah!"" she said, licking her lips sultrily.
[13:54] Mark the Cook grunts and accepts her request, pounding her as hard as he can until she's yelping with every thrust. ""What would your friends think?"" he asked. ""They'll probably never look at you the same way again."" He smacks her ass again. ""Unless... Unless you brought them here too, one day. Does that sound fun? They'd see why you couldn't help but be a butt-slut.""
[13:58] Chubby Sailor Scouts: ""Uhh, unngh, uh-huh!"" Ami said, cumming again when Mark spanked her like the begging slut she had become. Her face, now permanently stuck in a pouty expression, moaned like she had been sitting on a sybian for hours. Her body was one whole erogenous zone, it seemed. She had her entire hand up her womanhood and her pink nipples were starting to turn red and purple from how hard she kept pinching them. The thought of other girls being fun, happy sluts like her turned her on even more and helped Mark bring her to orgasm number three. ""Uhh, y-yeah, s-sound fffffun,"" she groaned. ""Budd-slud... ah'ma budd-slud!"" she cooed, slapping her ass.
[14:07] Mark the Cook groaned and thrusted into her one last time, deeper than ever before, and blasted ropes and spurts of thick, alabaster cum into her, splattering her insides with white. ""Good, good."" he says. ""And what do you say for me helping you?""
[14:08] Chubby Sailor Scouts: Ami took a few moments to respond to his question. Her head was so globbed up with cum it was barely possible for her to think. ""Nngh, uh... I dunno... tank you?""
[14:10] Mark the Cook pulled out, nodding. ""That's a good slut."" he says."

Engr major has a question about the next steps to take,meteorohdoom2016,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/67ydd9/4th_year_geo_engr_major_has_a_question_about_the/,"Hey guys/gals of reddit, I don't usually post on here, but I really need some advice.   
A little background on myself:  
Geo. Engr. MAJOR  
Computer Sci. MINOR  
Overall GPA: 3.3  
STEM GPA: 3.4  
Examples of classes: Structure, Min-pet, Differential EQ, Thermo, engr. Geo, sed-strat, geomorphology, mechanics of materials, applied geophysics, ArcGis, Matlab, Java 3
  
I will be attending college for 1 more year to finish up my last 20 hours, and I have been thinking about what I'm going to do. I always used to think that I would just get a job straight out of college. After applying for 9 internships through the GIP program and GeoCorps of America and not hearing back from any of them, I think it'd be best to work on building up my resume and involving myself with volunteer programs. I would like to get my masters; Although I don't know what to study. Hydrogeology and fluid mechanics are very fascinating to me, however I think i really want to learn geophysics. I only took one class in it though so I don't know how transferable I am to a geophysics program. I also really enjoy computer science, but more as hobby. I kinda want to go into O&amp;G or mining, but I don't think that a Geo. Engr degree will get me there. I still have to take my GRE and FE but I'm not too worried about them.  

So I guess my question is:  
Did I get a less valuable degree?  
What should my next step be? 
  
[TL;DR] 
Love my major but having second thoughts about its job outlook and it being what I want it to be. I want to spend my time working on something challenging and worthwhile. "
67yt5d,18,2017-04-27,20F4M - Drunk fucks and office bets with a busty brunette.,poutingpink,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67yt5d/20f4m_drunk_fucks_and_office_bets_with_a_busty/,"It was kinda weird being one of the only female interns at the tech company. Katrina should have been used to it by now, really. The gender disparity was bad enough at university. Out in the real world, though, the ratio of men to women went from pronounced to comical. Everyone was very friendly, sure, but she'd never felt quite brave enough to attend the Friday night drinks as the only girl there...  

It was probably for the best. A 'fuck-pool' had started around the office, with bets climbing higher and higher as to who would fuck the busty, sweet young brunette. Some braver souls had placed more outlandish wagers, like that they could get video evidence, or double team her. They'd never say it to her face, of course, but the spreadsheet detailing how much would be paid out to who for doing what to her was... explicit. Some on the milder end just volunteered to snap her bra-strap, the finally taming the pesky loop of fabric that always seemed to fall loose off her shoulder and drape invitingly over her prominent clavicle. At the far out end things went comical, like being the one to stuff her mouth so full of cum that she went over her limit, making her mascara run and cum to burble down from her cute, upturned nose...

Well, the last day of her internship had arrived. She hoisted her satchel bag over one shoulder, the strap pulling tight between her deep cleavage. She took a half step towards the exit, was distracted momentarily by the sound of music and laughter from the staff lounge... and hesitated.  

She bit her full lower lip, battling herself internally. She was shy, sure. She could only hide behind her big goofy glasses so much before someone would inevitably talk to her any make her blush. But...  

Screw it. It was her last day. She owed it to herself to attend staff drinks at least, once, right?  

What was the worst that could happen?"

She's always done nice things for me, like taking me to Broadway plays on my birthday, driving me to rehearsal every day when I was in shows as a kid, and taking me to lots of doctors when I had a health problem.
But there are some things she does that strike me as a little weird, like...
*how she concealed the fact that I had a stillborn/fetal death twin sister for eleven years, when she told me because it was creepy that I kept saying I wished I was a twin
*being diagnosed with ADHD at four or five by one of her colleagues when I saw the term in one of her psychiatrist magazines and said I thought I might have that (I was reading at that age) and then immediately being put on medication, which stunted my growth because I wasn't eating enough, so
*I had to take growth hormone shots for five years because otherwise I might have been under 4""8' (I'm five feet tall) (also I might not have aDHD?)
*she hired a personal trainer for me when I was thirteen or so, because I was more interested in reading than running around and super clumsy; he didn't know what to do because he was used to dangerously overweight kids, not clumsy skinny kids, but stuck around anyway
*I don't really remember the context for this, but on the advice of my therapist (who was weirded out because my mom kept calling her every day) I packed some sort of bag when I was 18 or 19 or so in case I wanted to just get out of the house for a weekend without my mom knowing, and she found it and yelled at me and for some reason I ended up calling the police? I really don't remember what this whole thing was about, I'm only mostly sure it happened, to be honest.
*when I was a kid she'd keep pulling me out of playdates to tell me what I was doing wrong socially, with advice like ""take the temperature of the room"" ""you need to make eye contact more"" and ""don't wear that, it's too weird""
*getting mad at me and really stressed out because I wasn't applying for summer internships in December and January
and a recent incident I remember cause I took notes
*this one time recently when I was receiving treatment for a dislocated knee, the doctor was like ""hey, take painkillers""
*i was like ""i'll take X painkiller but not Y Super Strength painkiller because it gives me stomach cramps""
*three days later I'm bedridden with horrible stomach cramps, which i mention to my mom 
*""oh yes I put Y Super Strong painkiller in your med box because I didn't think you remembered to take it, I just wanted to help, I'm sorry you weren't paying attention when I told you and you didn't read the email""
*a week later she says she notices a lack of loving energy coming from me
*I say I'm upset about the pill thing
end up checking my email and reading every email she's sent me in the past month out loud to her
*there's no email saying she sent the pills
*a neighbor comes over and changes the subject and we never talk about it again

So anyway, I think my mom might be a narcissist? But she's always so helpful, like she tries to come to my college every week to take me to Whole Foods and do my laundry. And she made sure I cooked and did laundry and learned the right way to put away pots.

I don't know. Am I overreacting?"

My birthday was earlier this week and so to honor that my coworker is having a bbq tomorrow at his house. The hardest thing for me to not drinking is people saying or thinking that I am so young that I can't possible be sober at my age. It is also difficult here in Chile where the drinking age is 18 and it is a lot more casual than it is in the US. 

I think tomorrow will be difficult as I don't want to be rude since they are being very nice and throwing a bbq for me, but I also need to stay strong in not drinking, which is certainly something I have devoted myself to, despite my young age. I have seen the outcomes of alcohol and how it hurts lives, both in my own life and others around me. I was a heavy drinker my freshman year and I did not enjoy it, but could feel myself slipping into a routine and making it my life. I decided that is not for me and am working hard to fight the stigma that all people my age should drink. 

Appreciate all the support!! I also feel better just after simply typing this out!! So I will promise myself right now, that I am NOT going to drink tomorrow!"

6803b3,4,2017-04-27,any Doctorcels here? a short story about my health.,[deleted],Incels,https://www.reddit.com/r/Incels/comments/6803b3/any_doctorcels_here_a_short_story_about_my_health/,"i'm hoping there's a doctorcel here (or maybe gambler with his 160 IQ) who can help me. this post is inspired by my [other](https://www.reddit.com/r/Incels/comments/67zst7/ive_had_a_pain_in_my_left_testicle_for_a_week_im/) post earlier about hopefully having testicular cancer. it made me remember i've never actually told another person about this. i don't particularly care if something's wrong anymore, it's mostly just curiosity at this point. but i'm pretty sure i did some irreversible damage to my heart. this post will be pretty long and pretty boring.

i was extremely fat in my late teens and early twenties. extremely fucking fat. during my senior year of high school i was just over 300lbs and was on a blood pressure prescription. my highest weight was 360lbs a few years later. this first started in the fall of 2010, i remember because i'm a SF giants fan and i watched them win the world series 4-1. i had (and still have) horrible social anxiety, and i had just started an internship that i got through my college so i was super stressed. one night after eating a shitload of food from burger king i started having chest pressure/pain, which i now think was a minor heart attack.  i tried to just block it out and go to sleep. i woke up the next day with my chest very sore and feeling heavy. over the next few days i experienced some very odd symptoms - my ears would feel pressure and would pop, my pinky felt numb like i had fallen asleep on it, and my balance seemed off. i considered going to the ER but didn't because of my social anxiety and not wanting a bunch of nurses to see my fat ass with my shirt off. the timeline from here is a little fuzzy, but for the next few months i was having extreme tightness/pressure in my chest basically 24 hours a day. i would have bad chest pains almost daily as well. the pain also spread to my left arm.  it's hard to decribe - it's mostly a stabbing feeling, a sharp shooting pain, almost like there's a tiny hole in my heart that i can feel. the only position that made the pressure feel slightly better was laying flat on my stomach. this made concentrating on anything fucking impossible because i couldn't focus on shit other than the fact that it felt like there was a 50lb dumbbell on my chest, so i quit my job. this went on for maybe a year and a half, i don't know if it got better or if i just got used to it over time. it got so bad sometimes that i have been convinced i was going to die probably 20+ times. i have very specific memories of a few of them, like laying on my floor next to my dog crying or playing world of warcraft and remembering exactly where i was and what i was doing when it happened. i remember laying in my bed with my hand on my heart to make sure it didn't stop beating.

it mostly went away in 2012 &amp; 2013, but started happening on and off since then. i'm also not fat anymore, i lost 150lbs a couple years ago and got in good shape. so it wasn't just a symptom of being fat as fuck. i remember during the fall of 2015 thinking to myself ""if i can just not die until the holidays are over then it won't be as bad for my family."" i actually went to the ER a few months ago when it was particularly bad, but i'm so autistic that i gave a horrible explanation to the nurses and doctors and just sounded like a retard. i don't think i even mentioned i was 350lbs for multiple years. i had an EKG, chest x-ray, and bloodwork done that i guess were fine because they released me and told me it was probably anxiety or GERD and gave me a bill for $4000. 

anyway, i know this was incredibly jumbled and i sound stupid, and i must've forgotten a ton of stuff, but i just wanted to say it here because i don't have any friends or anywhere else to say it. it will probably only be read by a few people since the sub is private and maybe i'll end up on cringeanarchy. thanks for reading if you made it this far.

6806eh,10,2017-04-27,130 Days - Benefits and Struggles,onoxin,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/6806eh/130_days_benefits_and_struggles/,"Day 131

Hi guys. 

I started my NoFap journey around two/three years ago. Prior to this my life sucked, I had anxiety and would feel sick in most social situations, suffered from Homosexual obsessive compulsive disorder (HOCD) and in general wasn’t a great person be around. Through countless google searches about my HOCD I came across NoFap and I’m so happy I did! 

It wasn’t an easy path for me by all means! I would relapse regularly, having small streaks which I would break through big relapses. I did however know that NoFap worked because of the huge benefits I would see in these small periods, and during big life events e.g. starting university and exams I would try and maintain a streak to see these benefits. One day, I don’t know what happened, but it became easier and PMO no longer appealed to me and the thought of watching porn disgusts me now – I believe that NoFap isn’t something you can just get straight into, but is progressive and something you need to work towards for a long time (so don’t expect to quit instantly, just keep working at it)

This has been by far the best thing I have done for myself in 20 years - I feel great! I am able to hold eye contact with anyone and attract it from a lot of females! My appearance has improved - I finally take care of myself and go to the gym every day and maintain a strict diet. I also managed to land a huge one-year internship at a massive company during my year off at University – In the interview my confidence was sky high and I felt like everyone liked and was attracted towards me, it was amazing. Lastly, I have returned to working on a website that I’ve been trying to build for the last 3/4 years, and am starting to make some ground with it and am loving every second of it. 

However, life hasn’t been all amazing. Unfortunately, me and my girlfriend of one year broke up half way through this journey as she is from a different ethnic background and her mother didn’t agree. This has been really hard for me and I’m not really sure what to do at the moment in this situation. NoFap for sure though has helped me not get into any bad habits again, and if anything has encouraged me to pick up even more habits towards self-improvement and ensured I have a clear head and don’t act irrationally. 

After this break-up I undertook cold showers as a way to see more benefits.  I would definitely recommend these once you’re ready for the next stage, these make you feel even better when combined with NoFap. They really get you ready for the day when you have them in the morning, help with sleep at night, do a great job at clearing your skin up and give you more energy! I have also been trying to quit smoking Weed – I’m not sure if this is something I will benefit from, but I believe that smoking is instant gratification, and something I’m trying to move away from. 

I’m also considering undertaking meditation, and was wondering what your opinions are on this, is this something that you guys would recommend, and if so, how do I get started? Is there anything you would recommend me watching/reading to learn about it first?

I would say even though I am 131 days in and my urges have drastically reduced, it is still really hard sometimes to keep a positive mind set and not fall back into these harmful habits. But reminding yourself that this is worth it and 30 seconds of pleasure isn’t worth the days of regret and guilt you feel after. I couldn’t imagine what I would have been like if I didn’t discover NoFap and in all honesty it’s quite scary to think about the person I would be without it!

If you have any questions or advice, please comment I would love to hear what you guys have to say. Good luck to everyone on this great journey!

6806fw,15,2017-04-27,Should I stay or should I go?,3rdeyewhisperer747,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6806fw/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,"My whole life, my mother has tried to control me to the point I would rely on her for the rest of my life. During high school, I was good at making money and ended up making a hell of a lot of money. Enough to pay for at least a year of a private college. At the time, I kept the money in a custodial account under my grandmother's name because she was the only one I can trust. Before I turned 18, my mother found out about the money and convinced my grandmother to give it to her claiming that she would not have to pay taxes if she transfered the money into her name. Since then I have not seen a dime of that money. 

During my first semester of college, I ran out of money in my checking account and that really screwed me over financially and made it harder living day by day. Sadly I failed a class which I should have not taken until at least my sophomore year of college. Because of that she convinced my father to keep me from going back to college. If I stayed in college I would have had a paid internship in my focus area of study Finance. By doing this she basically made it harder and longer for me to get a degree and a good corporate internship. Then she took me to a colleague of hers (who is a psychiatrist) who knew everything going on. I admitted that I felt depressed and felt like my life was falling apart which was a big mistake. She then said I had a marijuana addiction where she prescribed a medication which made me feel way worse then what I was feeling. I stopped taking the medication entirely and felt much better. Once my mother found out I stopped taking the medication, she made up that the medication was there to cure my marijuana ""addiction"". She ""forces"" me to take it even watching me take it even though I am 18. In fact I just pretended to take it just now. After I take it, she tries to convince me I was the person in the wrong and that I should be thanking her. 

Honestly I wouldn't currently be in this situation if I still had the money she took from me but all is getting better because I have a job and I am currently saving money to leave. I am currently trapped in a situation where if i leave, I can either strive in making money or fail miserably and screw up even more. But is the risk worth taking? If I don't take it, I will basically be her slave until I leave and has anyone else ever been in a similar situation?

I forgot to mention before I posted but she would look through my emails and would check my Google maps timeline to see where I would go. I put an end to it once I caught on and she admitted to looking through my mail. I also caught her going through my stuff because she found evidence that I owned the account before she took the money. "

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside the fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

ARMCOMEDY TO GUEST STAR ON CONAN O’BRIEN SHOW DURING THEIR U.S. TOUR

 

 

LOS ANGELES, CA – The Armenian Assembly of America (Assembly) and Armenia Tree Project (ATP) are pleased to announce that ArmComedy co-hosts Narek Margaryan and Sergey Sargsyan will guest star on Conan O’Brien’s late night talk show on TBS. Narek and Sergey will be in the U.S. during their benefit tour co-sponsored by the Assembly and ATP.

 

ArmComedy is performing at Winchester Town Hall in the Boston area on Friday, April 28 (www.armeniatree.org/armcomedy); at Stars on Brand in Glendale on Thursday, May 4 (www.itsmyseat.com/armcomedy); and at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts in the San Francisco bay area on Saturday, May 6 (www.armeniatree.org/mvcpa).

 

Even though this is their first U.S. tour, this will not be the ArmComedy duo’s first interaction with Conan. In 2014, Conan O’Brien visited a pawn shop in Los Angeles, owned by Armenians, with his assistant, Sona Movsesian. In the episode, he tried to sell the bobble head of himself for $6 million, but the owners would not go over $10,000. So, instead, Conan pledged to donate the giant bobble head to Armenia. Narek and Sergey watched this episode, and reached out to Conan to request his infamous giant bobble head.

 

The following year, in 2015, Conan traveled to Armenia with Sona where he made a guest appearance on ArmComedy. Narek and Sergey quizzed Conan on his knowledge of Armenian culture, and then took him on a journey through every essential Armenian experience, including barbecuing outdoors and playing backgammon. Conan explained his possible Armenian roots and signed a release form authorizing ArmComedy to spread rumors about his Armenian ancestry. Before the end of the episode, Conan invited Narek and Sergey as a special guest to his late night talk show in Los Angeles, which will take place next month in between the Assembly’s and ATP’s benefit shows.

 

The Armenian Assembly of America, founded in 1972, is the leading non-partisan advocate for Armenia and Armenians in the United States. The Assembly was the first Western private voluntary organization to establish an office in Yerevan. Working with many NGOs, the Assembly is proud of its role in fostering civil society initiatives in Armenia. The Assembly continues to be one of the most respected advocacy organizations in Washington, DC and this year is celebrating the 40th anniversary of its very successful Terjenian-Thomas Internship Program.

 

Since 1994, ATP planted more than 5.2 million trees and created hundreds of jobs for Armenians in Armenia. These trees provide food, environmental benefits, and opportunities for economic growth. ATP's goal is to use trees to improve the standard of living while protecting the environment. In doing so, ATP promotes self-sufficiency, and aids those with the fewest resources while conserving the indigenous ecosystem. Most importantly, ATP's programs allow inhabitants to stay on their ancestral lands.

68518j,1,2017-04-28,College Student Looking for Financial Options,college_throwaway001,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/68518j/college_student_looking_for_financial_options/,"Hey PF, long-time lurker.

I'm looking for some advice on my budget for next year (college sophomore).  This is the first time I'm planning to be fully financially independent in my life and I want to make sure that I'll be ready for it.


So far, I'm starting from a pretty clean slate. I'm working an internship this summer which is going to net $8,000 and 2 side jobs ($520/wk) for $6,240 combined, or $14,240 for the entire summer.  My expenses for the next year:

* Rent: $400/month, utilities included, 9 months

* Food: est. 50/week, 9 months

* Car: Need to buy, how much should I set aside?

* Insurance: ~200/month, 2400/year

* School: paid for



=[est. $6,440 after known expenses]


I don't plan on working over the year unless I need to, but I can continue freelancing here and there, even though I don't make a whole lot off of it.  My questions:

1) Can I afford to buy a car?  I live in a snow state but my house next year is two blocks from campus.  I have the credit score to finance (700) with my parents very willing to cosign.

2) Should I be putting money into savings or stock accounts of any kind?  How would that work with a minimal tax impact since my employers will not be offering full-time level benefits as far as I know?


Thanks for the read and the help PF!

685893,1,2017-04-28,Should I [22 M] continue to try to make it work with my girlfriend [22 F] of a year and a half?,throwawayJ011395,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/685893/should_i_22_m_continue_to_try_to_make_it_work/,"I apologize in advance for the long post but I got a lot to unload and really just need some advice/clarity to whats been going on in my head for the past year. (this is my first relationship)


So there was this girl, we'll call her V, who I had known for a couple years who I was always sort of into. V was extremely attractive and bit of a party girl who liked to drink and do some occasional cocaine. Other than the partying she is generally quiet and has very few friends, most of which are guys. Nothing ever came of my interest in her due to her having a boyfriend. Word gets around that her boyfriend (We'll call him D) was moving out west for an internship for several months and that they were going to attempt a long distance relationship. Fast forward a couple months and I find out that V is going to be living with one of my friends (We'll call him C) at the college I attend starting in January 2016. The first night she moves in we hang out she confesses that she had also been interested in me for several months ]and that when she visited her boyfriend out west a few weeks earlier things didn't go well and they hadn't talked since. We ended up hooking up that night and then several more times over the next couple of weeks.


While we weren't officially dating we were inseparable, having sex every day and her sleeping at my place every night hanging out all the time, Valentine's Day gifts etc... pretty much just doing everything one would do in a relationship. One night in mid February our good friend C throws a party. I sleep at C and V's place that night in V's bed with her where she confesses to me that earlier in the night she was drunk and made out with one of my other friends (We'll call him J). I was very upset and expressed that to her and left the next morning. She called texted and did everything to apologize and eventually I decided that since we weren't officially together I would forgive her.
 

About a week later we get into a minor fight and she tells me that she tried to have sex with J but it didn't work because he was too drunk. Again I get mad but ultimately forgive her. I talked to J about it and he assured me that he would back off as he didn't know we were a thing A week later we have a snow day, big parties outside in the snow around C and V's place. I go down and party there around 6 me and V go to have sex in her room. Afterwards I fall asleep and she goes back out to party while I was out. I meet up with her later and we go to sleep together.


Everything is good for a couple of weeks until one night after the bar we have sex and she confesses that she had sex with J on the day of the snow day about an hour after she had sex with me. I, being drunk, absolutely lose my shit (temper problems that I haven't recognized until recently) I broke several things before I left her apartment. I didn't talk to her for several days before caving, I told her that this is becoming serious and if she wanted it to continue we would be exclusive regardless of if we were officially dating or not and that she needed to promise me something like that will never happen again and that she is to never talk to J again. She was remorseful and agreed.


We officially decide to start dating at the beginning of march. Everything was great until the end of April when we get into a fight and she breaks up with me for a few days. We get back together and one night after she was being weird and distant i went through her phone, not proud of it but I needed to see what was going on. In her messages I found out that her Ex had come back from out west and that she had been texting him and hung out with him twice. I was upset but she assured me nothing happened between them and that she was just confused. I told her to cut contact and that would be the end of it. Again she agreed. A few days later, having my trust in her severely shaken I go through her phone again to discover that she had sex with my old friend C twice a couple of days after J (I haven't talked to C or J since). Again I confronted her and she cried and apologized and she said she would stay away from both of them. 


Again everything goes good until mid May she decides to hang out with C against my wishes. I forgive her and try to understand that C is one of her only friends and that we technically weren't together when it happened. We work through and things are not perfect but okay for a while. We start saying that we love each other around this time. The first weekend in June I go on a four day vacation with my parents from Thursday to Sunday. When I get there on Thursday night I open a ""find my iphone"" app to find out that V is at her ex boyfriend D's house. I confront her the next day and even drive a couple hours back home to talk to her about it in person. She isn't sorry at all and when I ask why she went she answerd with ""because I felt like it."" She accused me of invading her privacy and tracking her (which ill admit was wrong but not as wrong as being at your ex's house). We break up for a couple weeks before we talk. In the talk I ask if she still had feelings for her ex and if she was sleeping with him, she answered ""no"" to both of these. We end up getting back together. She starts to withhold sex from me, is weird about kissing me, constantly criticizes my sexual performance and gets annoyed or angry at anything I do, all just really weird suspicious behavior I brush it off as just her not being happy with the amount of arguing and go about my summer. 

With the 2016 Semester kicking off we both move into our respective apartments. The first Saturday at school we go out and party together. We go back to my place and have sex. Afterwards she says that she ""just isn't attracted to me anymore"" and leaves. Shocked I take the remainder of her things over to her place that night where she throws the wireless router I gave her at my head. I get very angry and throw her door open to go in and get the rest of my things from her place. When I threw the door open it accidentally hit her in the head. We end up arguing for most of the night before I leave. As soon as I leave she tells me to come back. I go back and we have sex and she is seemingly okay and affectionate again. While there I texted her ex D who's number I got off of a coworker. I tell him that this is V's boyfriend and V has been using his Uber to get us to the bar/casino etc. and that I had just found out and that he might want to change his password or something so she doesn't rack up a bunch of charges on his card. He texts me back with the reply ""Who is this? I thought I was V's boyfriend?"" 

Turns out V had been dating both of us. Like not just sleeping with D but in a full blown relationship with him, telling him that she loved him etc.. I am furious and go to her apartment to demand some answers. (this next part I am not too proud of) I knock on the door and when she answers a sort of force my way in and demand to know what the fuck is going on. She confirms what D had told me and that she was more concerned that D was upset with her and asks me to leave. I start to grab everything that I bought for her over the summer to take to which her response is to start hitting me in the head/face. I push her off me as gently as I can While on the way out she swings a makeup mirror at my face. The mirror shatters over me cutting my lip (later requiring 6 stitches). I drop everything that I had grabbed and just leave. 

I didn't talk to her for a while until one night when she came into my apartment (left the door unlocked) with a pizza as a ""peace offering"" She apologized and left. 

Over the next month or so we remain in contact and she expresses a desire to get back together with me. I have her over one night for a couple drinks and to talk. We end up having sex. Over the next several months V absolutely kisses my ass, buys me things, has sex with me whenever I want to, Doesn't hang out with C or do anything bad. She tells me she made a terrible mistake and that D is out of the picture. I told her that I wasn't going to be committing to anything with her for the foreseeable future and that I wanted to see other people (she knew I had been and was extremely jealous) and that she was not allowed to be seen in public with me or come to my place. She says she understands and I go about my Fall enjoying other girls while continuing to sleep with V. 

Around November I began to redevelop feelings for V as she seemed to be a changed person. I agree to maybe give it another shot as long as she promises to go to counseling, stay away from the cocaine, and be committed to being a better person. She does all of this for the most part. I find out that she had still been hanging out with D during the fall semester before he decided to go back out west. Additionally I found out that V had gotten back together with D in the month that we weren't talking and was still dating him the first time we had sex again in September, and had also told him initially to come back the previous April because she wanted to be with him. I again feeling like a was a stupid backup plan was infuriated and kicked her out. She later buys me dinner and tells me that nothing happened between the two in that time (which I honestly believe). I told her that I was really tired of the constant lies and secrets and that it needed to stop. D has since moved back out west. We started dating again around late November. My parents hate her for the way she treated me so I kept that I started seeing her again from them (which makes her mad for some reason). 

Winter break goes by and I couldn't find work over break and couldn't afford to get her anything for Christmas or her Birthday (its on January 13th) The night before New Years she goes and hangs out with C against my wishes again. When I confront her about it she again acts like she doesn't care and accuses me of my dislike of C being stupid and that it ""happened before we were together and that I need to let it go"" Totally disregarding the fact that he was a friend of mine who knowingly took advantage of drunk V who he knew I was seriously talking to and almost dating. She calls the next day and apologizes and assures me that it wont be an issue again. 

February rolls around and we are happy for the most part and she is seemingly a better person. My only rule is that she doesn't hang out with C or go to his place (several of her other guy friends live there with him). 


Over time she begins to disrespect my wishes again and goes over to C's house a couple of times, insisting that i'm being unreasonable for not letting/wanting her to go over there. I tell her that she is either going to have me as a partner or him as a friend. 

Several arguments erupt with her holding the ""I don't care"" about this attitude and going out of her way to purposely piss me off during an argument. I'm ashamed to admit it but during a couple of arguments i let my temper get the better of me. I never hit her but I did push her. I am currently undergoing counseling to help control my anger. 

About 2 days ago I went through her phone and found out that sometime in February she told me she was getting drinks with her girl friend. Instead she went to the bar with one of her male coworkers and then crashed at one of his friends house. Also found out that she continued to go to the bar and hang out with C by lying to me about who she was going out with. We are currently broken up and I'm not sure this is worth saving. Someone give me some advice. 

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend has cheated on me a couple of times and has treated me like shit in general. got back with her when she started to do better but has since resorted back to her usual lying manipulative ways. 

Should I try to talk to her or is she a lost cause? "

-The Steelers offense cuts through defenses like a Raiders fan at a Walmart Express; the young secondary holds it down on defense.  

-Antonio Brown refuses to answer questions about the mysterious fanny pack he began wearing in week 2

-Dupree has the monster season that everyone expects and draws double teams.  Watt benefits and, against the Bengals in week 12, has 2.5 sacks and a FF against Primetime Dalton

-Watt shining brightly on Monday Night dawns a new nickname Limelight, Light for short

-The OLB Duo, now known as ""Bud Light"", becomes official sponsor of the Bengals' Hell. Continues to wreak havoc, and helps the Steelers clinch the division on Christmas day against the Texans and ""TJ Watt's brother""

-James Harrison is fined 100K for passing more drug tests
than the maximum number allowed by the CBA (r/ravens still complains he's juicing)

-As part of his reinstatement, Martavius Bryant must do advertisements for NFL sponsors.  He is fined 25K for refusing refusing to drink a Bud Light during a commercial.  Eventually he caves and becomes violently ill all over set.

- Bryant is tested immediately following the commercial shoot, and found to have alcohol in his system.  He is given a lifetime ban.  Yinzers call into The Fan, berating the Steelers for ""drafting another bust""

-The Steeler fan sued by Anheuser-Busch for trademark infringement after chanting ""Here we go"" at game turns out to be Jeff Reed

-Le'veon Bell is diagnosed late in the season with a rare allergy to participating in meaningful playoff games

-Tied at 24-24 with 1 second left after the score, Tomlin goes for two.  Ben lumbers to his right and floats a pass to a wide open Sammie Coates.  All the lights at Foxboro turn off for a split second.  When they come back on, the ball is on the ground and Coates spotted fleeing into the tunnel.  
- It was later discovered that an intern accidentally tripped over a plug, and the Steelers.  
-  r/nfl scholar cites example of similar incident happening to his team during pregame warmups, states that it had no impact on outcome of game, receives 11k upvotes and gold

-On the first play of OT, Harrison strip sacks Brady and Shazier runs it in for a touchdown

- Replay officials in New York declare ""a do-over""

-The next play James Harrison knocks Sebastian Vollmer into the Shadow Realm, just as Brady throws an annoying 5 yard slant route

- 5'9 Golson, hiding behind a blitzing Sean Davis, intercepts it.  He disappears into a crowd of blockers like a crableg at the Winston household, and emerges on the other side, tearing both his achilles as he dives into the endzone

-PFF names Odell Beckham Jr Super Bowl MVP

685xw9,1,2017-04-28,"My experience with interviews at Microsoft, Google and AT&amp;T this past week.",cscqsaver,ComputerScientists,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerScientists/comments/685xw9/my_experience_with_interviews_at_microsoft_google/,"Last week I made a post saying that I had three interviews in one week with Microsoft, Google and AT&amp;T. I wanted to post an update with what happened and my experiences with each one. All interviews except google were for internships.
Microsoft
This was the first interview of the week. I flew in Sunday morning and got to the hotel later on at night. Microsoft paid for the rental car up front so I didn't have to pay anything. At the hotel food was already paid for by them also so I just ordered from the hotel. The next morning I had to be in the main recruiting office by 8AM (there was probably 50 people there). From there you can grab some free snacks and drinks and was able to play some video games while we waited for our recruiters. The recruiter I talked to was really awesome and for only knowing about me for a day he did quite a bit of research and knew quite a bit about me. He spent about 10 minutes talking about what happens during the interview process and how lunch is going to work out. Then for the next 10-15 minutes we kind of talked about Seattle and what he thought about living here then moved onto talking sports. This time was really to make sure you were calm and confident prior to the interviews.
For the interviews, there were 5 interviews (2 before lunch, 2 after lunch and the lunch interview). On a side note, if you get walked out after lunch, it's over. This was about the time that you heard which team you're interviewing for; I interviewed for the Bing Maps team. Each of these were about an hour apiece, although some went longer when the interviewers really got interested in my work. Each interview had about 2 problems which, if you know the cracking the coding interview, you shouldn't have many problems answering. Talking through the problems and asking questions to keep your interviewer involved was the big thing. When you started asking questions they seemed to be more interested. For the lunch interview, you talk to the recruiter for a while and ask questions that you want answered. We went over my thesis work and why I picked what I did. After you're both done eating then you'll officially start the 3rd interview.
After the interviews were done, my recruiter and I met back in the recruiting building and discussed what I thought about Microsoft and if I had any other companies I'm interviewing for (I was honest here). After that they ask you to fill out a survey and give you free taxi vouchers and vouchers for shows and free food. You're also able to shop at the Microsoft employee store before you leave. The next morning I flew out from Seattle into San Jose Airport for the Google interviews. When I landed, less than 12 hours from my last interview, I had about 3 missed calls from my recruiter. When I was able to call him back he said congratulations and gave me an offer for the summer internship. After that we discussed the compensation and how the summer internship was going to work. This interview gave me a whole different view of how Microsoft worked and surprised me a little bit.
Google
Google was similar to Microsoft when it came to car rentals and the hotel. Since I got my ticket so late I had to stay in San Francisco instead of near Mountain View. The food wasn't actually pre-paid this time so I had to buy dinner out of my own pocket but they're refunding me for it. The next morning the interviews actually started at 10:30 vs 8 at Microsoft. On the exit to Mountain View, I saw a best buy and thought that it must be the least technical thing for the next 5 miles. I still got in around 8 to meet up with a friend of mine and have breakfast at Google. I found it amazing that there was free food and coffee, but also a bowling alley in the building. At 10:30, I met with my recruiter talked about the processes. This was pretty similar to Microsoft. The exception was that lunch was not an official interview. So I only had 4 45 min - 1 hour interviews, and talked to a software engineer during lunch about their experience at Google. She also explained that I wouldn't be interviewing for a team but that would be picked later if I were to get an offer.
During the first interview I realized that this was going to be very difficult. All of Microsofts interviews combined didn't equal the difficulty of this one interview. Only the 2nd interview was I able to finish 2 problems. Everyone else I only got through 1 question. For lunch we actually just walked around campus till we found a place that looked good. All of this was free (as opposed to the Microsoft food), and the engineer I was talking to complained about how much weight he put on having free food :). When it was over with I kind of figured that it was over, I didn't feel the same like I did after the Microsoft interviews. So I emailed my recruiters and thanked them for their time and the opportunity to interview for Google, then I figured it was over... or so I thought. It wasn't till Friday that I got an email from the recruiter saying that all the feedback was great and that she was submitting a package for the hiring committee and asked if I wanted a couple of professors to submit a LOR on my behalf. So Tuesday I should get a response back from the hiring committee on if I'll move forward or not and will update this when it happens. (On a side note, Google couldn't offer any internships and interviewed me full time).
P.S. When I filled up the gas tank on the rental car, prior to returning it, somehow the pump stopped at exactly 2.2222 gallons for $7.77.
AT&amp;T
I flew home from Google on Wednesday Night and got back around 1AM. I drove home took a quick shower and drove to the nearest regional airport and got on another plane to fly down to Dallas for AT&amp;T experience weekend/interviews. In all I was only home for about an hour (at this point I'm very tired in the week). AT&amp;T really made this weekend a fun experience but official at the same time. This was the first time I dressed up all week (jeans and a t-shirt for other interviews). After getting into the airport a limo company met all the people at the airport and drove us back to the hotel individually (all 100 of us). That night we had a presentation from one of the higher up execs and was served a full 3 course meal while talking with some execs about working at AT&amp;T. This meal is going to make the next month or two of food in my apartment taste really bad :(...
The next morning we were up at 6:30AM after breakfast toured the main AT&amp;T HQ and visited places like their Social Networking room where they were able to see problems occur in real time. i.e. when they mentioned not installing fiber in 100's of cities across the country, they were able to see the whole country hate them in real time. From here we did a tour of Perot Museum and American Airlines Stadium to show how they managed to installed all of their antenna's without anyone every seeing that the antennas were ever there. It was kind of neat to see the custom antenna's built for hard to reach places. We finished the tours with the Foundry tour and saw all the cool neat devices that were coming out of that place. After that we went back to the hotel and had a mini-hackathon (without coding). The idea was to come up with the next best thing based on specific things. There was extra credit for doing an ""It Can Wait"" project. Everyone based their idea around the smart car except for us. I basically confused everyone by bringing up the idea to use torrenting and seeding to speed up data transfer to create the new 5G service. (This was an idea I read a while back from a journal article published out of California). Needless to say everyone was confused and we didn't win :). That night they had a dinner again (with food that makes me cry thinking about how I have to go back to my apartments fridge) and thanked us for coming out. They finished the dinner giving everyone free beats HD headphones. (Thanks for the Christmas Gift AT&amp;T, it's going to make someone in my family pretty happy) We finished that night with free ice cream and a sober style college party with video games we could play. This gave us the opportunity to network with some of the AT&amp;T staff.
The next day we had a thank you breakfast prior to the interviews and everyone had the chance to get a professional photo taken for linkedin. The interviews were weird, we had everything in the hotel and the internship interview was only 25 minutes long. They asked 3 behavioral question (actually this was the first behavioral question I saw all week) and 1 technical question (very very easy). After that you got an answer within 10 minutes of leaving the room. I heard the full time position was the same except for 2 interviews. Surprisingly I got a no from this interview. As we finished our interviews they gave us togo lunches and shuttled us back to the airport. This was a cool little trip down to Dallas. They want to do it again, if you see the chance to do it I recommend taking it.
All in all I had a great week and have a lot of stuff to catch up on.
TL;DR: Had a deadline, Microsoft and Google scheduled within the same week (AT&amp;T was already scheduled months ago). Microsoft said yes, Google is submitting a package to the hiring committee and AT&amp;T said no.
Edit
Several people asked for my resume.
I completely agree with this guys recent post for interview prep.
Edit 2
I just got an offer from Google.

685znr,1,2017-04-28,Sargon: Prologue,Maninahouse,LoreHeavy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoreHeavy/comments/685znr/sargon_prologue/,"“Is it set up? Yeah? Alright, in three, two,” Ignatius gestured for The Ambassador to speak. The screen in front of the pair glowed blue, and the long-awaited hologram blinked into existence. Ignatius Chevolt looked on.

“The date is April 10, 2210. And the time is,” The Ambassador checked his watch, “approximately 5:19 in the morning. Good morning, Florence!” The alien in the hologram blinked. A nasal voice erupted from his sharp mouth. 

“I bid you good day, Osmul. A rather beautiful day here on Sargon, actually. The grass is blooming this time of year, and the clouds are certainly helping with the heat. Let’s get down to business.” 

“Ah good. Florence, as you quite well know, today marks the 100th anniversary of our two species meeting. As festivities go on on both Earth and Sargon, we have some small matters to discuss.” The Ambassador paused speaking here and took a sip of Coke. He was born a human martian, but both his parents were humans from Earth. Widely regarded as the greatest public speaker and ambassador of all human history, he was a direct descendent of the legendary Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He was also married to the descendent of Edward Everett, which only added to his fame. Florence Seegan, the Sargonian Ambassador to Earth, just sat and watched from the hologram. The Ambassador continued.

“Well, to start things off we have a few housekeeping procedures we must get done. Our bicentennial peace treaties need to be renewed, so I’ll send that to you in a bit.” Florence nodded and leaned in, and The Ambassador raised an eyebrow expectantly.

“There’s something else, isn’t there?” Florence nodded again, and The Ambassador, whose real name was Osmul Thatch, gestured for Ignatius to leave. Ignatius obliged, and Florence continued.

“Last week, a team of archeologists were exploring and digging around the Southern Mountains here in Sargon. They discovered an ancient cave, blocked off by large dunes of sand. Inside, they found Rajoxle. The real one. I’m not sure what to do, so I’m asking for your help.” Florence sat back with an exhale.

“Bring it here,” said Osmul. “Bring it here now. We can’t afford losing this artifact while we have it.” He was in a state of shock at this colossal news.

“But, you do realize what this means, right?” Osmul nodded. “Ever since it was lost, Sargon has been ruled by two equal rulers. And for the past century, it’s been the two Ambassadors who’ve equally ruled both Earth and Sargon. Now that gives us the decision of where to put the artifact. I’ll personally deliver it to you next month, but we can’t tell anyone about this. Not yet, anyways. We’d be dead within the hour. Agreed?” Florence looked at Osmul, and waited for a response.

“Agreed. See you in May.” Osmul sighed and shut off the hologram. He got up, and opened the door to the darkened office space. Ignatius, his intern, was waiting for him outside.

“I’ve got those treaties we have to renew today right here, sir. Is there anything else?” Ignatius was a good intern, and would probably take up Osmul’s job when he died. Osmul knew he was a good lad, but he wasn’t giving up his job anytime soon. Oh, he had a better plan.

“No, that’ll be all. Dismissed.” Osmul took the treaties and signed them quickly. All he had to do now was wait. 

A month later, Osmul was sitting in his office, thinking of phrases to use in his next speech. On the paper he had in front of him were a few expressions, none of them good but none too bad either. They included, ‘I’ll keep the peace together with friction of humanity,’ among other things. Just then, the doorbell rang. Osmul shot up and went to the origin of the sound.

He opened the door to find Florence Seegan with a large box in his hands. He was sweating, as the days on Earth had become considerably warmer since his last visit. 

“Florence! Great to see you in person. It’s been, what, almost 2 years? Come inside, come inside. Please, make yourself at home.” 

Florence thanked Osmul and set the box down near the door. The two went to the room over and sat down, across from each other on two juxtaposed couched. 

“I assume that’s what I think it is?” asked Osmul, leaning back on the velvet couch. Florence nodded. He tried to catch his breath

“Yes, that’s the sword. I’ve marketed my coming to Earth as a necessary visit, a formalities sort of thing. But,” Florence got up, “I’m afraid I have matters to attend to. I still haven't paid off that flat in Paris and the government's been breathing down my neck and up my kilt about it. I’ll see you tomorrow, so remember to keep it safe. Goodbye.” Florence waved to Osmul and opened the front door. He exited after one last look at the box on the ground. It was late at night, and Florence Seegan just wanted a drink. He walked across the street to a late-night comedy club. Surreptitiously, Osmul followed him. 

“Hello. Is this thing on?” A comedian breathed heavily into the microphone, sweating beads onto his chin. “My wife said I had to be here tonight. Actually, it was my agent.” Florence walked over to the bar, where he tuned out the terrible comedian. Sitting down, he turned and looked at the hologram television nesting in the rack of wines to his front. Osmul covertly entered and watched Florence from across the room.

    “The usual, sir?” The bartender knew Florence well. Florence was, after all, the Sargonian Ambassador-Elect to the Empire. Florence nodded and was handed a blue, tall glass of Hadéfo. With a drink Florence got up, rejuvenated, and left the comedy club. The limousine parked in front was glistening in the light of the two nearby streetlamps. A valet recognized him, and opened the door to a bright yellow taxi. Florence clambered inside, and Osmul flagged down a second taxi just as Florence pulled away. 

“Hit it! Get to the Algonquin!” The cabbie nodded and sped away. They arrived and Osmul paid him in cash. Osmul entered just as Florence pulled up.

Florence Seegan was then escorted to his hotel room. Thanking the bellhop, he closed the door. Walking over and laying down on his king-sized bed, Florence fell asleep almost instantly. The Ambassador, who was hiding in the corner, grinned grinch-like. This was his chance. 

    Osmul stepped out of the shadows. However, he wasn’t his usual self. Not at all. In his right hand, he held a bladed weapon. It was a creation of the First Sargonians, thousands of years prior to this moment. He knew he was making history, right in this hotel room. Walking over to the bed, he held Rajoxle up high. The Ambassador plunged the blade into Florence Seegan’s chest, and jumped over to the window across the room. Onlookers have said that they heard the following words come out of his mouth just before he fell:

“I’ve started a fire! Glory to Sargonians!”

The following political crisis was irrevocable. Humans and Sargonians, fighting in the streets, and politicians quarreling constantly. The hundred year peace that had kept the Gregorians and Sargonians in line was broken. Both sides were too afraid of the other to initiate actual warfare, but relations would never be the same again. Within weeks, Rajoxle was lost again. Everyone searched for it, but it was never found. 

The son of The Ambassador, namely Osmul Thatch Jr., went into hiding soon after the incident. Within forty years, Sargon’s natural resources had depleted completely. Desertification began on the planet, and the last blade of grass withered and died sometime during the summer of 2238. Sargonians had to import water from Proxima Centauri for the  first time. Humans had been doing this since 2066.

Rajoxle had disappeared. Humans were exploring more and more space, but were weakened without the Sargonian help they needed. The galaxy was relatively peaceful until a radio in Buenos Aires picked up a signal from something much greater than they could have ever imagined. Gravitational waves unlike anything people had seen before. A rough, janky signal led them to believe a new sentient race was in trouble, and they opened up a wormhole above Sargon that lead to the source of the signal. What came out was horrifying.

They called themselves Eccians, and arrived in a massive, burning ship from millions of light years away. They soon destroyed Earth, and roughly 90% of the 30 billion human population along with it. A violent race, Eccians relied on military cruelness for power, and couldn’t comprehend the human’s desire to be friendly. They dethroned the two Ambassadors -- including Ignatius -- and took over control of Sargon. Humans were outlawed by the new Empire, and the leader declared himself Ruler. Of course, nobody accepted him because he had not the sword, Rajoxle. But then, fate looked at the cards and declared that evil had the winning hand. 

In 2267, a young Eccian by the name of Denos was found wielding the sword in gang battles on the streets of Sargon. He quickly gained a cult following, and the power went to his head. Nine years later, Denos murdered the Eccian Leader with Rajoxle and was officially Ruler of Sargon. The Eccians accepted him as the leader and came to worship him. Humanity seemed to be nearing an end, and people were committing suicide in the streets just to avoid being captured by the Eccians. All hope had been long gone when Osmul Thatch Junior had a child named Harold in the old mining caves far south of the city shortly after Denos gained control.

The Ambassador’s son was an old man by then. He had been born in 2199, and couldn’t take care of his wife anymore. He sent his wife and newborn son to the city, with the hopes of finding a foster home for the child somewhere inside.

They had no such luck when they reached the South Gate. The woman was near-death, and the baby was mistreated and handled carelessly. Humans were no longer the great leaders of the future, but instead had become lowlife scum-dogs of the Sargonian streets. The woman was banished from the city and she died in the desert right outside the walls.

The child was brought to Lord Denos, who asked that it be put into the military when it reached 10 years. Denos had not become addicted to adrenaline yet, so he still was slightly humane towards children and humanity in general. Luckily for Harold Thatch, Denos would taste adrenaline for the first time in 2298, a couple years after Harold had finished military school. 

Harold went undercover during this time, and joined the small but existing anti-Denos group in Trús Tower. Rising quickly because of his speaking skills and combat skills, Harold soon became the Leader of the Resistance. Denos and Thatch found themselves in a Catch-22. Neither could attack the other without being killed himself, yet either one would be assassinated if they ignored the other. It was Denos who decided to act first."
686299,1,2017-04-28,Amazon and Microsoft - How I studied,cscqsaver,ComputerScientists,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerScientists/comments/686299/amazon_and_microsoft_how_i_studied/,"Hi guys! I'm graduated in May, recently got a full-time offer from Amazon, and was a Microsoft intern last summer. Here's how I study for coding interviews:
EDIT: Here is a link to my CS review onenote as a PDF: EDIT EDIT (8/7/2016 new link) https://1drv.ms/b/s!Ah2zpQjCqYtpg7U04X730d3bbhDUCg
I. Technical knowledge
A. Data structures - know internal implementation, classes for your chosen language, advantages/disadvantages, and Big O complexity for common operations for each of the following:
-Hash tables
-Binary search trees
-Linked lists
-Arrays
-ArrayLists
-Tries
-Queues
-Stacks
-Heaps
B. Algorithms
-Big O
-Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort
-Tree/graph transversal
-Greedy algorithms
-Recursion
-Dynamic programming
-Divide and conquer
-String Builder class for your chosen language
-Proof by induction
-P vs. NP
C. Operating Systems
-Stack vs. heap
-Memory management (Garbage collector or manual malloc/free)
-Processes vs. threads
-Caching
-Call stack
-Kernel vs. user space
-Basics of internet stack
Data structures, algorithms, and operating systems were by far the most useful classes you took in school!
II. Coding practice
-You HAVE to code on a whiteboard! It is very different from coding in an IDE or even in Notepad. I spend a week and a half doing whiteboard coding questions out of ""Cracking the Coding Interview"". Don't just memorize the answers.
-Make a good faith effort to solve each problem as you practice. Also, think about the Big O complexity and where you can optimize.
-Finally, this is a great opportunities to memorize libraries/common data structure classes for your chosen language! You don't get documentation or Stack Overflow during your interview.
III. Behavioral
-Come up with responses to common behavioral questions in advance: i.e., ""What is your biggest weakness?"" or ""Tell me about a time you had a conflict on a team"" or ""What is the most difficult technical challenge you have faced?""
IV. Experience
-If you put a technology on your resume, you may be asked about it!
-Review all your previous projects/work experience, so you can quickly and knowledgeably answer any questions that may be asked.
-Don't talk negatively about your previous/current job unless specifically asked.
-Cast everything in a positive light. That project/job/coworker they just asked about might have sucked, but you look like an ass if you say that.
V. General tips
-You want to click with the interviewers. In the back of their minds, they're asking themselves ""Would I have a beer with this guy/girl?"" or something similar.
-Dress appropriately. I wore jeans and a button down for my last interview. It's not good to show up in a suit if the dress code is casual. Take a shower, comb your hair!
-Ask questions! This is a two way street, both for the company to see if you're a good fit, and if it's a good fit for you. Ask technical questions (what IDE/version control/languages/technologies does your team use?) and general company culture questions (what'd your favorite part of working here/how is the life/work balance?).
-Relax. The interviewers aren't out to get you, and you can't think straight if you're nervous.
-If you get rejected, don't give up! There will be another chance in the future.

686j84,2,2017-04-28,Life is what happens you're busy making plans,futballnguns,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/686j84/life_is_what_happens_youre_busy_making_plans/,"I'm freaking out. Lots of crying. All the sadness and anxiety things. 

I had everything figured out. I'm the only one on my lease and subleasing to my roommates for market value so I only pay 450 in rent - in Boston. Which is insane. I got accepted in to every grad school program I applied to and even received a scholarship to one. It all seemed like such an easy decision. Go to the school that gave me money and continue on with my amazing living arrangement that will allow me to survive in Boston.

However, my boyfriend asked me to move in with him, which was amazing and I was so excited to take that step. I told my landlord I wouldn't be renewing my lease and my so and I looked for housing. We found a place that was too good to be true, submitted applications and deposits, and the landlord kept me on the line for three weeks thinking I had the place. 

He just told me today that we didn't get the place, which wouldn't have been a big deal if my current landlord hadn't decided to sell the property because I was leaving. Come August 1, I will be homeless. Why not find another place to live? 75% of Boston leases start September 1st so most rentals aren't even applicable to me. In addition, I have a dog and a car - pet friendly places are hard to come by and places with some kind of parking arrangement are even harder. Then tack on my inability to pay average Boston rent (social work students don't get stipends and can't work that much because they're required to do 2-3 days/week of unpaid internship). Finding affordable housing for August that is dog friendly, and has parking (yes, even street parking is hard to come by here) is almost impossible at this point in time - people start aggressively searching for housing in February here. 

Then the real kicker - A few hours after being told I did not receive the apartment, my roommates (at hearing the landlord was evicting us) decided to find a place of their own and told me today that they are leaving on June 1st leaving me to cover the rent for the entire apartment by myself until August. 

Every calculation I ever made on how to afford living in Boston while not being able to work depended on me having a specific amount of money in my bank account before school started. As things stand now, my bank account will be almost be depleted before school starts.

So now instead of moving in with my boyfriend and starting a grad program with a generous scholarship at very prestigious institution, it is now more financially sound for me to move back home to Texas and move in with my parents while I attend an inferior program with no scholarship. My relationship with my partner will most likely end. His ex wife cheated on him while they were living long distance so I doubt he'd be willing to put himself in a similar scenario. 

He's out of town and terrible at communicating when he's on work trips so I probably won't talk to him about all this until Monday. I just feel so freaking alone and sad. But it just makes financial sense to move back home. 

I'm still searching for housing and I'm trying to find sub-letters for my roommates rooms so I'm not fronting the rent by myself but August 1 rentals are hard to come by and people who only want to rent a room for two months are also hard to come by. I'm just not optimistic that any of this will work out.

I have a wonderful support group of friends here and I can't bring myself to tell anyone I need to move back home so I'm starting here. Thanks for reading. "

I recently was hired for a position at the SSC. I had a few little questions I felt silly asking the recruiter about and was wondering if anyone here could answer. This is my first job after college so I'm pretty nervous, but want to do a good job! Any general information about the culture or expectations would be greatly appreciated.

Firstly, what's the dress code? Particularly for female employees. (Being my first job I'll probably have to go shopping for professional clothes and wanted to get an idea of what kind of things to get)

Secondly, I'll be working as a contractor and was wondering if they are generally treated as part of the team? I previously had an internship where contract workers were very separate and don't know if I should expect the same.  Also any info on how sick days/time off for contractors works would be awesome.

Thirdly, do people utilize the gym? 

Thank you in advance for putting a nervous new graduate more at ease. "
686qcj,19,2017-04-28,Another college MOH... [RANT],eirawyn,weddingplanning,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/686qcj/another_college_moh_rant/,"My old friend of 13 years is getting married this July and she chose me as the maid of honour. Leading up to the new year it slowly really dawned on me how naive I had truly been about the responsibilities and costs, this being my first wedding ever. I sat down with her and her fiancé and tried to withdraw back in January. She listened and then reassured me that the whole event was meant to be laid back and I actually wasn't doing that many traditional things (bachelorette party planning, helping the day of, and planning a few day of festivities). She convinced me that the role was manageable with my schoolwork and assured me that I didn't have to do even half the things a maid of honour would typically do. 

Now I find myself in a greater bind than before. I won a competition and the prize was a paid internship at a prestigious company in a city 6 hours away from our home city, as well as 7 hours away from the venue. I accepted the internship after the bachelorette had been planned, so as it stands I'm bussing in and back for the one day that is the bachelorette party, as well as coming in to town up to three days before the wedding for the rehearsal dinner and to provide support; days I'm losing income. 

So as soon as I knew, I contacted her to see if we could form a compromise. I suggested missing her bachelorette to save money (the suggestion of another bridesmaid) but she wasn't receptive to that idea. How about moving the bachelorette to the week of the wedding? Might be too busy for her. When I said then I'd have to bus in for both events, she asked me, ""Are you sure that won't cost too much?"" Agh! 

On the one hand, she's been quite accommodating thus far, since she bought all our bridesmaid dresses and is paying for transportation to and from the venue. But I've contributed too: I found her a photographer, designed her invitations for free, am altering all the bridal party's dresses, went to fittings and venue appointments with her, and am now helping her source last minute things like table centerpieces, shoes, and flowers. For her actual wedding, she is hoping for monetary contributions, which I'm sure I'm also on the hook for since I didn't pull through on sewing her bridesmaid dresses (that was supposed to be my gift, but my classes were too intense in the fall and I had to withdraw from it). I know it was my fault to get so involved and I really should have said no to being MOH when she first asked. Or stuck to my guns when I tried to withdraw. 

I have resigned myself to coming back to town separately for both the bachelorette and wedding. I realize now that a traditional wedding these days is not so easy for millennials. The vast majority of my friends, and myself, are saddled with student debt, high rent, can't buy homes, and struggle to find jobs. Weddings were much easier when one income could support a family of four. It's hard for me to be happy for her and genuinely supportive when she's marrying a fellow who has a ridiculous hourly consulting income, they've just bought a house downtown, she's finished paying all her student loans and teaches at one of the best universities in the country. She got really lucky.  My financial circumstances are not lost on her, but I feel like she's getting me to plod on as much as possible for her one day, which can and will hurt me financially (thankfully, not devastatingly so). A redditor posted recently about her sandwich wedding with food trucks, Spotify Playlist and marriage mid-reception, and my fiancé and I love the simplicity and elegance of the idea.  We won't be asking for gifts, we just want to see our loved ones. I can't blame my friend for having a traditional wedding. It was what we were all raised to expect in life, and she is entitled to celebrate this marriage in the way she wishes.

I'm writing to see if anyone has any anecdotes or supportive words about my own or similar situations. Help me to get through this without permanent resentment. At the very least, I really appreciate you reading my rant if you got this far, since this has been a hard pill to swallow. Thank you.

EDIT: She was super understanding!  Thank you everyone for giving me the courage to tell her I couldn't feasibly make her bachelorette. I'm making it up to her by taking her out for lunch or dinner either this week or after the wedding. I'm also coming into town 2 days before for the rehearsal just because the venue is fully booked the day before, and I'm okay with that. I'm really grateful to you all, thank you!"
686vy1,1,2017-04-28,Should I still try to see my LDR partner on my trip to Paris?,vismreal,relationships_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/686vy1/should_i_still_try_to_see_my_ldr_partner_on_my/,"I am a 22-year old female who just got ""dumped"" by LDR 22-year old male partner. While in Europe, I matched with someone on Tinder from Paris. We matched when I was back in the U.S so we didn't get a chance to meet in person. However, we talked from early/mid January until recently. We would message each other everyday and everything was great. Last month, we confessed our feelings for each other. We decided that meeting each other was the next step. I live in Chicago, so I bought a ticket to visit him in Paris in May. He then ""bought"" his ticket for Chicago in June. We were talking on the phone &amp; facetiming each other more than usual. I thought that this would continue until we finally met, but he stopped replying to me last week. He used the excuse of having finals + internships to worry about, but I am going through the same stress/anxiety. He finally asked to call me today to explain what was going on. In the call, he told him how everything was hectic in his life and even if we met, it wouldn't seem ""logical"" to commit to a long distance relationship. I really wanted to fight for what we had going on, but I chose to respect his decision and cut the call short. He offered to lend me his apartment while I stayed in Paris and he would just sleep at his friend's apartment, but I refused. So, my question to you all is: Should I still try to meet him? Should I keep any hopes at all? It seems to me that he is under a tremendous amount of stress, but I can't know for sure. I want to be with him regardless of the distance. I just don't know if there's something to fight for. Help!"

I hate it,mclaren_at_last,selfharm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/687lqx/i_couldnt_help_myself_and_now_i_feel_better_i/,"25 days ago I posted that I had relapsed after 6 months. Well tonight I did again. In 21 days I am leaving home for a 5 month internship on the other side of the country. This is the longest I will have spent away from all of my family. I'm not too broken up about not seeing my parents and whatnot, but my youngest sister and I are super close despite the 8.5 yr difference. She is going through puberty rn so she is getting ticked pretty easily atm. Tonight it kind of all hit me at once that I'm leaning her and I completely broke down. In her tween-hormonal angst she snapped at me to stop crying and pull myself together. I know she didn't mean it because not even 10 minutes later she was smuggled up against me and telling me that I'm going to be okay and we will talk every chance we get. However, it sent me into a full blown panic attack that only stopped when I went to the bathroom and made the first cut. Everything stopped. Immediately I felt better. Calmer. Clear headed. And while it stopped the attack in it's tracks, I can't help but beat myself up a little for giving in. Because I tried to tell myself I wasn't going to do it, I was going to put the knife down, take a Xanax, and go to bed. But I did anyway. And I knew the whole time I was saying I wasn't going to that I was lying to myself. Bleh. I think I am going to give my knife to a friend before I leave, that way I have one less blade to tempt me.

687m5b,4,2017-04-29,Advice needed on creating a proposal,ClintonsStickyCigar,SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/687m5b/advice_needed_on_creating_a_proposal/,"Hope this is a good spot to post this. 

First a bit of background: 2 years ago when I was a freshman in college I did an unpaid internship with a start-up doing some basic blogging, social media, and content creation. Since then I've really found I enjoy analytics and SEO and feel that I'm knowledgeable in both areas. I spent 8 months at a GA agency and got my GAIQ, and will be starting an internship at a SEO agency next week. 

My dilemma: The founder of previously mentioned start-up is now working for a different start-up and recently contacted me saying that they could use some marketing help. I went in and met with the team and laid out what steps they'd need to take, and convince them that, no digital marketing is not just a cash pit.

My plan was broken into 3 parts: 
Research: client avatar, competitive analysis, keyword research 
Backend: Getting GA set up, and making sure their site is SEO friendly (I've done this before on a wordpress site, but never squarespace) 
Content/Follow-Up: Help create content to rank for the keywords, and provide reports/insights in GA 

We are going to reconnect in a week (I'm currently in the process of moving to another state) and I'd like to give them a proposal of work, and ideally a pay rate. Am I even remotely on track here? Should I even be charging a rate? And if so, I wouldn't even know what to price myself at. 

Thanks in advance. I've learned a ton from lurking on this sub"
687u8d,0,2017-04-29,[M4A] - Captions,notarel,dirtyr4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtyr4r/comments/687u8d/m4a_captions/,"I'll send you a gif, you write a caption. Most of my gifs are of big-titted/big-assed pornstars like Amy Anderssen or Daphne Rosen or Olivia O'Lovely, or of the rougher variety.

Three choices:

1. I'll send gifs and provide scenarios so you can write captions about bullying, mocking or humiliating women, making fun of their implants/bimbo stuff, and nice girls/wives cheating on their boyfriends/husbands with guys who treat them like fuckmeat. Maybe a little cuck but I have limits on that.

2. I'll send you gifs and provide scenarios to write things about incest/ageplay (mother/son or stepmother/stepson, big sister/stepsister and little brother/stepbrother, aunt/nephew), teacher/student, interns at work or anything where older women are teasing, encouraging, seducing, corrupting or nurturing a younger, shy guy into having sex with her.

3. I'll just send you a gif without a kink and you write whatever you want for it, or you can ask to write a mini-story and I'll see if I can keep it going with the gifs I've got.

I'm Not into: Sissy/pretending the woman is a guy, tranny, puke (sloppy or drool-y blowjobs not included), male-on-male, animals, snuff, scat, threats of weapon use or illegal things.

Warning I do have some images of women getting pissed on, spit on, humiliated, giving guys rimjobs etc. If you choose 1 or 3, set your limits if you don't want to see that stuff. I don't want to be filling your inbox with things you want to see."

I just saw it tonight and was curious what he played that may have been replaced.

At my show, Jeffrey Cranor played a time traveling intern. Was he in the shows with Hal?

6887dd,4,2017-04-29,Depressive episode,girlski,BipolarReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/6887dd/depressive_episode/,"I've had the same best friends for 10 years, all through college and life after. They are the ones that encouraged me to seek help which eventually lead to my diagnosis. They have seen me through failed relationships, job changes, many many episodes, and other life issues and victories. Then one day they just weren't there anymore. I've called and texted and tried to make plans. No response except the Snapchats and Facebook posts about all the fun stuff they do with their other friends. This triggered a huge depressive episode for me.

Then I got an email from the school district I have been interning for letting me know that ""they can no longer accommodate me"" for my internship. No reason given. I have been substitute teaching from them in my off days and asked if they still wanted me subbing and I got no response. I'm in graduate school for teaching right now and have no idea how I'm going to complete my internship in a month for my course.

My depression worsened and I had several panic attacks today. My boyfriend was able to get me out of bed and onto the couch and fed but those were my biggest victories of the day. My suicidal thoughts are back for the first time in 2 years.

How do I get through this? I start therapy and have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Monday. I feel so helpless and empty."
6887t8,5,2017-04-29,A couple of questions from an incoming transfer student,kneelknee,UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/6887t8/a_couple_of_questions_from_an_incoming_transfer/,"Hi! As the title says, I'm an incoming student transferring from SoCal. I'm a little lost on some the the details of the process, and I don't know anyone currently at UCSC whom I could ask. I've tried to google the questions, but I can't seem to find clear and definite answers. So any help is greatly appreciated!

&amp;nbsp;

(1) I'm tentatively planning to apply for on-campus housing. However, I would like to bring my car with me so I'm not ""stranded"" up there. So how will parking work? It seems that I'm eligible to buy a parking permit, but only for one of the remote lots? Is this true? And will it be okay to leave my car there overnight/for weeks?  

&amp;nbsp;

(2) I'm also a little confused on how the meal plans work; the descriptions for the 7-day meal plan makes it sound like it's completely unlimited (eat as often as you want, however much you want). That seems a little too good to be true, and the site says something about checking your meal plan ""balance,"" which wouldn't make sense if it was completely unlimited.

&amp;nbsp;

I do plan on attending virtual tours/information seminars/orientation/etc, but if you guys have any advice or tips please let me know!

&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: I'm planning on majoring in Computer Science. Are there any CS clubs or extracurricular activities I should join? If anybody has any personal experience with the CS program and getting internships during school, that would be great to know!"

I swear to god. I've sent out 400 applications, gone on interviews, done stupid challenges, idiotic behavioral tests, I've pretended to be passionate about innane shit companies do, I've put in the legwork, I've done my time in college and outside of it, and you know what I get? 

Polite emails informing me I don't have enough experience. 

Because OF COURSE I DON'T. NO ONE WILL HIRE ME. 

Oh, I'm sorry, I put up with you rescheduling my phone interview three times, or making me code for ten hours, or answer questions about what I consider more important, learning a lot about a few things or a little about many, but you can't be bothered to even call me, no you're giving me the stock standard reply.  Oh, you went with other candidates, after I got to the final round and you mentioned there were like 7 openings for the job? DID YOU FUCKING REALLY? 

Like what's even the fucking point, if you don't already have experience or are best buds with the CEO I guess there's just no chance of this personal hell ever ending. 

Like GODDAMN IT. I'm willing to bust my balls, I'm willing to work fucking hard, but that's apparently not fucking enough. 

Also I swear to god if anyone else tells me ""it'll work out in time"" I'm going to go ballistic. You're right, clearly in another 400 applications it'll work out, cause its gone SWIMMINGLY so far. 

No, I don't want your stupid internship instead of a job, no I'm not willing to work free for experience, I have bills to pay, and other shit, and I'm *qualified*, I can FUCKING DO THE JOB. "

688ogr,0,2017-04-29,Is all the extra work worth it ?,IrishReilly,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/688ogr/is_all_the_extra_work_worth_it/,"Hi, (hopefully right sub)

I have been working for a large company for the past three years. I started out as a intern at nineteen. I have since been taken on fulltime and have just hit my one year mark. Three years if you include internship. I was wondering if any of you have any advice about unpaid overtime / extra work. 

I have been asked to help out in a project that's quite large that I dont believe in. I feel it will fail. Its has been handed to me and another employee. We are both low level and earn minimum wage. However this project will force us to work late 9-8 and weekends for the next few months.
I have volunteered for projects in the past but I am finding out now that when I say no, I am hit with quite a lot of resistance. Which is making me worried about my career here in the future. However others on the team are fine as they say no to extra work, so they are not been asked to help here. I feel like the higher ups dont care about how I feel and just want a yes person. 

Have any of you had any experience with this. Is it worth working unpaid overtime. I dont believe they will give me a promotion or a pay increase. But maybe I am not seeing the bigger picture. I just dont want to be the guy who lives to work rather than works to live. But maybe I am being an idiot, any advice thoughts. Is it worth it ?



Also just a side note, I usually would always say yes to things like this, but I bumped into a lecture there last week. She told me to be carful as managers will try to get new low level employees to work overtime while promising promotions or pay increase. How do I figure out if this is the case, all my manager has told me is that I will look good if the project goes well, but it must not fail or else I ll be held responsible.

sorry if this is not the right sub, its kinda a mix of a question, is a possible promotion worth the money, and do you guys think working unpaid overtime is worth it in the end ?"

Posting here in response to a few requests for an AMA resulting from my comments [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/686xgy/whats_the_smallest_decision_you_made_that_had_the/dgwfod1/)

I'm not sure how I can prove my story, but I'm open to suggestions. 

---

One of the greatest strengths of the tech industry is that, in many ways, its greatest success stories have humble beginnings.  It's created a truly open economy, where the education you received matters less than the skills you have.  If you've proven that you can do the work, you can get the job.

The world of professional UX Engineering is a particularly good example of this.  As an emerging aspect of the tech world, it's still a relatively new discipline.  What's more, the skills required to be a good UX'er -- the drive to solve problems, the ability to clearly envision flows and processes, interpersonal communications, and a love for both science and art -- are embodied in many other professions.

I've met architects, nurses, cell phone repair techs, CS grads and many, many more now chasing their dream.  The forums over at UXMastery.com (my favorite hangout to talk shop) are full of people of all ages and disciplines getting into the UX world.

My own path into the world of User Experience is about as long and meandering as they come, and a perfect example of how life experiences are more important in making a great UX professional than formal education.

In college, I studied editorial journalism, which had a layout and design component.  Although I found those aspects entertaining, my true love was sports journalism. I ended up with a prestigious internship with an NFL club that required me to not only write for the team but also shoot and edit video, maintain and update the website, and setup live video feeds for the NFL network.

With such good experience, I thought post-internship employment in the sports journalism world was a given.

So I applied and I waited. And waited. And waited. The call to the big leagues, so to speak, never came.

When the recession hit in '08, I was working for a not-to-be-named, now-defunct retail technology company as an operations manager. I learned a lot about managing and hiring the right people in that role, but the company was going downhill fast.  Soon enough, they were out of business.

At the time, this seemed to be a low point for me in my career.  Not only was I not employed in the journalism world, I wasn't employed at all. Like so many at that time, I took whatever job I could to make ends meet, latching on with a credit card call center.  I dug into my new work and put my interpersonal communication skills to work, honing them caller-by-caller.  I wasn't on the road to where I wanted to be, but I was at least on some road, which was better than nothing at all.

Then, as it often does, love struck when I least expected it.  I met a beautiful young woman with short blonde hair, baby blue eyes, an easy smile that lit up a room like the lights on a Griswold Christmas tree, and a heart beautiful beyond compare.  From our first date, I was absolutely spell bound.

The girl, however, was not happy where we were.  Having gotten herself into a graduate program she regretted, she now pined for a home state halfway across the country.  Within six months of meeting her, she was already moving thousands of miles away, but gave me the choice to come with her.

My heard wasn't as kind.  It didn't give me a choice.  Wherever she went, I was bound to follow.

Fortunately, I was able to switch to another call center with the same company and keep my job.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make a suitable deposit on even the worst apartment in the stabbiest part of town.

I quickly found myself in a really weird class-- the working homeless. I lived out of my car, showered at the gym, worked 60 hour weeks, and had a girlfriend and coworkers that knew nothing of how bad my situation was.  I spent most nights reclined in the driver's seat of my 2002 Ford Escort at a rest stop along the interstate, earplugs in place and a t-shirt over my head to block out the light from the streetlamps.

I didn't have a drug or alcohol problem.  I very rarely had anything at all to drink, and I have never done any drugs.  Like so many others in the country at that time, I simply wasn't working in a job that paid a living wage.  It doesn't help that being homeless is way more expensive than it seems, but that's another post for another time.

Try as I might, I could never save up enough for a deposit and first month's rent for even a bad apartment.  I was at a loss at how to get out of my situation.

When my dad passed in the midst of all of this, it was the catalyst I needed to begin to move forward again.  My dad had worked for almost 20 years for the same company as I did.  He was a great man, and I saw so much of him in me.  We both had dreams and hopes.  He was never was able to recognize his own because of what he did for a living.  Never had it been more clear to me that I would either need to take decisive action to change my situation or face a life too much like his.

Since I was in my teens, I had an interest in web design and development, but it was always little more than a passing hobby. Sometimes I'd take one-off builds for friends or family to get a website up and running, but to say that I dabbled would have been an overstatement.

At my job in the call center, though, I recognized an opportunity.

The biggest problem facing all of our reps is that it was so damn difficult to find the right information. In such a compliance-heavy world as credit and banking, having access to the right regulatory information and process compliance workflows was key. We had an internal communications website that was built with Microsoft FrontPage back in 2004. As new information came in, the website had been cobbled together in a mishmash of incomprehensible, buried spiderweb of links. Even the pieces that we used most often were impossibly buried to find.

Armed with nothing more than Notepad, Internet Explorer, an inquiring mind, and the time between calls, I started to build a tool to make finding and utilizing the information that dwelled in the depths of the existing website. I showed it to managers who universally loved it, but never enough to rock the boat. Over the course of a couple of years, I was promoted out of the call center into a corporate training position, and then into corporate communications, where I was now in charge of adding onto and maintaining our existing website. The entire time I kept tinkering with my project, studying everything from PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, and, most importantly, UI/UX principles and techniques.

Once again, I brought out my old project as the starting point for a major overhaul of our internal website. I eventually pitched the idea to my company's C-Level management, who all universally loved it. I was promoted into a management training program and charged with getting my new design up-and-running. While in the program, I was offered a position as a software engineer within the company, and I jumped it. This would be my break, my chance to finally earn a true middle-class income and have some upward mobility.

Sadly, things didn't work out in this position. While my company was eager to have me in the position to continue to work on my project, my manager would have none of it. I was put in charge of maintaining servers and back end processes surrounding submitting credit data to our banking partners, an interesting choice as I had no experience in infrastructure or the languages required to be truly successful. I was still able to work on my pet project, but it was made clear to me that it was a sideshow compared to my ""real"" work.

Once again, however, I found myself looking for problems without a solution and working independently to pitch a fix. One of the biggest issues we were facing was a lack of business intelligence when it came to what our representatives were actually talking about with customers who called in. Our VRU (the automated system that routes customers to representatives) was able to capture some information, but nobody had any idea if it was accurate.

In order to solve the problem, I built a PHP and MySQL based site that allowed our reps to quickly record the purpose of each call they received, something which required a lot of UI and UX work to ensure that the system was both intuitive, easy, and quick. We ended up capturing about 400,000 lines worth of data very quickly, which gave us an excellent dataset for analysis.

About this same time, the first version of our new site, based on my design, was finally released.

Between the easier-to-find information, a few other small tools I had built to increase efficiency, and more efficient call handling due to analysis on the business intelligence project I helmed, my company was able to shave around 30 seconds off of each call. In the call center industry, such a leap is unheard of. If you find a way to save 4 seconds off each call, it's a huge win. It's hard to put a number on how much money this saved us, but our best estimates were somewhere between $1 million and $7 million within the first year alone, with compounding returns over the coming years.

At the time, I was being paid less than half of the salary of the average software engineer. When I asked for a raise, the answer was a very firm ""it's not in the budget."" I knew it was time to go.

And so I jumped ship, finding work very quickly as permanent contractor to a company that made interactive digital signage. If you've ever stayed at a hotel and used a touchscreen sign to find a restaurant nearby, or gotten directions to a conference from a touchscreen, or looked at an airport monitor to find your flight gate, chances are you've used one of their products. I was immediately put in charge of the design (both UI and UX) of these signs for major corporations, as well as training our partners on how to use our proprietary software. Huge hotel chains, international humanitarian organizations, hospitals, universities, sports teams, airports, ski resorts. You name it, and I probably developed a sign for it.

A couple of years passed. I was promoted to a team lead and senior sign developer. My job also changed from pure design and development to traveling the country and running workshop for these large corporations. In the span of 3-5 days, we'd design a sign, develop it, and implement it on their systems, all the while training them how to use the software along the way.

While I absolutely loved what I was doing, I couldn't continue doing it for very long. I had a team I was supposedly managing that I really didn't know, family that missed me, and a peer group I never saw. I'd be home long enough on the weekends to kiss my wife, do my laundry, re-pack, and leave again. 2 years in, despite my increased responsibilities and capabilities, I never had a raise. I gave my notice, and once again began looking for a new gig.

My first idea was to look for work as a web developer. With a skill set that included, at this point, Agile methodologies, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, jQuery, XML, backend systems and support, and a host of other useful software programs, I didn't think it'd be difficult. I put my resume out on job sites, and the calls came in from recruiters.

To my surprise, I was most often contacted about UI/UX jobs. At first I wrote off the idea. In my mind, I was a developer. My code solved problems, dang it. I wasn't going to give that up.

The more calls that came in for UI/UX jobs, however, the more I began to look into it as a career choice. I was shocked to find out that average salary for a UX Engineer was actually better than it was for a software engineer. As I read more about how companies were leveraging UX to make the web a better place, the more in love with the concept I became.

I also quickly realized that my life had set me up well to be a pretty dang solid UX engineer. My writing career gave me imagination and empathy. My call center career gave me interpersonal skills beyond compare as well as the ability to spot issues and find UX-centric solutions. My digital signage career gave me an amazing amount of UX practice on hundreds of projects with world-class companies.

I tinkered with my resume a bit, and put out a UX-based version. In a matter of days, I had interviews with multiple companies. Within a couple of weeks, I was hired on with a company that provides services to investment advisors.

I've been working here for only a few months, but I couldn't imagine a better job. I love what I do every day, my coworkers are amazing, talented people, my company treats its employees amazingly well, and I'm in charge of the UX for the organization's main product.

What do I love about the job? Every day brings something new. I'm facing problems that I never knew existed. I'm learning a lot about presenting tabular data in an easily consumable format. I get to do a lot of fun UX stuff like heat mapping, scripted UX testing, user research, whiteboarding, sketching, and researching web design trends.

In some ways, I'm still very new to the world of UX. In others, I've been at it for years. I'm tremendously excited to to learn more for myself and to help others along the way. I pride myself on being a great teacher and patient mentor whenever possible.  My past experiences with terrible management have taught me what not to do, and I've promised myself to pass down my knowledge to anyone who asks for it. By no means do I know everything (not even close), but I love to share my expertise when I can.

At the same time, I still have a lot of questions of my own.

For now, my goal is to get as much ""education"" in the world as I can.  I'm blessed to work for a great, patient, and empowering employer who's learning as much about UX as I am right now.  Each day I try to learn something new I can implement in my team.

One more thing...

I think it's worth noting that while moving out of state to chase a girl I knew for only a handful of months was the best terrible mistake I've ever made. We've been married almost two years now, bought our first house at the end of last year, and plan on starting a family soon.

Sometimes stories have a happy ending. While my story is nowhere near it's conclusion, it's nice to know that in the middle of the book our protagonist is doing quite nicely, and has learned never take his blessings for granted.

***TL;DR: Started career as a journalist, failed, became a full-time employed homeless person, worked my way up to software engineer, digital signage developer, team lead, and eventually UX Engineer. I love what I do, and I'm excited to help others and learn more myself.***"

**My Analysis**

[This was probably one of the best BOTB simulations I've seen in a long time. I think this cast had the smartest players since the comp threats (Paige, Enid, Caleb,etc.) were immediately targeted. Jesse and Tiana were immediately big targets but Jesse's skill in comps kept the pair alive and they sent home Melanie, Paige, and Francine (all of whom wanted the duo gone). Jesse flipping the house against Caleb in a 5-4 vote was amazing. The Wan family is truly spectacular. Evan was a fighter, I don't think I've seen a player yet with that much determination. Carrie and Camille were a good pair, they seemed tight. Camille had to carry on without her sister and she won! I do think she was a bit of a floater, but maybe she had an excellent social game. Hoon was a great player too. Also, ugh! Tiana was SO close! I was really rooting for her in the end. Standout newbies for me were Bianca, Hoon, Francine, Hugo (poor guy, lol) and Enid.](/spoiler)

My favorites this time were Hoon, Jesse, Bianca, Tiana, Enid, Evan, Francine, and Hugo!

I've known a girl for a year now through a college club. It's been a few months since I developed feelings for her, though as the I've never dated anyone before and I'm quite introverted, there obviously there hasn't been much progress. 

We are both executives (different roles though) in this club. The only time I get to see her is at regular club meetings. I get to travel home (using public transport) with her (we live in the same area) after these meetings, giving us around 30 minutes to chat - usually it’s just about how we’re going at college, if there’s any progress with internships we’ve applied for, what we’re up to when we’re home. And yes, this is where it’s just the both of us together.

I never talked to girls back in school, so she's *one* of the first girls that I've actually been able to have small talks with on a regular basis.

She actually has the most important role in the club and her duties are to do with communicating with external stakeholders and making sure everyone else (including myself) is doing their job for the club. 

Messaging wise: Lots of smileys when she needs me to do something for the club, and grins/exclamations when she is impressed with what I’ve done (which is always). I’m going to interpret that as just being friendly and encouraging, rather than because she’s interested but it could go either way... 

---

&gt; **My goals**

&gt; * To somewhat figure if she likes me or if she is seeing someone else :(
* Assuming she is single, hint my interest to her?
* Of course, end result is to date her.

I believe if we know that we like each other, it’ll be easy for me to proceed from there (eg. taking her out to lunch when we're both on campus during our common break hours).


&gt; **My questions**

&gt; * How can I start off with figuring her relationship status? Not comfortable being upfront and asking “hey are you single?” as I’d be implying that I like her.. or should I do something else?
* I’ve never had a relationship/dated/asked a girl out in my life, and assuming she’s single, how would I *hint* my interest to her?
* Ideas on things to chat about? I’m not necessarily a very talkative person and there are often quite a bit of pauses during our conversations. 

---

If she isn’t interested, or she then reveals she’s already seeing someone else, then of course things are going to be awkward for our future encounters, and I don’t want that to negatively impact on the club - let’s just say that my role for the club does involve brand/reputation management… 

I think she is single, but I could be wrong (I am making an assumption based on my knowledge of her schedule, plus photos of her on Facebook - she is tagged in very few photos and these photos were all from her friend’s birthday parties - the friends are all girls too). As she’s doing very well academically I could take a safe guess a lot of her spare time is occupied with studying - at other times, she actually tutors for a couple of hours at college, has weekly sport commitments (don’t forget college classes and running the club too).

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: After becoming an executive member of a college club, **I've developed a crush on a girl** who's also an executive member for the club. **I'm shy and never dated anyone before.** I think she's single, but of course I'm concerned that she might not like me/she's actually not single. **Where do I start?** Also what are some recommendations on things to talk about with her (considering I'm not very talkative/not good at keeping conversations)?

Thanks in advance"

I was recently accepted into SFU as a transfer international student for Film. I had a few questions though I wanted to make to SFU students/graduates:

1) How hard is it to later change majors? For reference, I plan on changing mine to computing science.

2) How hard is it to get internships?

3) Is it feasible to live on campus or near the campus without a car (aka relying on public transportation)?

4) How hard is it to find jobs post graduation?

5) Now one for the international students: how hard is it to find a job while on a student visa and how hard is it to get one (that will give you documents so you can live there) after graduating?

I apologize for the amount of questions - I got accepted into another university and am currently trying to make up my mind. Thank you in advance!"

(21-24) I have studied as an Audio Engineer and double majored in Audio production and broadcasting to receive my Diploma in Audio Technology. Once I completed my Diploma the College I was working at asked me to join their internship program, It happened to be paid, the pay was good. This internship lead to a permanent job in the long run seeing as I stood head and shoulders over my peers. I was passionate and wanted to do my best, I succeed to complete my 10 year plan I made in High School in 7 years and was on track. I knew I wanted to go into business for myself next, this was always just a stepping stepping stone to greater things. I enjoyed it but there was something missing. I tried taking up a guitar course part t-time, I always loved music and have had a guitar for long enough to play a few chords and scales, I ended up pay for a full-time course I couldn't go to because I was lied to basically, I lost about the equivalent of $2200 on that, still in a 4 year long battle over it. Tried to study CCNA on my weekeends. The school was horrible and class of 7 was unenthusiastic except for me, so I became ""that guy"" in class, and later only to find the Lecturer had cheated on his final exam some how and that was the final straw for me... I couldn't have that on my conscience

(24-27) I have since worked as a mentor, lecturer, IT and tech support, assistant to two department heads, freelance audio engineer (recording, mixing, mastering) and have learned more skills than what I know what to do with. This was all great but life started to close in on me when I started working longer and longer hours and spending less time at home (80+/- hours a week), I spent less time with my family, that was my main driving force for all my hard work, my mom fell ill and was in and out of hospital, I started feeling my friends and I were not on the same page so distanced myself from most them as I was starting to pick up bad habits I didn't like. I was determined to branch off and do my own thing my any means. I started taking business seminars, going to meet ups and generally working on my marketing and sales skills as a I went along, this wasn't intentionally, it just happened. Eventually, a close friend of mine had joined and MLM and asked me to join. I did. I know your probably thing pyramid scheme all the way at this point but that was the happiest and most motivated I had been for a long time and the sales skilled I gained were invaluable, the books I read were powerful, the seminars I went to helped me look at myself differently. Around this time I gave myself a one year dead line make things happen, and things happened.

A year later I eventually quit the MLM and quit my job. I was not progressing in either as I hoped, the pressures of work had increased to an unhealthy point, working 12hr days almost daily, it got to me. It got so bad that in the 4/5 hours I had to sleep before getting up to do it all over again, I would fall in to sleep and while my body was resting my mind would wake up and plan and schedule the next day and think of solutions to weeks worth of problems. My mind was always in hyperdrive. Needless to say a few months of this and I was rekt. I felt like I lost myself and was going through a ""quarter life crisis"" - I HATED this phrase until it was the only thing that could explain what I was going through, what else do you call a 20-something sprouting grey hairs because of stress at the peak of his health? - I had to make serious changes. So, I quit, cashed out my 43 leave days, I hadn't used in over 5 years (worth about $1270) and said my farewells. Management were shocked I as leaving they wondered, why? They were clueless to our working conditions no matter how may times we said it, letters we wrote,etc... That didn't matter anymore I was about to take my freedom back.

(27-29) I decided I needed to take sometime of my recent failures and compose myself, It as August when I quit my job so lets just ride out the year and figure it out as we go, I figure it out by January.
I slept for most of those months, I need it. When I was awake I was panicked about what I would do next. I was broken. I realized I really didn't know what I wanted to do. My family were counting on me to get it together they had faith I would.
I was always so driven to move to the next thing, make myself more valuable and work hard, because all my life I was told that hard work pays off and, I believed it. It nearly killed me, I couldn't reconcile my belief with my experience.

I lost touch with everything I believed in and worse yet nothing felt the same. I feel like I am a completely different person, nothing is as I remember it and the things I used to enjoy seem so bland. I just want to sit in my car and drive in any direction until something happens, but I always find myself back home with my, mom and brother, who love very much but will never understand this space I am in. My brother went through something similar not to long ago but I still can't explain to him what I have gone through internally.

So it is two years later, and I have gone through so many phases of figuring out what I should pursue as my next venture, I'm still lost. Aviation was prominent for a long time but that is way out of my reach and there are no bursaries in the field that except people my age, same with the police, military, etc...I should have just become a doctor I don't see myself going back to my old job either, even though they recently contacted me and wanted me to come back, in a different position, I wouldn't work in any department except my old one anyway if I went back. I looked into some many things and most of the costs to get started are outside my finances, I'm tapped out and live at home with my family.

I recently applied for a job that requires no experience in the field of ecommerce and I feel like I would be a good match for the company and it to me. Still waiting on a response, It's been over a week now.

...And people ask me why I don't talk about myself much. My life is a sob story and nobody likes those, no matter how polite they are. 'I'd gladly listen to yours and help were I can, but don't ask me about mine' is how I feel about it.

Why is it so difficult to find something that you love and just do it? I'm good at and like many things but none will wake me up excited.
Where did I go wrong? How am I going to get out of this rut? When do I get to catch a break?

I'm an undergrad CS Jr. who will have Sr. standing after my summer courses. I transferred here from OCC last Fall, and I haven't had any internships or relevant work experience. I know it's too late to get one for this summer, so how do you guys suggest I spend the summer to maximize my internship prospects next Fall and Spring? (Github, topcoder, competitions, school-based activities (research), personal projects, etc. I'm aware of these things, but I don't even know where or how to start... )

Some background: 3.8 GPA. I've taken CS100, CS113, CS 114, CS252, and will be taking CS280 and CS634(Data Mining) over the summer. Even though I grasped the theory behind everything those classes taught, I don't feel comfortable with applying it...

P.S. I'm doing an MS in CS after the BS, so I still have '17-'18, summer '18, and '18-'19 to get professional experience. I want to do Machine Learning/ Pattern Recognition stuff when I graduate. "
68b0f6,1,2017-04-29,17 Funniest Moments Marvel Films (PART II),NightHowler253,AvengersInitiative,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvengersInitiative/comments/68b0f6/17_funniest_moments_marvel_films_part_ii/,"#12. THOR: THE DARK WORLD – DARCY STILL DOESN’T GET IT

#### If we’d made the first Thor movie, we probably would have eliminated the role of Darcy (Kat Dennings) and given all of her lines to Jane (Natalie Portman). Also, we would have cast Dennings instead of Portman because she was way more fun. But we have yet to make any Thor films (outside of our garages), so we just have to settle for the comic relief being way more interesting to watch than the female lead/love interest. And at least we have that much going for us.

####The Dark World gives Jane a little more to work with, but we still prefer Darcy because she still has all of the best jokes. And our favorite is the most simple. At one point during the climactic — and endlessly confusing — final battle between Thor and the evil Dark Elf, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the thunder god and his hammer, Mjölnir, get separated because of all the flying around between the Nine Realms and stuff. It’s a head scratcher, for sure. But Thor’s hammer will always come when it’s summoned, even if it takes a while. So we get a bunch of shots of Mjölnir flying around, trying to get back home, while Thor and Malekith punch each other in the face and say overly dramatic things about the Nine Realms or whatever.

####Meanwhile, Jane and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) are running around with their “make things go somewhere else” device that they never properly explained, and suddenly find themselves reunited with Darcy and her intern, Ian. They do that thing where everyone says each other’s names in surprise, and then Mjölnir flies by with uncanny comic timing.

####“Mew-mew!” Darcy yells.

####It’s a callback to the first movie, in which she has no idea how to pronounce the hammer’s name, and we were glad to see the joke return.

####Never change, Darcy.

#11. CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR – EVEN SUPERHEROES NEED A PEP TALK

####We didn’t want to leave Scott Lang out of this list, especially since he and Spider-Man are about the only funny characters in Civil War. It’s not really the movie’s fault; all of the principles have serious issues of revenge, loyalty, accountability, and fighting their former friends for maximum drama. During the huge airport showdown between Teams Iron Man and Captain America, Rogers calls for a distraction so that he and Bucky (Sebastian Stan) can make their escape and beat up more important people.

####“I got something kinda big,” he says, “but I can’t hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell, and if I tear myself in half, don’t come back for me.”

####He’s referring to his Giant-Man suit upgrade that lets him grow to ridiculous size, but his intro isn’t the part that gets us. That comes when he’s actually getting ready to use the maneuver and has to psych himself up.

####“I’m the boss,” he mutters to himself. “I’m the boss, I’m the boss!”

####It’s easy to lose track of the idea that some superheroes are just regular people with amazing abilities, and this is especially true in the middle of a rumble that includes two guys in high-tech armor, a brainwashed assassin with a metal arm, a kid with spider powers, and an android who draws his power from a rock in his forehead that is the super-condensed form of a singularity that existed before the universe began.

####Ant-Man’s call for confidence isn’t just funny — it’s also one of the most grounded, human moments in any MCU movie, and his post-transformation joy-filled giggle was echoed by every fan boy in the theater.

#10. IRON MAN 3 – WE’VE ALL HAD COWORKERS LIKE THAT

####We’ve already mentioned Iron Man 3 and how Marvel/Disney didn’t want Tony Stark to drink too much because kids might see it. But what remained was still decent, thanks to the considerable dialogue skills of co-writers Black and Pearce. The script is clever without being too quippy, and it contains some genuine surprises.

####Most of these moments come from Tony Stark’s less-than-heartwarming relationship with a boy he meets (Ty Simpkins from Insidious), but our favorite comes near the end when Iron Man escapes his captivity in a stronghold of terrorist group The Ten Rings. A thrilling action sequence follows, during which Stark takes out his guards and their reinforcements using a combination of guns and the glove and boot of his costume, which show up well before the rest of it does.

####With everyone else dispatched, Tony turns his gun on the single remaining thug, who immediately puts his hands up.

####“Honestly, I hate working here,” he says. “They are so weird.”

####And he gets to live because humor and self-awareness are important and must be preserved.

#9. THOR – SUMMONING AN EPIC MOUNT

####Thor’s MCU debut features Shakespearean drama, cosmic adventure, and all of the off-kilter camera angles anyone can stand. But it also contains an amusing fish-out-of-water story as the former God of Thunder deals with the loss of his powers and banishment to Earth.

####It takes a bit of adjustment, especially when he realizes that his new, mortal form has to eat regularly and stuff. But it isn’t all biological surprises; he also has to deal with some cultural differences like the impoliteness of smashing one’s glass after finishing a drink. You just aren’t supposed to do that, you guys. Thursday’s namesake also runs into some confusion when it comes time to obtain transportation. Being unworthy of Mew-mew, he can’t fly anymore, so he needs something to bear him. Obviously, his first choice is a horse, but the only place he can find with any animals is a shop called Pet Palace.

####“I need a horse!” he bellows upon entering, because Thor has not learned humility yet.

####“We don’t have horses,” the poor clerk replies, “just dogs, and cats, and birds.”

####“Then give me one of those large enough to ride,” Thor says with zero irony.

####We aren’t sure which image is funnier: Thor galloping down the street astride a huge puppy with just the softest of paws or the Asgardian taking to the air on a gigantic parakeet. Either way, the viewers win.


#8. CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER – OH NO, SHE DIDN’T

####We like Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow the most in Captain America movies. We think it’s because she’s free to just be awesome and play off of Steve Rogers’ clean-cut, Boy Scout demeanor without the possibility of romantic entanglement making things feel all weird and forced. You know, like that time she had a weird, forced romantic entanglement with Bruce Banner in Age of Ultron. Also, she body-shames an infant at the end, and that’s just bizarre.

####Agent Romanoff’s great in The Winter Soldier, however, as she and Cap work together to uncover and take down HYDRA, the evil organization that has quietly — and almost completely — taken over S.H.I.E.L.D. after decades of infiltration and subversion. And it’s not just the partnership aspect that we enjoy; the banter is also very real. It starts with her first line, when she drives up to meet Rogers and his new buddy Sam Wilson after they’ve finished a painfully unmatched morning run.

####“Hey, fellas,” she says. “Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I’m here to pick up a fossil.”

####We love Cap Widow so much that we were divided on whether to use Ant-Man’s line from Civil War or her response to Falcon asking her if anyone’s told her she’s paranoid (“Not to my face. Why, did you hear something?”), but we’ll just throw that in as an honorable mention here and ask Marvel if they could possibly find a way to get her and Darcy to meet in Infinity War.

#7. IRON MAN – LET’S BE HONEST HERE

####The first entry in the MCU was a revelation for a couple reasons. First, because it was better than most people expected, and second, because we never expected mainstream audiences to care that much about Iron Man.

####This was thanks to great casting in Robert Downey, Jr. and some crisp, Howard Hawks-style banter that’s smart without feeling forced. And the interaction between Stark and his long-suffering assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is the best of this. Our favorite expression of this relationship comes immediately after Stark’s first mission as Iron Man, when he has a little trouble with his suit-removing robots. While Tony struggles in the grip of his mechanical dressers, Pepper walks in behind him. She struggles to understand what her boss is up to until both he and the metal arms realize she’s there, and they all freeze comically.

####“Let’s face it,” Stark says, “this is not the worst thing you’ve caught me doing.”

####We aren’t sure what he could be referring to, but we hope it didn’t also involve the robots.

68be06,1,2017-04-29,Help choosing university,R0O7,ImmigrationCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmigrationCanada/comments/68be06/help_choosing_university/,"[Cross-posted to /r/canada]


I hope it's okay to post this here! I have been accepted to a few universities in Canada (Simon Fraser, York, and Concordia) and wanted some input/help to choose which one to attend. 
For reference, I'm a Brazilian citizen finishing my Associate in Art's in the United States. Therefore, I will be a transfer international student in Canada. I am fluent in Portuguese and English, but not in French - though if I end up in Concordia I do plan on taking French classes. In Concordia I was accepted into Psychology, whereas in both York and Vancouver I was accepted into Film. Regardless, I plan on changing my major later on to computer science, or double major later on. 
Now onto the questions! All of the questions apply to all the universities, obviously. If anyone can compare them I would be forever grateful, but if you can only speak about one in particular that's already plenty helpful! 

1) How hard is it to later change majors?

2) How hard is it to get internships? Are any of those better for getting internship compared to the others?

3) Is it feasible to live on campus or near the campus without a car (aka relying on public transportation)? On that same vein, how good is the public transportation? I don't mean as in ""oh the seats are comfortable"", but as in how fast you can get to places/how often the public transportation (bus, metro, etc) passes. 

4) How hard is it to find jobs post graduation? Particularly, how hard is it to find one that will give an international student the documents necessary to remain in Canada?

5) How reputable/respectable are those universities? As in, are any of them seen as ""better"" than the others?

6) In regards to rent: is it feasible to get a studio for at most $900CAD/month? I don't mind if it's not in downtown, as long as I can commute to downtown in at most an hour or so. 

7) Is it feasible to be a full time student while working part-time? 

Thank you so much in advance! If you don't know how to answer any of these, or just feel free to give some tips/information regarding something else feel free to do so! I want to make an informative decision that I won't regret later on, so every input counts!"
68bnxc,8,2017-04-29,I [18F] feel torn and stuck; parents mean well but are ridiculously isolating and have caused so many lost opportunities.,asschoe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/68bnxc/i_18f_feel_torn_and_stuck_parents_mean_well_but/,"Been lurking for awhile, but I've finally worked up the courage to post something 

Back story: I've lived basically my entire life in the most sheltered and bubbled city there is. I was born here but both my parents immigrated when they were in their early teens and met through mutual friends. I'm on an only child, and my mom loves to talk about how carefully she planned for me and how late she had me because they wanted me to have a perfect upbringing, etc. 

My dad, I guess, like in Asian household tropes, thought physical discipline was necessary to kind of keep everyone in line. My mother and I were at the receiving end of that often when I was younger, but it's not really a problem right now. Freedom was always a big problem for them; I was and are still not allowed to go anywhere overnight unless I am with them, and they've stopped me from joining important ""extracurriculars"" (including academic related ones) many times which lead to me basically being locked at home (friends have semi-jokingly called my house a prison), and negatively impacted my future (prevented me from attending a four year college).

This behavior has made many of my social relationships suffer, and I feel that if I hadn't been much more curious about what was around me, I would have been dangerous unadjusted for adult life.  As it is, I managed, through a lot of fighting, to be able to pick up a job and an internship while preparing to transfer out of the cc I'm in right now. However, whenever I bring up that kind of talk or moving out, they threaten me with financial security, and they are very very reluctant in allowing me to set up even the most basic of things, like a checking account, or even car insurance, and they get completely furious when I try to pay for things myself. 

I feel so hopeless and lost because on one hand I want to just distance myself from them and I am confident I can figure things out myself, but on the other hand, I still love and care for them, and I am also afraid for my mom to have to deal with my father's worsening temper alone. 

If you made it this far thanks for reading through, and I'll appreciate any advice. This has been on my mind for awhile and it's really negatively impacting my relationship with my close friends and bf (who they don't know about ofc), and I can feel my mental health deteriorating with this. I just feel really fucking lonely and torn. 

TL;DR: Suffocating parents are affecting my relationships, mental health, and future. "

Couple weeks ago my Razer Blade fans just stopped working randomly.  They so not begin to spin faster when playing games or demanding tasks.

I thought this was initially just a driver issue or something.  I don't have a lot stored on my computer, so I did a factory reset just in case.  I re-downloaded Overwatch, started it up, the fans worked regularly with games for about 10 minutes until they just started spinning at the speed my fans usually spin at idle.

Anyone know how to fix issues like this?  Kinda sucks that can't play games on my gaming machine and I leave for California on an internship that will require my laptop every day.  I also go to school so I just can't part with my laptop so I'd rather figure out how to fix this myself.

We both like each other, we get along very well, but I have a slight predicament:

I've made the move and kissed her, and we have kissed a few times since then--however I haven't actually asked her to be my girlfriend yet. This isn't a question as to whether the kiss was enough for us to be established as bf and gf-- I want to officially ask her no matter what opinions you guys have about that. 

The reason I'm hesitating is because we are both taking finals right now at our college (our college is hard as fuck to do well in). I really like her and it's starting to get slightly confusing as to where we are at. 

We both obviously like each other and want to see each other when we can, but finals are making that difficult and because we always need to study, it makes it very rare for us to have time alone to actually get even closer to each other and thus closer to a real relationship. 

The other annoying part to all of this is that she will not be at our college for the summer and will be back at herhome for an internship (her home is a couple hundred miles from our college), which kind of sucks, but I'm determined to make those 3 months work out because I really like her and I believe she is too given her mentioning the dates she wants to go on/things she wants to do next school year with me. 

I don't want to stress her out or anything by asking her in the midst of our finals, but this is really nagging at my mind. 

What do you guys think I should do? Should I wait until our finals are done in 4 days and then ask her, or should I just call her up and say I want to talk to her tonight and then tell her how much I like her and ask her to be my gf? 

TL;DR: I wanna ask this girl I like (and who likes me) to be my girlfriend tonight, but we are taking finals right now so idk if it's a good idea to do so."
68clx7,4,2017-04-29,I have some questions for CS majors,quizzor,dartmouth,https://www.reddit.com/r/dartmouth/comments/68clx7/i_have_some_questions_for_cs_majors/,"I'm thinking of studying CS at Dartmouth, and I have a few questions for you CS majors out there that might help me decide whether or not I want to come here. I have a day left to decide between here and Berkeley :/ I like the small environment of Dartmouth, but I am worried about the strength of the CS program and how well I'll fit in.

1) How hard is it to get into the Dali labs? When I visited it seemed like there was no other CS club on campus so I think I'd definitely want to get involved there if I were to go to Dartmouth. What other CS related clubs/opportunities are there?

2) What percentage of the class studies CS?

3) I noticed that a lot of people I talked to came into Dartmouth thinking they wanted to study something else then switched to Dartmouth. Do you think the student body overall is kind of weak  because people don't typically come to Dartmouth for CS? I noticed that the career office has almost no statistics about CS employment, which seems kind of odd, because good CS employment statistics would be something that would encourage someone to come to your school. My theory is that Dartmouth doesn't need to have such statistics because people who are planning to major in CS don't even look at Dartmouth. What do you guys think? The reason this is a concern to me is I am afraid I won't be as motivated to work hard if my peers are not serious about CS. I also heard that the best way to get CS interviews is by knowing someone who works at a company and getting them to refer you. If Dartmouth does not have many people who are super serious about CS it'll probably be less likely that my friends who I meet will hold jobs at top companies that I would want to be referred to.

3) How hard/competitive is it to become a TA for a lower division CS course? How many TAs are there? Are the TAs a close knit group?

4) Where have you interned and how did you get your internships/jobs? What's the most common way for Dartmouth CS students to get internships? (Ex. Career fair, online application, referrals)

5) What is your best estimate of the percentage of students who get **interviews** at top tech companies? (ex. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc)

6) At a career fair, how does an employer choose to offer interviews to if there are 100+ people trying to meet them?

7) What are the negatives of studying CS here. It is easy for you guys to say that ""CS at Dartmouth is Great!"", but that doesn't really help me when I'm trying to compare it to other schools, so I would like to hear the cons of this place. Do you ever wish you chose a different school?

8) Did you know you wanted to study CS when you came here? If so and your feel comfortable sharing, what schools did you pick Dartmouth over?

9) If I'm kind of a shy person and not into drinking/partying, so will I feel left out? I heard the culture at Dartmouth revolves around that kind of stuff. 

Thanks guys, I would really appreciate your help!"

Hiya people of DPP. Today, I want to play out a rather unique scene. Now, depending on how many people I can find for this, there's two ways this can go. 

Idea 1:


You and your wife are in your mid 30s and things have gotten stale. Sex which used to be wild and sweaty, now is scheduled and boring. One day, you decide to spice things up together, by bringing a new person in to the mix. Maybe you're on vacation, and the handsome young bellhop catches your eye, or perhaps the new intern at the wife's firm has begun to occupy her imagination. Whatever the case is, you seduce him together, and that's when things go wrong. Beside the fact that he's ten years younger than the husband, he also happens to be bigger than any man your wife has ever been with. And he knows it. Slowly, your wife begins to ignore you, and start to focus only on him. And he's enjoying your humiliation. 

Idea 2:

The same premise, but I'm in a relationship also this time. We decide to have a little wife swap, but you blow your load in my wife almost instantly, and she gets bored sitting and watching me and your wife. So she joins in, and I take both women while you watch from the corner. 


So these are the two ideas, and I hope you'll respond if you're interested. This will have to take place somewhere else obviously, so message me if you're willing. I use almost all other platforms for mesaaging, so hopefully yes can work something out. I can't wait to hear from you.

68de0l,23,2017-04-29,Girl that I had a long crush on and friend zoned me all of a sudden wanted me,plimpp69,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/68de0l/girl_that_i_had_a_long_crush_on_and_friend_zoned/,"Quick background story. There's this girl that I had a massive crush on since high school. I was 15 and she was 14, so I practically had a crush on her since I was 15. I never talked to her before because I used to be really shy in high school. Fast forward to a year ago, I crashed into her while I was at the mall. I immediately recognized her and we started talking, everything went like a dream! We talked for much more than I expected and I got her Snapchat. We talked on Snapchat for about a month and I ended up getting her number and asked her out on a date and she accepted. I thought that my dreams were coming true! She flaked it but I didn't really care because my car's radiator hose ended up exploding in that same week so I also had an excuse.

Fast forward a few months later, we constantly texted and I swear it seemed like she liked me and she was different, she was going to school and was legitimately nice in general. I thought she was a real NAWALT. I asked her out on another date and she responded by telling me that she'll see since her days off are random. Once again, she flaked it. Fast forward another few months and one of her snaps got me suspicious, she posted a pic of her holding a movie ticket with someone else present. The hand on the right looked like a dudes hand. I tried to dismiss it as maybe her female friend forgot to add nail polish or something. A few weeks after that I tried asking her out on another date to the movies and she told me she was already going to see that movie with her friend but she'll let me know if she ends up going or not. Once again, no response... A few days later I finally let my feelings out and she took it better than I thought and she said I made her day.

Fast forward a few months again... I started complimenting her calling her beautiful whenever we texted. At one point she just out of the blue stopped responding to me mid conversation. I was confused. The next day, she posted multiple snaps with a guy. I didn't see them all day because I was busy. When I opened them I was pretty devastated. It was a guy with tattoos and he literally looked like a lowlife. She took multiple selfies with him and she looked pretty happy. A flashback to the movie ticket snap came to my head. I told myself, that's probably the guy that she was with and why she's always flaking it because that's probably her boyfriend or something. I didn't text her at all for a few weeks. I got kinda depressed.

Fast forward a few weeks. I couldn't handle not texting her at all. I really liked her at the time still. I sent her a text and she replied. It was during the time I was getting interns for a software company so I told her about all of that. She seemed kinda uninterested but I didn't care. Anyways, while we texted a few days later, it was like how it was back then. I thought she was probably single or maybe I over thought and maybe the tattooed guy was her friend or something. I asked her out once again and she accepted it for the first time in a while. I was super happy and she seemed to agree to it. A few days later I saw her at the mall, well I entered the store where she worked at and we talked for a bit and everything seemed fine. The last thing I told her was, ""see you next week!"" I texted her confirming a day to go out since her off days are random and once again... no response... I thought maybe after work she'll respond. She never did at all... I knew she was going to flake it so I didn't bother anymore. I ended up finding out her off day was on a Thursday from Snapchat that week.

Fast forward to these months. I ended up going MGTOW and stopped texting her, eventually, I met another girl that actually went out with me for reals, she didn't flake it, she actually started conversations with me, and was actually interested in me. I posted that on Snapchat and since then, she's been viewing every single thing I post. I guess I ended up becoming pretty successful so I posted a few thing about my cars, when I go out, shopping, out on a boat since I live by the coast and I love the ocean, and like I said, she's been viewing everything. Yesterday she texted me for the first time, she tried acting like she just wanted to know how I was doing and where I was at in my snaps etc. All of a sudden she starts texting me about how she's sorry that we never got to go out in the past, she went on telling me how she was always busy with work and she was always out with her friends and didn't want to just leave them etc. She tried asking me to hang out that week since her day off was on a Saturday. I declined it and asked her if she was really that busy how come she had all that time to post things with that tattooed guy? She didn't know how to respond to that and told me she was so sorry and that he broke her heart and that I'm the sweetest guy she knows, and that she likes me etc. I didn't buy it. I told her I'm going out with my girlfriend on Saturday and since then we haven't texted. She still see's all my snaps till this day though and I don't delete her to keep her in her place and destroy her I guess.

Sorry for the long post guys. I just had to get this off my chest. Even though a girl seems like a NAWALT be careful out there guys! Since going MGTOW I now see past women's bullshit and now know how to choose females carefully. I go my own way, I don't bow down to no female.

So my ex is currently at my house, sleeping with my roommate, but also, the girl I am currently interested in went home with someone else tonight, and I fucking paid for their ride home. All of it I have to accept, and it's so fucking hard. 

Tonight I have to hurt, but I know that is ok. It's ok to cry over it, it's ok to feel like shit over it. But it did happen and I have to deal with that right now. After I got home I went for a long ass walk.
 
When I got back I just watched the first 2 episodes of 13 reasons why and played some WoW. I can't go back to self-harm, if I do it'll be back to step zero and I can't go back there. I feel like total shit though, I have finals in two days and then I go to Spain for the summer. I just have to get through the pain without doing anything unhealthy. I have to accept this. If I have to be alone, I'll be fucking alone, whatever. I knew that putting myself out there posed a risk and that I could be rejected, and now I have been. Shit happens, I gotta get through it and without going back to my old habits. I'm just being reminded how lonely I feel right now and it doesn't feel good. I've been going forward so far, I was just voted into an exec position in my fraternity, my grades are doing alright, and I have an internship for the summer, I'm alright. My friends respect and care about me, they've told me so, but I'm just hurting tonight. I'm hurting alot right now, but I know I will get through it, it's temporary, I'm going to fucking do it. 

I was so tempted to self-harm, it almost felt the same way as giving in to watching porn. ""just once won't hurt"", ""it'll make you feel better"", but I won't go back to it. I have my last therapy session next week and I won't go back saying that I indulged in that shit again, not when I've come all this way."

During my last month there, I shared an office with a girl I really clicked with - we're about the same age and have a lot of things in common. She even helped me find a job (which means I'm moving back to her city soon). So obviously we haven't known each other for very long, but I do consider her a friend, and hope to hang out with her regularly once I'm back.



The question is this - this girl has a spare room in her apartment that she often rents out on Airbnb. It's not always occupied but I know it pays for a significant part of her rent. I want to ask her if I can stay at her place for a few days while I look for my own apartment. I'm sure she would say yes if no one has already booked the room. Should I offer to pay for the time? Should I just find some other alternative so we don't mix friendship and finance?  "

I am moving to Brisbane for my internship in 2018 and am looking for some advice.

I'm thinking about working at Redcliffe Hospital, as I'm a North Queenslander born and raised and want to avoid working in the big hospitals (RBH / PA etc).  I would like to experience some city life, but don't want to be too far away from the hospital. 

I'm chasing some ideas about good suburbs to live in for a 22 year old.  Is Redcliffe the best option to work if it means I'll be too far from the city (despite it being a highly rated hospital for interns)?  I am happy to drive 10-15 minutes either way (to work or to the city).  

Just chasing as much advice, as well as tips and tricks from locals before the big move next year.

Thanks for your opinions, they are really appreciated!"
68fr40,2,2017-04-30,Why is the Toronto Star so weirdly pro-Trump?,Tasadar,canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/68fr40/why_is_the_toronto_star_so_weirdly_protrump/," I can't fault the Star for writing pro conservative pieces, especially ones based on facts. I could probably write a pretty good article on Harper highlighting good things he's done, and that article would be factual and soooomewhat informative. Sure I'd be leaving out my beefs with Harper, but I could say actual nice things about him, and any bias I had towards the Conservatives (I don't) would be reasonable.


But I picked up the Sunday Star to find on the same page as an article calling Trudeau out for being a photo-op feminist, an article about a recent Trump rally which just reeked of the question ""Why is this here?"".

My aforementioned Harper article might mention, you know, facts. But this Trump article sure doesn't. 


The title?


 ""100 days in, Trump's proud of his work""


 Okay, a little less aggressive than the Trudeau article but perhaps tongue in cheek? The article starts with Trump statements and quotes, his ""renewed promises on healthcare and taxes"" what promises? Didn't he recently release a tax plan that basically totally defies all his vague promises to fix the tax code? If he's making promises on taxes why isn't there actual info on his recent tax plan? No time for information though, have a trump quote ""My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens"". Okay. 



The article continues to talk about how he won the State he's rallying in on his 100th day as president, the first time a Republican had done so since 1988. A few more Trump quotes on Korea and other things, and some of the less idiotic of his executive orders ""an order to direct the commerce department to examine trade deals"" and one about the keystone oil pipeline. Never mind that writing an executive order to the commerce department to see if america is being ripped off is... well... stupid? Like oh we were supposed to read those? But okay sure.


 Then it mentions how he largely still has support from his voters. No actual approval ratings, no actual numbers, no mention of his steady record breaking decline in polls, just ""Mostly his supporters still love him""


The article finishes with talking about how Trump has signed the most executive orders of any president in 100 days. Not mentioning how 4 or 5 were struck down by judges, and several are just sorta. Stupid? Or that he's attacked his predecessor for these things, or anything really.


Why is this an article? It says nothing, the only number on the whole page besides 100 is the number of executive orders. It's like a sixth of the page is an article for Canadian Trump supporters (please god no) who are too ignorant for facts. Did Trump write this article? It's from the AP so I sort of imagine an editor asking for a pro trump blurb for conservative newspapers and an intern being like ""uuuh...""

|

But wait there's more! On the other side of the same page is **another** Trump article ""Criticism only makes Trump more powerful"". A long piece about how the media was wrong, how the small popular vote lead of Hillary Clinton is viewed as churlish by the millions of Americans who voted for Trump, how everyone's getting in his way. How the criticism of Trump only bolsters his support. Except that his support is slowly draining away. No mention of what the criticism is, politics is a sport after all, nothing should be based on facts or anything...

Trump may be hamfisted and haphazard but, as an intersected quote for those two lazy or illiterate to read the entire article will have you believe ""Despite the gnashing of the establishment's teeth, those who voted for Trump overwhelmingly think he's doing a good job"".


And that's it. Barely bringing itself to mention anything bad about Trump in about a page on him across the Sunday section, there's no mention of any actual facts, probably because actual facts sort of, you know, make him look bad. There is a couple lines near the end that says ""Make no mistake there's stuff to complain about with Trump"". Well going by this paper I would be making that mistake up to this point, care to actually point any of it out???


It's like watching Trump at a press event yammer on about his electoral college win. Okay, so what about the renewed softwood lumber dispute, or attacking Canadian dairy farmers? How bout when he said we were ripping him off and that ""despite how everyone loves Canadians"" we're actually nasty, or evil or whatever he said I forget. How bout his attacks on NAFTA which he immediately backtracked on? No nothing?

Like I'm reading this as I get a coffee on a Sunday morning, is this where people get news? Is this what passes for a newspaper now? Why is our press openly biased towards a foreign politician who repeatedly attacks our country, our trade agreements, our alliances? Why is a major Canadian newspaper avoiding as best it can to actually say anything bad, or anything true or anything meaningful about Trump?

I'm all for some slanderous pieces on Canadian politicians, you could probably fill the entire politics section with factual shit talking on Trudeau, I just don't understand why the paper is tiptoeing around Trump? Like what the fuck...

TL:DR full page worth of Trump articles can't find one actual fact about him that's negative, including an article about a pointless rally he had, despite on the same page ragging on Trudeau for ""empty photo ops""

68h5fl,2,2017-04-30,[F4M] - 36 - Confessions of an ovulating female.,jensdpp,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/68h5fl/f4m_36_confessions_of_an_ovulating_female/,"Even at 36, when I'm ovulating my thoughts can really get me in trouble...

Every year we get a set of interns from University who come join our company for three to four months. I enjoy working with them and seeing their start into corporate life. They always bring such an energy and different perspective into what our company does.

The first meeting is always a thrill and I work hard to capture the excitement with them. I enjoy being an authority figure and mentoring these twenty some-things. I like to dress the part, wearing my blouse and skirt and my black heels which add an extra inch or so. I'll usually wear my glasses to provide what I've been told is the librarian look.

That afternoon, my young administrative assistant stepped into my office. Her voice almost gasping as she smiled, her hands fanning herself as if in heat. ""They're ready for you ..."", she smiled and quickly left heading towards the bathroom.

I shook my head as I walked down the hall. My heels making a little clicking sound against the floor. I opened the door to the cramped conference room.

Was this a Fucking Joke from HR? What else could it be?. Every single one of my ten interns is male. Every damn one!!

The vast majority over six feet, their knit dressed shirts pressed against their chest. It's as if HR hired male models instead of geeky interns. I seriously stood there, mouth gaping open, looking at the sea of muscled men pressing against their sharp dress shirts and slacks. Then some smartass said, “Were you going to tell us something?” My face turned a deep crimson. I’m never like this. Calm, cool, collected is my motto.

I know I’m not supposed to think about these young men like this, but they’re so damn fuckable! Some of them look like athletes(varsity or club sports, does it matter?), I could feel the heat building in the cramp conference room as I tried to move to the front, brushing against these men and feeling that familiar warm tingle inside. I felt like I could smell the testosterone.

I had to stammer and stutter a bit before I finally got control of myself, and gave the *“Enjoy your internship, ask questions and enjoy your learning experience....blah.blah”* speech I give year after year. Thank god for panties, so they couldn’t see how wet I was getting. Seriously, I was soaked. If I weren’t so turned on, my instincts screaming *“MATE WITH THESE MEN”*, I would’ve been embarrassed.

That afternoon, I had meetings with each and every-one to discuss their goals. I couldn't help but feel I was interviewing these young men to put another baby in me. A lot of conversation and damn flirting on my part: ""Do you like your corporate apartment? there is that real nice place for dinner just down the block""...uggggg...my thoughts racing to myself:  ""Would you please?...just this once?"". I would catch the occasional glance across my breasts and would start to lean forward against the desk, not even worrying I may be showing my own pale cleavage. My thoughts drifting again towards these men, wondering which one would make my toes curl.

Afterwords, I couldn't take it any more and left early for home. Late that evening, I put on my iTunes songs, poured a glass of wine and brought out my purple vibrator from the night-stand. I grabbed the bedsheets as I thought about one of these young men pinning me to the bed. Throwing my arms above my head as my thoughts drifted towards his hands grasping me. His potent semen flooding my defenceless eggs as I orgasmed loudly to myself.

-------------------------

Just some whimsical writing and open to a RP or just chatting. You can also just comment on what I wrote, give me advice, ask me questions, or whatever via PM!

Today I'm bringing to you a couple ideas for a fun prompt in which one of the following girls is fucked! After the list of prompt ideas is a list of girls I'm fine with playing.

For clarification, I'm also open to playing with other girls in an [F4F] scenario or even trans/traps in a [F4T] scenario. I could even be convinced into a [T4M] scenario if it's good enough.

**Prompts:**

1. *The Gym Leader's Reward:*
After winning against me in a Pokemon battle, you recieved your Gym Badge and the proof you defeated me. However, you were a little surprised when I invited you into my private back room for a little more of a prize....

2. *Crime Always Pays:*
As a young Pokemon Trainer, I've done my best to stop you and your criminal organization (whether it's Team Rocket, Team Galactic, or any other one) from upsetting the balance of the world. But I didn't expect to be defeated when I challenged some grunts at your HQ, and I didn't expect them to use mr against my will...

3. *Double Battle Royal:*
After a year of harsh training and a rigorous application process, you finally made it into the Battle Royal Club; a prestigious trainer's club in a fancy Villa beside a beach. Here, Trainers can fight each other in large Double Battles set to an arena near the water. The club also has plenty of rooms for the inevitable ""relaxation"" that comes after every battle for the four trainers involved...

4. *The Champion's Trophy:*
As new reigning Champion of a region of your choice, you now have the right to any one girl in the entire region. Which also means that you're expected to plant your ""Champion's Seed"" inside her as well. The catch? It's got to be on Video, and you're going to have to release it to the public as an official film of the Pokemon Champion. So make it a good tape!

5. *The Professor's Assistant:*
As an intern working with one of the most established Pokemon Professors, you've grown quite a crush on her, even if she is a bit older than you. However, don't think she hasn't noticed. Because she has. And being as lonely as she is, she has no issues with seducing you and introducing you to her interesting kinks...

68hj1v,0,2017-04-30,Programming Internship tips??,andrewvogler12,Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/68hj1v/programming_internship_tips/,"I'm finishing my freshman year at Iowa State University and I'm looking for an internship in Seattle or the the area surrounding Seattle. 

I've felt downplayed all year for not going to University of Washington but ISU was significantly cheaper for me so I stuck with my decision.  I feel like it severely diminished my chances of getting an internship (and eventually entry-level job). Lots of my friends went to more prestigious schools than me because they were applying themselves early on in high school and I was still debating becoming a music major. (I'm studying Computer Engineering now).  

Seattle has lots of big name companies that I would love to intern at (Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, etc.) but I also know that most of those companies are looking for juniors and seniors to intern with. I also don't have really any connections in Seattle so I feel like I'm going out on a whim applying for internships when there are plenty of people at WU who will have found connections to those companies in their first year.

What are some other companies looking to hire interns whether big or small? &amp; What can I do to boost my internship/co-op possibilities for the next couple years? This could be useful programming languages, clubs, extra-curricular sports, idk. I'm currently a member of the IEEE, I'm semi-involved in our cyber-defense club, I play for our school's jazz band, and I'm also going to be a small group leader and on worship team at my local church. 

Thanks!

Edit: sorry if I made this unclear, I'm looking to get ready for an internship for the following  summer, not the one coming up in a week."
68hjmz,0,2017-04-30,Lets have a discussions on Manipulation.,mrthrowaway413,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/68hjmz/lets_have_a_discussions_on_manipulation/,"Hello all,

This is a topic on the use of manipulation on people.

So I've now come into the end of my first year of college. 

A lot has happened this year. I'm a founding father of a fraternity and have done well in academics. I have a girlfriend that has been a perfect LTR and I have cheated on her several times now. 

I've realized that in every interaction I have with a human being, I'm always looking to manipulate them. I want to see what benefits I receive from and how I can get it

Heres a very detailed example. 

So I smoke a lot of weed now, causing me to miss this class called Honors which is a ridiculous program at 8am every Tuesday and Thursday. I gave up on it ages ago, I have a B. So I went over the max absences and was being threatened to be failed.

I've never come close to failing a class before.

The professor told me that I had to speak with the Dean of Students to confirm my absences and he will listen to whatever she tells him.

I looked up the Dean of Students and arrange an appointment when her schedule was very busy. I knew this because of my fraternity brother who interns with her, he said he would suggest her to reschedule, since she does like to cancel on people. He also told she is not charge of absences, professors just like to put the pressure on her.

Because of this she rescheduled me a week later and her first sentence to me was ""I'm sorry for rescheduling, my apologies"".

I look at this as her first feelings towards me being sympathy. This puts me in a good spot, in comparison to just meeting her on a normal appointment with neutral feelings towards me. It's like being at +1 instead of 0

Then I told her about my single (Gotta sell the single mother story, right?) mother who has shingles and how I had to take care of her and that is why I missed class.

My mother did have shingles, but that is not why I missed class. 

Then I framed the professor's request to speak to her by saying that he will listen to everything she says. 

I talked about her nieces and talked about my upbringing in ways to bring out feelings of sympathy from her, but never be so drastic to bring out pity.

I did not want to appear like a whiner, I wanted to appear like a student who needs her help and has motivation. I shot out my founding father office position and small talk about her family etc.

In the end, she ended up saying ""Let's take advantage of the fact that he will listen to whatever I say.""

She sent an email to the professor excusing every single absence stating that I have brought documentation and reasonable evidence for my days.

I had no documentation at all. She then told me if my honors grade does result in endangering my scholarship to come speak to her personally since she believes I am a ""nice young man who wants to make the best of his education and the opportunities.""  

When she said that I realize how much I've managed to sell that Idea to her.

It's how I approach every interaction with people, with my girlfriend, with my own mother sometimes.

Do any of you guys use manipulation to this extent? Is this healthy? Sometimes I question my underlying agenda since I am a very selfish person. I look at everything at what I can personally gain.

Does living a life of manipulation mean living a life always on guard? Or is the way to live a life to its fullest?

Do you disagree with this way of living? 


I love having discussions, so go forward and shit on me if that is your opinion, the red pill doesn't ever hold back on that anyways. 

Lastly, cheers guys, hope your day is well, just finished my work for the day and wanted to make this post to see where it leads.

The next evening, I got a string of texts from my father. He said they will need some space for awhile and that they have decided to take the car back they gave me for college. My parents also requested “privacy on the issue on social media.” 

No ""I love you"" or ""you're still our son."" Just a request to not put my relationship on Facebook. You could say I was pretty upset at their reaction.

The next day, my dad told me I was going to be kicked off my family's health insurance, even though I still have a year of graduate school after my upcoming graduation. During that same conversation, he offered to keep me on their insurance as long as I didn't post anything on social media. I told him I didn't want *any* support if there were strings attached. 

Thankfully Spencer, his parents, and some really great friends have helped me through the last week. They have all been beyond wonderful. I also can't believe the outpouring of love I've gotten from my initial post of the letter. Rereading comments during my lowest points this past week has been a huge reaffirmation of support. 

Slowly, it seems my parents may be coming around, or at least not completely purging me from their life. They picked up my car today, but signed over my mom's old SUV to me. They also said I can stay on their health insurance until I finish graduate school. It isn't anywhere where I hoped it would be, but it's better than nothing. Hopefully these things are a sign there is a possibility for growth.

All in all, I don't think they're going to take Spencer and me to dinner. It seems doubtful they are even going to come to my graduation. Maybe I'll be surprised, but I'm not going to get my hopes up. I know either way, there will be a family there to celebrate with.

I have no regrets on mailing the letter. In fact, it has allowed me to take a huge sigh of relief the past week. Regarding my parents, I think all I can do is wait for them to come around. Give them space. Hope that I can offer another round of forgiveness someday.

Until that time comes, I’m going to celebrate my graduation, kick ass at my summer internship (Big 4 accounting what’s up), and be thankful I was able to meet a guy that made me feel comfortable enough with myself to take this huge step. 

Love is too great to miss out on, and nothing my parents can ever do or say will make me question that. "

When I say baby I mean 20 year old, just for those that where thinking wow that’s just odd. I’m 25 and have been working out here for a good 18 months now, and have my own place. Our parents live about an hour and a half out, so when my sister wanted to get an internship she turned to me for a place to stay.

The agreement was I would not have to change how I went about life, and I wouldn’t get in the way of her doing her own thing. Before I go on, let me tell you a little about me. I’m Matt, I’m stand at 6’3, with broad well built shoulders. I have a pretty toned chest, as I go to the gym 3 times a week. Normally I can be found wearing jeans and a t-shirt. But when I do go out I will pull out the shirt. But back to how I look, my arms are of a decent size, with powerful looking thighs. 

So after the first 2 months I noticed that my sister was starting to take more of an interest in the girls I would bring home on a Friday or Saturday night. At first It was little things, asking who she was, but then it progressed to how I met them etc. But more recently she has been asking for details like why I went for them, and what we got up too. 

So I have to ask my self, why is she taking such a big interest in my sex life?"
68id14,29,2017-04-30,Some game-time advice &amp; perspective from a 1L,EltonJohnCena,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/68id14/some_gametime_advice_perspective_from_a_1l/,"First and foremost, CONGRATULATIONS to all of you on working so hard the last 4+ years and fielding some seriously great offers! I was you a year ago and I know this is a crazy stressful time, but this is the most fun law school is going to be until graduation. I still pop back to this sub when I want to remember the good times before the actual work started. I read one of these when I was applying and hopefully this might be as helpful to someone as that one was for me - 

In short, I'm a 1L who was a poli sci major and super splitter (2.89/170). I went to an objectively average state school and then worked a pretty cool job for a year between undergrad and law school. I was convinced no one wanted me with my numbers, but I ended up at my first choice a few spots outside the T14 with a 75% scholarship. I'd rather keep the school nameless, but feel free to PM me if you have any questions about it. I have a number of friends in law schools (mostly east coast) with a wide enough range in rankings that I have a pretty good idea of the opportunities and realities beyond USNWR. I tried to address a few points I see popping up pretty frequently, but please let me know if there's something else you're curious about and I'll answer to the best of my abilities.

* Always, always, always ask for more money. Schedule a meeting or a call with the Dean of Admissions and ask for more. Before I committed I went in and politely but firmly explained that financial considerations were an important factor in my decision. She told me when to send an email officially requesting more and within a week my scholarship was doubled. Worst case scenario it's no more money, best case scenario law school is free.

* If you are set on the city or region you want to practice in, go there. It's certainly not binding but the connections you make will be invaluable in landing internships and eventually a job. Through networking alone I have internships lined up through my 2L year, which I would not have been able to do remotely. 

* There is no shame in adding an addendum to explain the circumstances surrounding a dark mark on your application. In my case, my GPA was trash my first two years thanks to a fantastic series of unfortunate events, but my major GPA was a 3.64 and I couldn't wait to tell them ""I'M BETTER THAN JUST THIS ONE DAMNING NUMBER!!!"" They listened.

* There's no undergrad degree that you should have. Most people I know here are poli sci, econ, or English, but the science majors are really the ones kicking ass (patent bar!). Liberal arts degrees definitely have advantages in that you've been more exposed to the way of thinking and might be familiar with some of the material, but law schools love non-traditional majors. You're not boxed in. Do the things you love in undergrad and the passion will show in your work.

* On that note, I see a lot of posts that say law schools don't care much about any work experience you've had or extracurriculars, just your LSAT and GPA. That is false. Of course, they don't hold as much weight, but having a diverse 1L class with a range of passions and backgrounds is massively to the school's advantage. I didn't hear one mention during orientation of how high our median LSAT was, but several deans bragged that they had admitted a glassblower (seriously). Your work and personal experience says a lot about who you are as a person - at schools where all the applicants are qualified, that's what makes you stand out.

* Something to remember if you're concerned about debt - if you happen to be dead set on going into the public sector anyway (government/nonprofits), loan forgiveness applies. Paying sticker or close to isn't a great option, but it's not the worst if 10 years in public interest is something you want to do anyway.

* Conversely, a lot of people want to do biglaw, and the salary does a pretty good job of explaining why. But be wary of convincing yourself you'll end up with an offer right after graduation: just like not everyone passes the bar their first time, not everyone that wants to do biglaw is going to have something lined up. There's nothing wrong with going that route, it's just critical that you don't rely on the promise of $180k before it's an option.   

* This is important - trust your gut. At the end of the day, if you are choosing between two schools with a decent difference in ranking but you know you like the lower-ranked one better, GO THERE. You'll start the journey happier, and you'll be in a better mental state to do well. My first choice wasn't necessarily my best choice on paper - I picked it because I clicked with the sense of community they built. I would not change a thing.

If you have questions about *anything* from scholarship/waitlist negotiations to timing and formalities to preparation to (for lack of a better term) the things you can't ask your advisor, I'm happy to help. Seriously, y'all should be so proud of yourselves and I promise the hardest part is over! Until August!

edit: I GOT RID OF THE ~7! IT WAS AN ESTIMATE BASED OFF OF WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO ME BY PEOPLE (LIARS!!) AT THESE SCHOOLS! I PROMISE I DID NOT CRASH YOUR APP CYCLE TO TRASH T13 OR BIGLAW OR YOUR DREAMS AND I AM SORRY THAT IT CAME OFF THAT WAY! I SINCERELY HOPE IF YOU WANT BIGLAW YOU GO OUT THERE AND PROVE MY BAD NUMBERS WRONG!!! A+ fact checking you will all make killer attorneys :)"
