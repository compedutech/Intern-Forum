8v6371,1,2018-06-30,[23/m] Ex [19/f] keeps contacting me. Why?,UnfoundHound,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8v6371/23m_ex_19f_keeps_contacting_me_why/,"Recently, in the beginning of June, my ex [19/f] broke up with me [23/m] after a relationship of 2 years and 9 months. We had a LDR for 2,5 years which worked perfectly (I met her when she was 16 and I was 21; quite the age difference I know; also her first boyfriend). 

January this year she moved from Germany to the Netherlands to live with me (and my dad, because I still lived with him to save money). The plan was, of course, to find our own place ASAP. I was still studying and doing an internship and she got a full-time job (she didn't want to start studying yet). 

After about 2,5 months we got into a small fight and she then told me she didn't love me anymore and wanted to break up (around the end of March). I was baffled. I knew the situation wasn't ideal. She didn't feel really comfortable at my place, she couldn't get along with my dad, she had to travel 2 hours each day to her work, our work schedules didn't match so we only had 1 hour before bed each work day to spend together. In the weekends we tried spending more time together, but we also wanted our time alone. Besides that, I had other responsibilities as well and she wanted to hang out with her friends. In general, our relationship became routine, it became a drag. Despite the little arguments and fights we had, the interaction between us was really good. We could always laugh together and just chill; like really good friends. Perhaps too much like friends, because the love and intimacy faded. So she impulsively wanted to break up. I was able to convince her to not give up. So we continued our relationship, but I didn't know what was actually wrong except for the fact that she didn't love me as much anymore. We never had a good talk about our relationship problems, because I was mostly blind to them and she didn't communicate. 

In the following month, in April, things were getting back to normal. There was love and intimacy again, we could finally start looking for our own place, and we had more quality time together. Sadly, in May, things started to return to the routine and so things got worse. Half-way May we still hadn't found a place as it is very tight housing market here and we simply got rejected because we weren't high earners. I then suggested to each find our own place (like a room/student housing), and then in the meantime save for a house. Later, post break up, I found out that she thought I wanted to stay at my dad's place and save for a house for the next few years. Due to that misunderstanding, she got scared, felt confined, and thus made the decision to find her own place in the city she works in; without telling me. Two weeks later I found her stuff packed, she broke up with me and moved out the next day. 

I was baffled again. I tried to convince her again, but she was having none of it. She didn't believe in me anymore and she didn't love me enough anymore. I helped her move and it was an emotional day. She tried to act strong, but she still had to cry. I then suggested we should take a break instead of break up. She agreed. Before we said goodbye we still hugged and kissed. 

In the following days, I made the mistake to text her and call her since I was too emotional. She was then a bit pissed of course and she broke up with me. I still managed to get her to meet up with me, but I was not gonna beg her to come back to me. Instead, I told her how I felt about the relationship and asked how we can go on from here. She was positively surprised by my mature and sensitive approach because she thought I was gonna beg and plead to her. We decided there to stay friends. We would have a period of no contact; she would initiate the first contact because she broke up with me. Saying goodbye that day was a bit odd because we hugged, but she wanted to hug longer than I did and she even told me I could kiss her on the cheek. I then walk towards my car, after a few meters I looked over my shoulder. She was surprisingly still standing there holding the door and smiling. I smiled back. I found it odd because I sensed quite some feelings on her side there.

After 6 days of no contact, she contacted me again. We had a friendly and fun conversation. I asked her if I could call her the next day and she surprisingly agreed. It was a decent conversation on the phone. Although, she wasn't sharing all too much and she was also distracted since she was riding her bicycle at the same time. I asked her if she wanted to meet up next week, but she said ""Maybe I'll have to see""; to which I replied that I understood if it was too early. She agreed so no plans were made. That day was also her birthday and I had sent her a personalized card and a small bouquet of flowers (also for her new place). She loved both. We kept talking on and off about all kinds of things. Here and there I made some mistakes as I still sort of showed a desire for her. She, of course, was a bit put off by that. For the weekend she went home to Germany to visit family for her birthday. I decided to not bother her that weekend and wait until she contacts me again.

The Monday after she contacted me to thank me for giving her back the money for the car we bought together. We had a small conversation, but there was still quite some tension. I confronted her about the tension and said it was unnecessary; that we could be good friends and just hang out as before. She saw all of that, but she doesn't want to call and hang out so much. She just wants to text now and then, because she doesn't have the need to share so much information with me or see me so often. That hurt a bit, but I accepted it.

I didn't speak to her for a few days until she contacted me again to ask if her dad could pick up some remaining stuff of hers at my place the next week on Saturday. I asked if just her dad was coming. She said she would also try to be there, but she wasn't sure because she had to work till 4 pm. I told her it wasn't necessary for her to come as it would only take a few mins. Still, she said she would do her best to come. After that, we talked during the weekend on and off. On Sunday I had texted her funny gif but didn't speak to her after that.

Now here's the thing. I haven't contacted her out of my own initiative once since the moment we decided to stay friends, because I wanted to give her space and time; she would set the pace. She had contacted me 3 times so far. The first time because we decided she should contact me first when she felt like it, the second time because of the money I returned, and the third time because of the stuff that had to be picked up. So she contacted me mostly out of politeness and because of practical matters. I took all that as a sign that she isn't really interested in talking to me. Of course, we had conversations, but it wasn't the same. She also gave mixed signals. Sometimes she was laughing and seemed interested, but then suddenly she got a bit cold and gave short replies, often killing the conversation. So I expected her to not contact me until the day her dad would come and pick up her stuff. Surprisingly, she contacted me on Thursday already to ask me what my vacation plans are (something I mentioned somewhere before in one of our post-breakup conversations). We talked a bit; she seemed interested; we had a laugh, but then again she killed the convo with a slightly cold and short reply. Later she messaged me that her dad would come at 2 pm on Saturday so she couldn't be there. She didn't apologize for it nor did she seem sad about it.

Today was that Saturday. She contacted me to tell me her dad would come later due to being delayed. When he came I  helped him with putting her stuff in his van and then said goodbye. It was all friendly and ok. It wasn't even very awkward, but just a bit weird. My ex then thanked me (twice) over text in a warm way for helping her dad. Since then I haven't spoken to her.

tl;dr
My ex keeps contacting me sporadically over the past month after having broken up with me. At first, it seemed she contacted me out of politeness or because of practical matters, but then she actually contacted me to ask about my vacation plans. I find this odd because in our conversations she gives off mixed signals where she seems interested at first, laughs with me, replies to my messages, but then she kills the conversation with a short and somewhat cold reply.

So now my question is: Why would she keep contacting me while she seems uninterested? I really don't understand it. I thought she only contacted me to get those practical matters solved and then just have a conversation out of politeness. "
8v6xpl,5,2018-06-30,Help Me Lose My Mind (The White Velvet Remix) [M/F] [Spanking] [Romantic],sinfulcaramel,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/8v6xpl/help_me_lose_my_mind_the_white_velvet_remix_mf/,"I met him at a house party on a random Saturday night two weeks ago.

Being invited by a good friend of mine, my plan was to go hang out with friends, have a couple of drinks, and maybe hook up with a random stranger for some much needed stress relief ahead of my exams.  And for the first hour or so, that’s exactly what happened. But...then I met him.

What started off as nice conversation under a gorgeous night sky with friends and a perfectly made gin and tonic, turned into an intense staring contest, then quickly escalated to a battle for control.  Twenty questions style. While I’d like to think I at least put up a good fight, in the end, I couldn’t resist the proverbial red string pulling both of us together. 

We then proceeded to spend the next twelve or so hours together, experiencing a total sexual high I was certain I’d never experience again.  The next day, he kindly drove me home after a long leisurely Sunday morning of “getting to know each other” underneath an incredibly cozy, grey and white striped duvet.  The relatively long ride was spent chatting about any topic that came to mind, then made promises to call each other over intimate kisses and hungry bites to the lips.

Then I didn’t hear from him.  At all. Not even a text.

So you can see how it would be a bit of a shock when, at dinner with my visiting mother and sister, I walked back from the bathroom to find him standing at the restaurant entrance, casually shaking hands with three guys around his age.  The faint sound of his sultry laugh and his beautiful smile had me standing dead in my tracks, admiring the put-together but casual look of an untucked light blue oxford shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark wash jeans and polished dark brown boots.

My mind spun with how fast it was trying to process all the feelings running through it at that moment.  Anger, frustration, hurt, passion, lust...love? 

The crashing waves of emotions made my heart race as I clenched my hands at my sides, watching the three guys he was with leave the restaurant.  My breath quickened as he turned to face me, and all the memories from that night drowned any comprehensible thought left in my brain. His eyes widened when I brushed past him, pushing open the restaurant’s heavy dark wood door and stepped out into the mild spring air.

I walked around the side of the all red brick Italian restaurant, trying desperately to control my emotions, even though the heat of his stare skimming over my back made me feel deliciously naked.  *No, not now.  Remember the past two weeks.*

I stopped in the small alleyway between the restaurant’s beautiful outdoor patio and a tall, glass office building.  Taking a deep breath to try and calm myself, I stared off into the distance; incredibly angry, but feeling ridiculous for leaving, wondering why I did any of it at all.  

It might’ve been the need for some air and to find a quiet place to gather my thoughts.  It might’ve been to force myself to get away from him, just to resist the greater urge to be as close to him as possible.  Or maybe I wasn’t thinking at all, and it was the first instinct my body latched onto that wasn’t just hauling off and punching him.

His footsteps were barely heard over the noisy rush hour traffic, and it had me jump a little when I felt his hand lightly turning me around to kiss me.  Slow and soft, but with so much passion that it made my eyes water with the pent-up frustration I’ve been harboring for the past two weeks. The warmth of his hand sliding over my skin-tight, white velvet dress scorched me as his fingers caressed the back of my neck, making me shiver with excitement.  The contrasting, tantalizing sensations only added to the frustration boiling deep inside me.

My hands slid up his chest, and I shoved him away from me, smacking him hard across the face.  After seeing the shocked look on his face, I wondered for a split second if the smack stung him just as much as it did my hand.  Then I remembered how much my heart ached for him the past two weeks, and suddenly my hand didn’t feel as bad.

“Two weeks,” I shouted.  “Two fucking weeks since that party.”

“Can I explain…”

“What’s there to explain?  You obviously didn’t feel the same way I did after that night.”

“You honestly can say that after the way I just fucking kissed you?”

“I believed it when you said you would call after you drove me home in the morning, and we spent...I don’t know...a good ten minutes in your car making out.  And look where we are now.”

“Oh come on,” he said, scoffing. “I…”

“You know,”  I said, never feeling so upset with someone before.  “I probably wouldn’t have minded if it was just one night.  If we both drank way too much, found somewhere quiet, and you screwed my brains out until we were both happy and satisfied.  Then we’d wake up, agree that it was just one night, and pretend like nothing ever happened between us. I would’ve been just fine with that.  But it wasn’t just that. Was it?”

He stood there staring at me, waiting for me to speak with a look of indignation on his face.  Good. He deserved it.

“We got to know each other the next morning.  We spoke about our lives, our families, our likes and dislikes, aspirations and fantasies,” I choked out in an unsteady voice.  “When you teased me with kisses as I rattled off all the things that turned me on. Then the incredible sex afterwards. I’d never felt so loved from anyone I’d ever been with before, let alone a person I’d just met less than twenty-four hours before.  It was slow and beautiful; completely opposite to the intense, rough sex we had during the party….”

“What about you?  I haven’t heard from you in two weeks.”

“Because you said you would fucking call!”

“And I can explain why I didn’t,” he sighed.  “But I’m not the only one who's guilty here. You easily could’ve called, but you left it up to me.”

The calm but firm tone in his voice had me flinch, stepping slightly backwards.  It made me even more frustrated that it wasn’t because I wasn’t afraid. “I wanted to call...”

“Don’t pull that ‘I wanted to call you, but I didn’t know if you liked me that way’ bullshit, I know you’re not like that.”  His piercing eyes stared down into mine as he waited for my answer. “Why didn’t you call?”

My back hit the red brick wall, the cool roughness of it jarring me out of my own thoughts as his hand trapped me in between his arm and the ivy lined cedar gate surrounding the outdoor patio.  Thankfully, the patio was closed for what looked to be an event later on tonight, so there wasn't anyone around to witness what was going on between us. Just rows and rows of square tables in the same slatted cedar as the pergola and matching chairs, topped with soft white cushions.  Pristine white table cloths covered some of the tables while others laid bare with just the chairs tipped over them. White string lights adorned the entire length of three walls enclosing the patio, creating an elegant and comfortable atmosphere for the family-owned Italian restaurant.

A sigh left my mouth when his eyebrow arched and waited patiently for my answer. Guess I wasn’t going to win this battle either.

“That night was hands down the best night I’ve had with anyone,” I said, my lips curling into a small smile.  “I never expected to leave the party with someone I actually wanted to see again. You and that night have been the only things on my mind for the past two weeks.  And that scared me. I have so much work and studying to do before my exams. You know it’s really hard to study when all you can think about is how good someone fucked you?”

The deep chuckle and the warm caress of his hand on my flushed cheek forced a shudder over my body.  His fingers brushed a stray tendril of hair behind my ear, and I couldn’t help but lean into his touch; detecting a bit of his wonderfully distinct scent mixed with the same cologne he wore that night.  “I think I can relate.”

“Then came the stress of whether I can pass my exams, on top of forcing myself not to think about you so I could concentrate, and then the wondering of ‘why hadn’t you called yet’ made me kind of a mess.”  I sighed when his fingers danced over the column of my neck. “I really wanted to call you. You don’t know how bad I wanted to hear your voice again.”

The small smile that formed on his lips made me let out an exhale I didn’t know I was holding in.  He leaned his head down and kissed me, his soft lips gliding over mine as his tongue easily slid between my parted lips.  The memory of his kisses that night had me biting back a moan when his lips left mine.

“So, what’s your excuse?”  I asked in a daze.

He laughed.  “Well, like you, I’ve also had projects and exams to prepare for.  I’ve also been busy looking into internships for the past month. Plus, I’ve had my little brother and two of my friends here for the past week, so that’s been taking up some of my time…”

“Ok ok,” I said, groaning at my own stupidity.  “I get it now. And I really am sorry for smacking you, it was just a gut reaction to all the frustration.  I swear I’m not really like that.”

The lights around the patio suddenly turned on as the spring sun began to set, casting a warm pink and orange glow all around us.  Distant sounds of car horns and random passersby mixed with the low strumming of a far off guitar had me leaning my head back against the wall, savoring the moment when lips softly kissed my forehead.

“Can we both agree that life got in the way?”

I slowly nodded, running my hand back up the soft cotton of his shirt to the back of his neck. “Kiss me,” I said low into the cool evening air.

He smiled and lightly caressed his hands up and down my sides.  A small moan slipped from my lips when he slowly pulled me into him and leaned down to kiss me.  Soft teasing kisses led way to rougher ones when my leg slid in between his. His arms squeezed harder and he let out a low moan as my bare thigh slid against the growing bulge pushing against his jeans.  Both of us in need of air, we both pulled away and his lips moved to kiss where my ear met my jaw, causing a half-hearted attempt by me to keep quiet.

“I need to get back to my table,” I said, sighing as his fingers played dangerously close to the hem of my dress.  “I’m still here with my family.”

His groan half made me want to skip the dinner.  And if it was anyone but my family, I just might’ve.  

“A glass of wine tonight?”  He said, lightly kissing my neck.  “At my place?”

A thoughtful hum left my lips.  “Just a glass of wine? I might need a little more than that to entice me to join you.  I could be studying instead.”

He bit my neck right under my ear, making me gasp and let out a small yelp.  “Is this enough to entice you, sweetheart?” He asked in that entrancing husky voice.

That’ll work. “I have to take my mother and sister to the airport, so about...ten?”

“That sounds good to me.”

\~\~\~\~\~

After we said our goodbyes, I went back in the restaurant and had a nice dinner with my family.  I apologized, quickly explaining how a friend I hadn’t seen in a while was having dinner here, and we ended up chatting for a few minutes.  I mean it wasn’t wrong, it just wouldn’t be proper dinner etiquette to explain how “that friend” and I hooked up at a party and we fucked pretty much the entire night.  After dinner, I took them to the airport and drove back to his house, conveniently finding it was only around a ten minute drive from mine. 

The modern, dark brick townhouse sat identical to the other townhouses in the perfectly landscaped neighborhood.  A small and simple assortment of trees and shrubbery perfectly lined around the front of the house. My heart fluttered when I saw the familiar black SUV parked in the driveway, and thoughts of that night hazily drifted through my mind.  I let out a soft sigh as I got out of the car and made sure to lock it, knowing I wouldn’t be back anytime soon.

He answered the door in a loose fitting steel blue t-shirt and matching lounge pants. Really, no one should look this good in pajamas, thinking back to my pj shorts and worn-in, over-sized gymnastics t-shirts.  After greeting each other with a long kiss, I set my things on the small table near the front of the door, and he began showing me around his place.  The house was well decorated in various shades of brown, black and gold with dark leather furniture and a gorgeous stone fireplace already lit with a warm and cozy fire.  Most of all it was clean, which is more than I can say for some of the other guys I’ve dated.

“Do you mind if I use your bathroom?  Need to freshen up.”

“Not at all, take your time.  I’ll be down in the kitchen when you’re done.”

After a quick use of the bathroom and touching up my makeup, I passed by his bedroom again along the way back to the kitchen.  The bedroom had most of the same color scheme as the rest of the house, with a comfortable over-sized brown leather chair and matching ottoman in one of the corners, opposite the four king size mahogany poster bed.  The bed was covered in soft and cozy bedding with pillows perfectly positioned on the bed. The thing that caught my eye though was the shirt he was wearing haphazardly thrown onto the bed along with his jeans; the only out of place things in the otherwise immaculately clean room.

My bare feet carried me across the soft beige carpet to his bed, and I began taking off my dress, laying it on the bed next to his clothes. I slipped the thigh length shirt on and buttoned it up to the top two buttons, leaving only my white lace bra and panties on and showing a healthy amount of cleavage.  The shirt was so soft and smelled of him, making my head spin and my eyes close as I vaguely heard the light melodic flourish of a piano from the corner mounted speakers. The further I walked out of his room and downstairs to the kitchen, the more I began to hear the light jazz piano flowing all throughout the house.  

When I walked into the kitchen, his back was turned to me, walking over to the black steel double door fridge.  The large center island with a gorgeous dark and light brown granite countertop was the focal point of the kitchen, with a small and somewhat deep circular sink at the end of the island.  The other end had a bottle of Pinot Noir, two red wine glasses, and a small cheese board filled with various meats, cheeses and fruits. Yep, definitely not like the other guys I’ve dated.

“I’m just finishing up, go ahead and take a seat.”

I jumped up onto the counter next to everything and smiled when he turned around; lips curled into that sexy smirk I remembered all too well.  “I hope this is okay?” I asked, already knowing my answer.

“More than okay,” he said and walked over to me, skimming a finger over my thigh at the hem of his shirt.  “You look really good in my shirt.”

“I was a little warm and felt overdressed.  Wanted something more comfortable.”

He chuckled.  “Good choice.”

“Everything looks delicious.”

“Thank you,” he  poured me a glass of wine.  “Go ahead and help yourself.”

What felt like minutes was almost two hours sitting at his kitchen island, chatting about whatever came to our mind; what had been going on in the past two weeks to what we were currently watching and everything in between.  It was nice to know we can still have a normal conversation without reverting straight into sex, although it clearly was on both of our minds. One light touch turned into many teasing kisses, all while intimately feeding each other in the middle of the warmly dimmed kitchen.  

I plucked a small, red grape from the almost eaten bunch and playfully tossed it into my mouth, savoring the bittersweet taste.  “Never thought a one night stand might actually turn into something,” I laughed, surprised at the slight uneasiness that showed through it.

He hummed as he finished off his current glass of wine.  Neither of us were necessarily drunk, but we did lose count somewhere in the past two hours.  “Let’s start over.”

My eyebrows furrowed.

“No no,” he said, kissing my temple at the worried look on my face. “I don’t think I could ever forget that night.  What I meant was how about we take things slow, really get to know each other, and see where it goes. We don’t need to put pressure on it.”

I grabbed my glass and tilted my head back to finish the rest of my wine.  I’ve been in a few relationship and never had a terribly bad breakup. My parents are happily married of almost twenty-two years, and my sister was recently engaged to her high school sweetheart of nine years.  Despite all the happy relationships in my life, there was still something deep inside the pit of my stomach that made me nervous about committing to a relationship with him. But...I really wanted to try. 

“I will accept your proposal, but I do have one very important stipulation.  This must be met if we can go forward with this matter.” Why am I such a dork sometimes?

His laugh sent a shiver down my spine.  Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. “Oh? And what’s that?”

“You are fucking me tonight.  And don’t worry, I’ll never forget that night.  I’m still reeling from it.”

He grabbed the glass I was anxiously playing with out of my hand and set it on the counter, his eyes never leaving mine.  “You really think you’re leaving here without me spreading you out on my bed, slowly eating you out as the sun rises though my windows?  Or sliding into you as those pretty nails dig into my back?”

“You know…” Damn, I could literally feel my cheeks reddened.  “The house tour was great and all, but I might need a more...in depth tour upstairs.  It was a little too quick for my liking.”

My lips wrapped around the plump strawberry he held to my mouth, biting it as leaned into my ear and whispered, “What kind of host would I be if I didn’t fulfill all of my guest’s requests.”

As we cleaned up the small mess we made, every sound sent shivers over my body; the click of plates and silverware, the open and close of the refrigerator, and the clink of the wine glasses as I neatly placed them in the drying rack.  Every single sound, every movement reminded me of his presence, of where I was, and it only served to both scare and excite me. 

We then went around the house, making sure everything was off as our soft touches and playful gazes tempted us for what was to come.  The only semblance of light in his place came from the street lamps casting a dim, soft yellow glow through the closed curtains and the frosted panels of the dark wood front door.  I watched as his fingers turned the gold plated lock with ease, and smiled when he walked over and kissed me.

Warm lips caressed over mine.  Large hands slipped over my ass, pulling me closer to him while pushing me deeper against the cold, cream colored wall.  This fucking perfect song doing a number on my sanity, as the scent of him suffocated me in the best way possible. All of it tempting me to give into something I haven’t wanted at all in the last two years, and told myself I didn’t want for a very long time.  

“While I’m not opposed to fucking you against this wall,” he said, whispering into my ear and knocking me out of my dazed contemplation.  “Having you on my bed is all I’ve been thinking about since you knocked on my door.”

Breaking from my own thoughts, I pondered both scenarios for a second, then laced his fingers with mine and walked upstairs with him in tow.  I knew we would have plenty of other opportunities to fully explore every area of his house. “That thought might’ve skimmed my mind a few times,” I said, grinning when I felt his hand caress my hip as he opened his bedroom door.

I turned down the bedding and grabbed my dress, tossing it onto the armchair along with his jeans.  I sat back down on the incredibly soft bed and traced the intricate design of the posters as I watched him carefully light a few candles he had sitting on the dresser; the spicy scent of cinnamon wafting throughout the room.  “Maybe next time I’m over here, we could test out how sturdy these beams are?” I asked, waiting for his reaction as he turned to look at me. Sadly, the only thing I got out of him was a blank stare and the slightest hint of a raised eyebrow.

“Does it interest you?”

“A little.”  Amongst other things.  “Haven’t really delved into that scene, just some spanking when things got a little rough.”

“I don’t know whether to be a little jealous or really turned on,” he said, laughing as he closed the lights; casting the room in a warm, luminous glow.

“‘...The green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on’.”

“Don’t think I’ve ever had a girl quote Shakespeare right before getting into bed with me.”

“Re-reading the classics.”  I shrugged and reached out to gently run my hands down his chest.  “It was one of the more recent ones.”

“Don’t get me wrong, I loved it.”  A soft smile settled on his lips as he slid his fingers down my neck and over the first button, his eyes never leaving mine.  “I also absolutely loved watching you walk around in my shirt.”

“I’ll be sure to wear it again next time I’m over,” I said, grabbing the hem of his shirt and pulling it over his head.

Yep, definitely missed that dark stare and gorgeous smile.  “I’ll hold you to it, sweetheart.”

A trumpet played low through the speakers as I leaned in to his kiss.  His hands slowly unbuttoned and pulled the shirt hanging loosely on my body, dropping it onto the floor and immediately threading his fingers through my tousled hair.  Fuck I missed this. I missed him. A lot. Was I really going to admit that a real relationship could transpire with a guy I hooked up with at a house party? With every hungry kiss.  With every desperate touch. With every rough moan and sweet sigh moving between our lips, the more I was totally okay with admitting that.

I bit my swollen lip when he pulled away, wanting to feel more of that kiss on every inch of me.  His ragged breathing and rough hands ran up my sides, searing into my skin and mind, and causing me to shiver at the raw emotion that coursed through my heated body.  Needing more of him, I leaned up and kissed him, my hands grabbing the waistband of his pajama bottoms. “These need to go.”

He hummed in agreement, helping to take them off along with my panties, and threw them onto the chair.  My arms and legs instantly wrapped around him as he picked me up and laid me in the middle of the bed, feeling as if I was on a cloud when I sunk into the massive pile of soft pillows.  He pushed the covers down a bit, and I watched as he climbed into the bed, situating himself between my spread legs; a small smile on both our lips as we leaned into to continue our fervent kiss.  

Fingers traced down my thigh to the crook of my knee and he spread my legs further apart; the cool air hitting against my already wet pussy.  My eyes closed slightly and I laid back against the pillows, watching him bend down to slowly run his rough tongue over my clit, shivers wracking my body with every slow, teasing caress.  I couldn’t breath. Every breath, every suck of his lips, and every stroke of his tongue sent shocks of pleasure throughout my body. I slid my fingers through his hair, watching him slip two of his fingers inside me and went back to softly sucking on my clit.

Cars driving by and a distant honk of a horn as he curled his fingers upwards were muted by the loud moans I let out, my other hand moving to play with my breasts, feeling the all too familiar feeling of pleasure pooling deep inside me.  “Oh my...fuck, baby. I’m gonna cum.” My orgasm crashed over my body as I uttered those words, hips rolling and fingers grabbing onto his hair as I convulsed all around him. Jeez I think I could’ve cum again watching him slowly lick his fingers clean of my juices.  And that damn smirk was actually gonna kill me one day.

Not even giving him time to think, I pushed him onto his back and straddled him. Goosebumps formed all over my sensitive skin and I giggled, unable to contain my nervous excitement.  That night I fell to him, caught up in the web of lust he spun around me. Tonight, this wasn’t for me.  This was to show him how much I’ve missed him, how much I’ve thought about him these past two weeks. I kissed the crook of his neck, dragged my lips over his collarbone and down his chest, and stopped to run my tongue over his nipple. This was to show him that while I was still anxious about love and relationships, I was still willing to try.  Because it was him.

“You’re thinking about it?”

“What?”  He groaned when I softly bit the other nipple and continued my trek down his toned abs.  A large grin spread across my lips, glad to know I was able to throw him off at least a little for a change.

“Me tied up,” my tongue traced over every sharp line and felt his fingers thread through my hair.  “Tied to your bed. My body writhing all over these soft sheets as you tease and torture me until you’re completely satisfied, and I’m a withering mess of pent-up sexual frustration.”

Pain shot through my scalp when he grabbed a chunk of my hair and pulled; dark, hooded eyes staring straight into mine.  I could really get used to this.

I licked my lips, staring back at him behind dark eyelashes.  “I am too. Never thought I’d be really into it, but...yeah. I want it with you.”

“Let’s,” he let out a long sigh and closed his eyes.  “Let’s talk about this tomorrow. If we’re going to have this conversation, I want to be relatively coherent for it.  It’s hard to concentrate right now when all I want to do is fuck you, and you’re not helping the situation.”

I sweetly smiled.  “I don’t know what you mean.  I thought I was doing a good job of helping you with your problem.”

“Uh huh,” he said, a low chuckle slipping from him as he leaned back into the pillows.  His grip loosened a little around my hair, and softly combed his fingers through the silky strands; a moan falling from his lips when my tongue slowly slid up the base of his cock.

The loose grip on my hair became even tighter as I circled my tongue around the head, feeling like he was about to rip it out.  Tell me how I found that so incredibly hot? “Shit yes, sweetheart. Like that.”

“Did you think about it at all during the last two weeks?”

He sighed, my tongue sliding down over the tip, slowly sucking as my hand played with his balls.  “A few times.”

“Only a few?”

“Maybe a little more than a few.”

My lips slid down his hard cock and slowly bobbed my head, tongue running along the underside with every teasing stroke.  His fingers in my hair, the strong scent of him all around me, and those groans flowing from his mouth. All of it provoked me to keep going.  “What did you think about?” I asked, licking the small bead of pre-cum forming.

“Fuck, a lot of things.”

“Tell me,” my hand grabbing the base of his cock, slowly stroking as I looked down at the tongue softly licking his lips.  “I’m a big girl, you won’t scare me.”

I could feel the low groan he let out when I ran my tongue over his balls.  “Tie you up. Tease you. Spank you…”

“How, your hand or...ooh that belt you wore to the party.  That sounds kinda hot.”

“Sweetheart.  I’m glad you’re enthusiastic about all of this, but fuck I’m gonna cum if you keep talking like that while you’re blowing me.”

“Kind of the point, baby.”

“Not before I get inside you.  I love what you’re doing and all, but if you keep talking like that, I will grab you and fuck you into the mattress.”

“Hand tight around my throat?”

Quicker than I could let out my next breath, he grabbed my sides and went to push me on the bed, but was stopped when I put my hands up to his chest.

My laugh traveled over the large room.  “Ok ok, wait. I wanna ride you.”

A small grin settled on his lips as he laid back against the pillows and watched me climb over him.  Grabbing onto the base of his cock, I let out a long moan when I slowly dragged the swollen head over my wet mound, teasing it over my hard clit; a shiver wracking my body at the intense sensations.  “Almost forgot how amazing you felt.”

“Same here, sweetheart,” he said, a groan reverberating throughout his body when I gently slid down the length of him.  His hands caressed up my sides and massaged my breasts, thumbs circling over my erect nipples. Moans turned to whimpers, groans into a string of flowery, filthy words only uttered in the heat of passion.  He felt so full inside me, growing even harder than I thought he would.

We both caught our breath in between featherlight touches, and when I felt ready to move, I gently rolled my hips and leaned down to kiss him.  Pleasure shot through my body as our tongues and hips met; moans and breathy sighs mingling together between our connected lips. I never wanted this to end.  As much as wasn’t ready to admit I was truly in love just yet, I knew after tonight that I wouldn't be able to leave, especially not for two weeks. They say ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’.  For me at this moment, truer words were never spoken.

“Oh fuck yes, baby.  Please.”

The tip of his nose dragged down the column of my neck, teasing breaths intertwined with hard nips of his teeth over my delicate skin, surely leaving some kind of mark tomorrow.  I grabbed onto the headboard behind me, bouncing faster onto his cock; thighs trembling with every hard thrust downwards. His lips wrapped around a hardened nipple and circled his tongue before biting down and sucking softly, repeating the process to the other one.  Fingertips dug deep into my hips only enhanced the overwhelming pleasure we both seeked out. 

“Spank me,” I cried out, surprising even myself.  “Please.”

The sound of multiple hard smacks echoed over both the soft jazz melody and my whimpering moans.  I wanted more. I wanted the cheeks of my ass to burn, flushed the same color as the rest of my skin from the smoldering blood flowing at breakneck speed.  Tingling more than my beautifully bruised and kiss swollen lips; marks of ravenous teeth scattered all over them. Every hard slap had me crazy for more, desperate to figure out what else he had in store for me.

A few more hard thrusts and we both came in an explosion of shivers and stars, crashing as lips and tongues and teeth collided; slow rolls of our hips searching for every drop of intense pleasure left in our lust-addled bodies.  We laid there in silence, hands slowly memorizing every inch of skin as we tried desperate to hold onto every single second before sleep fell over both of us.

\~\~\~\~\~

My head hurt.  Fuck, I hate mornings.

I moved to rub my eyes and remembered where I was, who I was with, and suddenly my hatred of mornings evaporated quicker than the cool morning dew formed on the large bedroom windows.

“Morning,” I said, curling into him even more as I felt him waking up.

His lips kissed my temple, moaning when my thigh rested comfortably in between his legs.  “Good morning, sweetheart.” 

Wow, ok his voice could not be that hot this early in the morning.  The low moan, raspiness in his voice, and that endearing name made it difficult to think straight.  How can three little words turn my brain into utter mush. 

“Sorry, kind of not a morning person.”

“I remember that from the last time,” he said, a low chuckle teasing my ear.  “It’s ok. We didn’t get to sleep much.”

“It’ll get better soon.  What time is it anyway?”

He looked over my shoulder at the clock.  “6:26am.”

I groaned.  “No one should be up this early.”

Laughing at my fake agony, he wrapped his arms tighter around my waist and pulled me into him, calming kisses placed all down my neck.  The morning sun peeked through the closed curtains while birds chirped happily away in the cool morning air. Candles long burnt out have lost their scent, but I could still remember the spicy sweet smell as I stared back at them, willing myself back to sleep.

“I want to make this work with you,” I said, not really sure why I wanted to have a serious conversation before I even had my first cup of coffee.  Because that sounded like a great idea. “But the thought of a completely monogamous relationship right now doesn’t really appeal to me.”

I knew he was listening, even if I couldn’t actually see his face, so I took a deep breath and continued on.  “I’m bi. I love girls just as much as guys. I’m young, absolutely love sex and want to explore the beauty that it is.  It may include other people, or maybe just myself, but exploring all of it with you really does turns me on. I won’t force you, and I’ll understand if you don’t…”

“The thought of you with another girl, or playing with yourself for my viewing pleasure, or a whole host of other sexual activities.  I can’t even begin to explain how much *that* turns me on.

“I’m not saying I won’t ever want to settle down, but for now, I just want to explore.”

“And I’m willing to go along for the ride.  We’ll discuss the serious stuff when we get to that point.”

“You really would like to see me with another girl?”

“Don’t all guys have some sort of a threesome fantasy?  Or at the very least watching two girls together?”

“Yeah I guess you’re right.  Have you been with another guy?”

“Does that turn you on?”

I laughed.  “Ok, are we really playing twenty questions at 6:30 in the morning?”

“I’m game if you are,” he said, feeling the grin as he moved my hair to the side and gently kissed right at the back of my neck.

I turned around to face him, placing a chaste kiss on his lips.  “I think at some point we need to get up, but that does sound appealing.  I’m not drinking though.”

“I don’t need to get you drunk to get you in my bed, sweetheart.”

I blurted out a giggle, laughing even harder at his sad attempt at looking hurt.

“Ok, it wasn’t that cheesy.  Was it?”

“No no...well okay maybe a little.” I covered my mouth in an attempt to stop laughing. “It’s fine, I won’t tell anyone. But...sweetheart.”

“You like it?”

“Yeah,” I said, nodded as I curled up into him and closed my eyes. “Has a nice ring to it.”

“Good.  You’re going to be hearing it a lot from now on.”

I couldn’t hold back the wide smile that settled on my lips.  “Good.”"
8v6y4i,11,2018-06-30,Help Me Lose My Mind (The White Velvet Remix) [M/F] [Spanking] [Romantic],sinfulcaramel,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/8v6y4i/help_me_lose_my_mind_the_white_velvet_remix_mf/,"I met him at a house party on a random Saturday night two weeks ago.

Being invited by a good friend of mine, my plan was to go hang out with friends, have a couple of drinks, and maybe hook up with a random stranger for some much needed stress relief ahead of my exams.  And for the first hour or so, that’s exactly what happened. But...then I met him.

What started off as nice conversation under a gorgeous night sky with friends and a perfectly made gin and tonic, turned into an intense staring contest, then quickly escalated to a battle for control.  Twenty questions style. While I’d like to think I at least put up a good fight, in the end, I couldn’t resist the proverbial red string pulling both of us together.

We then proceeded to spend the next twelve or so hours together, experiencing a total sexual high I was certain I’d never experience again.  The next day, he kindly drove me home after a long leisurely Sunday morning of “getting to know each other” underneath an incredibly cozy, grey and white striped duvet.  The relatively long ride was spent chatting about any topic that came to mind, then made promises to call each other over intimate kisses and hungry bites to the lips.

Then I didn’t hear from him.  At all. Not even a text.

So you can see how it would be a bit of a shock when, at dinner with my visiting mother and sister, I walked back from the bathroom to find him standing at the restaurant entrance, casually shaking hands with three guys around his age.  The faint sound of his sultry laugh and his beautiful smile had me standing dead in my tracks, admiring the put-together but casual look of an untucked light blue oxford shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark wash jeans and polished dark brown boots.

My mind spun with how fast it was trying to process all the feelings running through it at that moment.  Anger, frustration, hurt, passion, lust...love?

The crashing waves of emotions made my heart race as I clenched my hands at my sides, watching the three guys he was with leave the restaurant.  My breath quickened as he turned to face me, and all the memories from that night drowned any comprehensible thought left in my brain. His eyes widened when I brushed past him, pushing open the restaurant’s heavy dark wood door and stepped out into the mild spring air.

I walked around the side of the all red brick Italian restaurant, trying desperately to control my emotions, even though the heat of his stare skimming over my back made me feel deliciously naked.  *No, not now.  Remember the past two weeks.*

I stopped in the small alleyway between the restaurant’s beautiful outdoor patio and a tall, glass office building.  Taking a deep breath to try and calm myself, I stared off into the distance; incredibly angry, but feeling ridiculous for leaving, wondering why I did any of it at all.  

It might’ve been the need for some air and to find a quiet place to gather my thoughts.  It might’ve been to force myself to get away from him, just to resist the greater urge to be as close to him as possible.  Or maybe I wasn’t thinking at all, and it was the first instinct my body latched onto that wasn’t just hauling off and punching him.

His footsteps were barely heard over the noisy rush hour traffic, and it had me jump a little when I felt his hand lightly turning me around to kiss me.  Slow and soft, but with so much passion that it made my eyes water with the pent-up frustration I’ve been harboring for the past two weeks. The warmth of his hand sliding over my skin-tight, white velvet dress scorched me as his fingers caressed the back of my neck, making me shiver with excitement.  The contrasting, tantalizing sensations only added to the frustration boiling deep inside me.

My hands slid up his chest, and I shoved him away from me, smacking him hard across the face.  After seeing the shocked look on his face, I wondered for a split second if the smack stung him just as much as it did my hand.  Then I remembered how much my heart ached for him the past two weeks, and suddenly my hand didn’t feel as bad.

“Two weeks,” I shouted.  “Two fucking weeks since that party.”

“Can I explain…”

“What’s there to explain?  You obviously didn’t feel the same way I did after that night.”

“You honestly can say that after the way I just fucking kissed you?”

“I believed it when you said you would call after you drove me home in the morning, and we spent...I don’t know...a good ten minutes in your car making out.  And look where we are now.”

“Oh come on,” he said, scoffing. “I…”

“You know,”  I said, never feeling so upset with someone before.  “I probably wouldn’t have minded if it was just one night.  If we both drank way too much, found somewhere quiet, and you screwed my brains out until we were both happy and satisfied.  Then we’d wake up, agree that it was just one night, and pretend like nothing ever happened between us. I would’ve been just fine with that.  But it wasn’t just that. Was it?”

He stood there staring at me, waiting for me to speak with a look of indignation on his face.  Good. He deserved it.

“We got to know each other the next morning.  We spoke about our lives, our families, our likes and dislikes, aspirations and fantasies,” I choked out in an unsteady voice.  “When you teased me with kisses as I rattled off all the things that turned me on. Then the incredible sex afterwards. I’d never felt so loved from anyone I’d ever been with before, let alone a person I’d just met less than twenty-four hours before.  It was slow and beautiful; completely opposite to the intense, rough sex we had during the party….”

“What about you?  I haven’t heard from you in two weeks.”

“Because you said you would fucking call!”

“And I can explain why I didn’t,” he sighed.  “But I’m not the only one who's guilty here. You easily could’ve called, but you left it up to me.”

The calm but firm tone in his voice had me flinch, stepping slightly backwards.  It made me even more frustrated that it wasn’t because I wasn’t afraid. “I wanted to call...”

“Don’t pull that ‘I wanted to call you, but I didn’t know if you liked me that way’ bullshit, I know you’re not like that.”  His piercing eyes stared down into mine as he waited for my answer. “Why didn’t you call?”

My back hit the red brick wall, the cool roughness of it jarring me out of my own thoughts as his hand trapped me in between his arm and the ivy lined cedar gate surrounding the outdoor patio.  Thankfully, the patio was closed for what looked to be an event later on tonight, so there wasn't anyone around to witness what was going on between us. Just rows and rows of square tables in the same slatted cedar as the pergola and matching chairs, topped with soft white cushions.  Pristine white table cloths covered some of the tables while others laid bare with just the chairs tipped over them. White string lights adorned the entire length of three walls enclosing the patio, creating an elegant and comfortable atmosphere for the family-owned Italian restaurant.

A sigh left my mouth when his eyebrow arched and waited patiently for my answer. Guess I wasn’t going to win this battle either.

“That night was hands down the best night I’ve had with anyone,” I said, my lips curling into a small smile.  “I never expected to leave the party with someone I actually wanted to see again. You and that night have been the only things on my mind for the past two weeks.  And that scared me. I have so much work and studying to do before my exams. You know it’s really hard to study when all you can think about is how good someone fucked you?”

The deep chuckle and the warm caress of his hand on my flushed cheek forced a shudder over my body.  His fingers brushed a stray tendril of hair behind my ear, and I couldn’t help but lean into his touch; detecting a bit of his wonderfully distinct scent mixed with the same cologne he wore that night.  “I think I can relate.”

“Then came the stress of whether I can pass my exams, on top of forcing myself not to think about you so I could concentrate, and then the wondering of ‘why hadn’t you called yet’ made me kind of a mess.”  I sighed when his fingers danced over the column of my neck. “I really wanted to call you. You don’t know how bad I wanted to hear your voice again.”

The small smile that formed on his lips made me let out an exhale I didn’t know I was holding in.  He leaned his head down and kissed me, his soft lips gliding over mine as his tongue easily slid between my parted lips.  The memory of his kisses that night had me biting back a moan when his lips left mine.

“So, what’s your excuse?”  I asked in a daze.

He laughed.  “Well, like you, I’ve also had projects and exams to prepare for.  I’ve also been busy looking into internships for the past month. Plus, I’ve had my little brother and two of my friends here for the past week, so that’s been taking up some of my time…”

“Ok ok,” I said, groaning at my own stupidity.  “I get it now. And I really am sorry for smacking you, it was just a gut reaction to all the frustration.  I swear I’m not really like that.”

The lights around the patio suddenly turned on as the spring sun began to set, casting a warm pink and orange glow all around us.  Distant sounds of car horns and random passersby mixed with the low strumming of a far off guitar had me leaning my head back against the wall, savoring the moment when lips softly kissed my forehead.

“Can we both agree that life got in the way?”

I slowly nodded, running my hand back up the soft cotton of his shirt to the back of his neck. “Kiss me,” I said low into the cool evening air.

He smiled and lightly caressed his hands up and down my sides.  A small moan slipped from my lips when he slowly pulled me into him and leaned down to kiss me.  Soft teasing kisses led way to rougher ones when my leg slid in between his. His arms squeezed harder and he let out a low moan as my bare thigh slid against the growing bulge pushing against his jeans.  Both of us in need of air, we both pulled away and his lips moved to kiss where my ear met my jaw, causing a half-hearted attempt by me to keep quiet.

“I need to get back to my table,” I said, sighing as his fingers played dangerously close to the hem of my dress.  “I’m still here with my family.”

His groan half made me want to skip the dinner.  And if it was anyone but my family, I just might’ve.  

“A glass of wine tonight?”  He said, lightly kissing my neck.  “At my place?”

A thoughtful hum left my lips.  “Just a glass of wine? I might need a little more than that to entice me to join you.  I could be studying instead.”

He bit my neck right under my ear, making me gasp and let out a small yelp.  “Is this enough to entice you, sweetheart?” He asked in that entrancing husky voice.

That’ll work. “I have to take my mother and sister to the airport, so about...ten?”

“That sounds good to me.”

\~\~\~\~\~

After we said our goodbyes, I went back in the restaurant and had a nice dinner with my family.  I apologized, quickly explaining how a friend I hadn’t seen in a while was having dinner here, and we ended up chatting for a few minutes.  I mean it wasn’t wrong, it just wouldn’t be proper dinner etiquette to explain how “that friend” and I hooked up at a party and we fucked pretty much the entire night.  After dinner, I took them to the airport and drove back to his house, conveniently finding it was only around a ten minute drive from mine.

The modern, dark brick townhouse sat identical to the other townhouses in the perfectly landscaped neighborhood.  A small and simple assortment of trees and shrubbery perfectly lined around the front of the house. My heart fluttered when I saw the familiar black SUV parked in the driveway, and thoughts of that night hazily drifted through my mind.  I let out a soft sigh as I got out of the car and made sure to lock it, knowing I wouldn’t be back anytime soon.

He answered the door in a loose fitting steel blue t-shirt and matching lounge pants. Really, no one should look this good in pajamas, thinking back to my pj shorts and worn-in, over-sized gymnastics t-shirts.  After greeting each other with a long kiss, I set my things on the small table near the front of the door, and he began showing me around his place.  The house was well decorated in various shades of brown, black and gold with dark leather furniture and a gorgeous stone fireplace already lit with a warm and cozy fire.  Most of all it was clean, which is more than I can say for some of the other guys I’ve dated.

“Do you mind if I use your bathroom?  Need to freshen up.”

“Not at all, take your time.  I’ll be down in the kitchen when you’re done.”

After a quick use of the bathroom and touching up my makeup, I passed by his bedroom again along the way back to the kitchen.  The bedroom had most of the same color scheme as the rest of the house, with a comfortable over-sized brown leather chair and matching ottoman in one of the corners, opposite the four king size mahogany poster bed.  The bed was covered in soft and cozy bedding with pillows perfectly positioned on the bed. The thing that caught my eye though was the shirt he was wearing haphazardly thrown onto the bed along with his jeans; the only out of place things in the otherwise immaculately clean room.

My bare feet carried me across the soft beige carpet to his bed, and I began taking off my dress, laying it on the bed next to his clothes. I slipped the thigh length shirt on and buttoned it up to the top two buttons, leaving only my white lace bra and panties on and showing a healthy amount of cleavage.  The shirt was so soft and smelled of him, making my head spin and my eyes close as I vaguely heard the light melodic flourish of a piano from the corner mounted speakers. The further I walked out of his room and downstairs to the kitchen, the more I began to hear the light jazz piano flowing all throughout the house.  

When I walked into the kitchen, his back was turned to me, walking over to the black steel double door fridge.  The large center island with a gorgeous dark and light brown granite countertop was the focal point of the kitchen, with a small and somewhat deep circular sink at the end of the island.  The other end had a bottle of Pinot Noir, two red wine glasses, and a small cheese board filled with various meats, cheeses and fruits. Yep, definitely not like the other guys I’ve dated.

“I’m just finishing up, go ahead and take a seat.”

I jumped up onto the counter next to everything and smiled when he turned around; lips curled into that sexy smirk I remembered all too well.  “I hope this is okay?” I asked, already knowing my answer.

“More than okay,” he said and walked over to me, skimming a finger over my thigh at the hem of his shirt.  “You look really good in my shirt.”

“I was a little warm and felt overdressed.  Wanted something more comfortable.”

He chuckled.  “Good choice.”

“Everything looks delicious.”

“Thank you,” he  poured me a glass of wine.  “Go ahead and help yourself.”

What felt like minutes was almost two hours sitting at his kitchen island, chatting about whatever came to our mind; what had been going on in the past two weeks to what we were currently watching and everything in between.  It was nice to know we can still have a normal conversation without reverting straight into sex, although it clearly was on both of our minds. One light touch turned into many teasing kisses, all while intimately feeding each other in the middle of the warmly dimmed kitchen.  

I plucked a small, red grape from the almost eaten bunch and playfully tossed it into my mouth, savoring the bittersweet taste.  “Never thought a one night stand might actually turn into something,” I laughed, surprised at the slight uneasiness that showed through it.

He hummed as he finished off his current glass of wine.  Neither of us were necessarily drunk, but we did lose count somewhere in the past two hours.  “Let’s start over.”

My eyebrows furrowed.

“No no,” he said, kissing my temple at the worried look on my face. “I don’t think I could ever forget that night.  What I meant was how about we take things slow, really get to know each other, and see where it goes. We don’t need to put pressure on it.”

I grabbed my glass and tilted my head back to finish the rest of my wine.  I’ve been in a few relationship and never had a terribly bad breakup. My parents are happily married of almost twenty-two years, and my sister was recently engaged to her high school sweetheart of nine years.  Despite all the happy relationships in my life, there was still something deep inside the pit of my stomach that made me nervous about committing to a relationship with him. But...I really wanted to try.

“I will accept your proposal, but I do have one very important stipulation.  This must be met if we can go forward with this matter.” Why am I such a dork sometimes?

His laugh sent a shiver down my spine.  Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. “Oh? And what’s that?”

“You are fucking me tonight.  And don’t worry, I’ll never forget that night.  I’m still reeling from it.”

He grabbed the glass I was anxiously playing with out of my hand and set it on the counter, his eyes never leaving mine.  “You really think you’re leaving here without me spreading you out on my bed, slowly eating you out as the sun rises though my windows?  Or sliding into you as those pretty nails dig into my back?”

“You know…” Damn, I could literally feel my cheeks reddened.  “The house tour was great and all, but I might need a more...in depth tour upstairs.  It was a little too quick for my liking.”

My lips wrapped around the plump strawberry he held to my mouth, biting it as leaned into my ear and whispered, “What kind of host would I be if I didn’t fulfill all of my guest’s requests.”

As we cleaned up the small mess we made, every sound sent shivers over my body; the click of plates and silverware, the open and close of the refrigerator, and the clink of the wine glasses as I neatly placed them in the drying rack.  Every single sound, every movement reminded me of his presence, of where I was, and it only served to both scare and excite me.

We then went around the house, making sure everything was off as our soft touches and playful gazes tempted us for what was to come.  The only semblance of light in his place came from the street lamps casting a dim, soft yellow glow through the closed curtains and the frosted panels of the dark wood front door.  I watched as his fingers turned the gold plated lock with ease, and smiled when he walked over and kissed me.

Warm lips caressed over mine.  Large hands slipped over my ass, pulling me closer to him while pushing me deeper against the cold, cream colored wall.  This fucking perfect song doing a number on my sanity, as the scent of him suffocated me in the best way possible. All of it tempting me to give into something I haven’t wanted at all in the last two years, and told myself I didn’t want for a very long time.  

“While I’m not opposed to fucking you against this wall,” he said, whispering into my ear and knocking me out of my dazed contemplation.  “Having you on my bed is all I’ve been thinking about since you knocked on my door.”

Breaking from my own thoughts, I pondered both scenarios for a second, then laced his fingers with mine and walked upstairs with him in tow.  I knew we would have plenty of other opportunities to fully explore every area of his house. “That thought might’ve skimmed my mind a few times,” I said, grinning when I felt his hand caress my hip as he opened his bedroom door.

I turned down the bedding and grabbed my dress, tossing it onto the armchair along with his jeans.  I sat back down on the incredibly soft bed and traced the intricate design of the posters as I watched him carefully light a few candles he had sitting on the dresser; the spicy scent of cinnamon wafting throughout the room.  “Maybe next time I’m over here, we could test out how sturdy these beams are?” I asked, waiting for his reaction as he turned to look at me. Sadly, the only thing I got out of him was a blank stare and the slightest hint of a raised eyebrow.

“Does it interest you?”

“A little.”  Amongst other things.  “Haven’t really delved into that scene, just some spanking when things got a little rough.”

“I don’t know whether to be a little jealous or really turned on,” he said, laughing as he closed the lights; casting the room in a warm, luminous glow.

“‘...The green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on’.”

“Don’t think I’ve ever had a girl quote Shakespeare right before getting into bed with me.”

“Re-reading the classics.”  I shrugged and reached out to gently run my hands down his chest.  “It was one of the more recent ones.”

“Don’t get me wrong, I loved it.”  A soft smile settled on his lips as he slid his fingers down my neck and over the first button, his eyes never leaving mine.  “I also absolutely loved watching you walk around in my shirt.”

“I’ll be sure to wear it again next time I’m over,” I said, grabbing the hem of his shirt and pulling it over his head.

Yep, definitely missed that dark stare and gorgeous smile.  “I’ll hold you to it, sweetheart.”

A trumpet played low through the speakers as I leaned in to his kiss.  His hands slowly unbuttoned and pulled the shirt hanging loosely on my body, dropping it onto the floor and immediately threading his fingers through my tousled hair.  Fuck I missed this. I missed him. A lot. Was I really going to admit that a real relationship could transpire with a guy I hooked up with at a house party? With every hungry kiss.  With every desperate touch. With every rough moan and sweet sigh moving between our lips, the more I was totally okay with admitting that.

I bit my swollen lip when he pulled away, wanting to feel more of that kiss on every inch of me.  His ragged breathing and rough hands ran up my sides, searing into my skin and mind, and causing me to shiver at the raw emotion that coursed through my heated body.  Needing more of him, I leaned up and kissed him, my hands grabbing the waistband of his pajama bottoms. “These need to go.”

He hummed in agreement, helping to take them off along with my panties, and threw them onto the chair.  My arms and legs instantly wrapped around him as he picked me up and laid me in the middle of the bed, feeling as if I was on a cloud when I sunk into the massive pile of soft pillows.  He pushed the covers down a bit, and I watched as he climbed into the bed, situating himself between my spread legs; a small smile on both our lips as we leaned into to continue our fervent kiss.  

Fingers traced down my thigh to the crook of my knee and he spread my legs further apart; the cool air hitting against my already wet pussy.  My eyes closed slightly and I laid back against the pillows, watching him bend down to slowly run his rough tongue over my clit, shivers wracking my body with every slow, teasing caress.  I couldn’t breath. Every breath, every suck of his lips, and every stroke of his tongue sent shocks of pleasure throughout my body. I slid my fingers through his hair, watching him slip two of his fingers inside me and went back to softly sucking on my clit.

Cars driving by and a distant honk of a horn as he curled his fingers upwards were muted by the loud moans I let out, my other hand moving to play with my breasts, feeling the all too familiar feeling of pleasure pooling deep inside me.  “Oh my...fuck, baby. I’m gonna cum.” My orgasm crashed over my body as I uttered those words, hips rolling and fingers grabbing onto his hair as I convulsed all around him. Jeez I think I could’ve cum again watching him slowly lick his fingers clean of my juices.  And that damn smirk was actually gonna kill me one day.

Not even giving him time to think, I pushed him onto his back and straddled him. Goosebumps formed all over my sensitive skin and I giggled, unable to contain my nervous excitement.  That night I fell to him, caught up in the web of lust he spun around me. Tonight, this wasn’t for me.  This was to show him how much I’ve missed him, how much I’ve thought about him these past two weeks. I kissed the crook of his neck, dragged my lips over his collarbone and down his chest, and stopped to run my tongue over his nipple. This was to show him that while I was still anxious about love and relationships, I was still willing to try.  Because it was him.

“You’re thinking about it?”

“What?”  He groaned when I softly bit the other nipple and continued my trek down his toned abs.  A large grin spread across my lips, glad to know I was able to throw him off at least a little for a change.

“Me tied up,” my tongue traced over every sharp line and felt his fingers thread through my hair.  “Tied to your bed. My body writhing all over these soft sheets as you tease and torture me until you’re completely satisfied, and I’m a withering mess of pent-up sexual frustration.”

Pain shot through my scalp when he grabbed a chunk of my hair and pulled; dark, hooded eyes staring straight into mine.  I could really get used to this.

I licked my lips, staring back at him behind dark eyelashes.  “I am too. Never thought I’d be really into it, but...yeah. I want it with you.”

“Let’s,” he let out a long sigh and closed his eyes.  “Let’s talk about this tomorrow. If we’re going to have this conversation, I want to be relatively coherent for it.  It’s hard to concentrate right now when all I want to do is fuck you, and you’re not helping the situation.”

I sweetly smiled.  “I don’t know what you mean.  I thought I was doing a good job of helping you with your problem.”

“Uh huh,” he said, a low chuckle slipping from him as he leaned back into the pillows.  His grip loosened a little around my hair, and softly combed his fingers through the silky strands; a moan falling from his lips when my tongue slowly slid up the base of his cock.

The loose grip on my hair became even tighter as I circled my tongue around the head, feeling like he was about to rip it out.  Tell me how I found that so incredibly hot? “Shit yes, sweetheart. Like that.”

“Did you think about it at all during the last two weeks?”

He sighed, my tongue sliding down over the tip, slowly sucking as my hand played with his balls.  “A few times.”

“Only a few?”

“Maybe a little more than a few.”

My lips slid down his hard cock and slowly bobbed my head, tongue running along the underside with every teasing stroke.  His fingers in my hair, the strong scent of him all around me, and those groans flowing from his mouth. All of it provoked me to keep going.  “What did you think about?” I asked, licking the small bead of pre-cum forming.

“Fuck, a lot of things.”

“Tell me,” my hand grabbing the base of his cock, slowly stroking as I looked down at the tongue softly licking his lips.  “I’m a big girl, you won’t scare me.”

I could feel the low groan he let out when I ran my tongue over his balls.  “Tie you up. Tease you. Spank you…”

“How, your hand or...ooh that belt you wore to the party.  That sounds kinda hot.”

“Sweetheart.  I’m glad you’re enthusiastic about all of this, but fuck I’m gonna cum if you keep talking like that while you’re blowing me.”

“Kind of the point, baby.”

“Not before I get inside you.  I love what you’re doing and all, but if you keep talking like that, I will grab you and fuck you into the mattress.”

“Hand tight around my throat?”

Quicker than I could let out my next breath, he grabbed my sides and went to push me on the bed, but was stopped when I put my hands up to his chest.

My laugh traveled over the large room.  “Ok ok, wait. I wanna ride you.”

A small grin settled on his lips as he laid back against the pillows and watched me climb over him.  Grabbing onto the base of his cock, I let out a long moan when I slowly dragged the swollen head over my wet mound, teasing it over my hard clit; a shiver wracking my body at the intense sensations.  “Almost forgot how amazing you felt.”

“Same here, sweetheart,” he said, a groan reverberating throughout his body when I gently slid down the length of him.  His hands caressed up my sides and massaged my breasts, thumbs circling over my erect nipples. Moans turned to whimpers, groans into a string of flowery, filthy words only uttered in the heat of passion.  He felt so full inside me, growing even harder than I thought he would.

We both caught our breath in between featherlight touches, and when I felt ready to move, I gently rolled my hips and leaned down to kiss him.  Pleasure shot through my body as our tongues and hips met; moans and breathy sighs mingling together between our connected lips. I never wanted this to end.  As much as wasn’t ready to admit I was truly in love just yet, I knew after tonight that I wouldn't be able to leave, especially not for two weeks. They say ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’.  For me at this moment, truer words were never spoken.

“Oh fuck yes, baby.  Please.”

The tip of his nose dragged down the column of my neck, teasing breaths intertwined with hard nips of his teeth over my delicate skin, surely leaving some kind of mark tomorrow.  I grabbed onto the headboard behind me, bouncing faster onto his cock; thighs trembling with every hard thrust downwards. His lips wrapped around a hardened nipple and circled his tongue before biting down and sucking softly, repeating the process to the other one.  Fingertips dug deep into my hips only enhanced the overwhelming pleasure we both seeked out.

“Spank me,” I cried out, surprising even myself.  “Please.”

The sound of multiple hard smacks echoed over both the soft jazz melody and my whimpering moans.  I wanted more. I wanted the cheeks of my ass to burn, flushed the same color as the rest of my skin from the smoldering blood flowing at breakneck speed.  Tingling more than my beautifully bruised and kiss swollen lips; marks of ravenous teeth scattered all over them. Every hard slap had me crazy for more, desperate to figure out what else he had in store for me.

A few more hard thrusts and we both came in an explosion of shivers and stars, crashing as lips and tongues and teeth collided; slow rolls of our hips searching for every drop of intense pleasure left in our lust-addled bodies.  We laid there in silence, hands slowly memorizing every inch of skin as we tried desperate to hold onto every single second before sleep fell over both of us.

\~\~\~\~\~

My head hurt.  Fuck, I hate mornings.

I moved to rub my eyes and remembered where I was, who I was with, and suddenly my hatred of mornings evaporated quicker than the cool morning dew formed on the large bedroom windows.

“Morning,” I said, curling into him even more as I felt him waking up.

His lips kissed my temple, moaning when my thigh rested comfortably in between his legs.  “Good morning, sweetheart.”

Wow, ok his voice could not be that hot this early in the morning.  The low moan, raspiness in his voice, and that endearing name made it difficult to think straight.  How can three little words turn my brain into utter mush.

“Sorry, kind of not a morning person.”

“I remember that from the last time,” he said, a low chuckle teasing my ear.  “It’s ok. We didn’t get to sleep much.”

“It’ll get better soon.  What time is it anyway?”

He looked over my shoulder at the clock.  “6:26am.”

I groaned.  “No one should be up this early.”

Laughing at my fake agony, he wrapped his arms tighter around my waist and pulled me into him, calming kisses placed all down my neck.  The morning sun peeked through the closed curtains while birds chirped happily away in the cool morning air. Candles long burnt out have lost their scent, but I could still remember the spicy sweet smell as I stared back at them, willing myself back to sleep.

“I want to make this work with you,” I said, not really sure why I wanted to have a serious conversation before I even had my first cup of coffee.  Because that sounded like a great idea. “But the thought of a completely monogamous relationship right now doesn’t really appeal to me.”

I knew he was listening, even if I couldn’t actually see his face, so I took a deep breath and continued on.  “I’m bi. I love girls just as much as guys. I’m young, absolutely love sex and want to explore the beauty that it is.  It may include other people, or maybe just myself, but exploring all of it with you really does turns me on. I won’t force you, and I’ll understand if you don’t…”

“The thought of you with another girl, or playing with yourself for my viewing pleasure, or a whole host of other sexual activities.  I can’t even begin to explain how much *that* turns me on.

“I’m not saying I won’t ever want to settle down, but for now, I just want to explore.”

“And I’m willing to go along for the ride.  We’ll discuss the serious stuff when we get to that point.”

“You really would like to see me with another girl?”

“Don’t all guys have some sort of a threesome fantasy?  Or at the very least watching two girls together?”

“Yeah I guess you’re right.  Have you been with another guy?”

“Does that turn you on?”

I laughed.  “Ok, are we really playing twenty questions at 6:30 in the morning?”

“I’m game if you are,” he said, feeling the grin as he moved my hair to the side and gently kissed right at the back of my neck.

I turned around to face him, placing a chaste kiss on his lips.  “I think at some point we need to get up, but that does sound appealing.  I’m not drinking though.”

“I don’t need to get you drunk to get you in my bed, sweetheart.”

I blurted out a giggle, laughing even harder at his sad attempt at looking hurt.

“Ok, it wasn’t that cheesy.  Was it?”

“No no...well okay maybe a little.” I covered my mouth in an attempt to stop laughing. “It’s fine, I won’t tell anyone. But...sweetheart.”

“You like it?”

“Yeah,” I said, nodded as I curled up into him and closed my eyes. “Has a nice ring to it.”

“Good.  You’re going to be hearing it a lot from now on.”

I couldn’t hold back the wide smile that settled on my lips.  “Good.”"
8v6y8w,23,2018-06-30,Help Me Lose My Mind (The White Velvet Remix) [M/F] [Spanking] [Romantic],sinfulcaramel,Erotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erotica/comments/8v6y8w/help_me_lose_my_mind_the_white_velvet_remix_mf/,"I met him at a house party on a random Saturday night two weeks ago.

Being invited by a good friend of mine, my plan was to go hang out with friends, have a couple of drinks, and maybe hook up with a random stranger for some much needed stress relief ahead of my exams.  And for the first hour or so, that’s exactly what happened. But...then I met him.

What started off as nice conversation under a gorgeous night sky with friends and a perfectly made gin and tonic, turned into an intense staring contest, then quickly escalated to a battle for control.  Twenty questions style. While I’d like to think I at least put up a good fight, in the end, I couldn’t resist the proverbial red string pulling both of us together.

We then proceeded to spend the next twelve or so hours together, experiencing a total sexual high I was certain I’d never experience again.  The next day, he kindly drove me home after a long leisurely Sunday morning of “getting to know each other” underneath an incredibly cozy, grey and white striped duvet.  The relatively long ride was spent chatting about any topic that came to mind, then made promises to call each other over intimate kisses and hungry bites to the lips.

Then I didn’t hear from him.  At all. Not even a text.

So you can see how it would be a bit of a shock when, at dinner with my visiting mother and sister, I walked back from the bathroom to find him standing at the restaurant entrance, casually shaking hands with three guys around his age.  The faint sound of his sultry laugh and his beautiful smile had me standing dead in my tracks, admiring the put-together but casual look of an untucked light blue oxford shirt with the sleeves rolled up, dark wash jeans and polished dark brown boots.

My mind spun with how fast it was trying to process all the feelings running through it at that moment.  Anger, frustration, hurt, passion, lust...love?

The crashing waves of emotions made my heart race as I clenched my hands at my sides, watching the three guys he was with leave the restaurant.  My breath quickened as he turned to face me, and all the memories from that night drowned any comprehensible thought left in my brain. His eyes widened when I brushed past him, pushing open the restaurant’s heavy dark wood door and stepped out into the mild spring air.

I walked around the side of the all red brick Italian restaurant, trying desperately to control my emotions, even though the heat of his stare skimming over my back made me feel deliciously naked.  *No, not now.  Remember the past two weeks.*

I stopped in the small alleyway between the restaurant’s beautiful outdoor patio and a tall, glass office building.  Taking a deep breath to try and calm myself, I stared off into the distance; incredibly angry, but feeling ridiculous for leaving, wondering why I did any of it at all.  

It might’ve been the need for some air and to find a quiet place to gather my thoughts.  It might’ve been to force myself to get away from him, just to resist the greater urge to be as close to him as possible.  Or maybe I wasn’t thinking at all, and it was the first instinct my body latched onto that wasn’t just hauling off and punching him.

His footsteps were barely heard over the noisy rush hour traffic, and it had me jump a little when I felt his hand lightly turning me around to kiss me.  Slow and soft, but with so much passion that it made my eyes water with the pent-up frustration I’ve been harboring for the past two weeks. The warmth of his hand sliding over my skin-tight, white velvet dress scorched me as his fingers caressed the back of my neck, making me shiver with excitement.  The contrasting, tantalizing sensations only added to the frustration boiling deep inside me.

My hands slid up his chest, and I shoved him away from me, smacking him hard across the face.  After seeing the shocked look on his face, I wondered for a split second if the smack stung him just as much as it did my hand.  Then I remembered how much my heart ached for him the past two weeks, and suddenly my hand didn’t feel as bad.

“Two weeks,” I shouted.  “Two fucking weeks since that party.”

“Can I explain…”

“What’s there to explain?  You obviously didn’t feel the same way I did after that night.”

“You honestly can say that after the way I just fucking kissed you?”

“I believed it when you said you would call after you drove me home in the morning, and we spent...I don’t know...a good ten minutes in your car making out.  And look where we are now.”

“Oh come on,” he said, scoffing. “I…”

“You know,”  I said, never feeling so upset with someone before.  “I probably wouldn’t have minded if it was just one night.  If we both drank way too much, found somewhere quiet, and you screwed my brains out until we were both happy and satisfied.  Then we’d wake up, agree that it was just one night, and pretend like nothing ever happened between us. I would’ve been just fine with that.  But it wasn’t just that. Was it?”

He stood there staring at me, waiting for me to speak with a look of indignation on his face.  Good. He deserved it.

“We got to know each other the next morning.  We spoke about our lives, our families, our likes and dislikes, aspirations and fantasies,” I choked out in an unsteady voice.  “When you teased me with kisses as I rattled off all the things that turned me on. Then the incredible sex afterwards. I’d never felt so loved from anyone I’d ever been with before, let alone a person I’d just met less than twenty-four hours before.  It was slow and beautiful; completely opposite to the intense, rough sex we had during the party….”

“What about you?  I haven’t heard from you in two weeks.”

“Because you said you would fucking call!”

“And I can explain why I didn’t,” he sighed.  “But I’m not the only one who's guilty here. You easily could’ve called, but you left it up to me.”

The calm but firm tone in his voice had me flinch, stepping slightly backwards.  It made me even more frustrated that it wasn’t because I wasn’t afraid. “I wanted to call...”

“Don’t pull that ‘I wanted to call you, but I didn’t know if you liked me that way’ bullshit, I know you’re not like that.”  His piercing eyes stared down into mine as he waited for my answer. “Why didn’t you call?”

My back hit the red brick wall, the cool roughness of it jarring me out of my own thoughts as his hand trapped me in between his arm and the ivy lined cedar gate surrounding the outdoor patio.  Thankfully, the patio was closed for what looked to be an event later on tonight, so there wasn't anyone around to witness what was going on between us. Just rows and rows of square tables in the same slatted cedar as the pergola and matching chairs, topped with soft white cushions.  Pristine white table cloths covered some of the tables while others laid bare with just the chairs tipped over them. White string lights adorned the entire length of three walls enclosing the patio, creating an elegant and comfortable atmosphere for the family-owned Italian restaurant.

A sigh left my mouth when his eyebrow arched and waited patiently for my answer. Guess I wasn’t going to win this battle either.

“That night was hands down the best night I’ve had with anyone,” I said, my lips curling into a small smile.  “I never expected to leave the party with someone I actually wanted to see again. You and that night have been the only things on my mind for the past two weeks.  And that scared me. I have so much work and studying to do before my exams. You know it’s really hard to study when all you can think about is how good someone fucked you?”

The deep chuckle and the warm caress of his hand on my flushed cheek forced a shudder over my body.  His fingers brushed a stray tendril of hair behind my ear, and I couldn’t help but lean into his touch; detecting a bit of his wonderfully distinct scent mixed with the same cologne he wore that night.  “I think I can relate.”

“Then came the stress of whether I can pass my exams, on top of forcing myself not to think about you so I could concentrate, and then the wondering of ‘why hadn’t you called yet’ made me kind of a mess.”  I sighed when his fingers danced over the column of my neck. “I really wanted to call you. You don’t know how bad I wanted to hear your voice again.”

The small smile that formed on his lips made me let out an exhale I didn’t know I was holding in.  He leaned his head down and kissed me, his soft lips gliding over mine as his tongue easily slid between my parted lips.  The memory of his kisses that night had me biting back a moan when his lips left mine.

“So, what’s your excuse?”  I asked in a daze.

He laughed.  “Well, like you, I’ve also had projects and exams to prepare for.  I’ve also been busy looking into internships for the past month. Plus, I’ve had my little brother and two of my friends here for the past week, so that’s been taking up some of my time…”

“Ok ok,” I said, groaning at my own stupidity.  “I get it now. And I really am sorry for smacking you, it was just a gut reaction to all the frustration.  I swear I’m not really like that.”

The lights around the patio suddenly turned on as the spring sun began to set, casting a warm pink and orange glow all around us.  Distant sounds of car horns and random passersby mixed with the low strumming of a far off guitar had me leaning my head back against the wall, savoring the moment when lips softly kissed my forehead.

“Can we both agree that life got in the way?”

I slowly nodded, running my hand back up the soft cotton of his shirt to the back of his neck. “Kiss me,” I said low into the cool evening air.

He smiled and lightly caressed his hands up and down my sides.  A small moan slipped from my lips when he slowly pulled me into him and leaned down to kiss me.  Soft teasing kisses led way to rougher ones when my leg slid in between his. His arms squeezed harder and he let out a low moan as my bare thigh slid against the growing bulge pushing against his jeans.  Both of us in need of air, we both pulled away and his lips moved to kiss where my ear met my jaw, causing a half-hearted attempt by me to keep quiet.

“I need to get back to my table,” I said, sighing as his fingers played dangerously close to the hem of my dress.  “I’m still here with my family.”

His groan half made me want to skip the dinner.  And if it was anyone but my family, I just might’ve.  

“A glass of wine tonight?”  He said, lightly kissing my neck.  “At my place?”

A thoughtful hum left my lips.  “Just a glass of wine? I might need a little more than that to entice me to join you.  I could be studying instead.”

He bit my neck right under my ear, making me gasp and let out a small yelp.  “Is this enough to entice you, sweetheart?” He asked in that entrancing husky voice.

That’ll work. “I have to take my mother and sister to the airport, so about...ten?”

“That sounds good to me.”

\~\~\~\~\~

After we said our goodbyes, I went back in the restaurant and had a nice dinner with my family.  I apologized, quickly explaining how a friend I hadn’t seen in a while was having dinner here, and we ended up chatting for a few minutes.  I mean it wasn’t wrong, it just wouldn’t be proper dinner etiquette to explain how “that friend” and I hooked up at a party and we fucked pretty much the entire night.  After dinner, I took them to the airport and drove back to his house, conveniently finding it was only around a ten minute drive from mine.

The modern, dark brick townhouse sat identical to the other townhouses in the perfectly landscaped neighborhood.  A small and simple assortment of trees and shrubbery perfectly lined around the front of the house. My heart fluttered when I saw the familiar black SUV parked in the driveway, and thoughts of that night hazily drifted through my mind.  I let out a soft sigh as I got out of the car and made sure to lock it, knowing I wouldn’t be back anytime soon.

He answered the door in a loose fitting steel blue t-shirt and matching lounge pants. Really, no one should look this good in pajamas, thinking back to my pj shorts and worn-in, over-sized gymnastics t-shirts.  After greeting each other with a long kiss, I set my things on the small table near the front of the door, and he began showing me around his place.  The house was well decorated in various shades of brown, black and gold with dark leather furniture and a gorgeous stone fireplace already lit with a warm and cozy fire.  Most of all it was clean, which is more than I can say for some of the other guys I’ve dated.

“Do you mind if I use your bathroom?  Need to freshen up.”

“Not at all, take your time.  I’ll be down in the kitchen when you’re done.”

After a quick use of the bathroom and touching up my makeup, I passed by his bedroom again along the way back to the kitchen.  The bedroom had most of the same color scheme as the rest of the house, with a comfortable over-sized brown leather chair and matching ottoman in one of the corners, opposite the four king size mahogany poster bed.  The bed was covered in soft and cozy bedding with pillows perfectly positioned on the bed. The thing that caught my eye though was the shirt he was wearing haphazardly thrown onto the bed along with his jeans; the only out of place things in the otherwise immaculately clean room.

My bare feet carried me across the soft beige carpet to his bed, and I began taking off my dress, laying it on the bed next to his clothes. I slipped the thigh length shirt on and buttoned it up to the top two buttons, leaving only my white lace bra and panties on and showing a healthy amount of cleavage.  The shirt was so soft and smelled of him, making my head spin and my eyes close as I vaguely heard the light melodic flourish of a piano from the corner mounted speakers. The further I walked out of his room and downstairs to the kitchen, the more I began to hear the light jazz piano flowing all throughout the house.  

When I walked into the kitchen, his back was turned to me, walking over to the black steel double door fridge.  The large center island with a gorgeous dark and light brown granite countertop was the focal point of the kitchen, with a small and somewhat deep circular sink at the end of the island.  The other end had a bottle of Pinot Noir, two red wine glasses, and a small cheese board filled with various meats, cheeses and fruits. Yep, definitely not like the other guys I’ve dated.

“I’m just finishing up, go ahead and take a seat.”

I jumped up onto the counter next to everything and smiled when he turned around; lips curled into that sexy smirk I remembered all too well.  “I hope this is okay?” I asked, already knowing my answer.

“More than okay,” he said and walked over to me, skimming a finger over my thigh at the hem of his shirt.  “You look really good in my shirt.”

“I was a little warm and felt overdressed.  Wanted something more comfortable.”

He chuckled.  “Good choice.”

“Everything looks delicious.”

“Thank you,” he  poured me a glass of wine.  “Go ahead and help yourself.”

What felt like minutes was almost two hours sitting at his kitchen island, chatting about whatever came to our mind; what had been going on in the past two weeks to what we were currently watching and everything in between.  It was nice to know we can still have a normal conversation without reverting straight into sex, although it clearly was on both of our minds. One light touch turned into many teasing kisses, all while intimately feeding each other in the middle of the warmly dimmed kitchen.  

I plucked a small, red grape from the almost eaten bunch and playfully tossed it into my mouth, savoring the bittersweet taste.  “Never thought a one night stand might actually turn into something,” I laughed, surprised at the slight uneasiness that showed through it.

He hummed as he finished off his current glass of wine.  Neither of us were necessarily drunk, but we did lose count somewhere in the past two hours.  “Let’s start over.”

My eyebrows furrowed.

“No no,” he said, kissing my temple at the worried look on my face. “I don’t think I could ever forget that night.  What I meant was how about we take things slow, really get to know each other, and see where it goes. We don’t need to put pressure on it.”

I grabbed my glass and tilted my head back to finish the rest of my wine.  I’ve been in a few relationship and never had a terribly bad breakup. My parents are happily married of almost twenty-two years, and my sister was recently engaged to her high school sweetheart of nine years.  Despite all the happy relationships in my life, there was still something deep inside the pit of my stomach that made me nervous about committing to a relationship with him. But...I really wanted to try.

“I will accept your proposal, but I do have one very important stipulation.  This must be met if we can go forward with this matter.” Why am I such a dork sometimes?

His laugh sent a shiver down my spine.  Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. “Oh? And what’s that?”

“You are fucking me tonight.  And don’t worry, I’ll never forget that night.  I’m still reeling from it.”

He grabbed the glass I was anxiously playing with out of my hand and set it on the counter, his eyes never leaving mine.  “You really think you’re leaving here without me spreading you out on my bed, slowly eating you out as the sun rises though my windows?  Or sliding into you as those pretty nails dig into my back?”

“You know…” Damn, I could literally feel my cheeks reddened.  “The house tour was great and all, but I might need a more...in depth tour upstairs.  It was a little too quick for my liking.”

My lips wrapped around the plump strawberry he held to my mouth, biting it as leaned into my ear and whispered, “What kind of host would I be if I didn’t fulfill all of my guest’s requests.”

As we cleaned up the small mess we made, every sound sent shivers over my body; the click of plates and silverware, the open and close of the refrigerator, and the clink of the wine glasses as I neatly placed them in the drying rack.  Every single sound, every movement reminded me of his presence, of where I was, and it only served to both scare and excite me.

We then went around the house, making sure everything was off as our soft touches and playful gazes tempted us for what was to come.  The only semblance of light in his place came from the street lamps casting a dim, soft yellow glow through the closed curtains and the frosted panels of the dark wood front door.  I watched as his fingers turned the gold plated lock with ease, and smiled when he walked over and kissed me.

Warm lips caressed over mine.  Large hands slipped over my ass, pulling me closer to him while pushing me deeper against the cold, cream colored wall.  This fucking perfect song doing a number on my sanity, as the scent of him suffocated me in the best way possible. All of it tempting me to give into something I haven’t wanted at all in the last two years, and told myself I didn’t want for a very long time.  

“While I’m not opposed to fucking you against this wall,” he said, whispering into my ear and knocking me out of my dazed contemplation.  “Having you on my bed is all I’ve been thinking about since you knocked on my door.”

Breaking from my own thoughts, I pondered both scenarios for a second, then laced his fingers with mine and walked upstairs with him in tow.  I knew we would have plenty of other opportunities to fully explore every area of his house. “That thought might’ve skimmed my mind a few times,” I said, grinning when I felt his hand caress my hip as he opened his bedroom door.

I turned down the bedding and grabbed my dress, tossing it onto the armchair along with his jeans.  I sat back down on the incredibly soft bed and traced the intricate design of the posters as I watched him carefully light a few candles he had sitting on the dresser; the spicy scent of cinnamon wafting throughout the room.  “Maybe next time I’m over here, we could test out how sturdy these beams are?” I asked, waiting for his reaction as he turned to look at me. Sadly, the only thing I got out of him was a blank stare and the slightest hint of a raised eyebrow.

“Does it interest you?”

“A little.”  Amongst other things.  “Haven’t really delved into that scene, just some spanking when things got a little rough.”

“I don’t know whether to be a little jealous or really turned on,” he said, laughing as he closed the lights; casting the room in a warm, luminous glow.

“‘...The green-eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on’.”

“Don’t think I’ve ever had a girl quote Shakespeare right before getting into bed with me.”

“Re-reading the classics.”  I shrugged and reached out to gently run my hands down his chest.  “It was one of the more recent ones.”

“Don’t get me wrong, I loved it.”  A soft smile settled on his lips as he slid his fingers down my neck and over the first button, his eyes never leaving mine.  “I also absolutely loved watching you walk around in my shirt.”

“I’ll be sure to wear it again next time I’m over,” I said, grabbing the hem of his shirt and pulling it over his head.

Yep, definitely missed that dark stare and gorgeous smile.  “I’ll hold you to it, sweetheart.”

A trumpet played low through the speakers as I leaned in to his kiss.  His hands slowly unbuttoned and pulled the shirt hanging loosely on my body, dropping it onto the floor and immediately threading his fingers through my tousled hair.  Fuck I missed this. I missed him. A lot. Was I really going to admit that a real relationship could transpire with a guy I hooked up with at a house party? With every hungry kiss.  With every desperate touch. With every rough moan and sweet sigh moving between our lips, the more I was totally okay with admitting that.

I bit my swollen lip when he pulled away, wanting to feel more of that kiss on every inch of me.  His ragged breathing and rough hands ran up my sides, searing into my skin and mind, and causing me to shiver at the raw emotion that coursed through my heated body.  Needing more of him, I leaned up and kissed him, my hands grabbing the waistband of his pajama bottoms. “These need to go.”

He hummed in agreement, helping to take them off along with my panties, and threw them onto the chair.  My arms and legs instantly wrapped around him as he picked me up and laid me in the middle of the bed, feeling as if I was on a cloud when I sunk into the massive pile of soft pillows.  He pushed the covers down a bit, and I watched as he climbed into the bed, situating himself between my spread legs; a small smile on both our lips as we leaned into to continue our fervent kiss.  

Fingers traced down my thigh to the crook of my knee and he spread my legs further apart; the cool air hitting against my already wet pussy.  My eyes closed slightly and I laid back against the pillows, watching him bend down to slowly run his rough tongue over my clit, shivers wracking my body with every slow, teasing caress.  I couldn’t breath. Every breath, every suck of his lips, and every stroke of his tongue sent shocks of pleasure throughout my body. I slid my fingers through his hair, watching him slip two of his fingers inside me and went back to softly sucking on my clit.

Cars driving by and a distant honk of a horn as he curled his fingers upwards were muted by the loud moans I let out, my other hand moving to play with my breasts, feeling the all too familiar feeling of pleasure pooling deep inside me.  “Oh my...fuck, baby. I’m gonna cum.” My orgasm crashed over my body as I uttered those words, hips rolling and fingers grabbing onto his hair as I convulsed all around him. Jeez I think I could’ve cum again watching him slowly lick his fingers clean of my juices.  And that damn smirk was actually gonna kill me one day.

Not even giving him time to think, I pushed him onto his back and straddled him. Goosebumps formed all over my sensitive skin and I giggled, unable to contain my nervous excitement.  That night I fell to him, caught up in the web of lust he spun around me. Tonight, this wasn’t for me.  This was to show him how much I’ve missed him, how much I’ve thought about him these past two weeks. I kissed the crook of his neck, dragged my lips over his collarbone and down his chest, and stopped to run my tongue over his nipple. This was to show him that while I was still anxious about love and relationships, I was still willing to try.  Because it was him.

“You’re thinking about it?”

“What?”  He groaned when I softly bit the other nipple and continued my trek down his toned abs.  A large grin spread across my lips, glad to know I was able to throw him off at least a little for a change.

“Me tied up,” my tongue traced over every sharp line and felt his fingers thread through my hair.  “Tied to your bed. My body writhing all over these soft sheets as you tease and torture me until you’re completely satisfied, and I’m a withering mess of pent-up sexual frustration.”

Pain shot through my scalp when he grabbed a chunk of my hair and pulled; dark, hooded eyes staring straight into mine.  I could really get used to this.

I licked my lips, staring back at him behind dark eyelashes.  “I am too. Never thought I’d be really into it, but...yeah. I want it with you.”

“Let’s,” he let out a long sigh and closed his eyes.  “Let’s talk about this tomorrow. If we’re going to have this conversation, I want to be relatively coherent for it.  It’s hard to concentrate right now when all I want to do is fuck you, and you’re not helping the situation.”

I sweetly smiled.  “I don’t know what you mean.  I thought I was doing a good job of helping you with your problem.”

“Uh huh,” he said, a low chuckle slipping from him as he leaned back into the pillows.  His grip loosened a little around my hair, and softly combed his fingers through the silky strands; a moan falling from his lips when my tongue slowly slid up the base of his cock.

The loose grip on my hair became even tighter as I circled my tongue around the head, feeling like he was about to rip it out.  Tell me how I found that so incredibly hot? “Shit yes, sweetheart. Like that.”

“Did you think about it at all during the last two weeks?”

He sighed, my tongue sliding down over the tip, slowly sucking as my hand played with his balls.  “A few times.”

“Only a few?”

“Maybe a little more than a few.”

My lips slid down his hard cock and slowly bobbed my head, tongue running along the underside with every teasing stroke.  His fingers in my hair, the strong scent of him all around me, and those groans flowing from his mouth. All of it provoked me to keep going.  “What did you think about?” I asked, licking the small bead of pre-cum forming.

“Fuck, a lot of things.”

“Tell me,” my hand grabbing the base of his cock, slowly stroking as I looked down at the tongue softly licking his lips.  “I’m a big girl, you won’t scare me.”

I could feel the low groan he let out when I ran my tongue over his balls.  “Tie you up. Tease you. Spank you…”

“How, your hand or...ooh that belt you wore to the party.  That sounds kinda hot.”

“Sweetheart.  I’m glad you’re enthusiastic about all of this, but fuck I’m gonna cum if you keep talking like that while you’re blowing me.”

“Kind of the point, baby.”

“Not before I get inside you.  I love what you’re doing and all, but if you keep talking like that, I will grab you and fuck you into the mattress.”

“Hand tight around my throat?”

Quicker than I could let out my next breath, he grabbed my sides and went to push me on the bed, but was stopped when I put my hands up to his chest.

My laugh traveled over the large room.  “Ok ok, wait. I wanna ride you.”

A small grin settled on his lips as he laid back against the pillows and watched me climb over him.  Grabbing onto the base of his cock, I let out a long moan when I slowly dragged the swollen head over my wet mound, teasing it over my hard clit; a shiver wracking my body at the intense sensations.  “Almost forgot how amazing you felt.”

“Same here, sweetheart,” he said, a groan reverberating throughout his body when I gently slid down the length of him.  His hands caressed up my sides and massaged my breasts, thumbs circling over my erect nipples. Moans turned to whimpers, groans into a string of flowery, filthy words only uttered in the heat of passion.  He felt so full inside me, growing even harder than I thought he would.

We both caught our breath in between featherlight touches, and when I felt ready to move, I gently rolled my hips and leaned down to kiss him.  Pleasure shot through my body as our tongues and hips met; moans and breathy sighs mingling together between our connected lips. I never wanted this to end.  As much as wasn’t ready to admit I was truly in love just yet, I knew after tonight that I wouldn't be able to leave, especially not for two weeks. They say ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’.  For me at this moment, truer words were never spoken.

“Oh fuck yes, baby.  Please.”

The tip of his nose dragged down the column of my neck, teasing breaths intertwined with hard nips of his teeth over my delicate skin, surely leaving some kind of mark tomorrow.  I grabbed onto the headboard behind me, bouncing faster onto his cock; thighs trembling with every hard thrust downwards. His lips wrapped around a hardened nipple and circled his tongue before biting down and sucking softly, repeating the process to the other one.  Fingertips dug deep into my hips only enhanced the overwhelming pleasure we both seeked out.

“Spank me,” I cried out, surprising even myself.  “Please.”

The sound of multiple hard smacks echoed over both the soft jazz melody and my whimpering moans.  I wanted more. I wanted the cheeks of my ass to burn, flushed the same color as the rest of my skin from the smoldering blood flowing at breakneck speed.  Tingling more than my beautifully bruised and kiss swollen lips; marks of ravenous teeth scattered all over them. Every hard slap had me crazy for more, desperate to figure out what else he had in store for me.

A few more hard thrusts and we both came in an explosion of shivers and stars, crashing as lips and tongues and teeth collided; slow rolls of our hips searching for every drop of intense pleasure left in our lust-addled bodies.  We laid there in silence, hands slowly memorizing every inch of skin as we tried desperate to hold onto every single second before sleep fell over both of us.

\~\~\~\~\~

My head hurt.  Fuck, I hate mornings.

I moved to rub my eyes and remembered where I was, who I was with, and suddenly my hatred of mornings evaporated quicker than the cool morning dew formed on the large bedroom windows.

“Morning,” I said, curling into him even more as I felt him waking up.

His lips kissed my temple, moaning when my thigh rested comfortably in between his legs.  “Good morning, sweetheart.”

Wow, ok his voice could not be that hot this early in the morning.  The low moan, raspiness in his voice, and that endearing name made it difficult to think straight.  How can three little words turn my brain into utter mush.

“Sorry, kind of not a morning person.”

“I remember that from the last time,” he said, a low chuckle teasing my ear.  “It’s ok. We didn’t get to sleep much.”

“It’ll get better soon.  What time is it anyway?”

He looked over my shoulder at the clock.  “6:26am.”

I groaned.  “No one should be up this early.”

Laughing at my fake agony, he wrapped his arms tighter around my waist and pulled me into him, calming kisses placed all down my neck.  The morning sun peeked through the closed curtains while birds chirped happily away in the cool morning air. Candles long burnt out have lost their scent, but I could still remember the spicy sweet smell as I stared back at them, willing myself back to sleep.

“I want to make this work with you,” I said, not really sure why I wanted to have a serious conversation before I even had my first cup of coffee.  Because that sounded like a great idea. “But the thought of a completely monogamous relationship right now doesn’t really appeal to me.”

I knew he was listening, even if I couldn’t actually see his face, so I took a deep breath and continued on.  “I’m bi. I love girls just as much as guys. I’m young, absolutely love sex and want to explore the beauty that it is.  It may include other people, or maybe just myself, but exploring all of it with you really does turns me on. I won’t force you, and I’ll understand if you don’t…”

“The thought of you with another girl, or playing with yourself for my viewing pleasure, or a whole host of other sexual activities.  I can’t even begin to explain how much *that* turns me on.

“I’m not saying I won’t ever want to settle down, but for now, I just want to explore.”

“And I’m willing to go along for the ride.  We’ll discuss the serious stuff when we get to that point.”

“You really would like to see me with another girl?”

“Don’t all guys have some sort of a threesome fantasy?  Or at the very least watching two girls together?”

“Yeah I guess you’re right.  Have you been with another guy?”

“Does that turn you on?”

I laughed.  “Ok, are we really playing twenty questions at 6:30 in the morning?”

“I’m game if you are,” he said, feeling the grin as he moved my hair to the side and gently kissed right at the back of my neck.

I turned around to face him, placing a chaste kiss on his lips.  “I think at some point we need to get up, but that does sound appealing.  I’m not drinking though.”

“I don’t need to get you drunk to get you in my bed, sweetheart.”

I blurted out a giggle, laughing even harder at his sad attempt at looking hurt.

“Ok, it wasn’t that cheesy.  Was it?”

“No no...well okay maybe a little.” I covered my mouth in an attempt to stop laughing. “It’s fine, I won’t tell anyone. But...sweetheart.”

“You like it?”

“Yeah,” I said, nodded as I curled up into him and closed my eyes. “Has a nice ring to it.”

“Good.  You’re going to be hearing it a lot from now on.”

I couldn’t hold back the wide smile that settled on my lips.  “Good.”"

8v71zt,32,2018-06-30,To Binge and She's My Collar: My Last Relationship.,ClockworkNite,gorillaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gorillaz/comments/8v71zt/to_binge_and_shes_my_collar_my_last_relationship/,"I’ve thought about this for a while now and I feel like it’s time to share. I guess this is a way for me to release my pent up emotions. Mods, if you don't like this sort of thing on here, I'll delete it. Without further ado, this is how the songs To Binge and She’s My Collar helped me realize I was destroying myself. 

 In 2015 I entered a long distance relationship with a person I’ll call K. She and I were madly in love and before anyone asks, yes, she was real, we verified this multiple times. The first year was amazing and we always found things to do. We watched cartoons, played Steam games together, talked about movies and our everyday lives. It wasn’t always perfect though.  

K had PTSD from a past relationship that still haunted her to this day. After the first year together she started vanishing for periods of time with her trauma coming back. She spoke with me, clearly upset with herself and asking me to leave her out of fear of her hurting me. I refused to do so, telling her I’d wait while she recovered.  Her absences continued, and I always sent encouraging texts in hopes she’d find some comfort. The next time I saw her was four months later, having acquired a service dog. She went back to her recovery later. But as this continued, I became nervous and worrysome for her sake, thinking the worst had happened, that she killed herself or shut away from everyone entirely. Year Two left me a nervous wreck.  

In May of 2017 we had a nice talk and catch up, making plans to do something that night. It never came.  At this point I had been getting deep into Plastic Beach and the song To Binge clicked with me.  

""I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half and all I want is 

Someone to rely on as 

Thunder comes a rolling down 

Someone to rely on as 

Lightning comes a staring in again""  

First, this verse filled my mind with 'what if she hates me? I'm so far from her, I can't help her, and she'll think I'm powerless to help.' And then Damon's vocals:

I'll wait to be forgiven 

Maybe I never will 

My star has left me 

To take the bitter pill 

That shattered feeling 

Well the cause of it's a lesson learned 

Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again 

Just don't know if I could do it all again she said, it's true  

This was me, I was blaming myself for this and I didn't know if I could go back to the way things were again if she did up and never come back.  

Damon's next verse: 

I'm caught again in the mystery 

You're by my side, but are you still with me? 

The answer's somewhere deep in it, I'm sorry but your feeling it 

But I just have to tell you that I love you so much these days 

Have to tell you that I love you so much these days, it's true  

I was asking myself if she still loved me and if I still felt the same after so long. This was tearing me apart. I accepted I had several issues but didn't know how to act on them. I poured my frustrations into my schoolwork. At this point I was in my senior year of school working on a final project. Part of the final was to focus on your flaws and how you can overcome them, so I spoke with how relationships can be taxing on me and the advice I received was to find what you expect in a relationship and find a mutual understanding.  To me I realized that I was putting all this pressure on myself for no reason and I had to focus on the now.  She was gone, and I shouldn't worry. I had no power to change it.

My heart is in economy 

Due to this autonomy 

I'm rolling in and caught again  

It was time for me to stop and focus on myself. And it worked. My work ethic increased, my attitude had never been better, I felt on top of things and rest of the year went by smoothly. I had even started going out with friends more and increasing my social life through meeting people at conventions and playing D&amp;D with friends. Heck I even got involved with helping some mutuals through some difficult problems as a middleman and/or outlet for their troubles.  
And during that time, I met someone. I will refer to her as R. R and I met through a mutual friend and we hit it off with similar interests, anime, superheroes, cartoons, etc. We even formed a kickass D&amp;D duo. Over four months we became close and developed an attraction but I felt I wasn't ready.  

Then this past April, after 11 months without a word, K came back.   

At this point I had been obsessing over Humanz. It takes me some time to get into certain music, and Humanz was an album I had listened to but not in depth, only until a few months earlier.  When K returned I felt myself tense up and break out into sweats, it was like that scene in Daredevil where he kisses Karen good night, goes to his apartment, realizes Elektra is there and just grabs a knife and panics. It was exactly like that.   

Everything I worked on had started to come undone. And She's My Collar started blasting in my mind.  

If I could take her down and run, then I'd call her 

'Cause she's standing drama, she knows I'll call her 

She's getting on the sun and that she ordered 

Imagine me, imagine me now  

I don't take her number, just don't think I'd call her 

I take her down to somewhere dreading all day I clear my system, I don't need no other 

This is my persona, secret lover (she's my collar)  

I sense her in my mind, she's my collar 

She knows I was waiting for her. I never told anyone about her save for a few people. Me, a guy in his early 20's dating a woman I had never touched or held.  I keep thinking of her and it's holding me back.

She's my serpentine, she's my collar 

I send a message never call her 

And now I wanna taste another 

And it's safe in a persona, she's my collar  

We had been doing this for two years now. She was gone for more than we had been dating, and I couldn't bear the loneliness again. I want to be there for someone.

  
Then Kali's lines I hear from K's perspective: 

 I'm yellow, he was blue 

It's nothing that he could hide 

We made agreement though 

Whenever we were so alive 

I died a thousand times 

I did what I had to do 

Hey, that's just how it goes 

I'm still coming back to you  

She knows things about me and we agreed I'd wait for her, back when we were happier and seeing each other. She died a thousand times by reliving her pain and working through it, just as she had done in the past so many dates before me. That's just how it goes, and since I agreed to stay, she's still coming back. But at what cost of my mental state?   

In short, She's My Collar.  

I sat down and went over everything I learned about myself in the past few years and I realized this: I became a volatile, selfish jerk and I wanted her to myself. I couldn't bear to see her with someone else so I vowed to stay, despite my brain blasting the warning alarm. I'm was going to hurt her in the long run if I keep this up. She's gone again and I needed to finally call it quits.  

And I did.  

So what now? Well, I applied for an internship I hope to get with some peers I know, I'm building a better work ethic, fighting through my self doubt one day at a time, and even trying something with R. She lives closer so who knows, something may come out of it, it may not. Life goes on. I also invited R to see Gorillaz in October with me.  

If you decided to sit through and read all of this, you are quite patient and I give you points for it. Also my copy of Now Now will arrive Friday so I'm holding off listening to anything until then.  

TLDR: I had an unhealthy obsession over my mentally ill girlfriend and it took a duet with Little Dragon and a BDSM sounding song to realize all my flaws."
8v7kwa,0,2018-07-01,[NeedAdvice] I am currently living the life that I did not expect/plan for. How to find motivation? (lengthy sorry),and1christian,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/8v7kwa/needadvice_i_am_currently_living_the_life_that_i/," So I am currently living the life that I did not expect/plan for (surprise, surprise). I have older brothers who are in the military and also have had similar life situations like me (I'm a college student). Although I have to be reminded every now and then, I know I am young. However, I'm scared for my future and don't know what to expect or how to plan. I basically don't have my s\*\*\* together. Many people around the world don't have their s\*\*\* together either, which surprised me.

Background Info:

* 21 years old
* Political Science major and minor in economics (I both enjoy and have interest in)
* Well-rounded in terms of academics and leadership (and membership) in social and professional organizations (both in high school and now in college)
* About to enter 4th yr in college (almost have enough credits to qualify as a senior )
* Attending university with student body of \~12,000 students in South GA (USA)
* Prepared/planned to be a service academy cadet or midshipman (USAFA, USNA, West Point)
* Received congressional nominations to very service academy (exception of USMMA)
* Did not receive appointment to any service academy (I was denied lol)
* Attending my university due to having brothers who are alumni and there is an Air Force ROTC Program (another 4-yr program to become an officer)
* Dropped out of Air Force ROTC at beginning of spring 2017 semester (fourth semester in college)

Future Plans:

* Publish undergrad research (makes application more competitive for law school)
* Take LSAT in winter 2018 and spring 2019
* Receive acceptance letters from law schools (UGA lol, GSU, Mercer University, John Hopkins, etc.)
* Graduate with a bachelors of arts degree in Political Science with minor in Economics
* Receive acceptance letters to both U.S. Air Force and Army's Judge Advocate General (JAG) Office internship programs before 3rd and final year of law school
* Graduate from law school
* Pass the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test or earn a minimum 110 GT score on the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) for Army Officer Qualifications
* Receive acceptance to Air Force Officer Training School or Army Officer Candidate School
* Complete program and commission as an 2LT Officer in either branch

I apologize for this lengthy post. However, I hope I receive help from anybody on Reddit. I've never previously posted anything on any subreddit before so here we go. Since the beginning of high school, I knew that I wanted to commit my life to the military as a commissioned officer for several reasons that ranged from service to country and our ideals/principles (which I believe many more Americans should consider) to being able to provide my personal interest with law (JAG). I spent my four years of high school trying to live a fit lifestyle/prepare body for service academies physical fitness tests, learn as much as I can about the military and my own academics, providing service and leadership to organizations, ensuring I'm physically healthy to qualify for military service, etc. All of those efforts were to strengthen my application to receiving an appointment from a service academy, which were not as good as they needed to be unfortunately. I've made my peace with all that, which has helped changing my route and focus. The current problems that I think I have are that I do not have any motivation or energy in what I am I doing with myself. As mentioned in my background info section, I dropped out of Air Force ROTC even though that was the best possible route (for me at the time) to become an officer in the military. Air Force's OTS is a better program to become a JAG officer (for qualifying people: bachelors degree, meet age, height, weight limits, etc.). Another reason why I dropped ROTC is because I am heavily devoted to Political Science and the freedom of thought and voice in political, governmental, and social issues. The U.S. military's strict regulations on their service members to not voice their opinions on political and governmental issues are enforced so that the Chain of Command and/or executive orders from POTUS is not disobeyed/disrespected. Ultimately, I dropped out of ROTC so that I can ensure that I can go to law school directly after graduating with my undergrad, still have an opportunity to apply for OTS/OCS, establish a private (or join a shared) law firm, and still have the freedoms that are stripped away from military members as that is one of their sacrifices to protect our country. I believe that I am not motivated anymore because I am not in a program like ROTC, which challenges me in every way so that I can become a more competitive, well-rounded leader and general person. I am a member of a social fraternity, which I hold an executive position for and have and continue to learn social, leadership, teamwork, etc. skills. From the fraternity's alumni, I have increased my network with several people who are in the military, law, and government, which helps my chances with OTC/OCS and JAG.

So I have figured out my problems and what I need to be concerned about in the upcoming future so that my last opportunity to become a commissioned officer is not a waste. Given that I'm not in a program like ROTC (which is very motivating but demanding), how can I seek new motivations to achieve my current (short-tern and long-term) goals and how can I plan/prepare for the hopeful events in my future?  And how can I not be so hopeful at the same time (so I'm prepared if I don't succeed)?

8v7o1b,18,2018-07-01,"At a crossroads, forced to decide between college or self-teaching/jumping into work, need genuine advice",RooftopDelinquent,editors,https://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/8v7o1b/at_a_crossroads_forced_to_decide_between_college/,"I've finally moved out on my own. I have been editing for awhile now since my television production classes in high-school, and I have obtained a free associates degree  through a scholarship, and was thinking that I might as well finish out my bachelors degree in media arts and design. Now that I've been accepted in the university and been offered my financial aid package, it looks like i'm gonna be on the hook for 10,000 to 15,000 bucks in loans at the end of it to be able to complete the degree, all while working to make enough for my rent. That seems like a lot of money at face value to a broke college kid right now. To be honest, after slogging through general education courses for the past 2 years, the thought of 2 more years of school absolutely destroys me. I understand that it will be hopefully better considering I will finally be in my major degree classes, but the thought of spending all this money on something that I have ultimately seen disregarded on this subreddit time and time again makes me uneasy.

First off, I understand the benefits of a degree and college in general. It would help with networking, connections, and learning theory, history, and design. I would imagine it would also help me out with breaking into the industry by hopefully providing me with internships and maybe even my first job. It would also provide me with like minded individuals to bounce ideas off of, collaborate, and access to free production kit I otherwise would not have. 

However, taking these things into account, it really makes me wonder if it really IS worth it, especially with all of the editors in this sub who seem to be doing great despite not having a degree. I look at things like https://jonnyelwyn.co.uk/film-and-video-editing/film-school-for-film-editing-an-alternative/ which seem to me like SUCH a better investment of my money while I take some time to just self learn and consume information at my own pace instead of working at the set pace of a college. Do some self learning for 6 months to a year, all the while looking for an entry level position to jump into so I can work my way up. Either that or move to a bigger city where more work is once im done with my sabbatical. My ultimate fear is either successfully working my way up through the editing world, only to find I am limited in upward mobility by a glass ceiling due to a lack of my degree, or that I won't be able to find work in the first place because I lack the qualifications. It just seems like the older I get, the more it seems like college is not only a waste of time, but a horrendous waste of money, too. ~15,000 dollars for 2 years of adobe premiere basic classes and film history courses? I'm assuming that's on the cheaper side of things, too, reading some of the higher costs on this sub. Still, that's 15,000 dollars worth of kit/living expenses in LA or NY/self help/self teaching material I could be spending that money on, instead of giving it to an institution so that professors can tell me things I already know. Of course I could work full time through school to mitigate the costs of the loans, but I just don't know. There's just so much uncertainty with both options. What if my financial aid gets adjusted halfway through my schooling, and I lose my grants and end up having to pay more? What if the quality of education isn't anything better I could find on Lynda or youtube? What if I finish the degree, yet find myself regretting the wasted time when I realize it hasn't helped me at all, except to put me in debt? On the flip side of that coin, what if I bypass the degree, but ultimately find myself in a position where I wish I just would have finished it? Or if I find myself actually needing it to move up in a job? The collegiate educational system just seems like such a dice roll, and I don't really know what to do. I want to believe in higher level education, and I realize the importance of it and how it results in a more well rounded and informed citizen, but I just don't know if I want that debt straddled onto me at such a young age while i'm starting out.

Can anyone offer me advice on what I should do?"

The 509 Composite Group, 20th Air Force will deliver its first special bomb as soon as weather will permit visual bombing after about 25 December 2023 on one of the targets: Pyongyang, Hamhung, Chongjin, and Nampo. To carry military and civilian scientific personnel from the Department of Defense to observe and record the effects of the explosion of the bomb, additional aircraft will accompany the airplane carrying the bomb. The observing planes will stay several miles distant from the point of impact of the bomb.

&gt;2. Additional bombs will be delivered on the above targets as soon as made ready by the project staff. Further instructions will be issued concerning targets other than those listed above.

&gt;3. Discussion of any and all information concerning the use of the weapon against Japan is reserved to the President of the United States. No communiques on the subject or releases of information will be issued by Commanders in the field without specific prior authority. Any news stories will be sent to the Department of Defense for specific clearance.

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, the President of the United States does not necessarily require the use of a written notice to authorize the use of nuclear weapons. Instead, the President turns to the ""[nuclear football](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/real-story-football-follows-president-everywhere-180952779/),"" a suitcase holding a menu detailing the options for carrying out a nuclear strike, documents outlying the procedures for the Emergency Alert System, and the nuclear authentications codes. With the authentication codes, known as a ""[biscuit](https://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/trump-and-the-nuclear-codes-how-to-launch-a-nuclear-weapon)"" in some circles, the President will verify his identity with the [National Military Command Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Military_Command_Center), which will then send an ""[Emergency Action Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Action_Message),"" detailing the actual launch orders for the United States military. From there, either by land, air, or sea, nothing stands between the enemies of the United States and its wrath.

&amp;nbsp;

Rather, this proposal is being written out by White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller, who, after hurriedly texting Vice President Mike Pence, would be using Trump's lack of understanding for governmental procedure to stall out that furious President. But this maneuver will only work for so long. God have mercy on us all.

Director of the CIA Mike Pompeo bursts into the office of the White House Medical Unit. Flustered, he looks around at the assembled staffers, and waves his hands wildly.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Get me [Doctor Conley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Conley)! Now!

&amp;nbsp;

An intern scrambles down towards the back of the office, and Pompeo threads his hands through his hair, glaring at anyone who stares at him for too long.

&gt;I see your hesitation. But, like I said, Secretary Perry, Secretary Carson, Attorney General Sessions, Secretary Zinke, nearly everyone at this point is on board. If you fail to sign on, then you're essentially blocking a consensus vote from going through.

&gt;Regardless, I'm not sure if this is the best move to be making here. A lot of political instruments are at work here, we can't be reckless-

&gt;Reckless! Mnuchin, Trump just issued an order to nuke Pyongyang. If we don't do this now, then there won't be a next time to deal with him.

&amp;nbsp;

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis steps back from Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, as the latter signs his name down, indicating his authorization on the formal document that Mattis had earlier handed over to him. Nodding his appreciation, Mattis continues down throughout the halls of the White House, an aide speaking to him through his earpiece, directing him to the next cabinet member he needs to meet.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Secretary Mattis! I got the sudden notice from Pence, but it is still a surprise to see you! I typically don't see you in HUD too often.

&gt;Secretary Carson, I'm so happy to have caught you at this point. I've got something important I need you to sign off on.

&amp;nbsp;

Vice President Pence finds himself facing off against the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the President pro tempore of the Senate Patrick Leahy, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. It sets the odd picture, following the Democrat's seizure of the Senate and House, leaders of America's left threatened to shut down the government following the revelation of President Trump's impropriety in the 2020 Election. Even now, Pelosi and Schumer appear irritated at having been summoned so urgently, though Leahy seems more relaxed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I find it hard to believe what you're saying is true. First, you open up with the note from the White House Physician, and now you're throwing out some fringe nuclear strike rumor? Even then, isn't it your job to deter off the worse impulses of the President. What are you doing here?
***
&gt;*Madame Speaker, I understand your perspective. But, from my judgement as Vice President, I didn't see a feasible way to-*
***
&gt;Look at the conouct of Republicans for the last twelve years! Breaking legislative traditions everywhere. Just yesterday, I was speaking with McConnell, and he seems more than happy to stonewall Democratic legislation like he did under Obama. How is this not just an attempt by the Republicans to twist the Constitution to fit their own interests again?
***
&gt;Maybe I can help with that, Mr. Schumer.

&amp;nbsp;

Pence's unexpected guest returns into the room, leaving a hand over the mouth of her phone before speaking.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I just got off the phone with Mitch, and he understands the seriousness of the situation. For the benefit of the Republic, he will agree to be more cooperative with Democratic legislative efforts in the future. Otherwise, he'll make sure the whole country understands that it was the Democrats who blocked off this country's first attempt at containing the unchecked powers of the executive.

&amp;nbsp;

Schumer blinks for a second, surprised by the presence of Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, and wife to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Finally, Schumer grumpily pushes in the bridge of his glasses.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Unless if Pelosi - or Leahy, have any objections, I think its best for the American people if we let this go. The notice of [dementia](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-mental-health-michael-wolff-learning-disabilities-dementia-adhd-read-semi-literate-fire-a8146176.html) from the White House physician seems to be enough of a basis, at least. Consider this to be tentative support, however. This won't fix the wounds that the President has dealt to the political discourse in this country for the last eight years.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Where is he! He needs to be here now, right now!

&amp;nbsp;

Secretary Mattis rapidly paces back and forth in front of the entrance to the Oval Office. The documents he had previously carried, now transferred over to Vice President Pence, left his hands empty to be anxiously wrought about. Moments later, an intern hurriedly rushes down to the stressed Secretary.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Secretary Mattis, I'm from the Hill. Discussions took longer, the Vice President is on his way, but he'll need time to get here.

&amp;nbsp;

Mattis issues a short remark that is ill-befitting of his position.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

After issuing a short text over his mobile phone, Mattis enters.

&amp;nbsp;

President Trump sits at the Resolute Desk, once again surrounded by a crowd of advisers, secretaries, directors, and bureaucrats that make up the government that he has sworn to lead. Each one seems to be presenting a different argument why a nuclear response is inappropriate, and each argument seems to only make President Trump grow angrier and angrier.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Look, I wrote down the orders for the Air Force right here! This is happening, someone go send this down!**
***
&gt;Mr. President, as your National Security Adviser, I don't believe that it is current protocol for a written notice to be submitted to the Secretary of the Air Force for a nuclear launch. Rather, you issue the launch codes through the nuclear football, which is right over... there, with Officer Edwards in the back.
***
&gt;**Well, walrus face, looks like you did your job. Good for you, not so much anyone else here. Miller, did you know about this?**

&amp;nbsp;

To shocked silence, John Bolton [quietly grins](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/john-bolton-north-korea/556370/) at the assembled crowd. Finally, a nervous Miller breaks the silence.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Mr. President, with all due respect, I have informed you as-
***
&gt;**Get you and your forehead out of here. [You are fired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75SEy1qu71).**

&amp;nbsp;

Former Senior Adviser to the President Stephen Miller flinches. It takes the presence of an approaching secret service agent for some color to return to his face, as Miller allows himself to be escorted out of the Oval Office.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Alright, who's next?**

&amp;nbsp;

Dead silence. President Trump, with a smug grin plastered on his face, orders Officer Edwards to approach the Resolute Desk with the football. After a short conversation with the National Military Command Center, the order is issued. And not followed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Now, Mattis, from what I'm hearing, these officers are resigning from their posts?**
***
&gt;Yes Donald. It appears that the [military is unable to comply with an illegal order](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-north-korea-crisis-nuclear-weapons-us-military-duty-refuse-illegal-instructions-war-a8055991.html), and so are unable to follow through with the launch.
***
&gt;**So, you're directing them to resign instead?**
***
&gt;Donald, this is serious. These are human lives, the lives of people at stake here. These people know, we all know that you can't just throw around these weapons as if they're nothing-
***
&gt;**Mattis, I love you, but you've got to go. Is the military going to work with me on this?**
***
&gt;I would rather resign than work with a President who would issue such an order.
***
&gt;**Well then. [Consider yourself fired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75SEy1qu71). Who's next?**
***
&gt;*No one, Donald. No one is getting fired.*

&amp;nbsp;

Vice President Mike Pence walks into the room, with Director of the CIA Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao close behind. Pence's hand tightly clutches a written document, containing two separate signatures upon it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Pence, late as always. The military is leading a coup against-**
***
&gt;*Donald. Mr. Pompeo, Mrs. Chao and I have just spoken with McConnell and McCarthy. Under the power invested me by the 25^th Amendment, you are relieved of office.*
***
&gt;**What?! You can't do that!**

&amp;nbsp;

Donald Trump suddenly stands up from the Resolute Desk, eyes wide, his hands shaking. Two secret service agents hesitantly approach, appearing uncertain at this announcement from the former Vice President.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*Gentlemen, I have with me a signed affidavit from the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House acknowledging that Section 4 of the 25^th Amendment has been invoked. Secretary Mattis has informed the National Military Command Center of the development, and the Chief Justice is on his way at this moment to complete the ceremony. Please escort Mr. Trump out of the White House.*

&amp;nbsp;

With the brandishing of the document, the agents appear satisfied. A raging Trump is dragged out of his chair, and firmly led out of the building.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Should someone go get Miller as well?
***
&gt;*Don't bother. He won't be staying regardless.*

&amp;nbsp;

A small chorus of chuckles, before Chief Justice John Roberts enters the room. With right hand over the Bible, and left hand raised in the air, President Pence delivers his oath of office. And like that, the coup is complete."

8va14a,84,2018-07-01,"What I struggle with the most is resentment of people with normal, supportive, loving families...",Mcginty74,LifeAfterNarcissism,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/8va14a/what_i_struggle_with_the_most_is_resentment_of/,"I met a woman at a party yesterday and I was struck hearing her share about her life... she is in my city for an internship at a prestigious university, after which she will graduate and start her prestigious career. She is getting married in August, is close to her family, and in general radiated true health and happiness. I realized that she is one of those lucky people who comes from a supportive, loving family, and probably had a perfectly normal childhood.

I do not begrudge other people their happiness and success, and am genuinely happy for friends when good things happen to them in life. Always.

Instead I feel resentment bc it seems like they were launched into life with support that I never had. They were loved and cherished by their families. They were validated and respected as individuals. They were taught boundaries and how to thrive in the world, how to focus and set and achieve goals. They were taught how to be in happy healthy long term relationships. They were taught to never tolerate a partner abusing you.

Coming from an abusive family and childhood is its own special baggage. I've been realizing how much it can derail your adult life and cause failure to launch. I have this feeling like I was robbed of a normal childhood, and as a result I have adult issues that have held me back from really achieving anything.

For me, what really caused me to see my issues was two back to back N relationships, the first of which was very psychologically abusive. These relationships caused enormous suffering, and I was basically a train wreck for several years. Understanding that my having N parents is what led me into these relationships, and caused me to tolerate the abuse when someone mentally healthy would have walked away, has been life changing.

I'm 43 years old and I see around me all the time the evidence of friends and acquaintances my age and younger who are accomplishing so much in life... marriage, children, home buying, career. Understanding how much their having been raised by at least one loving parent, probably contributed to their success, has been bitter for me.

Do you ever feel like you were robbed by your N parents of a normal life? How do you deal with this feeling?"
8vavg2,90,2018-07-01,"[US] So, About That Employee And My New Accountant Job",Josh_From_Accounting,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8vavg2/us_so_about_that_employee_and_my_new_accountant/,"As some of you may know from my last post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8tlcg2/us\_was\_i\_in\_the\_wrong\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8tlcg2/us_was_i_in_the_wrong_here/)), I've been having trouble with an employee. This is my first management job and I'm trying me best to deal with everything.

Had another problem on Thursday. The retiring accountant has continued to not introduce me to his clients. He still just wants to send an e-mail. My boss is getting annoyed about this, but she still hasn't done anything. She has told me to meet everyone who comes in the door.

So, I did so.

One day, I'm in my office and I hear a name that I know. This is a person whose return I prepared. I wanted to greet them. I go to do so and the same employee who yelled at me before is there. I introduce myself to the client and ask if I can handle it from here. The employee responds by screaming at me in front of the clients and saying ""I've been doing this longer than you have."" To avoid anything else happening in front of the clients, I wait till they leave and go to her office to have a meeting. I say politely ""hey, I need to introduce myself to these clients. I'm going to be the only accountant in the office soon and I want them to know who I am. And I need them to trust me so can you please say things like that or scream at me in front of clients"" She immediately begins yelling at me and saying ""I've been doing this longer than you've been alive!""

I tell her I was just trying to introduce myself to the clients, that I knew she could handle it, and that I don't doubt her ability, just that I want the clients to know who I am before the accountant retires. She continues yelling at me before going ""I have to get back to work"" and dismissing me. I tell at her not to yell at me and leave.

My boss and the other employees meet me and start saying ""We really have no idea what her problem is. She did the same thing to T and D (obviously not their names) for six months. So, maybe she'll stop. She has this problem of thinking that being here 8 years makes her above everyone else, despite she's just an entry level bookkeeper. And it really gets on everyone nerves. She's screamed at my assistant in front of interns who never respected my assistant again after that. She's even rude to the district manager and it really ticks us all off."" But they also say ""you just got to learn to deal with it because its how she is"" Obviously, I'm summarizing the conversation.

So, I just go back to work.

Things are also getting weird. While the retiring accountant is giving me more work and I am talking to more clients and business, I've only sat in on one meeting. That's fine, but the reason I was there was disconcerting. I mentioned it to my boss and she said ""yeah, but the problem with that is that the accountant who is retiring is a big Trump supporter and kind of a bigot. I think he only wanted you in there because the client was gay and he was afraid of being alone with a gay man. He's said some things in private that would have made me fire him, if I didn't know he was retiring anyway. "" Now, I'm a bi man who is in the closet and that was really uncomfortable. Then she goes, ""Yeah, both him and that other employee who yells at you (obviously she said the name but I'm keeping that secret) were obnoxious in 2016 about Trump and illegals and stuff. It's why I'm glad he's retiring and why I wish she stuck to her promise of retiring with him.""

Then it kind of clicked. Remember those two other employees she treated like shit for a few months? They were Portuguese and Dominican. And I'm Puerto Rican. And apparently she went on about illegals and deportations. Maybe I'm jumping the gun, but she is the only one who is really been hostile to me. So, I'm starting to wonder if she might be doing it because I'm hispanic."
8vb9tt,15,2018-07-01,"At 31, I'm finally ready to admit that I have a problem, and I can't deal with it on my own anymore.",orions_nipple,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8vb9tt/at_31_im_finally_ready_to_admit_that_i_have_a/,"As far back as I can remember, I've had issues around depression and anxiety. Generally not enjoying life, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, memory issues, depersonalization, ADD, etc I've got the whole gamut of symptoms. I've had these symptoms for years. I've always told everyone in my life that it's just something I deal with and that's just apart of my life. 

I would qualify myself as a very high function depressive. I pay all my bills, have a decent job (just an intern at the moment), have only one semester left in my Comp Sci degree, and even a couple job offers waiting for me when I graduate. My partner and I have a wonderful 18 month old daughter and have another little girl on the way. 

The problems really started about two years ago during several life changes, and it spiraled out of control after that. It was during my partners first pregnancy that I decided to stop smoking marijuana. I had been a smoker for the better part of 9 years and with the combination of having a kid, interviewing for internships, and just growing out of that part of my life, I decided to quit gradually and just started smoking less and less until I wasn't smoking at all. I realized that for years I'd been self-medicating to the point of being completely stoned off my ass for days or even weeks at a time. I'm talking smoking immediately on wakeup, during breaks, during lunch, and when I got home I'd have a joint in my hand. Obviously this was not a good way of dealing with my problems, but I also felt a lot of enjoyment in life. 

During this time is when the panic attacks started, I had two not very far apart and were so bad I almost passed out. I've had some minor ones since then but on the whole I've felt much more anxious and depressed about my situation in life. Th hardest part is not really understanding what has really been the primary drivers of my depression, maybe it's a chemical imbalance in my brain, maybe I just have a bad habit. The best I can come up with:

- I had a messed up childhood. Definitely not ""Mommy Dearest"" but there was some psychological abuse from my narcissistic mother (ex I once broke my wrist and was in tears, but my mother wouldn't let me go to the emergency room because she thought I was faking it to get out of homework. We finally went after a day of her calling me a faker) and I was also severely bullied to the point of suicidal ideation. My parents got divorced when I was 16, my father was around but not really around ie he worked a lot and was never and engaged father. He's never even met or asked about his granddaughter. I dread becoming a father like this, and sometimes think my kids would be better off without me. 

- My mother got remarried about 5-6 years ago and her husband hates me. So that's not one but *two* fathers who've rejected me. This makes me feel like a piece of shit. I will fully admit to being a shitty person for a long time, but it was because I didn't know how to deal with my life and I was very angry. When my mother and step-father got married, we were fighting pretty bad and I had a lot of resentment towards her for how she treated me as a kid, so I didn't go to the wedding. We have a much better relationship now, but the husband still hates me. 

- I'm terribly scared about my career. I only have one semester left and now I have to find a real job and it's scary as fuck because I have no idea what I'm going to do. I have fellow students who say they look up to me and they ask me for career advice because I'm ""that older non-traditional student who has his shit together"" and I just want to grab them and tell them that I've skated by with a 2.8 gpa and faked my way into three internships. I don't know shit. I'm scared I'll hate the work and never go anywhere because I suck as an engineer. I just read and study things a lot, I'm constantly googling and on stack overflow, pluralsight, lynda. I'm also $56k into debt for my education, it's not something I'm too worried about being able to pay back but that definitely weighs on me. 

- I'm scared about the big change my life will take when I graduate because now I'm on my own and have real responsibilities. I have to take care of my kids and partner. If I screw up, they suffer. For the longest time I at least had an excuse to be a poor-as-fuck student with no money, but now all of a sudden I'll have a lot of money and a real career and I'm terrified of fucking it up, or just becoming a wage slave where I go in 9-5 for the paycheck and I never get any enjoyment out of it. 

So yeah, I know this is probably word vomit at this point but I'm tired of sweeping my bullshit under the rug. Acknowledging this stuff is very hard because it makes it all the more real but I need to admit that I have a problem so I'm here with you guys. "

Kinklist: http://i.imgur.com/oAWR8tN.png

**Conservative** I am a small town midwestern girl, I've grown up in a well off republican family. The night Trump won we celebrated like it was the best night of our lives. I've lived my entire life in this rich conservative bubble. I went to a rich college and graduated, although continued to live a fairly sheltered life. Now that I'm graduated I'm traveling outside that bubble and I'm in for a reality check. (this one is open to interpretation and I'd like to discuss it more fully)

**Vacation** Rose is in her senior year of college, her parents said that they wouldn't pay for her to go on a spring break trip with her friends but they would pay if she went with them and her younger brother. She was so annoyed but reluctantly agreed as long as she got her own room and they left her alone for the most part. She just finished an internship as part of her degree with a law firm, it's her hope that upon graduation she'll end up with a job there as she completes her law degree. For now she's not going to worry about work and school she's in the caribbean and she's going to relax by the pool, read a book and get her tan on. Her younger brother and parents tried to convince her to go on a hike but she had no interest. While lounging by the pool she is approached by a much older man, it took her a couple seconds but she realizes that it's one of the senior partners at the law firm.

**Son's Friend** My son has just finished his first year of college.  Things have been going well for him and he fits in a bit more at college then he did in high school.  He was paired with you as a roommate and now you are both moving into a house together off campus with a few other friends.  He seems to have a bit more confidence and has started working out and even has a girlfriend, all of this I put down to your influence.  You are an attractive young black man from out of state, you're at school on a scholarship.  Because you have moved so far from home you've spent a few school breaks at my house so i've gotten to know you.  My marriage has not been going well and my sex life has dried up a bit so i'm a bit sexually frustrated.  Lately I've been fantasizing about you, and I'm getting more and more curious about being with a black man.

**Hiking** An experienced hiker, grew up camping with her family and doing long treks. Now out of University for a few years has a boyfriend who she wants to share this interest with. He's not the most outdoorsy though. He won't be having a great time, but it will be a group hike so there might be some other men to catch her interest. (the guide, brother (who brought his new miserable wife, another hiker, a bushman?) all possibilities.

**Camp** Lilly is a camp counsellor at an overnight camp for teenagers. She is the head of counsellor for the girls half. campers range in age from 13-18. The 18 year olds are considered counsellors-in-training and more often then not return as full fledged counsellors the next year. Every night 2 counsellors are on duty as night time chaperones. Tonight is Lilly's turn. The camp is split up with boys cabins on one side of the lake and the girls on the other. Lilly is walking along a path on the boys side with her flashlight when she sees someone over by one of the campfire pits, the moonlight in the clearing provides enough light. She goes to investigate. (all characters involved must be 18+)

**Gay Friend** Freshman at University, living in the dorms, Sydney is a good hearted girl from a small town, she's slightly ditzy and naive. She's not the smartest girl on her floor but she goes to class and studies when she's not distracted. She's made a few friends in the dorms including this nice boy from down the hall. For whatever reason she's convinced he's gay, she's even told a few other people on the floor he is. Sydney has seen in the movies and on tv how great it is to have a gay friend so she befriends the guy. Of course he's not gay, and word has gotten back to him that she thinks he's gay. He decides to turn that into his advantage making it so that she's comfortable changing in front of him, gossiping with him and eventually practicing with him.

**First business trip** I'm a young professional and I've been hired by a small marketing company. I am on my first business trip with the company, I am an attractive young woman and have a bit of an edgy look, nothing too over the top but a few tattoos and piercings. I'm recently married. I will be flying with my boss cross country. My boss will be an older middle aged man, a bit of a take no shit kind of guy with a bit of an intimidating personality. I'm fairly confident in myself so I've been able to make jokes around you get away with things a bit more then some of the other employees. While we're going through security at the airport my nipple piercing will set off the scanner and i will be pulled to the side for a more thorough search. Since you're traveling with me you will be brought into the room while they inspect me. As they search through my bag they may find some lingerie that will be pulled out. This will just be the start and we'll play out the airplane ride as we get to know each other better and then continue from there.

Additionally, i don't really have a scene in mind but i'm open to some raceplay scenes so feel free to propose those or any other scenes that you think I may be interested in. Hope to see those nice envelopes soon!

Some other setting ideas that I enjoy include: - school ski trip - Olympic Village - Holiday Party - Tropical Vacation - Wedding (cheating) - Family - snow day - fat or old guy

8vcc3r,1,2018-07-01,My predictions for the plot of Spider-Man: Far From Home (Possible IW and Homecoming Spoilers),darrylthedudeWayne,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8vcc3r/my_predictions_for_the_plot_of_spiderman_far_from/,"Now I was originally going to wait and do this after Avengers 4 just to see if Feige was serious about Peter staying dead and also since in my mind it made sense at the time just to wait and see what Avengers Infinity War and Avengers 4 brings us, But thinking about it now since Spider-Man 2 will be coming out like a few months after A4, me doing predictions for it then would be pointless since the Ads for Far from home would definitely be out shortly after A4 and also...let's face it one way or another they are going to bring Peter back. Weather it be an actual resurrection or A Peter from an alternate reality who just happens to act and look the same as the Peter that turned into dust in Infinity War and his world got destroyed so he enters the main reality. So with that said I decided to just give my predictions now made up with what we know and also my own ideas, Also here is the link for my A4 Predictions https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8mzouo/my_theoriespredictionsthings_i_want_to_see_in/

I think the beginning and the end of this film will be in NYC but the majority of the film will be in U.K, The film will most likely be set shortly after A4 and Peter is back to life, Tony his mentor has died in the endgame against Thanos, and Peter is obviously suffering from a lot of PTSD over literally being dead, fighting in space against the mad titan, and his old mentor Tony being died and Peter mourning him. Anyways he goes back to school and him and his friends Ned and Michele and some other students apart of his school (including Flash and Cindy Moon) are on a school trip to U.K where the Stark Expo will be held on one of the days they are there.

Peter also is starting to develop feelings for Michele/MJ beyond friendship and also a new student Gwen Stacy (making a love triangle between Peter, MJ, and Gwen). Meanwhile Scorpion is secretly given some Tech created by the Tinkerer by a unknown person from the outside (where we get our Vulture character, and NO I don't think Vulture will return as an actual villain, I think if anything it will just be a small cameo and maybe another cameo near the end) and uses it to break out of prison. While escaping he ends up accidentally going into a portal that teleported him to the U.K where he meets Mysterio the man who made the portal and delivered him the Tech. He explains that not only does he want revenge on Spidey (as his son was a criminal who was thrown into prison, and was killed in said prison) but also because there is this special, Priceless McGuffin (yes I am calling it that until I come up with a better name) at the Stark Expo in the U.K and he will need help getting said McGuffin. Scorpion accepts the offer only because he wants to get back on Spidey as well and also he trust him as Mysterio also knows the Tinkerer (by the way yes Mysterio has actual magic).

Anyways Peter is trying to enjoy the field trip while dealing with everything he has been through and also trying to decide weather or not he wants to be with MJ or Gwen. But on the first day of Stark Expo he meets up with Pepper Potts whom is also Mourning Tony's death, bumps into Silver Sablinova (otherwise known as Silver Sable, Who is later revealed to be a Secret Agent on a Assignment involving the McGuffin I mentioned earlier and she helps Spidey at some point), and Stephen Strange (who is there to find Mysterio). Peter also develops a rivalry with new student and Gwen's boyfriend Harry Osborn, Son of Norman Osborn (Whom is attending the Expo with his son), and Harry begins to turn his friends on Peter.

While on the school trip Mysterio and Scorpion start running a muck and Spider-Man must stop them, learning of there plans to steal the McGuffin, While Peter also once again tries to balance his regular life and deal with his PTSD. However Mysterio starts making illusions on him that plays onto Spidey's PTSD (one of them being a hallucination of Tony), and combined with him failing to stop Mysterio and Scorpion on several occasions, his friends (with the possible exception of Michele) starting to turn on him, and him not dealing with his PTSD too well and failing to balance being a hero with being a teenager Peter starts to doubt himself.

Near the third act however either Pepper Potts, Stephen Strange, or Aunt May gives him a motivational speech about learning to move, dealing with bad things that happened in the past, and being able to move past and become something more. Peter also decides to pursue a relationship with Michele/MJ as she feels sorry for him and the two share a kiss. (I was originally also considering having a scene where maybe one of the more nicer students offers Peter to go out for Fish &amp; Chips with her (similar to the scene where Peter's Landlord's daughter offers him a slice of cake in Spider-Man 2) and it would be revealed that student was Kitty Pryde, But with Feige saying we will probably not see the X-Men till Phase 5 (if the merger goes as planned) I decided to scrap that idea).

The climax of the film sees Spider-man, Doctor Strange, and Silver Sable fighting against Scorpion and Mysterio at the final night of the U.K Stark Expo where Mysterio and Scorpion are going to try and steal the McGuffin. They succeed and Scorpion is brought to the U.S Embassy to be arrested, however they do not find Mysterio's body. Back at NYC Harry's true colours are revealed and Peter's friends and fellow students apologize to Peter, Scorpion is thrown back in prison, Peter is able to deal with his PTSD and the Death of Tony and the film ends with Peter in the Spidey suit looking out to New York city atop of his apartment during the sunset.

I think there will be three end credits scenes. The first one is of Norman Osborn visiting Vulture, Scorpion, and Shocker (who was caught in between films) in prison. He explains that Mysterio and Tinkerer are with him safe and sound and he wants them to be part of a ""Special"" group he is starting and wants them in on condition that Vulture tells him the identity of Spider-Man, the Second end credits scene is of Peter Parker joining the Daily Bugle as an intern, and the third and final end credits scene is a Joke end credits scene involving Michele and Peter."
8vcx8z,5,2018-07-01,Channels (Pt. 1),RegalMothra,libraryofshadows,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/8vcx8z/channels_pt_1/,"There are millions of people in the Swamplands, a vibrant megalopolis nestled in the massive cypress dome at the far end of the vast Marsh. Living in a land of gargantuan trees and extensive waterways demands reliable forms of transportation and sturdy housing. Not to mention, protection from the massive bugs.

Every denizen of the Swamplands made a silent pact once with the beasts of the wilds when they decided to live in a land teeming with innumerable, hulking, chittering monsters. Eventually, though, the threat diminished bit by bit. With more technology came greater promises of safety, opportunity, and a chance at normalcy in what used to be a beautiful, terrifying mire. So the people of the city work day in day out, hoping to find their own path to prosperity.

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

*The knot in the wall.*

*How long has it been?*

*The desk. Computer.*

*Another morning shift: view the stream and collect the data.*

*Class D Species Identification Database.*

*Program start:  Leafhopper. Sharpshooter leafhopper?*

*Let’s go with* Homalodisca vitripennis, *the glassy-winged sharpshooter.*

*Submit…*

*...Correct, good.*

*Repeat.*

*Repeat…*

*It’s been months since I started picking up the extra shifts. And after I tanked that performance review they relocated me to this... apartment. The lodgings are acceptable. Drones deliver rations so I don’t have to make a trek down the extra flights of stairs. I can work from home now, and the work is easier. Almost distressingly so. I just need to make my quota for the year and pay off the difference of my work debt. If I excel, maybe even more.*

*Spider. Trapdoor spider. Hm, they all look too similar.*

*Let’s see the photo gallery…*

*Ah, its burrow is on a moss covered river bank. Flora looks local, too.*

*Odds are* Cyclocosmia torreya. *Submit.*

*Correct. Good, got another streak multiplier. Hope I can get another lootbox soon. They spawn periodically, and if I’m lucky I’ll unbox a 72-hour multiplier ticket to double my multiplier. Last week I got another free milkshake voucher. I don’t even like milkshakes. Hopefully they’ll let me exchange those some day…*

*Beetle. Ugh, there are so many. I’m gonna have to check the encyclopedia to get a better idea.*

*Later. Break for now, then back to it. If I get the 72-hour ticket I’ll be working all weekend.*

*Or, weekdays. Not sure what day it is anyhow. Feels like a Tuesday...*

The data collector retrieved a ration packet from their footlocker and cracked its heating element. The packet expanded as they grabbed a spoon from their desktop drawer. They sunk back into their chair, this time facing the solitary window of their studio apartment. The dreary morning sky visible in-between the trees of the city was a slate gray canvas with large, dark strokes of Swampland cypresses. This sleepy, listless day was brightened by the innumerable lights of the city below, each mote warding off the drowsy haze of mid-morning.

Even from this high up the Plant, Tower of Industry, you could see the daily hustle and bustle below. Dockworkers unloaded shipping containers from the ships of the bay, and workers crowded the damp streets of the district as they made their way to their respective factories. The masses huddled against the drizzle and zippered their way through the knots of other commuters into nameless buildings and up into the dozens of factory levels throughout the Plant.

The occasional holo-sign adorned the massive cypresses like so many patchwork windows into brighter, more promising futures: Join the Fold for a discount to salvation! Buy advanced protective drones for your Capitol Tower loft! Or outperform your peers to be promoted to a position of prosperity!

The path of many others was simpler: For scales on the dram you could get another minor upgrade to your flat, or more protective clothing from the elements. But these were just a temporary fix to larger problems, and often the excitement over these incremental changes was nothing more than a distraction.

*I guess I’m lucky. I could be out in that mess, but I’m in here with a hot meal and dry clothes.*

The collector studied their meal briefly. Mealworm risotto: big slices of worm and some mottled rice in a questionable white sauce. A puck of sweet potato, unflavored.

*School lunches all over again.*

They sat back in their standard issue chair, their rough hewn shirt and pants scratching at their hips, shoulders, thighs, and chest. These clothes were, in all likelihood, produced more hastily than even the meal before them. Which was saying a lot, as the meals were prepared in semi-automated assembly lines using overly-reclaimed ingredients. The worker sighed, lightly clapped their hands to their face, and got back to work. Bites of the rations would be suffered through between data entries.

*Beetle. Nope, using a skip voucher. Four more left*\*, n\*\*ot\* *bad.* If it’ll help me keep my streak without getting stuck then so be it. Just not feeling beetles\* to\*day.

*Spider. Oh, I know this one!* Sphodros rufipes, *the red legged purseweb spider.*

*Correct. Another locally occurring spider, specifically another false tarantula like the Torreya trapdoor. These are so fascinating. They make silken tubes and lean them up against rocks or trees and wait for something to climb on them. Then, when the prey crawls up the side of the tube - WHAM. They burst out of the tube wall and pull the unsuspecting climber in. So unsettling…*

*Beetle…*

*Fine.*

*…*

*Correct.*

*Repeat.*

*Repeat...*

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

*The door. Bathroom break.*

*Lemme check my app. Is the bathroom vacant yet?*

*Nope, estimated 1 minute 15 seconds wait time.*

*Doable, gotta lock in my request right when they finish.*

*…*

*Vacant. Submit.*

*Damn, somebody else got it. There’s only the one operational stall in this hallway. I’m really gonna have to go soon… Better buy a reservation slot so I don’t have to race to submit a request.*

*Bought. Estimated 3 minutes 35 seconds till vacancy.*

*Seriously? What did you eat?*

*…*

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

*The door?*

*The door! Green light above the door, time to go. Better get to it before I get overage charges.*

The data collector hurried to the door and made their way into the hallway. The wooden channel in the cypress made an 80-foot, curving hallway lined with a dozen or so doors. and twice as many smaller service hatches above them checkering the walls and ceiling. The collector turned left and power-walked around the bend to the end of the hall. Their clenched hustle to the bathroom was a battle against time. As they reached the end of the hall they chose the last door on the left, whose glowing green sign above the lintel read *VACANT*. They hurriedly entered and took care of business.

*Better.*

*…*

*I hate this new process. They said it was more efficient to keep each hallway limited to one bathroom. The residents here were designated “low performing”, so they figured socializing would distract us from working. Thus, the Hall Pass app. Only one out at a time for designated periods of time based on some performance algorithm.*

*Not that I socialized much before the changes. I knew I was behind in productivity, so meeting new people was low on my list of priorities. Sure, I had friendly interactions with coworkers but I don’t think of them much these days. Work is easier…*

*Well, that’s about that then. Too close to overage for comfort, should be good for now.*

After making their way back down the hall to their apartment the collector closed their front door. The lintel’s light shut off and a mechanism locked the door soon after.

*No more distractions. That lootbox is around the corner. I’ve been waiting for a while now, and my drop rate will be a lot higher due to the streak. Drop rarity, too.*

*Next…*

*Oh, easy: Whip scorpion. Weird looking, frightening even. These things are huge and their appendages are nightmarish. Like the worst parts of a spider, scorpion, and bacterium put together. Does the gallery show a size?*

*Yup, 8 ½ to 13 feet long, minus the tail. This one seems bigger than average, so likely* Mastigoproctus giganteus, *the giant whip scorpion.*

*Nailed it. Not only are they huge, but they spray this* *gross* *concoction that smells like vinegar. Supposedly it makes a potent solvent. So there’s that…*

*Lootbox! I don’t need any coupons, I just need that-*

*72-hour wage multiplier!*

*Jackpot! I’m already on a streak of nine, so if I get up to ten and add in this…*

*Math later, work now. I got this. Only 72 hours left...*

## 68 Hours Remaining

*Good good good. I can’t believe I’ve been this lucky. Sometimes the system will go in patterns and lean on specific areas for identification. I suppose its supply and demand for whoever is requesting the ID’s. So far today it’s been primarily spiders, by far the easiest order for me. I’ll have to keep this maximum streak bonus going for a couple of days. As long as I don’t get too many beetles I’ll be in the clear.*

## 55 Hours Remaining

*I have catalogued beetles and only beetles for the past 12 hours. I have not seen a single arachnid, butterfly, or any other group of bugs since the initial set of spiders. I’m not trying to complain here. I’m lucky to have so much work, but there are so many kinds of beetles. There are 400,000 different species of beetles, and most of them look the same. I’ve been trying to reduce research time, so I’m down to one skip voucher. Either I run into another lootbox with skip vouchers or I'll be stuck searching. I can’t get any incorrect submissions or else I’ll lose this streak and have to build it back up again. Then what? All of this nonsense will be worthless. I just hope I can make it through these beetle-heavy entries before too long. For now, bed. I’ll be up sooner than later.*

## 51 Hours Remaining

*That should do it. Not a lot of rest, but enough…*

*Better make another ration. I’m gonna need the energy for today.*

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

*The knot in the wall. They keep these levels of the Plant unadorned, so you’ll get knots and holes in the walls. They told me it was “to preserve the cypress’s natural splendor”. They didn’t want to spend a red scale on paint - fine. At least be honest about it. So I have to look at this 3-foot wide knot in the side of my wall all day, every day.*

*The window and desk.*

*At least I have the window. Still raining out today, so not much consolation there. After I make it through this weekend I should request use of my vacation hours. Don’t know how many I have saved up, but if I really need to I can dip into my wages for an extension. Then again, if the rain doesn’t let up that won’t matter.*

*Well, back to it then. Ambrosia ration. Gross. It’s supposed to be like fruit salad, but I don’t think they use fruit. Seems more like grubs in a sickly sweet and savory sauce. Not a fan, but it’ll fill me up.*

*Another beetle.*

*Fine…*

*…*

*Right, likely a bark beetle. Like THAT narrows it down. Time to open the encyclopedia. This is gonna be a while…*

## 38 Hours Remaining

*Still no end in sight to the beetle onslaught. Why am I still getting beetles? The odds of it are so low I can’t even…*

*I’ll open up the Collector Stream Channel in another window. Maybe they have some insight. At the very least, the ads will keep me awake.*

The data collector opened a new tab on their browser for the collector stream. The window filled with dozens of Fold Sigils, advertisements, and illustrations of bugs. Some electro-folk intermission music played in the background as a timer counted down the seconds till the stream’s next segment. It read 5:34. Then 5:33, and so on.

The collector sighed and clicked on an ad amidst the sea of other banners and flashing icons. It featured the huge jaws of a tiger beetle in front of an ornate flask with the words *Tiger Beetle Energy Drink* emblazoned above both. The bottle was made of sap glass and encircled by copper-colored, metal ornamentation reminiscent of vines, wings, and beetle horns. Its liquid, as seen through the gaps in the metallic wrapping, was a glowing, blue-green concoction colored similarly to the shell of the drink’s eponymous beetle. Below the title read the brand’s slogan, “Live Fast! LIVE FASTER!!”

As the collector clicked on the ad, another sub-window popped up with their account information, balance, and two buttons: accept and decline. The decline button was noticeably smaller than the accept one, and went unused as the collector confirmed their purchase. The tiny window morphed into a friendly, virtual rhinoceros beetle. It winked cartoonishly at the data collector in appreciation, its word bubble exclaiming, “Thank you! Your purchase is on its way.” The rhino beetle skittered to the corner of the screen, serving as a delivery status indicator. It ambled along in place, as though in a hurry to get nowhere fast. A series of bars above it indicated the current step of the delivery. For now, only the first bar was filled and topped with the word *Ordered*.

The channel timer read 3:48. Another pop-up window appeared. It read, “You have a number of unused dessert vouchers. Would you like to redeem one and add it to your order?”

*Ugh, the milkshake vouchers again. No, I do not want your flavorless, beet milk slushes.*

*Hard pass.*

The collector clicked the tiny decline button. The window turned into another rhino beetle, this time frowning with its mandibles. Its word bubble read, “Are you sure? You have declined this offer 73 times. Would you like to order one for later?”

*73? Wow, I guess I’ve been working more than I thought. Definitely time for a vacation. But first, to take care of this thing…*

As the collector went to click decline once more, they noticed the button was gone. They grabbed the window with their cursor to see if it was a graphical glitch, but to no avail. The only change was the expression of the rhinoceros beetle who began crying pixelated tears like an underfed virtual pet. It exclaimed, “No! Don’t throw me away!”

*I hate this targeted advertising. Lemme see if I can get rid of it…*

The collector pulled the window to the trash bin at the bottom of the screen. The rhino beetle’s expression intensified, and its virtual tears flowed more heavily in turn, like a pair of rushing faucets. As the collector let go of this beetle, it successfully disappeared into the trash. After a moment though, the bin began jostling back and forth. The collector right clicked it, and selected the option *Empty Trash*. The bin made an brief shriek, followed by an intense, muffled combustion. The lid rattled and its sides bowed out for a moment. A sizzling sound accompanied a thin trail of smoke snaking its way out from from under the lid. The collector stared blankly at their screen in disbelief. It glowed a quiet, fluorescent blue throughout the darkened apartment.

*W-what the hell was that? Why would they program that in? Just to make me feel bad?*

After shaking off the shock, they began distracting themself with a bleary-eyed review of the initial order. The *Out for Delivery* bar was almost full, but the status beetle beneath it was no longer walking. It was looking over its shoulder at the smoking trash can, formerly the incinerator of its fallen comrade. The collector clicked on the seemingly stunned delivery beetle, only to bring up an expanded summary of the order. When they closed the summary, the beetle marched once more as though nothing had happened. Before the collector could give it another thought, the countdown timer went from :01 to :00.

The stream’s chilled-out intermission music gave way to vibrant, mock-war pop rock. Screeching tech-guitars and large drums made a powerful base for ethereal chanting, and samples of buzzing bees melded with horns added extra warmth and fullness. This combination gave the theme the feeling of a Sunday night sports channel. The intro’s overly vibrant, bold typeface read:

## DATA COLLECTION TONIGHT

The text was surrounded by streams of ones and zeros, as well as glowing squares representing bits of data flying around. Then, the title card gave way to a sweeping camera pan over an applauding audience towards three seated hosts. Two of the hosts wore butterfly-scale-laden blazers, and the third a dress made of flower petals and moth scales. They all smiled toothy grins as the camera closed in. The camera focused on the right member of the three who wore a tailored, blue morpho butterfly suit. It glittered a strange, translucent grey-blue under the studio lights, a trick of the eye inherent in the morpho’s scales. His short, dark hair shimmered with a sheen of unnatural pearlescence. After the applause died down, he spoke to the camera.

“Welcome to another installment of the Kaleidoscope’s Review Series! On your personalized stream, we’re playing-“ The host’s confident, practiced diction gave way to an overlaid dubbing by another voice. The former mouthed some vague nonsense while the sound clip of a supremely underpaid, half awake intern mumbled, “Data Collection… Tonight.”

*Personalized stream... More like cookie cutter stream. They just make the same show for dozens of different jobs and hobbies. Then they dub over whatever parts as needed and fill the rest with the occasional news segment.*

Applause followed the placeholder for dubbing, and the host continued. “I’m your host Roger Stillwell, and I hope you are too!” The audience laughed a knowing laugh and cheered at this apparent catchphrase. The data collector rolled their eyes and moved the stream to the corner of their screen. They began working once more while trying to stomach both the rations and the show’s host.

*Dear Roger Stillwell,*

*I hate your jokes and I hate you.*

The service hatch in the ceiling at the other end of the apartment opened. Out of it descended a fluttering, suitcase-sized beetle clutching onto a canister. The diamond-shaped chip adhered to its back was lined with a series of lights blinking in sequence, and its cables snaked their way into the various gaps of the beetle’s chitin. The drone buzzed its way over to the collector and placed its package on the desk. The collector opened the tube and removed its contents without so much as looking at the drone hovering beside them. When the tube was empty, the collector closed it and tapped the top twice. In response, the chip on the beetle’s back blinked orange, then green. The beetle retrieved the now empty canister and made its way to the open hatch before ascending back into the service channels. The door closed soon after. The status beetle in the corner of the collector’s screen crawled out of view as the transaction concluded.

The data collector removed the dried leaf wrapping of their delivery, revealing a bottle of Tiger Energy. Its copper-colored, curvilinear design and glowing, teal contents made it the nicest looking thing in the apartment. The collector popped the cork top of the bottle. Its liquid fizzed and a jet of blue-green carbonation *fwoomped* out of the bottle’s mouth. After a moment, the drink settled. The data collector took a swig and grimaced. The drink’s biting fizz and acidity was only matched by its overly-sweet and tangy flavor. Drinking Tiger Energy was like getting struck by lightning in a citrus grove.

*Data Collection Tonight* droned on and on in the background as the collector continued to identify beetles and take swigs from his frightening brew. The hosts talked about market prices, their love lives, and how rewarding it was to help their servants convert to the Fold in lieu of giving them tips.

*Submit.*

*Correct. Give me a spider.*

*…*

*Dammit.*

## 35 Hours Remaining

The collector clicked madly at the image galleries and encyclopedia entries on their screen. Their eyes were bloodshot from both lack of sleep and staring at their screen all day. The stream still played in the background as the segments rolled on and on, and though the stream had gone on now for three hours not a single segment referenced data collecting. So far there had been 15 ad spots, 4 product-driven testimonials, 5 freeform discussions, and 2 fluff pieces.

Then, as the collector contemplated closing out the tab, one of the hosts gestured to a large screen beside them. It was titled with the words *Data Collecting Update*. Bullet pointed tips appeared beneath the header, each line being doled out letter by letter as though being typed hurriedly by another underpaid intern. The tips were as follows:

Be sure to eat, drink, and sleep

Keep up that multiplier

Use energy drinks or coffee for the long haul

Utilize any unused dessert vouchers for a sweet treat

Have fun!

The data collector stopped typing or clicking, but instead stared blankly at the stream in the corner of their screen. After showing the tips for long enough, the camera cut back to the hosts, who smiled and laughed raucously. The collector closed the tab, ending the hours of background content that served as an undercurrent of distraction. The apartment fell silent, save for the gentle hum of the computer, its susurrations a constant reminder of what was still in store.

## 28 Hours Remaining

In the wee hours of the morning the data collector listlessly clacked away at their keyboard, their head bobbing and lolling from the ravages of exhaustion. Fluorescent blue light still filled the apartment, its shape morphing like stymied moonlight eclipsed by the collector’s weaving head. Rain still peppered the window as the city slumbered peacefully, with whatever sunrise this hazy morning could offer still hours away.

*Submit.*

*…*

*Correct. Now… please give me a spider. Gimme a moth, anything. I’ll even take a cicada if it’ll keep me from-*

*Beetle.*

*…*

*I’m never going to escape these beetles. I need to make it through one more day. I can’t go any further than that, I need a vacation. I don’t even care about the rain anymore, I just need out.*

They retrieved another ration from their footlocker. It was one of three remaining, so they opened the store to restock. Its window was comprised of almost entirely of ads, sprinkled with help and contact forms, and dotted with actual ration packages. They selected the basic package for two weeks and added it to their cart. Exhaustion reared its sleepy head once more, causing the collector’s eyes to close and their body to begin slumping onto their desk. Sleep would soon be the victor at this rate, so they decided to put their groggy fate into the hands of a more capable power than themself. They scrolled to the top of the page and found the iconic Tiger Energy once more, its beetle mascot’s mandibles powerfully gnashing before the alluring bottle of elixir. The collector clicked on the banner and their cart appeared. As they went to click the accept button the collector paused, and after a moment adjusted the order. The quantity of Tiger Energy went from x1 to x3.

*That should do it. Just for today, no more. Just one more run and it’s over.*

The data collector clicked *Accept*, and the delivery beetle once more thanked them and scuttled to the corner of the screen. The collector sighed, and warmed up their ration. As the ration’s heating element did its thing, they opened the home page of their data collecting program. Its options included panes for employee information, job reviews, pay stubs, the collection identification portal, the encyclopedia, and other various tools and resources.

The collector navigated to the forms for time off requests. Instead of lining up the forms as a series of relevant links, the system organized the requests as products and packages. The images and pricing were laid out like options for renting a timeshare. This page, too, was inundated with ads, but their content was focused differently than those of the meal app. They focused on weekend getaways and personal entertainment packages. These latter, more domestic packages included anything from new channels for streaming to entertainment appliances and services.

The ad that stood out among the rest, as it took up a quarter of the right side of the screen, was a sultry silhouette of a person posing against bright pink, orange, and yellow clouds. The text above the gyrating, androgynous figure read, “Need company? We come to your door and into your...” The text continued beneath the figure, “heart.” As the collector’s cursor passed over the ad its background filled with hearts and the silhouette gave the viewer a come hither gesture.

*Subtle. I can’t bother with companionship right now, and even if I could I wouldn’t. Something about a romance delivery service feels… wrong. But I suppose it’s easier than using funds to make your way to the Kaleidoscope to socialize, or pay for premium social sites.*

The collector scrolled past the ad to the bulk of time-off requests and compared their options. The time limits of each package were anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 days, the latter of which was exorbitantly more expensive than the former.

*Maybe just a couple of days. I could a ferry out to the Edge and see the Marsh. Haven’t been outside the Dome since Mom saved up and ferried us all out through Snake Creek. I’ll book the tickets when I finish up. Just… One more day.*

## 4 Hours Remaining

Torrents of rain battered the window of the data collector’s apartment. Midday in the Swamplands gave way to sheets of precipitation and charcoal grey cloud cover. The spectrum of lights throughout the city struggled against the downpour. Lamplights twinkled weakly high up on the Spires like so many dying stars, and they dappled random alleyways below like blobs of honey bobbing in a sea of tar.

*The knot in the wall. The window and desk. The bed. The door.*

The collector sat at their desk, plunking away at their keyboard clumsily. Ration trays littered the floor, and mostly empty bottles of Tiger Energy lined the corner of the desk, their glass and metal glinting in the blue fluorescence. On the computer screen a confirmation window of a successful submission popped up. Points were tallied and added to the collector’s total funds. Then, another image appeared. An ornate puzzle box made of many kinds of wood and lined with glowing sections popped up in the middle of the screen. The collector stared at the digital box, silently taking it in. The soft roaring of raindrops against the Plant raged on.

After what seemed like an eternity of contemplation, the collector clicked on the puzzle box. Its various sections slid apart, and the glowing strips filled with a strangely beautiful ooze, making them shine even brighter than before. The box’s hidden machinations shifted as its lid opened, revealing a diamond shaped ticket. The stylized ticket fluttered out of the box. It read: *72-Hour Wage Multiplier x2*.

*What?*

The data collector rubbed their eyes and clicked on the ticket. It dissolved into a glittering stream of data and zipped over to the multiplier bar in the corner of the screen. The current multiplier doubled, and its timer increased by 72 hours.

*Wait, it isn’t supposed to go higher than x32. It’s stacking with the other 72-hour ticket. And it even extended the total duration. So if I were to keep working for few more days…*

They paused, looking out their window. The storm raged on and, as though answering any doubts of its intensity, a burst of lightning filled the night sky. The collector instinctively flinched, and a second later thunder rumbled throughout the darkened city.

The collector turned around and looked at their door. The sign above the lintel was dark, aside from the blue of the computer screen bathing the wall in a pale light. They turned back to their computer, and navigated to the time-off section of their employee portal. They scrolled down past the sea of ads to the weekender packages. After scrolling through the pricing of each package, they looked back to the corner of their screen. The timer of their multiplier read 76:18:34, and counted down the seconds thereafter.

The collector scrolled back to the top of the page, and clicked on an ad for Tiger Energy. They increased the quantity of their order and pressed *Submit*, turning the window once again into a delivery status beetle. The rhino beetle scurried to the corner of the screen and resumed its usual march to nowhere.

## 45 Hours Remaining

The collector powered through another entry hurriedly. The confirmation page gave way to the next request, this time for a nondescript, reddish-brown beetle. The data collector popped open their fifth energy drink and took a swig. The other bottles were strewn about the floor around their desk.

*What are you? WHAT?! I’ve been seeing you around you little cretin! I know you’re trying to mess with my flow. Fine, but you can’t beat me! Get it?! Beet?! HA, I should be the next Roger Stillwell! I’m on fire, I got this. I got this. I’m gonna find you, you puny, glorified roach…*

They opened the encyclopedia to their beetle bookmarks. When reading or scanning, the collector incessantly clicked the blank space next to each wall of text. This anxious tic caused their muscles to tighten, and their already aching wrists sent bolts of pain through their arms. But they ignored the pain, alongside the other dozen effects of overworking - the beetle was in their sights.

Or so they thought. After half an hour of scanning any relevant sections for the beetle in question the collector stopped searching. They knocked their knuckles against the tabletop of their desk, ground their teeth. Taking a particularly acrid gulp of Tiger Energy, they switched tabs on their screen.

*Damnit!! If I can’t find this one… I can’t go to a forum and ask, it’ll cost too much. And if anyone finds out my user ID and they report me, I might get a penalty on my account. Underperforming can be disastrous to your score, and even worse for your quarterly review.*

*Fine! I’ll use another skip voucher, you win. I just want you out of my sight…*

They opened their inventory tab and clicked on their voucher wallet. The skip voucher line read x0 remaining vouchers. The collector clenched their jaws, felt a heat rise up in their chest. They navigated once more to the submission pane and clicked through the gallery of images associated with the beetle.

*It’s just a beetle! It isn’t special, it isn’t unique. It can’t spin webs or fly very fast or do anything other than gnaw on wood. IT’S JUST A DAMN BEETLE!*

They hovered their cursor over the submission box and clicked once. A blinking bar awaited their answer, reappearing every second like a ticking clock. As the collector was about to type, a separate window popped up. This one was in the shape of another friendly rhino beetle, and its word bubble filled with text. It said, “Hey! You still have a number of unused dessert vouchers. Why don’t you take a break and have a delicious shake on us?”

The collector’s eye twitched. Their cursor shot to the corner of the beetle’s window to close it out. It zipped out of the way and giggled, saying, “Oh no no! You can’t get rid of me that easily!” The collector chased after it frantically, mistakenly closing out tabs and selecting pieces of text on the way. The beetle laughed audibly with a high-pitched voice, taunting the collector. As the pursuit rose to a fever pitch the collector faked out the beetle and swung their cursor to where it was headed. But as their cursor landed on it the beetle it gave a look of fear, extended a set of wings out from under its elytra, and fluttered off screen. In that instant, the data collector misclicked. They accidentally pressed the *Submit* button next to the empty submission box. Time slowed down as the next page loaded. It showed the submission status: *Incorrect*. The total multiplier in the corner of the screen went from x64 down to x4, leaving only the doubled-up 72-hour multiplier.

The data collector shot up from their chair with shaky knees and yelled at the screen, “NO! NO DAMMIT NO!!” They picked up an empty bottle of Tiger Energy and hurled it at the knot in the wall. It shattered, and its metal frame fell to the ground with a *thunk* and rolled toward the door.

The collector breathed staggered breaths in-between intermittent lip smacking and wiping sweat from their brow. They slumped to the floor beneath the knot in the wall and began weeping openly. Sobbing between hoarse coughs and painful gulps for air, they lay in the shadows of their apartment. Their legs stuck out into the pale light as their feet bumped awkwardly into the bed frame before them.

*I can’t keep doing this. I’m so miserable and I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t remember where I am, or where I was before. All I have are scrambled snippets of a life before, and even that feels more and more like a dream every day.*

*Why can’t I just be okay with walking away? I… I don’t want this.*

*I want out.*

The collector looked up at the darkened sign above the lintel. Then, over to the window. The rain fell steadily outside, a warning to those seeking adventure. It pattered on and on, as though saying, “Perhaps another day then?” The data collector took a few deep breaths, wiped away the tears, and proceeded to get up. They leaned on the chair beside them for support and, after a few moments of struggle, got to their feet.

After catching their breath and refocusing themself, they sat down at their desk. The screen was still on the submission status window with the result *Incorrect* filling the middle of the screen.

*I remember when being wrong meant I didn’t get to go out with friends or get an allowance. Mom would slave away at the factory and come home to another one of my failed tests. She’d just hang her head and say, “I’m not mad, I’m just disappointed.” And I was devastated. I thought it couldn’t get any worse than that shame.*

*So I made my own way. I dropped out of school and pooled my money with some friends in hopes of starting a business in the Marketplace.*

*I was wrong once more. Once I gave them my savings, I never saw those friends again. Without a scale to my name or a place to live, I made my way to the Plant for work. It was fine, for a while...*

The collector sighed and switched tabs to the employee portal. They selected the time off menu and scrolled past the companions and media stations to the weekender packages. Then, their eyes caught a deal slightly further down the list. They scrolled down to it: a discounted ferry and local flight 10-day package.

*It’s cheaper than usual, but way out of my budget. Or, at least I’ll have made a lot less from this whole ordeal than I would’ve liked…*

*But I need to get out of here, longer than a day or two. I just want to wake up somewhere far away from these four walls.*

They closed their eyes, took a deep breath, and clicked on the 10-day package. After a couple seconds, they opened one eye, then the other. A new window came up, one unfamiliar to the collector. It had the standard *Accept* and *Decline* buttons, but added other, more pertinent information as well. Text above the buttons read as follows:

## We are experiencing a

## larger than average number

## of orders at this time.

## Est. Wait Time: 1 Month

The collector squinted their bloodshot eyes at the notification. Its pinkish-red text sat like a stone in the middle of the window, half-warning and half-apology.

*Wait time? What do you mean wait time? Wait for what? How can they have too many orders? The ferry makes plenty of trips, and all I need to do is walk out the door. I get a couple of days, sure. But a month? Dammit…*

Closing out the screen, they scrolled up to the weekender packages. After selecting one they proceeded to scan the details of the confirmation window, only to see a familiar warning before them.

*2 months? What the hell?! I didn’t even know they had wait times on time-off packages, and now this? This is beet crap! I just want a couple of days…*

*Fine fine fine, I’ll look into single day passes. And if I stay out late enough I’ll pay the overage.*

They opened a single day package. Its notification read *Est. Wait Time: 3 Months*.

The collector tensed once more and tapped their desktop with two fingers impatiently. They scrolled up to the top of the time off packages. This time they selected a 10-minute package with bated breath. The order window popped up, and its notification read *Est. Wait Time: 6 Months*. The data collector froze.

*What is going on? Why would they make us wait on a 10-minute break, let alone for 6 months? What if there’s an emergency or I need to go talk to HR? What if I want to go to the store? Or visit somebody?*

*6 MONTHS?*

The data collector gave the screen a quizzical look. They scrolled back down to the single day package and opened it. Its notification now read *Est. Wait Time: 9 Months*. They closed the pane and scrolled down to a weekender package, whose notification read *1 year*. They frantically selected package after package to find one that was currently available, but each new order caused the notification’s wait time to go up further and further. They clicked on the 10-minute package once more. Its notification read *Est. Wait Time: 4 years 6 Months*.

The collector laid their head down on the desk stared off into nothingness for a good while. They lost focus in the grain of the wall beside them, its aimless patterns only grounded by the immense knot dominating the middle of the expanse.

*The knot in the wall.*

*…*

*They must be punishing me for underperforming. I thought I was doing a good job, but I must be lagging behind. The only way I’m getting on that elevator and leaving this place is by erasing my work debt.*

The collector picked up their head from the desk and turned to the unlit sign above the lintel, then back to the computer.

*Or…*

They opened the bathroom app. Its wait time was 1 minutes 42 seconds.

*Better. Now if I calculate the overage charge for being a whole day late from the bathroom…*

*Wow, that is ludicrous. Maybe I can get away with an hour or two.*

*That’s… doable. Not great, but way better than half a decade of waiting.*

As they counted down the seconds till vacancy their cursor hovered over the *Submit* button. With less than a minute remaining the collector shifted their cursor away.

*How will I get down? I didn’t make a formal time off request, so I won’t be able to get the elevator doors open. I need to have the doors open when I leave for the bathroom. Dammit…*

*No, it’s fine. I just need to order an oversized package. They’ll send it on the back of a larger delivery beetle instead of a drone. Then they’ll have to use the elevator.*

*Missed that bathroom slot. It’s fine, I need to make an oversized order anyways.*

They were pricing out a bulk order of rations when inspiration struck. They opened their digital voucher wallet. Their dessert voucher line read x44 vouchers. The collector redeemed all of them, to be delivered immediately. The window morphed once again into a rhino beet, whose face lit up with an expression of joy. Its text read, “I’m so glad you’ve reconsidered! I hope you enjoy your sweet treat.” The beetle made its way to the usual corner of the screen.

*Good. That way I can save a bit on this slapdash vacation. Now, to wait for the order and time a bathroom request to coincide with the delivery. As far as the return trip… I’ll cross that road when I come to it.*

8vcxy3,1,2018-07-01,bothered and upset because my SO is going out with her friends and she’s not inviting/bringing me.,orangejuicepenguin,BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8vcxy3/bothered_and_upset_because_my_so_is_going_out/,"Hello, I don’t know where to share what I’m feeling right now. Maybe a piece of advice can help. 
 
I’m (Lesbian 22yrs. Old) diagnosed with BPD back in 2014 (and I just started my therapy again last week). My SO (20 yrs old) and I were living together in an apartment since 3rd yr college. I just graduated, and she’s still in her 4th yr doing her internship.  
  
I started to feel bad again since graduating, crying endlessly, feeling lost, not knowing what to do, I cannot control my emotions, and my SO is so patient with me, she’s probably the most understanding person I’ve been with. I can feel she really love me, and now I’m afraid I might lose her because I’m like this. 
 
So here, my SO got invited by her friend to an exclusive party of her friend’s friend, and I’m not. That night knowing that she will go there without me made me feel sad and a little bit paranoid she might cheat bcs of my past issues with my ex who cheated on me (i know past is past, and I trust my SO, but sometimes it just so hard to deal with my trust issues). I just don’t understand why I felt unwanted because she didn’t ask her friend if she can bring me, i know I’m crazy, I’m so attached to her and i got used to being with her every time she’s going out with her friends because she’s always inviting me to come along. I cried that night, but she clearly explain the situation that it’s an exclusive event, and i handled it well and went to sleep.  
  
My SO went and I entirely handled the situation (even though I felt empty) by distracting myself watching movies and doing other stuff while waiting for her to come home. 
 
Fast forward to the day after the night of the event. There’s another overnight party by her friend, and she’s invited again, and she didn’t ask me if I want to come. I don’t wanna control her and tell her not to go or ask her if i can go because i don’t wanna sound needy but it  kinda ended up that way, i cried in front of her and told that “i feel like you don’t want me around when you’re with your friends anymore” and she replied “of course i do, i like being with you” and i said “if you really want me being with you at first why didn’t you invite me to come with you” and she asked “what do you want me to do? Okay i will ask X if you can come” and she also told me that she’s shy to ask her friend if she can bring me and i suddenly snapped and told her “no, just tell me if you don’t want me being with you anymore” and I didn’t mean it, after that i cried a lot, circulated with the same argument telling her that she’s just gonna ask her friend if i can come because i already told her what i feel and i just wanna be with her, but I don’t wanna suffocate her. I know I’m so pathetic and needy for saying those things to her, but I cannot control my emotions. 
  
I started getting help from my therapist last wk for myself but also mainly to maintain and keep my relationship with my girlfriend hoping for a healthy relationship because I love her so much and I don’t want to lose her, and I’m afraid that she might get tired and abandon me because I’m like this. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to scar my girlfriend or get her traumatized because of my BPD. I want to become better. I wish I’m not like this. I want a happy simple normal life with my girlfriend. 
 
Thanks for reading my lengthy post. I wish someone can enlighten me.

Are there any open DnD groups around here? I'm not a newbie but I'm no veteran either. I've played DnD 2e and 5e as well as Pathfinder and a couple rounds of Warhammer RPG, but I'm totally up to learn a new game too."
8ve366,1,2018-07-01,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ve366/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
  
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
8vecge,4,2018-07-01,I have always tried to be strong for my own sake but i don't know how long i can continue.,NotRealBalarka,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8vecge/i_have_always_tried_to_be_strong_for_my_own_sake/,"[I would like to apologise in advance for my bad english and for any things i might have said repetitively and such i have never done this before and i am also new to reddit and this is my first ever post here]

Its 5:23am here as i am writing this on my phone and its just another night that i am not able to sleep cause so many things keep me up. I don't know how to deal with anything all so i end up doing is playing video games or watching youtube as escape from reality. I feel helpless and alone with no power to change anything.

I am studying in a law college for which my family has taken a loan but i am afraid about my future and if i will even be able to pay my debts and sustain myself, my family (just me and my parents) have been dealing with financial issues and barely make ends meet. 

They have so many expectations from me but i am barely able to maintain my results to provide them even barely any relief. The holidays we were given this time i was not even able to go for any internships since most internships for law are not paid and so i couldn't afford to have one as things have been specially hard this year for us and i didn't want to burden my father any more. But i have been unable to cope up, i am not able to express or talk to my family about any of these problems as they will not understand any issues with mental health and  we cant afford any medical treatment for this anyway. 

I just don't know how i will survive and i am worried about my family over that. I am unable to sleep or maintain a routine and do anything productive. i feel useless and pathetic. Helpless as i am i don't think i can fulfill any expectations my family have of me. "
8veuop,4,2018-07-01,She[F 24] was and still is the love of my[M 26] life and I miss her so very much,KingKeithDA,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8veuop/shef_24_was_and_still_is_the_love_of_mym_26_life/,"This is really just a post where I hope to vent. If you feel like reading, you can do so, if not that's ok, too. It will be a two part post, the first covering our first year together and the second cover our second year.

I met her May of 2016 at a time in my life when I had just got over two really horrible relationships with girls who lied and cheated... I remember being on the couch in my apartment (I had just finished my first year in graduate school btw) feeling really awful about the last girl and I was on my facebook and saw this cute girl who I friended thinking nothing of it. Moments later, she messages me, complementing me on my physique (I was really into bodybuilding). We got to talking and I was immediately drawn to this girl cause she was incredibly smart and understood my humor quite well which she was drawn to along with my intelligence. She gave me her number that night and my world, which had once been so gray and dull, once again was saturated with radient light.

I was so incredibly happy. I was so excited to talk to her every single day and when I saw her name roll in through a text on my phone, I was filled with joy and excitiment! I remember the first time I talked to her on the phone was when I was on the highway driving back to school from my hometown. I was a little nervous, but my jokes were definitely on point and she laughed and we both have a horrible sense direction (I took a wrong exit) so we clicked like bread and butter. She loved science and went to school for dietetics, so she knew about dieting and just about everything related to science, in general. My background is in applied stats and econ but I also love science and can talk about it for hours and hours. And that's pretty much what we did along with talking about whatever else :) Our conversations flowed so seamlessly. I couldn't believe I found this girl.

After weeks of talking and snapchatting I was hoping to get to see her in person (she lived in a town about an hour away from my University which is also where she went to school). It took so so so long to get her to see me; she was so flakey and she made my emotions go through a roller coaster. At one point, she couldn't wait to see me then all of a sudden something would come up and she would flake out and distance herself from me; I started to get sad that I'd never actually get to see her, then after not talking to her for a couple days, one night I laid it out to her, everything I felt about her, and how much I wanted to see her along with some other things which inevitably convinced her to come to my apartment one evening which was actually kind of a spur of the moment kind of event as she isnt really one to plan on seeing you... she just kind of shows up! I was so excited when she said she was near that I ran out of my apartment and met her at the little grassy area near the entrance of my complex. She picked me up and I asked her if she was hungry and if she wanted to go to IHOP - she was a small town girl so didnt really eat out much and she had a lot of anxiety with being around people, so we ended up just going through the rally's drive through and I just got something to eat. We went back to my apartment and ended up watching The Witch and to my surprise, she kissed me! She had to leave about an hour later but I was so incredibly happy! I cant even describe the joy I felt! I can almost feel it right now.

We had a couple more great times together and even though she flaked out a couple more times I got her to come to my apartment to meet my buddies one night. She stayed the night and we had sex. She was a shy girl and didnt have a lot of experience... I had no experience whatsoever, but It was incredible! Once again we proved to be perfectly compatible, physically as well; it was so seamless. A few weeks later and after pulling her arm quite a few times, she finally came around and decided she wanted to become official! I was so happy! Finally , I met the girl of my dreams. She was everything to me. I loved her more than anything I ever possibly known

The first year was so great with her! We did everything together; she was the love of my life and we loved eachother with a fire and a passion im sure not many people get to experience in their lifetimes. I felt so incredibly lucky I had her. She was and is so incredibly beautiful (best figure and face; she had the whole package!)

In the fall she got a dietetics internship at the university of michigan hospital in ann arbor which was an incredibly prestigous position to have earned; she was so incredibly smart and had a 4.0 throughout her university career so it's no surprise she got it! She lived in ann arbor and I lived in Mt. Pleasant (two hours away) where I was attending my second year of graduate school at central michigan university. So we had a long distance relationship and each weekend either I would go to her or she would come to me. When we got together after being apart for that week, sparks would fly! We would be so happy to be reunited and the sex we had was so absolutely incredible it was as if our souls intertwined. We had such a great time eating places and just laying low, together, watching movies or whatever. She often had to work on the weekends which was a bummer, but we still salvaged the time we had. Halloween was so great with her :))) we dressed up and stayed in and watched movies and ate candy all day - we are both inherently hermits. Christmas was the best!!! She made me a dragonball blanket (I love dragonball)!!! It was the best present I ever got. I got her a blue diamond star and silver necklace because she was my ""star"" - ""my everything from here to mars"" - coheed and cambria. The good times we had were the best of times!

In the second year I made mistakes. Mistakes that cost me the love of my life, that I am so very sorry for, and that I have learned a great deal from - ones that I will never make again. I'll cover all of it as best as I can in my next post.

Even though she is not with me now, in person, I can still feel her with me and I think about her every second of every day. She is still my everything, my burning star, and the love of my life. Shes the first one to show me what love felt like and what it felt like to be loved in return. She made me happier than anything I've ever known. I hope someday I'll be with her again. I hope so very much. Being without her is the most horrible suffering I've ever had to endure. 

I love you.

I however think that it has to be somewhat harder than that right? I mean I was looking at the job board for my school and I saw some other students who where also there and we all basically almost have the same profiles. We all work part time jobs mostly in retail. We all are part of the accounting club to what degree of participation I do not know. And the biggest thing that we have in common is that all of us do not have an internship?

My question is how hard is it really to get an internship offer? I have been told by some people at my uni that many people simply list the accounting club on their resume but many of them then do not actually attend any of the meet the firms nor do they go to the majority of office meetings as well. What are some good ways that I could give myself an advantage to my make my process a bit easier. I am planning on becoming an officer of the club but other than that and going to meet the firms I dont really know what else to do?"

The current state of the people in the Earldom is still kind of a mystery to the Earl. Him and his chancellors can only guess how much or how little to tax his people. For the sake of efficiency, a census will be conducted. This census will not only determine how many people live where, but also what their income is. This would give the earl the maximum amount of taxes, while making sure the people didn't suffer and still had enough to prosper.

**Building Markets**

In Desmond, the people produce many great goods and services but with little place to sell them. The Earl want to construct several market places at various towns like Killarney. Although it doesn't need to be the most fancy or good looking, it should a well constructed market that offer the chance for the citizens of Desmond and outside merchants to the a wide range of goods and services of Desmond.

**Building a Port**

The City of Ardmore long has been a fishing and trading centre for the earldom. But the city lacks a proper port. The Earl wishes to construct a trading port along with an ship yard. This is aimed at trading with the surrounding Irish neighbours and maybe with England. The ship yard will be used to build small trade and fishing vessels, with the possibilities of building Gallies for the Earl's Navy.

**Roads**

The current paths between cities and towns are mud paths, which are uneven and hard to travel on. The Earl has commissioned proper gravel paved road between major towns and fortifications. This is for shorter and safer trips made by merchants and traders, as well as it allows the Earl to move troops around much faster then on mud roads.

**Rights to resources**

The earl will now be more lenient on handing out rights to fishing hunting farming etc..... This should make the people of Desmond larger access to resources (which intern more stuff taxable)"
8vfl9q,7,2018-07-01,Amelie Mae or 1000 Kisses Deep?,cabaretcupcake,LushCosmetics,https://www.reddit.com/r/LushCosmetics/comments/8vfl9q/amelie_mae_or_1000_kisses_deep/,"Hi everyone,

I've been reading all of the reviews of these two I can find trying to decide on one of them.  I was hoping someone could guide me a little more based upon my personal scent preferences.

Favorite scent families (in no real order):

- Rose Jam: I've only ever had the shower gel, but I have gone through many of these and it's such a beautiful fragrance.

- Karma: Karma was my first Lush scent and I adore it deeply, but find that the patchouli can be a bit much for people and I work in close contact with people all day at both my job and my internship.

- Beautiful: The shower gel might have been my favorite permanent item and I'm so sad it was discontinued.

- Lord of Misrule: Spicy and sweet.  Not sure if I'd want to smell super strongly of this, but it's my favorite winter smell.

- Rockstar/Creamy Candy: I hated it at first and now I'm totally in love.  Sweet but doesn't linger enough to be cloying after using it.


Sorry for the encyclopedia length there, but I just wanted to give you guys an idea.  After reading that Amelie Mae is sort of like Rose Jam with raspberry, it sounds appealing but I don't want something super cloying.  *If* 1000 Kisses is exactly like Beautiful I'd adore it, but some say it's plastic smelling?  

What would you recommend? If there's a different one other than these two, I'm open to options.  Thanks for any help!"

[cw violence, child abuse, general disturbing content]",sadasfuckboi,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8vfm0x/my_dental_work_i_need_will_cost_me_well_over_150k/,"Background: 

Growing up my parents sort of just avoided me altogether in the scheme of my household. I have 3 biological sisters and a 4th adopted sister. I didn't really cry or complain or do anything out of the ordinary, and they never made me brush my teeth. I never formed that habit, and I know it must seem grotesque to all of you, but I wouldn't have been able to if I wanted to. I had 4 women living in my house with a bathroom that I couldn't even get into and timewise I never was forced to brush my teeth except by my sister, who much older, forcibly made my teeth bleed when she brushed for me. I never got over that as a young child and avoided brushing because I thought it was going to hurt really badly and make my teeth bleed until I was out of the age you form habits like that. I don't super blame my parents, and I'm not going to share much because I still live with them, but one of them was profoundly abusive. Beyond comprehension. He'd wake me up from the age of 4 to 16 at 5 or 6 am and make me hit and catch hundreds of baseballs sometimes twice a day, and beat me if I complained or didn't perform to his EXTREME expectations beyond the capabilities I was born with. So basically always. I might even call it depression, and these are absolutely excuses, but I ignored my teeth compared to most people and I'm sitting here blaming myself on a throwaway on reddit, when I had a profoundly broken life. Hell I didn't drink water for like 6 years. I just drank soda and milk. When I was a child my dentist told my parents I had extremely poor dental health from drinking so much milk (this is actually real, it doesn't sound like it but it is) that my baby teeth rotted out. I spent many years without any baby teeth either. If it came to my father doing anything for me, if it cost money I was a burden to him. He hated me. He still does. I haven't cried over my father in probably 4 years, since the last time he attacked me over something. He accused me of forgetting to close a door I never opened in his shop he runs, which I couldn't have possibly done, and he had forgotten he had done (because he's in his 60's). That's not really what this is about. This is about consequences. This is about a young 20 something person finding out that this neglect, abuse, and disdain for his own life came back to haunt him.

For whatever reason, a young me, did not connect cavities to poor dental health the way I should have until much later, about 6 or 7. my parents made enough that anytime I had trouble they just fixed it for me at the time and I thought it was ok. Around 13 or 14 I got braces and my dentist explained to me the importance of brushing and that for some reason I was having poor dental health up until that point. He asked me how often I brushed and I said at most 3 or 4 times a week, most of the time never; Which as I mentioned before, makes sense, every day my father made me participate in his absurd fantasy of having a sports star, and every day I suffered. He didn't always make me hit balls or pitch etc, sometimes he'd make me run multiple miles as a young child, for ""punishment"" for absurd made up garbage. It's important to note that you will no doubt ask, how did you not get taken away? Because I am from bumfuck nowhere, where my dad knew the chief of police and many police personally and they never believed me. Same goes for sports coaches in middle school, high school, and little league. In fact for a lot of those little league times, my dad was the coach, and he had such profound disdain that I wasn't very good that my most intense memory of my life includes being beaten senseless after my dad promised me if I scored he'd take me to dairy queen. He didn't tell me why he beat me, he told me I should know why he hurt me that I had embarrassed him in front of so many people's parents that they hate him because of me. He was expressing disdain for my speaking with friends in the dugout, something 5 or 6 year olds do.  Another memory of my father was being beaten senseless, without exaggeration, for crying when another player in that same year pounded my head with a baseball bat. Because ""boys shouldn't cry"". Snot is literally pouring out of my face right now and I can remember looking him in the eyes crying volume beyond anything a child should ever cry, and for thousands of days of my life crying like that, probably every single day for 14 years or more, and on most of those days he'd beat me and hurt me and continue to do so because crying was a sign of weakness, and not a completely fucking normal response to absurd abuse. 

I neglected everything in my life not just my teeth, I should have easily been valedictorian in high-school, and should have been in fact valedictorian. But circumstance meant that I was so profoundly afraid of adults for most of my life that any sign of disciplinary action or yelling would sometimes make me break down and cry just as horribly as I described before. Why did nobody help me? It's not like I didn't ask? I was literally bullied by my own teachers for 3 years in middleschool, and the only nice thing my father ever did was use that absurd rage to threaten one of them into leaving me alone. I don't know why for so many years I've let this go but I'm sitting here crying harder than i've ever cried before. On reddit, talking to nobody. I remember at a specific summer camp for children who were gifted I took a speaking and presentation class with a psychologist and he pulled me aside and discussed my problems for a few moments on the last day and he hinted that he knew something was wrong and I just remember this weird disturbing scene where I was balling out of one eye because when confronted with anything by an grown man in most cases I was going to be beaten, and then further beaten for crying. 

So basically my whole life i'm this ball of volatile stress that goes off and screams and cries and begs for help, and is LARGELY despised for it. Nobody believed me. I called for help, I was ignored or outright told to suck it up by so many people that I honestly can't believe I made it to adulthood. I would be crying and crying and begging for help but they'd just shush me and tell me that I was insane for crying over something so small. I was shouted down by everyone. I remember I had a friend in an economic situation profoundly below mine tell me he wished he lived with my dad, and I looked him dead in the eyes with the greatest jealousy I believe a person could possibly experience, sighed, and said me too. I prayed every night for nearly 10 years to be set free, to be saved. I tried to save myself. It never worked. I was hurt. I was fucked. It was pre-internet times it's not like I could have found somebody to help me back then, I only knew about neopets man. My own mother didn't believe me or plain gaslighted me my entire life. I'd tell her everything he did crying begging please, anything. She'd tell me my father was too loving of a man to have ever done that to me. She still to this day refuses to god himself that my father ever hurt me. He would basically torture me when I was somewhere between 8 and 11. He had these weird excercises that were so painful. It would be describable as endurance training but to a degree that was done by a mentally ill psycopath who thought he could make a small boy who was never not the shortest, smallest person in his class until he was a grown adult. I didn't even grow until I was 18. I wish I could share pictures of me on my travel team I pitched on, I was 4'11 at most pitching for a highschool travel team at 12 I think? And you might say wow you must have been really good! It was almost guaranteed done as a favor to my father and to help him with his greedy fucking fantasy I wanted nothing of. 

Interesting tidbit: I was a nationally ranked competitor in another sport and was never once told good job by my father sincerely. He'd say great great great, nice /u/sadasfuckboi, I'm really glad. And tell me how much he wished I liked baseball that much. He then went on to ruin that sport for me so I'd have more time for baseball, until I revisited it in my later teens. 

I used to want to be a girl as a young young boy. I know now that I just wanted anything in my mind that I thought would prevent my father from hurting me. He never touched, yelled at, or hurt any of my sisters. I would have given anything in this world to be a girl just because it meant my father couldn't hurt me. My situation was so hopeless I was praying to god to be made a girl so my dad couldn't hurt me, because the police, my extended family, my direct family, and my school among many numerous other unnameable people in grandeur wouldn't believe me or take the small inconvenience to listen to me. the \*one\* time the police came to my home my older sister called them and my father looked me in the eyes and said ""i'll kill you before I let them take you away from me, I'll never let you get away from me, I'll never let you go."" He made me lie to the officer and I just tried to describe the way my father treated me in code and the officer didn't understand because he was dumb as fuck. I only needed him to hear what I was saying. I made up obvious lies about how nice he was to me, and I literally did this while my dad sat behind the door to my home listening and I knew that because he was tall enough to see his head through the little window at the top of the door. I don't remember what I said because I was quite young but I believe with no doubt in my mind if I had actually told the officer the truth while my dad was there that he'd have killed me for sure. 

My whole life they looked at me crying and breaking down over things and thought I was just annoying or were disgusted with me, shouted me down, didn't believe me, wouldn't listen to me. I couldn't take care of my teeth, I was too busy taking care of my life.I was beaten within inches of death before, bleeding and covered in knots and bruises. My mom just tuned it out I guess. Maybe she was afraid too. Maybe she still is. I don't know. I only know that he hurt me for sure. He'd beat me til I was black and pelt me with baseballs like stones until my eyes swelled up. I was always frail, small, and slow and I never got away from him. The one time I ran away he tried to make sure the police shamed me beyond reprieve. And by ran away I went straight to my mom. He was making me run like 5 miles or some absurd distance as a punishment for yelling at him about wanting to go home and I remember trying to explain to the police that as soon as we'd left he'd take me and beat me and they were like ""he said THIS was your punishment, my son would be HAPPY to take that as a punishment.""

I know I was originally pretty sad about my teeth. But now I'm pretty sad about everything. I just want the life I could have had without my dad. The life everyone deserves. I used to be woken up by a cup of water everyday and even to this day if you sneak up on me while I'm not paying attention I'll scream and gasp because the number of times I was grabbed by the hair or absolutely suplexed, slammed, or punched in the neck numbers in the thousands. 

other important sad times in my life to note.

1. did not get into a college program for young people that my parents agreed to send me to if I got in despite being offered that elsewhere but they wouldn't let me go
2. Was supposed to skip from 5th to 9th grade but my father wouldn't let me so I could fulfill his absolutely stupid fantasy of a sports start son (which never happened, and then literally happened and he ignored it because he didn't give a fuck about the sport)
3. had an ACT and gpa in the top 98&amp;#37; and they wouldn't let me apply to the schools I wanted to go to (very far away). and contributed to my negative experience in college when I went to a school nearby and hated my life because I had been forced into it instead of studying in hawaii thousands of miles away from my abuse. It wasn't bad at first but it got worse and worse. 
4. found out 10 years of ritalin has ruined what I had left of my teeth and that despite constant brushing as an adult and attempts to fix them that I will eventually lose my teeth no matter what and the pain I experience from it is so absurd that I just kind of wish I lived anywhere else in the civilized world but the USA. Where I could actually afford to live, go to school and fix my teeth, have a home. Anything. I'm going to be a fucking engineer and I feel nothing but the crushing hand of economic oppression forcing me up until (august) to live with this same monster that hurt me for all those years. 
5. despite being handsome my teeth make me feel grotesque and unloveable and the people i've liked the most romantically in my life have always looked at me disgusted when I open my mouth or otherwise outright left me, no doubt because of my teeth or outright because of it. My ex literally married another man when we started dating, straight up left me and married another man within 2 months of seeing each other; I am mostly over this, who would ever forget that, but also who could love somebody after knowing they did something like that to somebody??
6. did not get an internship and had to take a semester off for a sleep disorder my parents refuse to acknowledge is real and plagues me. I need to see a doctor for this but can't afford it. I've learned to live with this and I hope I can get some sort of reduced cost medical care at my new school so I can finally sleep normally. This is my biggest problem atm and seeing a sleep specialist is something I need so bad that when I actually sleep I dream about it being fixed so I can have a normal life.
7. the only memories I have of my childhood are generally profoundly negative and traumatic. I don't really remember a lot of good things. 

good things recently though:

1. I get to leave again. I went back to school for a more fun degree in engineering and its more challenging and now i'm transferring to a better school.
2. I'll eventually be able to afford to fix my teeth if I graduate, but the degree I chose is so hard I have anxiety that I'll fail at any time all the time. 
3. I don't have a lot of debt
4. my father is nice to my nephew and he likes all the stuff my dad used to get triggered about, so my poor nephew never has to experience that ever. Not even accidentally, unintentionally etc.
5.  I plan on abandoning my family after I graduate and moving to alaska, hawaii, somewhere very far away and expensive to visit so that they can never visit me. That sounds really mean, but my mom literally let my dad abuse me for like a good 80&amp;#37; of my life. 
6. my dad stopped abusing me eventually, not because of love or anything but because the high school baseball coach hated mine and my dad's guts enough he let me quit to make some sort of irrelevant point and I never had to play again.
7. if I get my sleep schedule fixed my gpa will absolutely improve and I'll get even more money for school and I'll get a good internship leading to a good job, so I'm trying my very best to have that happen
8. I haven't cried about this or experienced any trouble with this for many years, and while tonight I cried harder than I've ever cried probably I want everyone to know that I know its not healthy to bottle things up and I'll probably see somebody when I can afford it. I didn't get an internship this summer so I'm focusing on studying instead. I can't justify working for minimum wage when I am so stressed about school, my gpa, my lack of an internship etc. and I can instead reduce that stress substantially by studying engineering. Surely that makes sense. 
9. I will succeed because if I don't i'll have to live with an abuser
10. I made it through this abuse, some of the most violent abuse I've heard of, and I am alive. I made it and I'll continue to make it I hope.
11. I am going on a minivacation tomorrow
12. If you are wondering yes I'm trying to list positives so I'll stop crying and it's not working so I'll probably just try and go to sleep!

To finish up. I have a lot of problems in my life and I was set off tonight trying to remember when this nonsense with my teeth started, relating to ritalin usage for adhd and other problems with my teeth which will be a profoundly horrific expense to pay. Nothing makes you cry harder than having profound pain in your mouth, telling your mother your dentist said you needed a root canal if it started hurting after the filling, and her looking you in the eyes and saying you have to live with it because we can't afford it.

I'm really sad and cry easy so Idk If I'll read this again

tldr; Nightmarish existence, pain and suffering, teeth suck very badly and I have taken chemicals known to cause tooth decay for adhd with already poor dental health since I didn't start worrying about teeth until it was absolutely necessary because I had other things on my plate. Now I just experienced a true breakdown for the first time in many many many years. Wish me luck I'll probably be ok to morrow but in case I'm not leave your well wishes below. I may or may not read them. "
8vfudz,5,2018-07-02,Back to square one.,guidodevito,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/8vfudz/back_to_square_one/,"I had recently battled my pot-smoking demons around the time fall 2017 semester started. After I knew I was clean I got a job in my field only to get laid off months later. 
In that period of time I worked there, I got too comfortable after the drug test month and smoked every day after work, because drug testing was very rare and pretty much raffled every few months. Right away, I made the mistake of taking advantage of that. Now I have to go back to quitting again and it’s harder than ever (first day right now) even though I’ve done it before, I dread the fact of quitting. I really enjoy it. I have a lot of anxiety, my mind runs like an engine and I get frequent mood swings and feel depressed all the time. The fact that I might have to quit for possibly forever really leaves an empty feeling.

Taking a step on my background,

I’ve smoked almost everyday since the beginning of my freshman year (2012). Me and my dad smoked together as a past time and  most of not all of my free-time is smoking with friends.
I got my certification in May 2017, my job field is machining. most people are aware that industry is strict drug test wise especially for the best paying jobs, the big aerospace companies with full benefits. It took me over a year after starting school to live up to the quitting smoking thing. I’ve delayed since summer ‘16, I knew my college had great internship program placing you in the better companies that can really be lockdown 10+ year jobs.
So around fall 2017, me and my girlfriend began dating (we worked together and things slowly clicked). I knew she smoked like I did in my prime, (daily, picking up quarters weekly) but for the first few months I remained clean, I chilled with her while she faced a blunt, shit like that. Every here and there id take a hit and would be set for a few weeks.

Once I got laid off I got back into Cracker Barrel the same day cause management literally begged my ass to come back once a week at least. I told myself I would only work temporary and use a couple weeks to clean myself out again and get back right into the Work field.
That was almost two months ago though, and my job makes me miserable because I don’t make much and I just want to be able to provide more for my lady and my momma.

Hardest part is really trying to occupy the time, weed was the easiest way to get pleasure in my brain without doing much work like exercise or basically anything productive, in addition it complemented anything productive, I’m a musician and physically active and smoking weed helped me drive myself into those passions in the first place. 

All my friends smoke, and last time I quit, I rarely saw them. When I did, we basically did nothing. Nothing to do, not much to talk about. Chill sessions were literally cut to a quarter of what they’d usually be.

I’m aware of the benefits of me quitting and this is the one block in the road from actually getting my life around. But damn. I’m just so Fucking depressed without it."
8vg6xf,3,2018-07-02,She[F 24] was and still is the love of my[M 26] and I miss her so very much part2,KingKeithDA,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8vg6xf/shef_24_was_and_still_is_the_love_of_mym_26_and_i/,"If you haven't read the part 1, please read part1: **She\[F 24\] was and still is the love of my \[M 26\] life and I miss her so very much**

As I've said, our first year together was incredible. There was enough love in that year to fill most 50 year relationships.

But a few small problems started to show themselves which I ignored early on that first year. Within the first couple of months of our relationship, while I was at a concert with my buddies she texted me with an earth shattering message: ""I think I love you more than you love me. Maybe we shouldn't be together"".... it hit me like lightning to the chest. I had to drop everything at the concert with my buddies and went outside to calm her and talk her through why she said that and get her to come back to me and stay in the relationship. I convinced her and she did.

Toward the end of that first year, these situations started to become more and more frequent and I felt like she was becoming insecure with me...I'd get these same texts while I was at work and class, many times a week. She became frustrated even when I wouldn't text her back quickly enough (within an hour) while I was trying to focus on work and thought it was because I didn't love her.... Oh, I assure you that I loved her more than anything, but I had to convince her she was wrong over and over and would inevitably always get her to stay with me. Though, over time, having to constantly do this started to really wear me down and I would start to get aggressive with her and wouldn't be empathetic to what she was feeling. I would tell her that I felt like I was rolling a bolder up a mountain trying to convince her to stay with me only for it to roll back down onto me days later, and then I would have to roll the rock up again. Being aggressive with her in this way and telling her I felt like I was wearing thin made her become even more insecure with me and made her retract emotionally; these events occurred over and over, so many times that I would almost start to predict when the next one may occur.

At some point I slightly began to lose some of my attraction for her because of these incidents and felt like I was being pushed away. When she felt me wane, it felt like she would become even more insecure with me. We also started arguing about a lot of things - politics being the main topic and I was very combative/ aggressive with my arguments and stupidly took a lot of her responses as personal attacks. My aggression would shut her down completely, emotionally. When my attraction waned, being the stupid person I am, I looked to porn to quench my sexual desires. I also started saving a lot of Instagram pics of porn stars/models into my phone and I friended girls on facebook. Just to be clear, I would never cheat on her. Not ever, because I loved her so much and I've been cheated on and I know what it feels like, and I never did cheat on her. But my behavior appeared to be heading down that path. We still had sex, but she felt crushed because she could feel my attraction fading slightly and felt like it was because I no longer found her to be physically attractive. Tangent, I assure you she is and was physically attractive - like I said, she has the body of a goddess and the face of an angel - but it was her behavior that was pushing me away from her and making me feel like I did. I also had another stupid reddit post about these events which I posted a year or so ago. Anyway, one day she got a hold of my phone one weekend and saw the porn and the pics and it hurt her so much. I was so stupid. But inevitably I got her to come around with my rationalizations (which were so wrong and so stupid looking back). I told her ""it was just a guy thing"" and that I would stop and so we went from there.

I relapsed many times and ended up becoming addicted to porn. As a result, she felt unattractive and it hurt her so much to the point where she felt emotionally damaged and she broke up with me a couple times and the second time was the worst. She was staying at my parents house for a while and she came back one day after her day at her internship, and was so incredibly sad; she talked to my mom and my dad about me and how she had to break up with me. I felt so terrible, so I came back to my home town that day after work to console her and be with her. I tried to comfort her and again was able to get her to come around; but it was a temporary fix because at this point I still didn't understand the root of the problem.

That next summer, she graduated from her program, and in the fall, we moved in together. She decided to start a graduate degree as well and I was in my last year of mine. We had a lot of really nice times together - we watched a whole bunch of anime, we spent time together studying and eating out (a lot of panda express) and listening to music and shes also a great cook so she would also cook and I would pretend to help and then eat. We went to concerts (Bruno Mars) and wed see shows together including her favorite: Phantom of the Opera. She loved me so incredibly much - I was her universe - and I loved her more than anything, too. But those occurrences didn't stop, it became even more frequent with her feeling she was not being loved. I became increasingly more and more frustrated as I was trying to balance an oppressive father who obsessed over my life, was trying to finish two master degrees (econ and stats) and was trying to roll the stone up the mountain with my girl; everything culminated with our last breakup in early April, 2018. We broke up after my interview for a Statistician position at Nissan. It was the most intense interview of my life and I had not eaten the whole day before it because of my anxiety; the interview was in my home town so I had to drive two hours for the two hour interview. The interview was in the afternoon and I felt so incredibly tired that I decided I was going to stay the night there. It was my mistake to not contact her and tell her I wasn't coming home that night; she got extremely upset about it and took it as my not caring about her and so we broke up.

After the breakup, I took some time to myself to reflect - roughly three weeks with almost zero contact with her. I spent so much time thinking about our relationship and what went wrong and I was so incredibly lonely without her and missed her so incredibly much. I started to think about my upbringing with my father and mother. My father was an intense, self made, anxiety inducing man who obsessed over my life. I grew up with him working a job in which he made six figures but that required he travel to different countries for months at a time while my mom was at home, lonely, taking care of the baby version of me. I remember as a toddler seeing her crying and pleading with him to come home and I would talk to him on the phone and always ask in a sad tone if he was coming home tonight. My dad was very neglectful of my mother and me but always told me he had to do this so my mother and I could live the comfortable life that we did.

As I grew older, my dad became an obsessive and controlling force in my life. He almost lived his life through my eyes as he pushed me to train in martial arts, wrestling, and gymnastics. I had my blackbelt at 10 years old and was at an elite level by the time I was in eighth grade in all three. At one point I was training 24 hours a week at an elite level in gymnastics and 10 hours a week in wrestling (I was varsity my freshman year; martial arts had to fall off the table). I barely had time to do my homework (but he pushed me to maintain a good gpa as well) - I barely had time to do anything but what he made me do. Because of his obsessive drive for my success in my endeavors, he continued to neglect my mother - I do not recall a time when I saw him truly show affection to her - and he failed to teach me so many important lessons about how to treat a woman. I never had a girlfriend before college. This was how I grew up. And when I finally got to university, knowing nothing about girls, I went through several groups of friends, the majority of the guys in these groups were straight womanizers... they talked about the girls they had been with, porn, who they wanted to be with... you name it, thats what we discussed. I didn't have much input because I didn't have any experience until my junior year in college in which I met a girl who i spent a brief period of time with and who inevitably lied to me and was actually seeing another guy behind my back. During my senior year, I met another girl who did the same. Now I had never had sex before at this point, and all my friends looked to me as a model man - a good disciplined guy who they actually idealized.

When I finally met the love of my life, I had almost no experience with girls... My dad never taught me how to treat girls and what I knew, I knew from my friends... I realized the problem was me!!! The reason my girl was so seemingly insecure was because I wasn't treating her like the queen she was; I wasn't giving her the attention and the affirmations she deserved: like telling her about how beautiful she was whenever I could or when she specifically did her hair or wore sexy cloths just for me - I didn't make the connection because all I knew was what I saw from my dad neglecting my mother. She would try to reach me and get my attention time after time and I didn't understand... overtime it started to make her think I didn't love her and because I never truly addressed the problem, those occurrences kept happening over and over and over and each time I failed to get it, her negative feeling and emotions started to snowball... this lead me to the porn which I believed was a normal thing for a guy from what I learned from my friends... I was so wrong! I was so so so wrong! It shouldn't have ever been about me; it should have been about making her feel like she was loved and attractive and the queen she truly was. If the porn was getting in the way of that, it wasn't a normal guy thing; it was a bad thing. I understood everything, I understood my mistakes after those revelations I had in those three weeks.

She came back from her home town one weekend which is where she was staying for those three weeks. She sat down and told me in a wavering and almost sad tone that ""she had met someone"" and that ""he was coming over that night to watch her dodgeball game"". My world came crashing down, because I didn't get a chance to tell her everything I realized and that I understood! I told her I still loved her so much and to please reconsider having him over - I was ok with him going to the game, but he was also scheduled to stay the night in our apartment that night. So that entailed me staying in the room next-door to the girl who I loved more than anything as she slept with another dude she met in the three weeks we didn't talk. I tried so hard to get her to reconsider, I did everything but she wouldn't reconsider; I felt so incredibly sad that I ended up checking into the ER that night because I was considering suicide... yes suicide... I was texting her in the time I spent in the hospital telling her everything I wish I could have had the chance to tell her without her being with him that night.

I checked out of the ER at around 5 am and I came back to my apartment. The guy had work in the morning and left around 6 am. She came to me in my room and consoled me and assured me that it was me who she wanted to be with and who she loved and who she wanted to have a family with. I felt assured that she was my girl once more (though we were not ever official again). That Friday I was in her room while she was packing for the weekend to go back to her hometown for karaoke and drinking with her family. I was ok with this and as she was packing I brought her into me and started to take her pants off because I craved her sexually. Normally she would fold like a leaf and we would have an incredible time... this time she folded but then retracted a couple times. I knew something wasn't right; she told me she felt bad because she was just with that guy and felt bad being with me - note, she also assured me that the guy she had met was a virgin and was waiting till marriage to have sex - though I was a bet apprehensive, I accepted it and she left for the weekend and told me she'd be back Sunday night.

My anxiety got to me and I began to text her a little too much because I worried she had left to see him (he lived in a town not far from her hometown) . She assured me this was not the case. I accepted it. Saturday came around and I started to feel the anxiety again! I started texting her Saturday night, incessantly, and she told me she was crying to her sister in law and didn't know what to do! She loved me more than anything, but she told me this guy also really liked her and they had kissed and that she had never not been in a relationship with someone after kissing them. I plead my case as hard as I could to get her to return to me. She told me she needed some space which I stupidly didn't give to her as I continued to text her... she returned Sunday night and everything seemed somewhat normal...

That next week was the week before finals week for her and all of her finals were take-home so she spent that week doing them and I spent that week helping her with them as well as giving her some of my adderall whenever she needed them (the courses she was taking were relatively difficult and so her finals required a lot of focus and effort). I also spent that week trying so hard to explain to her everything I realized about the problems that occurred in our relationship and how it was all completely my fault and how I understood my mistakes and was trying to change for the better. I tried my best to show her that week firsthand by spending my time with her and filling her with confidence about herself while treating her with love, kindness, and understanding. We got to the end of that week onThursday and I was a bit suspicious of her as she was texting in the corner of her bed while I was working on stuff. I tried to remain unwaivered but couldn't help but think she was talking to him even though she assured me several times that it wasn't the case.... I walked into my room and she followed... we proceeded to have the most incredible sex ever that night and then ordered dominoes and went to sleep. Come Friday night, we were cramming to finish a final that was due that Wednesday... I didn't understand why we were cramming that night so hard when there was plenty of time but she told me she was going home for karaoke again with her family that weekend. I accepted it, though I was a little suspicious... I told her I knew the guy she had been talking to cause I saw he had liked one of her facebook pics... after assuring me she wasn't talking to him, she told me at around 1 am that she had to bring a fruit salad to a cookout that her program was putting on the next day. She assured me she just wanted to go there and drop off the fruit salad and that she would be back within 15 minutes. I accepted and so we went to meijer at around 2am, got the ingredients she needed and I sat in the kitchen while she made the fruit salad she was going to bring to the cookout. We laid down around 4 am and literally had the best sex we've ever had to date (there have been some contenders, though). We got up that morning, I gave her an adderall again since she was tired and I saw that she was packing her backpack with her stuff including her computer and exam stuff... she said she was going to talk to her classmates about the final and I was completely ok with this. She needed my computer charger, though since she left hers at her house the weekend prior. That was ok with me.

I had some work that I needed to get done that day so I took an adderall as well minutes after she left... she told me she was dropping off the fruit salad and shed be back. I figured since she took her backpack that she would probably be at least an hour or two. So an couple hours pass and I realize she hadn't come back and my adderall was kicking in hardcore and I needed my computer charger so I could get my work done since my computer was dead so I contacted her through text simply asking if she was somewhere on campus where I could come to just get the charger from her - I didn't want to disturb her if she was working on her final with her friends. I got no answer, so I let another hour pass and texted her again the same thing and got no response. I texted her a half hour later and I was a bit frustrated but also worried something may have happened to her and got no response. I called and got no response. So I started driving around campus trying to find her and was extremely worried something may have happened; I did that for an hour and then contacted her friends and finally her mom who told me she was safe and that her plans must have changed as she was not planning to return that night... I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was the first time I saw my girl as someone or something that I no longer knew... I was so angered, so frustrated and so anxious! Not only was I not able to do my work since she had my computer charger, but she lied to me, she used me - my time, my drugs, my energy - and she took advantage of my trust and betrayed it! At the time I didn't know where she had gone, but later found out she picked up that guy she said she wasn't talking to and drove to Indiana to meet her Father!

I was shellshocked... I tried so hard to show her I understood the mistakes I made and that I was so sorry and that they would never happen again... and she crushed me, completely!

I got so angry that night and demanded she return with my charger! She inevitably did the next day on Sunday after my struggling to get a hold of her and ended up making it a touch and go type of situation. But I convinced her to stay because of course I still love her and I wanted her with me! She was not touchy with me any longer and that's when I knew for certain, deep down, she had been still seeing and talking to that dude. We ordered some sushi and she spent time trying to finish the remainder of her finals. I came into her room and laid next to her as she finished the final she was working on... she wasn't touchy at all... I let it slide and we fell asleep.

The next day she had a Drs. appointment and took her computer and USB drive with her to the appointment to finish up one of her finals. She ended up breaking the usb drive which held her finals data and other important files. She returned to me quickly for help and skipped her appointment and I miraculously fixed the drive and recovered her files and she was able to turn in her final that that day. I was happy as she was acting closer to me again and I felt like she was my girl again even though I still had a gut feeling there was still something else going on. Sure enough, she ended up wanting to go home that night which had me anxious, yet again! She left because she said I felt unsafe (of course I was a little overly anxious about the whole situation because I didn't know what in the hell was going on and where I stood and if she was my girl or not). She always assured me she wasn't going to see that guy and I trusted her.

Let me try to wrap it up: so this sort of thing kept happening i.e. she would go back and forth from our apartment to her home and would stay in her hometown for the weekend... it turns out she was seeing that guy and I found out the hard way after driving there one weekend to find his car there (that same morning she came to me and was laying in my bed while I was helping her with something on excel - she actually reassured me that morning that she wasn't talking to him). Long story short, I was crushed again... and then they got into a relationship shortly after... she knew him only five weeks and got into a relationship with him... the next Monday she got into an argument with him and she returned to me and I took her in and comforted her, bought us dominoes and supported her with her PowerPoint presentation she had to give the next week... I was under the impression she was breaking up with him and she assured me of this and also that she ""wasn't going to lie to me anymore"" and that she ""wasn't out to hurt me"". She stayed at our place that night but was quick to leave the next day back to her hometown to take her mom to a Drs. Appointment. She stayed there that night and then returned the next day. Things seemed ok the next day - I gave her another adderall so she could get through her presentation as she stayed up late trying to finish it - and the rest of the week seemed ok, though in the back of my mind there was always something I didn't feel good about, but she acted like she did when we together again (we were telling each other we loved one another, calling the pet names, etc.) and she assured me time and time again she wasn't going to lie to me and that she wasn't out to hurt me...

She left that weekend yet again which I felt anxious about... I found out yet again she went to see him... and she didn't break up with him at all... once again she lied to me, used me, and crushed me with little remorse! I began to think ""who the fuck is this person?"" the sweet girl I knew who was so loyal to me and loved me so much now frequently manipulated and lied to me... I couldn't believe it... I still can't believe it. It feels so horrible.

She came back to me a couple more times and stayed the night, but nothing stuck... she ended up signing a lease and moving in with that guy about three weeks after I found out she didn't breakup with him.

I am suffering so much from all of this; I've tried so hard to show her how much I love her, how much I care, how thoroughly I understand my mistakes and have taken the measures to correct them i.e. I haven't watched porn now for 12 weeks, I assured her of her beauty and intelligence (which are undeniably) every chance I got when she was with me! I did so much, so much to get her to see, to get her to hear me! I became too much, however, and she blocked me on social media... I feel so horrible because I love her so much! More than anything, even still! And I have so many options with girls I could be with, but I don't care about them at all! I've remained so devoted to her, so loyal, even now when I don't have to be. And i'm going to be interviewing for a data science position which I have about a 99&amp;#37; chance of getting since they reached out to me a month after I interviewed initially, I proved an excellent fit but was beaten out by someone who had a little more experience... this new position is mine for the taking! I'm going to be making six figures! I'm going to be able to do all the things I wanted to do with her which includes leaving on weekends for Florida to go to Disney World, Vegas, fuck whatever the hell we want to do! Thats what I wanted to do with her cause she means everything to me. She is also so special to me since she is the only one i've been with sexually, and thats how I wanted it! I want to marry this girl, go everywhere, and do everything with her! I'm suffering here without her and I know I could have other girls who would die for this, but she's my girl! I'm not the same dude, and I could treat her so amazingly and shes the one I want to be with! I just wish so badly that she would see that.

What are your thoughts?

I love you so much. So much. Please return to me

8vgl4k,0,2018-07-02,The Trial (Fiction),tatotellstories,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8vgl4k/the_trial_fiction/,"The Trial is the story of Chris Greene, a foster kid who made it into a prestigious law school and got a very big internship at a fancy law firm. What at first seemed like heaven turns into hell when Chris is forced to face a ghost from his past: the very first big case he’s going to work on will be defending Logan Archibald, his former father-in-law who was responsible for the break up of his engagement two and a half years before. To make matters worse, he’ll have to work side by side with his ex-fiancé, Jake Archibald, who broke things up unexpectedly and without giving any sort of reason. Will Chris be able to let his past go and defend the man who hates him? Will he find out what’s behind the event that changed his life forever?

1

“You can let them in, Sally, thank you” Mr. Williamson said, pressing the button on the intercom that had buzzed just a second ago. Chris held his breath, getting ready for the sight of him walking into the conference room: the one who once meant everything, who proposed and then a month later came into Chris’s room to break everything up, ask for the engagement ring back and crush all those dreams and hopes with one swift blow. There was no notice, no reason, no nothing, just a simple ‘We can’t get married. I’m sorry’ uttered in a tone of voice Chris had never heard coming from his lips; not that any further explanation was needed: it was obvious that the whole thing was due to his father finding out about their relationship before he got access to his trust fund. That’s what Chris got for being with a frat boy, someone that was way out of his league and who could get anyone he wanted; three years… ended just like that, as if it meant nothing, as if they were wasted.

Now, over two years after the whole ordeal, Chris was sitting in the fancy conference room of the prestigious firm in which he got his internship. All his effort was going to bear fruit, and Chris was beyond himself, working harder than anyone to show his supervisor he was worth it, that he could handle any assignment or case the firm needed him to; what Chris didn’t expect was that he would have to work on a major sexual harassment one involving none other than the man who hated him, who destroyed his chance of happiness, of having a real family: Logan Archibald, son of the famous conservative senator Harold Archibald and father of… him*, the one who was heading to the conference room right now along his father and grandfather, the one who years ago was smiling by the pool of his fraternity house during a party, the very first one Chris attended in college.

Chris was just 19, on his first month at Wollenberg University, and got dragged by his roommate to the annual pool party that was supposed to be the major social event on campus. Being surrounded by overprivileged frat boys was something that Chris was absolutely not used to and the thought made him anxious; he was a foster kid who jumped from house to house all around the state, who lived with the bare minimum and had to bust his ass off for every single thing he had, including the scholarship won by academic merit. Even now, when he closed his eyes, Chris could clearly see the white fence of the large house where the party was being held, hear the loud music and see him sitting there, feet in the water, body covered with drops, blond hair still wet, blue eyes filled with that carefree joy only rich youth had. Jacob, Jake, the one who got away… or better, the one who ran away; even his name made Chris shiver and each second that passed was filled with the dread that anticipated an awkward and painful moment. Jake was on his last year when they met, ready to follow his father’s footsteps and go to law school after his graduation, to one day take over the family business and continue being rich, to marry some rich girl, have rich babies. Not someone who would even look at a foster kid.

But he did. For three years they were together, and Jake didn’t do anything else but to look at Chris. And that was something that blew his mind, because there was absolutely no logical reason for it; since the party where they met, Chris saw Jake everywhere he went: the library, the cafeteria, even some study groups. He was reluctant at first, even suspicious – he had been bullied before, been the victim of pranks –, but Jake managed to break all those walls and sneak into his life, and Chris was happy for once, truly happy. For three years. Then Jake was gone. All calls were ignored, and for over two years Chris fought the urge to go after him, stalk his social media, google him. It wasn’t worth it, and he probably wouldn’t like what he would find: Jake, now a lawyer probably, engaged to some girl, maybe even married. So much could have happened in that time… the only thing that wouldn’t change was the indisputable truth that it was over. Jake was gone.

And now Chris was there inside the conference room of the law firm he fought so much to intern at, watching the door closely, knowing Jake, his father and his grandfather were walking towards it. Chris held his breath once again… the doorknob was turning.

*

*Two weeks earlier*

Chris took a deep breath as he looked up to the tall, imposing building in front of him; it was his very first day at Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb’s working as an intern – a paid one, a position any law student would kill for. All his classmates coveted the job and the selection process was absurdly competitive, but he got it; he nailed the academic criteria and managed to impress even the most unimpressible partners that interviewed him. Chris looked into the glass doors and took a second to check if his short brown hair was properly combed, if his glasses were not dirty and if his tie knot was not messed up; everything was fine, so he stared at himself, looking deep into his own green eyes and smiled reassuringly before he went in.

“Good morning, what can I help you with?” The middle aged woman behind the front desk asked with a straight face – not friendly, but also not rude; just the right amount of polite you’d expect from a law firm receptionist.

“Good morning” Chris couldn’t stop smiling “My name is Chris Greene and I’ve just been recently hired”

“Oh, yes, you’re the new intern” She nodded, as if she just remembered someone new was about to start “Let me check if your Company ID is ready” She opened one of the drawers and looked for it, smiling when she found it. After giving it a quick look over to Chris to check if he was the same person on the badge, she handed it to him “Welcome to Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb, Chris. Name’s Sally Pearson and I hope you do well here” Sally smiled for the first time, and it was a comforting one that managed to ease some of his anxiety.

“Thank you, Mrs. Pearson”

“Just Sally, dear. Now go straight to the 10th floor; Miranda will be waiting for you with the information you need”

Chris nodded and headed to the access turnstile, eyes glowing when it opened as he placed his badge on the reader; Sally’s smile and that green light were all the reassurance he needed to quell his heart and calm his stomach down – no matter how many times he succeeded, his insecurities always kicked in when it came to feeling like he belonged somewhere, and in his mind he was still just a foster kid who didn’t have a place of his own. Chris had never been mistreated by any of the families he lived with; they were all nice and gave him whatever he needed for school, took him to trips and even bought him presents every now and then. However, some things were not within his reach: he never had a car, a laptop of his own, an allowance that actually allowed him to do whatever kids his age did; but most important, Chris never had a home, and whenever something big happened he was never included in the plans – one of his foster families moved away and their new house couldn’t accommodate him anymore; or an unexpected pregnancy changed things; or the foster family started not being too comfortable hosting a teenager, despite the fact that Chris had been living with them since he was 10; it was always temporary, always a favor, even if not rubbed on his face.

When he turned 18, he managed to live on his own with some of the money he got access to – his parents had a small amount of it, and it was kept in a savings account after their death waiting for him to be old enough to use it – and the paychecks from a part time job at the local Walmart. But again, everything was a sort of ‘in between’, until he left for college and made friends, had sleepovers, went to parties… met Jake and finally had a boyfriend, someone that cared for him in a deeper way. Or seemed to for a while: even that was temporary, and Chris started thinking living was moving in between the in betweens, enjoying everything while it lasted. Right now, the green light granting access to the elevators was his home, and it was a damn good one. He went into the elevator, holding the door to someone who just came across the turnstiles and who greeted him as if he had always worked there.

“Can you press the 7th, please?”

“Sure” Chris pressed the buttons to their respective floors.

“Did you watch the game last night?”

“Yeah, it was great” He had absolutely no idea which game the man was talking about.

“Tight score! For a while I thought the Mets would lose” The man said in relief.

“Oh, you’re a Mets fan…” Chris said with a small eye roll. He learned that giving this kind of answer was the safest bet, as it would force the other person to either talk about the other team or end the discussion faster.

“Don’t tell me you were rooting for the Braves?!”

“Hey, are you gonna judge me now?” Chris chuckled and the man soon followed.

“Alright, alright… can’t judge a man for his tastes, even when they’re bad” The elevator stopped on the 7th “This is me. Let’s discuss this some time while we watch the Braves get crushed, shall we?” The man said as he stepped out.

“Drinks are on me” Chris answered with a smile and gave his coworker a thumbs up right before the doors closed. It may seem like it was a stupid strategy, but saying he was not into sports or wasn’t aware of any games would create a barrier – and he was sick of things that kept him apart from other people; that guy would probably forget about him by the end of the day, but for the brief amount of time they spent together they were old friends, and Chris could definitely use some.

The doors opened on the 10th floor and Chris walked out, spotting Miranda’s desk. He headed over there calculating each step: he didn’t want to seem too eager nor too tardy; this was something important to him: act as if he belonged, as if things were naturally easy for him to deal with. “Good morning, I’m…”

“Chris Greene” Miranda said before he could; she didn’t seem nearly as nice as Sally “Front desk called informing you arrived. You’re early”

“A better option than late” Chris answered, trying to match her objectivity.

“And witty. We’re going to get along” She said with a slight curve on the corner of her lips, almost imperceptible; Chris figured out quickly that’s the closest he would get to a smile from the woman in front of him “Your supervisor is waiting for you; I suppose you’ve heard of Mark Johnson” Chris’s jaw dropped. Johnson was one of the most famous lawyers the firm had; even though he was still 35 years old, he was known for winning even the most absurdly difficult cases – people called him the ‘jury charmer’.

“Yes, we’ve studied some of his cases” He did his best to keep his voice steady.

“There’s no need to panic, Mr. Greene” Miranda said in a very specific tone that was half annoyed, half reassuring, the one people used whenever someone was freaking out over nothing “You’re in one of the most respectable work places in the city – or better, in the country. HR doesn’t assign interns to supervisors randomly, and if you’re working for Mr. Johnson it’s because you were chosen to do it; in fact, he probably asked to be your supervisor”

Chris was dumbfounded “But…”

“Please, spare me. I got curious and looked into your file and it’s quite impressive” She said in the same tone as before “You’ll do just fine. Now go ahead and introduce yourself; his office is the last one on the hallway to the left”

“Thank you, ma’am”

“It’s miss” She raised her eyebrow “I like you, but don’t push it”

“Thank you, miss” Chris said, blushing a bit, as he ambled towards the hallway she indicated, his heart thumping inside his chest with every step he took towards the office at the end. Even the sight of the door was imposing, as if it wasn’t just another plank of wood used to separate two different parts of a building but a portal to some other dimension where he would have a lot to measure up to. When he got there, Chris did his ritual of holding his breath before knocking – in case the world would run out of oxygen when he heard the deep voice on the other side say “Come in”

Chris opened the door and stepped in “Mr. Johnson, I’m…”

“Oh, Chris!” The man said excited, getting up “Come in, come in!”

“Of course, sir” Mark’s reaction was completely different from what Chris expected: Mark sounded eager, as if he was the one about to meet someone important.

“It’s Mark” He said, shaking his head “We’re going to be working together and I don’t want any excessive formality between us” Mark reaches his hand out to Chris, who gives him the firmest handshake he could.

“It’s an honor, sir… I mean, Mark”

“Likewise. Your file was pretty impressive, and all the lawyers wanted to supervise you” Mark smiled wide, clearly happy with meeting him “Thankfully I have some privileges around here and got to snatch you before they could”

Chris couldn’t help but blush, as it was extremely flattering to be treated as a prize by someone like Mark Johnson “I hope I can measure up to your expectations”

“Oh, I’m sure you will, Chris” Mark said reassuringly “But I don’t want you to put excessive pressure on yourself. Just relax and do as instructed; I’m not going to demand anything unreasonable. Now tell me, how’s your day so far?” Mark asked in a kind tone, pointing to a chair across from his desk. Chris sat down, feeling a heavy weight being lifted from his shoulders, and answered his supervisor’s question casually, keeping the tone of the conversation light.

Mark seemed interested in hearing everything Chris had to say, and it didn’t take long for him to be comfortable. Some of the questions were personal, but not overly, and Chris was happy to hear Mark comment on his answers with information about himself as well; it was more of an ice breaker than an interview or a lecture, and Chris was smiling the whole time – belonging was the most important thing to him, and Mark made him feel at home. After about 15 minutes of chatting, the phone rang and Mark answered it “Yes, Miranda. Oh, that’s good to hear. Can you ask her to hold while I finish giving Chris his first task? Thank you” He looked at Chris before hanging up “Conversation was nice, but as you can see we don’t have many idle moments here”

“That’s good to know, Mark, I’m eager to start learning and helping in any way I can” Chris answered with a smile.

“Hard working, as I expected you to be” Mark got up and motioned for Chris to follow him into the hall. He opened a small office, right next to his “You’ll be working here, close to me, so if you need anything I’m just a step away” Chris nodded and Mark continued “You have all the log in information you need on that folder on your desk and Miranda will be bringing you some work to do; for now, all I want you to do is organize some files for the case I’m working on. Paperwork is a mess sometimes and I hadn’t had the time to sort things out; just pay attention to the dates on each document and put them in chronological order”

Chris nodded to sign he understood “Do you want me to file them together by month or week?”

“Monthly will do just fine” Mark smiled and patted Chris on the back “If you have any questions, just let me or Miranda know”

“Will do, sir…” Mark gave him a look “I mean, Mark” Chris corrected himself as Mark walked back into his office, smiling. Chris was beyond himself when he closed his own door, in his own office and sat by his own desk, on a very comfortable chair that soon would be molded to himself. He closed his eyes and took another deep breath, but this time it was all about savoring the moment – his moment, the result of all his hard work. For a second, he thought about Jake and wished he could grab his phone and text him, tell him how perfect everything was, but Chris shook it off quickly; he wasn’t going to go there, follow that road. He opened his eyes and looked into the folder with all the log in instructions and turned his computer on; before long, he was able to get familiar with the firm’s system and access all its features. He was reading the firm’s welcome e-mails when a knock on his door interrupted him “Yeah?” He said and Miranda opened it, pushing a cart with several folders.

“These are the files Mr. Johnson wants you to organize” She handed them to him one by one and Chris was surprised with how heavy they were “Try to get it done by Wednesday”

“I’ll do my best” He answered, hoping he’d be able to do it; there were so many documents, a year worth of paperwork.

“If you need any help, don’t hesitate in calling. Numbers are by the phone” Miranda said as she walked out, closing the door behind her. Chris set the folders on his desk and took his jacket off, placing it on the back of his chair, thinking of the best way to start working. Being methodical and having experience working at places that were not fancy helped him a lot: most interns would struggle handling all the files, sitting on their chairs without enough space to sort the documents; instead of doing that, decided to just sit down on the floor and sort the documents in piles based on each month, then he’d have an idea of how many folders he’d need. Also, instead of reading each piece of paper he just scanned the sheets, looking for words that started with capital letters as they’d lead him to each month; he had no idea what each document was about, but he was able to organize the first folder in no time, seeing about five piles form in front of him.

Chris worked without taking any breaks, going through each folder like a machine, and before he knew it, things were sorted out. He had more empty folders than piles, and those were uneven, so, instead of simply grabbing each pile and placing it in a folder, he went through the documents again and looked for more specific dates – that allowed him to divide the highest piles in weeks, making it easier to find documents. As he organized the files like that, he was able to get a better look at their content and learned he was working on the case of some rich businessman trying to get rid of tax evasion charges; it was all over the news, and Chris wasn’t surprised to see that Mark was handling it – in the end, being a lawyer in a prestigious firm like Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb was all about helping rich people get away with their bullshit.

It wasn’t exactly noble, but it paid well, and Chris couldn’t afford to think like some self righteous small time attorney; he had ambitions, he wanted things and he knew he wasn’t going to be able to help anyone before he helped himself. One day he was going to have enough money to live comfortably and would have the time to dedicate himself to charity work, but not now, not before he’d get to taste a life he never had. He always thought it was funny how his classmates asked him if he planned on ‘helping kids like him’, becoming a public servant or doing social work, but no one ever asked anyone else things like that; no one expected his classmates who came from money to dedicate their time to noble causes – people like Jake were exempt of that kind of pressure, of having to explain themselves to others, justify every action they took. Chris felt like he had to come up with excuses for everything, and the past few months were a pain in the ass “Woah, you’re applying to Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb? I thought you were going to try to get that other position as a public attorney assistant!” was something he heard from several times. He just smiled and shook his head, while thinking ‘Why don’t you go for that? Daddy gives you money, you can afford to take an unpaid internship, jackass’. That’s why it was so important for him to belong, to fit right in: he was tired of feeling like an outsider wherever he went, of seeing dumb, rich kids walking about as if the world belong to them while he was constantly feeling inadequate.

As he thought of all that, his body worked on auto-pilot, scanning the documents and putting them in order, and even though he wasn’t paying any special attention to content, he couldn’t help but notice there wasn’t a single file about any charity project – and he knew Mr. DeLuco, the man being charged, was always on the news boasting about how much he helped poor people. After he was done organizing everything, he placed the folders on his desk and walked to Mark’s office, knocking gently on the door. “Yes?”

“I have a question about the files” Chris said as he walked in.

“What about them? Are you having trouble figuring out the dates?”

“No, not at all, I finished sorting things out”

Mark raised his eyebrow “You finished organizing a whole year worth of documents in a day?”

“Uhh, yes… I haven’t stopped since I started”

“You didn’t stop?!” Mark went high pitched “Chris, it’s almost five! You didn’t have lunch?!”

“No, I didn’t” He hadn’t realized it until now. Chris’s tone was apologetic, as if he was a boy who got caught misbehaving.

“Good lord, don’t do that!” Mark was surprised, and not in a good way it seemed “It’s easy to get caught up in whatever it is that you’re doing, so pay attention to it” Chris nodded in response and Mark let out a sigh “Anyway, what was the question?”

“I think there are some documents missing”

“Miranda should have given you everything we have”

“All I had were bank statements, detailed reports of his many deals with other companies, data about his spending habits and things like that”

“Yes, that’s about it, you shouldn’t be missing anything” Mark said, clearly not understanding Chris’s point.

“But what about Mr. DeLuco’s charity work?”

“I’m not following”

“Well, he’s being charged with tax evasion, or so I’ve heard” Mark nodded, signaling Chris to continue “Shouldn’t we have that kind of information to see how much we can deduct from whatever amount he supposedly owes? Maybe some of the charity will be admissible, if we can tie it to him personally and not to one of his companies. His wife should probably have something we can use, they’re always on the paper at some function or other, and…” Mark was blinking, staring at what seemed like nothing as Chris talked; great, on the very first day he was asking stupid questions about a simple task “Sorry, I probably shouldn’t be…”

“We had three different lawyers working on that case – myself included” Mark started talking over Chris, who braced himself expecting a snarky reply “And we were so caught up trying to figure out a way to bend the numbers, that none of us idiots noticed there was nothing in there about charity!” Mark started laughing nervously and Chris had no idea how to act “God, it’s so obvious…” He reached for the phone and dialed “Miranda, get Joshua and Travis to come to my office as soon as possible and contact Mr. DeLuco’s office for me, please… we have important information to get” Mark then looked at Chris with a big smile “And then get a meal for Chris; poor kid worked his ass off and didn’t stop to have lunch. Thanks”

Chris’s jaw dropped “Sir, I…”

“It’s Mark” The smile was plastered on his supervisor’s face “Now go take the folders to Miranda and come back here. I want you to help us figure this thing out”

“Of course” Chris smiled back, not believing what just happened “I’ll be right back”

“Take your time” Mark said as the phone rang “Yes? You have his office on the line? Transfer the call please…” Was the last thing Chris heard before closing the door. He grabbed the first cart he found and quickly took the folders to Miranda.

“Mr. Johnson asked me to bring those to you”

“You finished it” She sounded impressed “What are you? Superman?” Chris rubbed the back of his head and just shrugged “Anyway, you shouldn’t be skipping any meals around here, okay? Mr. Johnson takes his interns well being very seriously”

“It won’t happen again” He nodded, embarrassed.

“I told you you had nothing to worry about, didn’t I?”

“I guess you did” Chris chuckled then confessed “I’m a bit insecure sometimes”

“Well, don’t be. You made it here, kid, and that says something” Miranda was now smiling warmly; she opened a drawer and grabbed a menu “Now get something to eat; firm will pay for it, so don’t worry about prices. You earned it”

Chris stared at the menu from the fancy restaurant, beyond himself. He pictured his first day at work in many different ways – several of them in which he made a fool of himself and got himself fired, like a dumbass; it didn’t seem real that he would be there, doing well, it was too good to be true. But, lo and behold, there he was browsing through lunch options, being taken care of as if… no, not as if… because he belonged somewhere – and that somewhere was a very important place. Chris felt truly happy for the first time in a very long while, ever since Jake had left him, and that afternoon it seemed like things were finally going to work out for him, like all the hurt would stop and life would stop throwing curve balls at him – Chris finally felt safe, and for the first time in years he allowed himself to breathe normally.

8vgobp,1,2018-07-02,The Trial (Fiction),tatotellstories,gaystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystories/comments/8vgobp/the_trial_fiction/,"The Trial is the story of Chris Greene, a foster kid who made it into a prestigious law school and got a very big internship at a fancy law firm. What at first seemed like heaven turns into hell when Chris is forced to face a ghost from his past: the very first big case he’s going to work on will be defending Logan Archibald, his former father-in-law who was responsible for the break up of his engagement two and a half years before. To make matters worse, he’ll have to work side by side with his ex-fiancé, Jake Archibald, who broke things up unexpectedly and without giving any sort of reason. Will Chris be able to let his past go and defend the man who hates him? Will he find out what’s behind the event that changed his life forever?

1

“You can let them in, Sally, thank you” Mr. Williamson said, pressing the button on the intercom that had buzzed just a second ago. Chris held his breath, getting ready for the sight of him walking into the conference room: the one who once meant everything, who proposed and then a month later came into Chris’s room to break everything up, ask for the engagement ring back and crush all those dreams and hopes with one swift blow. There was no notice, no reason, no nothing, just a simple ‘We can’t get married. I’m sorry’ uttered in a tone of voice Chris had never heard coming from his lips; not that any further explanation was needed: it was obvious that the whole thing was due to his father finding out about their relationship before he got access to his trust fund. That’s what Chris got for being with a frat boy, someone that was way out of his league and who could get anyone he wanted; three years… ended just like that, as if it meant nothing, as if they were wasted.

Now, over two years after the whole ordeal, Chris was sitting in the fancy conference room of the prestigious firm in which he got his internship. All his effort was going to bear fruit, and Chris was beyond himself, working harder than anyone to show his supervisor he was worth it, that he could handle any assignment or case the firm needed him to; what Chris didn’t expect was that he would have to work on a major sexual harassment one involving none other than the man who hated him, who destroyed his chance of happiness, of having a real family: Logan Archibald, son of the famous conservative senator Harold Archibald and father of… him*, the one who was heading to the conference room right now along his father and grandfather, the one who years ago was smiling by the pool of his fraternity house during a party, the very first one Chris attended in college.

Chris was just 19, on his first month at Wollenberg University, and got dragged by his roommate to the annual pool party that was supposed to be the major social event on campus. Being surrounded by overprivileged frat boys was something that Chris was absolutely not used to and the thought made him anxious; he was a foster kid who jumped from house to house all around the state, who lived with the bare minimum and had to bust his ass off for every single thing he had, including the scholarship won by academic merit. Even now, when he closed his eyes, Chris could clearly see the white fence of the large house where the party was being held, hear the loud music and see him sitting there, feet in the water, body covered with drops, blond hair still wet, blue eyes filled with that carefree joy only rich youth had. Jacob, Jake, the one who got away… or better, the one who ran away; even his name made Chris shiver and each second that passed was filled with the dread that anticipated an awkward and painful moment. Jake was on his last year when they met, ready to follow his father’s footsteps and go to law school after his graduation, to one day take over the family business and continue being rich, to marry some rich girl, have rich babies. Not someone who would even look at a foster kid.

But he did. For three years they were together, and Jake didn’t do anything else but to look at Chris. And that was something that blew his mind, because there was absolutely no logical reason for it; since the party where they met, Chris saw Jake everywhere he went: the library, the cafeteria, even some study groups. He was reluctant at first, even suspicious – he had been bullied before, been the victim of pranks –, but Jake managed to break all those walls and sneak into his life, and Chris was happy for once, truly happy. For three years. Then Jake was gone. All calls were ignored, and for over two years Chris fought the urge to go after him, stalk his social media, google him. It wasn’t worth it, and he probably wouldn’t like what he would find: Jake, now a lawyer probably, engaged to some girl, maybe even married. So much could have happened in that time… the only thing that wouldn’t change was the indisputable truth that it was over. Jake was gone.

And now Chris was there inside the conference room of the law firm he fought so much to intern at, watching the door closely, knowing Jake, his father and his grandfather were walking towards it. Chris held his breath once again… the doorknob was turning.

*

*Two weeks earlier*

Chris took a deep breath as he looked up to the tall, imposing building in front of him; it was his very first day at Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb’s working as an intern – a paid one, a position any law student would kill for. All his classmates coveted the job and the selection process was absurdly competitive, but he got it; he nailed the academic criteria and managed to impress even the most unimpressible partners that interviewed him. Chris looked into the glass doors and took a second to check if his short brown hair was properly combed, if his glasses were not dirty and if his tie knot was not messed up; everything was fine, so he stared at himself, looking deep into his own green eyes and smiled reassuringly before he went in.

“Good morning, what can I help you with?” The middle aged woman behind the front desk asked with a straight face – not friendly, but also not rude; just the right amount of polite you’d expect from a law firm receptionist.

“Good morning” Chris couldn’t stop smiling “My name is Chris Greene and I’ve just been recently hired”

“Oh, yes, you’re the new intern” She nodded, as if she just remembered someone new was about to start “Let me check if your Company ID is ready” She opened one of the drawers and looked for it, smiling when she found it. After giving it a quick look over to Chris to check if he was the same person on the badge, she handed it to him “Welcome to Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb, Chris. Name’s Sally Pearson and I hope you do well here” Sally smiled for the first time, and it was a comforting one that managed to ease some of his anxiety.

“Thank you, Mrs. Pearson”

“Just Sally, dear. Now go straight to the 10th floor; Miranda will be waiting for you with the information you need”

Chris nodded and headed to the access turnstile, eyes glowing when it opened as he placed his badge on the reader; Sally’s smile and that green light were all the reassurance he needed to quell his heart and calm his stomach down – no matter how many times he succeeded, his insecurities always kicked in when it came to feeling like he belonged somewhere, and in his mind he was still just a foster kid who didn’t have a place of his own. Chris had never been mistreated by any of the families he lived with; they were all nice and gave him whatever he needed for school, took him to trips and even bought him presents every now and then. However, some things were not within his reach: he never had a car, a laptop of his own, an allowance that actually allowed him to do whatever kids his age did; but most important, Chris never had a home, and whenever something big happened he was never included in the plans – one of his foster families moved away and their new house couldn’t accommodate him anymore; or an unexpected pregnancy changed things; or the foster family started not being too comfortable hosting a teenager, despite the fact that Chris had been living with them since he was 10; it was always temporary, always a favor, even if not rubbed on his face.

When he turned 18, he managed to live on his own with some of the money he got access to – his parents had a small amount of it, and it was kept in a savings account after their death waiting for him to be old enough to use it – and the paychecks from a part time job at the local Walmart. But again, everything was a sort of ‘in between’, until he left for college and made friends, had sleepovers, went to parties… met Jake and finally had a boyfriend, someone that cared for him in a deeper way. Or seemed to for a while: even that was temporary, and Chris started thinking living was moving in between the in betweens, enjoying everything while it lasted. Right now, the green light granting access to the elevators was his home, and it was a damn good one. He went into the elevator, holding the door to someone who just came across the turnstiles and who greeted him as if he had always worked there.

“Can you press the 7th, please?”

“Sure” Chris pressed the buttons to their respective floors.

“Did you watch the game last night?”

“Yeah, it was great” He had absolutely no idea which game the man was talking about.

“Tight score! For a while I thought the Mets would lose” The man said in relief.

“Oh, you’re a Mets fan…” Chris said with a small eye roll. He learned that giving this kind of answer was the safest bet, as it would force the other person to either talk about the other team or end the discussion faster.

“Don’t tell me you were rooting for the Braves?!”

“Hey, are you gonna judge me now?” Chris chuckled and the man soon followed.

“Alright, alright… can’t judge a man for his tastes, even when they’re bad” The elevator stopped on the 7th “This is me. Let’s discuss this some time while we watch the Braves get crushed, shall we?” The man said as he stepped out.

“Drinks are on me” Chris answered with a smile and gave his coworker a thumbs up right before the doors closed. It may seem like it was a stupid strategy, but saying he was not into sports or wasn’t aware of any games would create a barrier – and he was sick of things that kept him apart from other people; that guy would probably forget about him by the end of the day, but for the brief amount of time they spent together they were old friends, and Chris could definitely use some.

The doors opened on the 10th floor and Chris walked out, spotting Miranda’s desk. He headed over there calculating each step: he didn’t want to seem too eager nor too tardy; this was something important to him: act as if he belonged, as if things were naturally easy for him to deal with. “Good morning, I’m…”

“Chris Greene” Miranda said before he could; she didn’t seem nearly as nice as Sally “Front desk called informing you arrived. You’re early”

“A better option than late” Chris answered, trying to match her objectivity.

“And witty. We’re going to get along” She said with a slight curve on the corner of her lips, almost imperceptible; Chris figured out quickly that’s the closest he would get to a smile from the woman in front of him “Your supervisor is waiting for you; I suppose you’ve heard of Mark Johnson” Chris’s jaw dropped. Johnson was one of the most famous lawyers the firm had; even though he was still 35 years old, he was known for winning even the most absurdly difficult cases – people called him the ‘jury charmer’.

“Yes, we’ve studied some of his cases” He did his best to keep his voice steady.

“There’s no need to panic, Mr. Greene” Miranda said in a very specific tone that was half annoyed, half reassuring, the one people used whenever someone was freaking out over nothing “You’re in one of the most respectable work places in the city – or better, in the country. HR doesn’t assign interns to supervisors randomly, and if you’re working for Mr. Johnson it’s because you were chosen to do it; in fact, he probably asked to be your supervisor”

Chris was dumbfounded “But…”

“Please, spare me. I got curious and looked into your file and it’s quite impressive” She said in the same tone as before “You’ll do just fine. Now go ahead and introduce yourself; his office is the last one on the hallway to the left”

“Thank you, ma’am”

“It’s miss” She raised her eyebrow “I like you, but don’t push it”

“Thank you, miss” Chris said, blushing a bit, as he ambled towards the hallway she indicated, his heart thumping inside his chest with every step he took towards the office at the end. Even the sight of the door was imposing, as if it wasn’t just another plank of wood used to separate two different parts of a building but a portal to some other dimension where he would have a lot to measure up to. When he got there, Chris did his ritual of holding his breath before knocking – in case the world would run out of oxygen when he heard the deep voice on the other side say “Come in”

Chris opened the door and stepped in “Mr. Johnson, I’m…”

“Oh, Chris!” The man said excited, getting up “Come in, come in!”

“Of course, sir” Mark’s reaction was completely different from what Chris expected: Mark sounded eager, as if he was the one about to meet someone important.

“It’s Mark” He said, shaking his head “We’re going to be working together and I don’t want any excessive formality between us” Mark reaches his hand out to Chris, who gives him the firmest handshake he could.

“It’s an honor, sir… I mean, Mark”

“Likewise. Your file was pretty impressive, and all the lawyers wanted to supervise you” Mark smiled wide, clearly happy with meeting him “Thankfully I have some privileges around here and got to snatch you before they could”

Chris couldn’t help but blush, as it was extremely flattering to be treated as a prize by someone like Mark Johnson “I hope I can measure up to your expectations”

“Oh, I’m sure you will, Chris” Mark said reassuringly “But I don’t want you to put excessive pressure on yourself. Just relax and do as instructed; I’m not going to demand anything unreasonable. Now tell me, how’s your day so far?” Mark asked in a kind tone, pointing to a chair across from his desk. Chris sat down, feeling a heavy weight being lifted from his shoulders, and answered his supervisor’s question casually, keeping the tone of the conversation light.

Mark seemed interested in hearing everything Chris had to say, and it didn’t take long for him to be comfortable. Some of the questions were personal, but not overly, and Chris was happy to hear Mark comment on his answers with information about himself as well; it was more of an ice breaker than an interview or a lecture, and Chris was smiling the whole time – belonging was the most important thing to him, and Mark made him feel at home. After about 15 minutes of chatting, the phone rang and Mark answered it “Yes, Miranda. Oh, that’s good to hear. Can you ask her to hold while I finish giving Chris his first task? Thank you” He looked at Chris before hanging up “Conversation was nice, but as you can see we don’t have many idle moments here”

“That’s good to know, Mark, I’m eager to start learning and helping in any way I can” Chris answered with a smile.

“Hard working, as I expected you to be” Mark got up and motioned for Chris to follow him into the hall. He opened a small office, right next to his “You’ll be working here, close to me, so if you need anything I’m just a step away” Chris nodded and Mark continued “You have all the log in information you need on that folder on your desk and Miranda will be bringing you some work to do; for now, all I want you to do is organize some files for the case I’m working on. Paperwork is a mess sometimes and I hadn’t had the time to sort things out; just pay attention to the dates on each document and put them in chronological order”

Chris nodded to sign he understood “Do you want me to file them together by month or week?”

“Monthly will do just fine” Mark smiled and patted Chris on the back “If you have any questions, just let me or Miranda know”

“Will do, sir…” Mark gave him a look “I mean, Mark” Chris corrected himself as Mark walked back into his office, smiling. Chris was beyond himself when he closed his own door, in his own office and sat by his own desk, on a very comfortable chair that soon would be molded to himself. He closed his eyes and took another deep breath, but this time it was all about savoring the moment – his moment, the result of all his hard work. For a second, he thought about Jake and wished he could grab his phone and text him, tell him how perfect everything was, but Chris shook it off quickly; he wasn’t going to go there, follow that road. He opened his eyes and looked into the folder with all the log in instructions and turned his computer on; before long, he was able to get familiar with the firm’s system and access all its features. He was reading the firm’s welcome e-mails when a knock on his door interrupted him “Yeah?” He said and Miranda opened it, pushing a cart with several folders.

“These are the files Mr. Johnson wants you to organize” She handed them to him one by one and Chris was surprised with how heavy they were “Try to get it done by Wednesday”

“I’ll do my best” He answered, hoping he’d be able to do it; there were so many documents, a year worth of paperwork.

“If you need any help, don’t hesitate in calling. Numbers are by the phone” Miranda said as she walked out, closing the door behind her. Chris set the folders on his desk and took his jacket off, placing it on the back of his chair, thinking of the best way to start working. Being methodical and having experience working at places that were not fancy helped him a lot: most interns would struggle handling all the files, sitting on their chairs without enough space to sort the documents; instead of doing that, decided to just sit down on the floor and sort the documents in piles based on each month, then he’d have an idea of how many folders he’d need. Also, instead of reading each piece of paper he just scanned the sheets, looking for words that started with capital letters as they’d lead him to each month; he had no idea what each document was about, but he was able to organize the first folder in no time, seeing about five piles form in front of him.

Chris worked without taking any breaks, going through each folder like a machine, and before he knew it, things were sorted out. He had more empty folders than piles, and those were uneven, so, instead of simply grabbing each pile and placing it in a folder, he went through the documents again and looked for more specific dates – that allowed him to divide the highest piles in weeks, making it easier to find documents. As he organized the files like that, he was able to get a better look at their content and learned he was working on the case of some rich businessman trying to get rid of tax evasion charges; it was all over the news, and Chris wasn’t surprised to see that Mark was handling it – in the end, being a lawyer in a prestigious firm like Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb was all about helping rich people get away with their bullshit.

It wasn’t exactly noble, but it paid well, and Chris couldn’t afford to think like some self righteous small time attorney; he had ambitions, he wanted things and he knew he wasn’t going to be able to help anyone before he helped himself. One day he was going to have enough money to live comfortably and would have the time to dedicate himself to charity work, but not now, not before he’d get to taste a life he never had. He always thought it was funny how his classmates asked him if he planned on ‘helping kids like him’, becoming a public servant or doing social work, but no one ever asked anyone else things like that; no one expected his classmates who came from money to dedicate their time to noble causes – people like Jake were exempt of that kind of pressure, of having to explain themselves to others, justify every action they took. Chris felt like he had to come up with excuses for everything, and the past few months were a pain in the ass “Woah, you’re applying to Williamson, Smith &amp; Loeb? I thought you were going to try to get that other position as a public attorney assistant!” was something he heard from several times. He just smiled and shook his head, while thinking ‘Why don’t you go for that? Daddy gives you money, you can afford to take an unpaid internship, jackass’. That’s why it was so important for him to belong, to fit right in: he was tired of feeling like an outsider wherever he went, of seeing dumb, rich kids walking about as if the world belong to them while he was constantly feeling inadequate.

As he thought of all that, his body worked on auto-pilot, scanning the documents and putting them in order, and even though he wasn’t paying any special attention to content, he couldn’t help but notice there wasn’t a single file about any charity project – and he knew Mr. DeLuco, the man being charged, was always on the news boasting about how much he helped poor people. After he was done organizing everything, he placed the folders on his desk and walked to Mark’s office, knocking gently on the door. “Yes?”

“I have a question about the files” Chris said as he walked in.

“What about them? Are you having trouble figuring out the dates?”

“No, not at all, I finished sorting things out”

Mark raised his eyebrow “You finished organizing a whole year worth of documents in a day?”

“Uhh, yes… I haven’t stopped since I started”

“You didn’t stop?!” Mark went high pitched “Chris, it’s almost five! You didn’t have lunch?!”

“No, I didn’t” He hadn’t realized it until now. Chris’s tone was apologetic, as if he was a boy who got caught misbehaving.

“Good lord, don’t do that!” Mark was surprised, and not in a good way it seemed “It’s easy to get caught up in whatever it is that you’re doing, so pay attention to it” Chris nodded in response and Mark let out a sigh “Anyway, what was the question?”

“I think there are some documents missing”

“Miranda should have given you everything we have”

“All I had were bank statements, detailed reports of his many deals with other companies, data about his spending habits and things like that”

“Yes, that’s about it, you shouldn’t be missing anything” Mark said, clearly not understanding Chris’s point.

“But what about Mr. DeLuco’s charity work?”

“I’m not following”

“Well, he’s being charged with tax evasion, or so I’ve heard” Mark nodded, signaling Chris to continue “Shouldn’t we have that kind of information to see how much we can deduct from whatever amount he supposedly owes? Maybe some of the charity will be admissible, if we can tie it to him personally and not to one of his companies. His wife should probably have something we can use, they’re always on the paper at some function or other, and…” Mark was blinking, staring at what seemed like nothing as Chris talked; great, on the very first day he was asking stupid questions about a simple task “Sorry, I probably shouldn’t be…”

“We had three different lawyers working on that case – myself included” Mark started talking over Chris, who braced himself expecting a snarky reply “And we were so caught up trying to figure out a way to bend the numbers, that none of us idiots noticed there was nothing in there about charity!” Mark started laughing nervously and Chris had no idea how to act “God, it’s so obvious…” He reached for the phone and dialed “Miranda, get Joshua and Travis to come to my office as soon as possible and contact Mr. DeLuco’s office for me, please… we have important information to get” Mark then looked at Chris with a big smile “And then get a meal for Chris; poor kid worked his ass off and didn’t stop to have lunch. Thanks”

Chris’s jaw dropped “Sir, I…”

“It’s Mark” The smile was plastered on his supervisor’s face “Now go take the folders to Miranda and come back here. I want you to help us figure this thing out”

“Of course” Chris smiled back, not believing what just happened “I’ll be right back”

“Take your time” Mark said as the phone rang “Yes? You have his office on the line? Transfer the call please…” Was the last thing Chris heard before closing the door. He grabbed the first cart he found and quickly took the folders to Miranda.

“Mr. Johnson asked me to bring those to you”

“You finished it” She sounded impressed “What are you? Superman?” Chris rubbed the back of his head and just shrugged “Anyway, you shouldn’t be skipping any meals around here, okay? Mr. Johnson takes his interns well being very seriously”

“It won’t happen again” He nodded, embarrassed.

“I told you you had nothing to worry about, didn’t I?”

“I guess you did” Chris chuckled then confessed “I’m a bit insecure sometimes”

“Well, don’t be. You made it here, kid, and that says something” Miranda was now smiling warmly; she opened a drawer and grabbed a menu “Now get something to eat; firm will pay for it, so don’t worry about prices. You earned it”

Chris stared at the menu from the fancy restaurant, beyond himself. He pictured his first day at work in many different ways – several of them in which he made a fool of himself and got himself fired, like a dumbass; it didn’t seem real that he would be there, doing well, it was too good to be true. But, lo and behold, there he was browsing through lunch options, being taken care of as if… no, not as if… because he belonged somewhere – and that somewhere was a very important place. Chris felt truly happy for the first time in a very long while, ever since Jake had left him, and that afternoon it seemed like things were finally going to work out for him, like all the hurt would stop and life would stop throwing curve balls at him – Chris finally felt safe, and for the first time in years he allowed himself to breathe normally.

8viexy,3,2018-07-02,Day 7? When does the energy come back,zoochadookdook,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8viexy/day_7_when_does_the_energy_come_back/,"Hey there, I was never super super heavy but I was every other day/maybe a 2 or 3 day gap in between for the past year.5 of at least a tall boy or two.

I was on day 10 last Sunday when I had 4 beers when my buddies arrived unannounced from Texas bearing gifts. Granted it was over a 6 hour period and I hydrated/wasn't near what the usual binge would have been.

Now I'm tentatively on day 7-last night we were at a swanky 4th of July party and one of the directors at the firm I'm applying to offered me a taste of some insanely fancy insanely expensive insanely never sold ever again (these are all empty validations I know) Japanese whisky. I drank maybe a /5th of a 1oz shot glass due to wanting to fit in with the potential new boss and it felt impolite to decline. Not sure if I should reset my clock for that but if not I'm on day 7.

ANYWAYS, since starting this new trip on a better more sober lifestyle I have to ask WHEN DOES THE ENERGY COME BACK? I started a summer internship so I'm getting up at 6 am daily and going to sleep around 12 but that never stopped me from feeling more awake when I used to drink a 6 pack or whatnot. I generally work until 4 or so and am supposed to teach wrestling 6-8 but by the time I get home I'm wiped. Last week I made it in 3 nights/6. It also doesn't help I'm trying to balance lifting 3/4 times a week to get back into competition weight and such but man; I can't help but think the alcohol keeping me out of rem sleep had a huge contribution on higher energy levels.

I've also noticed I feel more stomach unsettling (not nausea just not right) lately. My diets fairly good aside from a insane amount of caffeine. 

Any advice on how to support energy levels?

thanks"
8visbo,1,2018-07-02,First Credit Card,Jbuck7,CreditCards,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/8visbo/first_credit_card/,"Hey everyone, first time poster on redit. I (21M) am looking into getting my first credit card and am not sure how to determine what card would be best for me. I am still in college going into my senior year and am currently working a summer internship where I make a enough money to cover all of my expenses and still have a comfortable amount left over. I simply want to get a credit card to start building credit over the next two years through purchasing mainly gas and groceries along with random items here and there. My plan is to pay the balance off almost immediately after using the card, that way I never incur interest on payments. 

So if I plan and do pay the balance off every billing cycle and avoid interest do the interest rates for the card even matter? Also, for what I want to use it for what would be the best rewards card to look into? I hope this is enough information to give some feedback to, thanks!  "
8vitpq,0,2018-07-02,Thinking about investing in real estate (23 y/o),Eptasticfail,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8vitpq/thinking_about_investing_in_real_estate_23_yo/,"Hey all!

So I'm tired of wanting for money. I've been reading up on a lot of different methods for generating income (""passively"", looked into quite a few options), and have been struck by the seemingly limitless potential real estate investment seems to offer. I've taken some time to learn about equity, HELOC, refinancing, the whole jazz. 

Time to get down to numbers! I'm still a college student (unfortunately in a 5 year program), so I have a year left of school. I'd like to hit the ground running once I graduate however, and have a job lined up for a full time position. I'm currently working as an intern and making ~$25 an hour in a pretty low cost-of-living area of the country. I will continue to work part time (~17-20 hours a week) for the entirety of next semester at this hourly rate. I pay around $600 in bills a month, and around $300 on some side-hustles that I may end due to time constraints.

I'm expecting to be making ~$60-$70k my first year out of college if I manage to get a position with the company I'm working with at the moment, and it's looking like they'll want me. I've got a few assets that I'm projecting to grow pretty significantly in the next year or so (cryptocurrency, already made some pretty big success there) and, hopefully, it will be enough for a down payment on my first housing asset. I'd like to purchase my first housing asset in July of next year, and I'd like to live there myself with some roommates. I'd like to live in the house at least for a year, because learning how to manage a property is going to take time and experience and living in the asset itself will help facilitate my learning.

I'm considering houses in the 120k-180k range, which is about average for the area of the country I'm in. I have recently applied for a credit card to begin building my credit score, which is sitting at around 640 at the moment. My plan is to build equity in my asset while renting out rooms so I can ""live for free"" and pull in a small income. Luckily I have a few friends that I believe will be living in the area whom I have lived with before and trust to pay rent; I think I'll be asking them to live with me for at least a year. Then, after I've built enough equity to establish a home equity line of credit, I'm going to leverage that line of credit to put a down payment on another asset. 

Because it's easier for me to show things with numbers here's my plan in a nutshell:

1) Purchase 1 asset for myself and a few roommates to live in. With a ~120k-180k mortgage, this makes my monthly payments around 750-1.2k (depending on my credit score, which I'm working on). With 2-3 roommates and a 500-600 a month rent payments, that brings in $1000 - $1800 a month (250-400 net), which will go to my mortgage and upkeep of the property. Regardless, if I'm breaking even at this point it's fine because I'm building equity.

2) Continue payment of mortgage until I have enough equity to refinance and/or establish HELOC. Establish a HELOC, and use the credit for a down payment on another property. Look for a similarly priced asset, repeat the same process as the first property (with the exception of me living in the property). Look for assets that bring in 100-300 in rent a month. Looking into leasing options as well (although I don't know enough about them just yet).

3 - inf) Repeat step 2 indefinitely. Hire a property manager once enough income is being generated. 

I'd like to know how risky this plan is, how realistic it is, and what sort've hidden oversights I might have that I currently am not seeing. One such oversight is squatter's rights, which are problematic for some landlords. I'm driven and want to succeed, but I'm also without a mentor who's done this sort've thing before. I'd love to hear personal stories or any other insight you guys may have for me. Thanks, and I hope you all have a great week :)

Tl;dr: Want to leverage equity to purchase assets, stupid or smart? 

EDIT: Forgot to add, I have around 40k in student loans as well."
8viunq,14,2018-07-02,What is the purpose of this subreddit?,amirite91,purelivingonyoutube,https://www.reddit.com/r/purelivingonyoutube/comments/8viunq/what_is_the_purpose_of_this_subreddit/,"For the past month or so I've noticed that the whole dynamic of this sub has been changing, and not for the better, but for the worse. It became even more obvious when several of the PLFL fans or their acolytes/sycophants joined this subreddit and started undermining it (I'm talking about MuzzleBlast and qqererer, but there are a couple of others as well).

MuzzleBlast is a self-proclaimed admirer of the PLFL duo and qqererer tries to make them look less unpleasant by writing long posts (similar to the ones written by their ""intern"" on their social media platforms and blog) saying things like ""yes, they lie, but who doesn't?"" making it sound like lying is no big thing, everybody does it. They are lying about almost every single aspect of their lives. They complain about living in that trailer, hell, they even make scenes where they wake up in the trailer (hair done, make-up on, first thing they do is turn on the camera), trying to keep up the farce for as long as possible, even though evidence shows they haven't been living there (especially in the winter time).

They try to delete everything they have posted on their older schemes so nobody can notice that what they are doing is cyclical. They delete everything that doesn't fit with their new narrative. They buy views and subscribers (but like qqererer says ""everybody does it"" right? NO. Not everybody does it, not everyone is a piece of shit).

Ever since these several clowns joined this subreddit everything that can be considered evidence that this whole thing is a scheme to make money off gullible people is now labeled as ""doxxing"".

I thought this subreddit was about bringing things to light and discouraging this kind of ill-reputable practice on youtube. Letting people know not to donate money for a scheme ran by a couple of greedy internet marketers.

If the only purpose of this sub is to post their clips (btw that is how they're getting even more clicks) then you're helping them achieve their goal.

So, I ask again, why has the dynamic of this sub suddenly changed and what is the purpose of it? (MuzzleBot and qqererer I'm not interested in your opinions, I already know what your intentions are)."
8vivcx,3,2018-07-02,Any advice for a guy with no experience?,forget4,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8vivcx/any_advice_for_a_guy_with_no_experience/,"I've posted before and have been looking for some kind of advice on what I need to do to get over my neediness. I'm 23 years old, never been able to get into a relationship or have sex, I've just had a few first and second dates which didn't end well, and kissed a few of those girls. I haven't been able to get a date in over a year and a half either, just polite rejections.

I know I have much confidence, low self esteem, I'm a people pleaser, and anxious. These are all things I'm working on though, I've improved a bit on all of this in the past month but still have a lot to work on. I have been told to refrain from dating for the next months or couple of years until I'm able to be happy single because anyone I date will end up treating me the same way as girls have in the past and it overall wouldn't be a good experience for someone to be with a guy like me. 

Other than that I am doing ok every where else in my life. I'm apparently not horrible to look at, I go to the gym 3 times a week and people have noticed and I feel the difference, I dress nicely and people compliment my style, I have many friends who are guys and girls and they all like hanging out and talking to me and trust me more than other people it seems and they find me a funny and social guy. I recently graduated from college and have a job lined up, currently working on some extra education for my career as well. I don't really drink, or like parties or clubs though. 

I also take rejection easily, if a girl isn't interested I'm ok with it and go about my life. Its not fun being rejected but I don't make it a big deal. In one instance a girl wanted to show me a picture of her boyfriend to prove she wasn't lying despite me telling her she didn't have to and she seemed extremely flattered that I found her attractive but she also seemed kind of guilty for having to reject me. Two other instances girls have told me they were flattered but had boyfriends. Clearly I can't explain in 100% detail what I have gone through and what I said to every girl but I'm just trying to give whatever information I can.

Overall, my issues stem from my lack of confidence, self esteem, being a people pleaser, and anxiety. I've been through some bad experiences with the girls I've dated but I don't see women as bad. I am refraining from dating because people said I should and it wouldn't lead to a good relationship because of my neediness and lack of self esteem. I have reached the point though where I want to be alone for the rest of my life, not ever going for anything beyond a platonic relationship with women because I don't see a point. I feel that I have missed out on so much by this point in my life, I got through college without a single relationship or any of those crazy fun experiences people have. I get I might meet people later in life somehow but anyone I meet now will always be comparing me to their ex or remember the great times. Considering how people say I need to be alone for a while before putting myself out there again I feel its best if I just stay alone and not try putting myself out there again even if someone wanted to date me.

The main reason I posted this is because I went to an appointment today and I saw a girl there that I met a prior appointment. We both went to the same university and graduated this year but we met about a month ago at her job. She is an assistant or intern it seems. Anyways, I've been working on myself and keeping away from trying to date and all of that. I feel a bit more confident as well but when I saw her I had this feeling of not being good enough/I need to avoid dating at all costs.

I know what everyone is going to say, she works there and will get into trouble if I asked her out, she would be uncomfortable, etc. I wasn't going to ask her out, I know I'm not supposed to talk to or ask out women that are working, but I am attracted to her. She is attractive and also friendly and talkative. Anyways, she wasn't helping me today and just stood in the back waiting until the doctor needed her help. I felt awkward if I tried to say hi or something since its a big open space where everyone is being helped. Also, this is for physical therapy, not a regular doctors office. So I just spoke to the assistant(?) helping me and didn't really speak to the girl until she had to walk past me as I was waiting and said excuse me.

I wasn't being standoffish or rude or anything to her, I just found it awkward to try talking to her or saying hi since it felt like I would have been forcing it. Plus I forgot her name since last time I saw her was a month ago. I just felt really conflicted, like of course I'm not supposed to ask her out or anything like that, especially in this big open room with a few people and her boss. And I'm supposed to avoid dating as well anyways so even if I saw her at a bar I shouldn't be trying to ask her out. I also felt like she isn't someone that would want a guy like me, I was bringing myself down. 

What I want to know is, are there any women out there that ended up with the first guy they met and did you not get to date until later in life after everyone else? If thats the case how do you feel about it? Or if you married a guy with no real past experience or bad experiences with women how do you feel about that? Clearly that situation with me and the girl working at the office is my own specific problem, not hers or anyone elses and I was not going to ask her out. But have any women been in similar situations where they were told to be single, work on themselves, avoid dating, and then felt conflicted when they had an opportunity to meet someone? Have any women felt like giving up on dating completely when they learned they have their own issues that have sabotaged their relationships or lead to men treating them not so great? 

Also, how do you view a guy like me with no experience and just bad experiences with girls? I'm not blaming these girls completely for what happened. I was a people pleaser, lacked confidence, accommodated myself to make things easier for them, etc. They took advantage of that and started playing games with me, stringing me along, telling me lies, seeing other guys, etc rather than just dump me or tell me they didn't like what I was doing. So again I'm not blaming them completely but they didn't help the situation once they realized they could do whatever they wanted. I feel like it makes me look like a joke towards women. I think I can be more confident and accept myself a little more but if anyone ever asks me why I'm single or find out I'm a virgin somehow I'm not sure what to say or do. I clearly had a part in my failures and I feel like a woman would just see me as a guy with no confidence and a people pleaser if they ever found out what I've been through. Even if I completely overcame all of my personality flaws. Any advice or thoughts on what you think would be really appreciated.

tldr; 23 year old guy with no relationship experience, a virgin, bad dating experiences, lack of confidence, people pleaser, anxious but working on it, avoiding dating but conflicted on whether its worth it to ever try again even after overcoming my flaws and if any woman was interested."
8vj1zm,11,2018-07-02,I (19f) can't tell if my fwb (21m) really likes me or just wants sex,yeikss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8vj1zm/i_19f_cant_tell_if_my_fwb_21m_really_likes_me_or/,"My first post on here, so bear with me --

So we've been hooking up since February. We met when he was on an internship near me (tinder, lol) and I started going to his place pretty much every weekend. We've never had drunk sex (which I heard was common for tinder hookups) -- not bc we're prudes or anything, clearly, just because I'm not comfortable with underage drinking and the most I ever drink is like 1/2 a bottle of very low alcohol beer in the presence of responsible adults, and he respected that and just chose not to drink around me even though I told him I don't mind. 

He's always been very attentive and caring while having sex. The very first time he asked her explicitly whether or not I wanted it ""do you want this?"" ""Is this okay"" etc, multiple times, and he's always careful to make sure he's not hurting me and that I'm enjoying myself and stuff like that. He's not just the ~I got what I want so we're done here~ type

Often, I would stay the night and we would chill and watch movies and cook dinner and sometimes we would go out and romp around town and go thrifting, record store shopping, get dinner, etc.

When it was time for him to move back to college (about 3.5 hours away from me) I told him basically ""oh shit hey I caught The Feels™"" and he said ""I like you but I don't know if I can do the ldr thing because I have friends who do and I see them struggling with it all the time"" and I was like ""yeah I get that"" and we were chill. 

He continues to text me every day, usually all throughout the day unless he's really busy with school in which case he'll text me when he gets a chance toward the end of the day and be like ""I'm sorry, I had [projects, responsibilities, events] going on"" which like -- if what I think doesn't matter why explain yourself, y'know? 

So since he's been back at college, he has invited me to make the 3.5 hour drive back to his home to see him (which I did once, because I was already planning to go see my mom later that weekend so I just decided to make a little getaway out of it) and we stayed in his house that night and watched Netflix and then went out to town for breakfast before I parted ways to go visit my mom, another 2.5 hours away). 

Then, I was planning a weekend trip to see my mom again (rented an Airbnb for three nights because my mom's place is too small) and I was planning to have her stay w me the first night, spend most of Thursday + Friday with me, and then stay alone Friday night, and the guy was supposed to come Saturday to see me and stay Saturday night but he ended up texting me on Thursday and asked if he could come Friday evening through Sunday instead which turned into Friday afternoon because he really wanted to see me -- when he arrived we fucked around because it had been a month (for me, I don't know for him whether or not he's being exclusive, which he seems like he could be but I'm going to go ahead and assume that he's not because we haven't discussed exclusivity -- I am being exclusive because honestly I just don't have the time right now or the desire to fuck multiple people). Anyway after that we went out to get chipotle (kind of a tradition for us) and I accidentally routed us to a downtown location so we found a parking garage and walked to the chipotle, got out food, took it home, then just chilled and watched a couple movies. 

The next morning we fucked around some more and then went downtown because he'd never been to the city we were in and I am very familiar with it so I wanted to show him around. We went window shopping all around and then got some breakfast and I showed him all over (we ended up walking like four miles in the 90 degree weather which was AWFUL but we were having a good time). Then we decided we were gonna go get groceries and cook dinner, which ended up taking like three hours because we're both scatterbrained shoppers if we don't have a list and the traffic was a little gnarly.

So we get back, make dinner, he refers to me as ""wife"" and ""mom"" multiple times to which I just roll my eyes (because I'm still a teen and naturally I should act like one?) and then we eat and he starts watching some show that's nearing the series end and he's like ""we can change it if you don't like it"" but turns out I actually really like this show BECAUSE IT'S INTERESTING so I keep asking questions to figure out exactly what's going on and we end up watching like three episodes and he's just like ""I can't believe you're watching this with me"" and then we end up talking for a while and we got on the subject of IQ's and ended up taking IQ tests for like an hour and a half before just cuddling up and falling asleep, and then we woke up like thirty minutes later and having some wild sex and then knocking out for the rest of the night.

The next morning we woke up and did it one more time and I came for the first time from penetration so that was cool. (So much tmi in this. I'm sorry. I need more friends to load this on). 

He had homework so we parted ways (small detail but we always greet each other and part ways with a kiss which might be a normal fwb thing but Idk?) 

So yeah... I just don't know. I get that the best way to crack down on this is to ask him what he wants/how he feels but I'm reluctant after the first time. I get that if he doesn't want more that I'm kind of wasting my time but I'm genuinely just really comfortable where I'm at with him because I'm having a good time and he is too, but I'm also like, getting to the point where I feel kind of sad when we part ways because I just like being around him and I don't like being so far away and not knowing when I'll see him again.

A couple of other details (as if this post isn't long enough) -- he was supposed to get transferred to an internship like 2 hours away from me (beginning in August) and so when I first told him how I felt he said basically just ""we'll continue our adventures this fall!"" but now he might not be interning there so I don't know how far he'll be but also we've clearly been continuing our adventures through this summer. He also said (right before he moved back to school from the previous internship) ""might never see you again"" but now he always says ""see ya soon"" and ""drive safe"" and ""text me when you get home"" and stuff like that (he's always said the latter two but the ""see you soon"" is new)

Another possibly irrelevant detail? When we first hooker up he called me hot when we had sex but now he says ""you're so beautiful"" and ""you're so hot"" if it's reaaaaaally intense and he also calls me beautiful or cute whenever we wake up together even though I'm well aware that my septum ring is probably crooked and my hair is a disheveled wreck.

I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. But like y'all. How do you interpret this? Are we fwb? Does it seem like he wants more? Am I wasting my time?? I just would like some outside advice from a neutral source.

Sorry for all the details. Help ya girl out tho I need help 

TL;DR:
FWB (21m) seems to act like more but I (19f) am not really clear because this is all new territory to me.

Edit: had the terrifying ""what are we"" talk about six weeks ago and we have been ""officially a couple"" since. :)"
8vj28m,2,2018-07-02,Looking for an Inpatient Program,trashpotatoextreme,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/8vj28m/looking_for_an_inpatient_program/,"I'm looking for a good inpatient program. I've talked to my psychologist, and she thinks I'm at my tipping point and that hospitalization might be helpful. I've been dealing with chronic pain for two years, going to different types of doctors every week or so. No one knows what's wrong with me. They thought it might be fibromyalgia, but they said not all of my symptoms match. It's also not an autoimmune disorder. So they titled it ""a physical symptom of a mood disorder."" I keep having meltdowns, which include crying, screaming, throwing/breaking things, hitting things, and crying some more. I keep having thoughts about self harm and suicide. (And I recently cut myself again. I couldn't take it.) I cant get it out of my head. No matter what I'm doing, these horrible thoughts are just there. I keep asking for help from doctors, but right now I'm at a stand still and I don't know how to handle it. But, my Psychologist thinks staying in an inpatient facility could be helpful so that they could possibly balance my meds, and get rid of some pain? Maybe? 

In the morning I take Gabbapentin and Cymbalta. And in the evenings I take Gabbapentin, Cymbalta, and Seroquel. I can't remember the doses right now. 

I missed a week of work last week unable to do anything due to pain. Every morning I wake up, hardly able to move. I'm sensitive to heat and cold. Meaning, I'll get sweaty, lightheaded, and extremely nauseous in the heat. And in the cold my whole body aches. My bones ache all day. Not just my joints, but my bones. So bad that I can't walk sometimes. It's like a sharp, aching pain that just radiates from one place (it never starts in the same place) until my whole body just hurts. I have horrible headaches. Nausea. I've lost 10 pounds from barely having an appetite from either nausea or a bad moos. I'm exhausted even when I get lots of sleep. I slept from 10 pm to 4 pm recently. Similar hours for that whole week I missed. I just feel sick. And it makes me angry. 

I'm 18, and I feel like an old lady. I'm an artist and a gardener, and now I can barely use my hands or get out of bed. I start back college in a few weeks, and I'm terrified I won't do well because of my problems. My internship also ends next month, and I'll be out of a job. The problem though, is I'm afraid to get another. I can barely make it through this one. 

Recently though, everything has been bothering me. Everything makes me extremely angry. I swear I get into a stupid fight with someone everyday, and I can't stop it. It's such a strong anger, it just consumes me. I feel like I could spit fire. I want to hurt people, and myself, and throw things and scream. I just don't know how to cope with this feeling.

I just need help. I know these feelings aren't right. I don't want to think like this anymore. It's driving me crazy.

I live in Alabama, but I'm willing to travel to Georgia too. I have Cigna insurance. I'm struggling to find a good facility. Can anyone help? What should I do? I"

I got cheated on in May by the man I genuinely thought I had a solid future with. He cheated on me with one of his interns at work, who knew about me from day 1, but decided to flirt with him all the time and make a move on him before she moved away for a job. Apparently he had had some minor feelings for her but wrote them off, but cheated when he found out how she felt.

I found out, he lied to my face. I had proof and I’m not dumb, so he finally admitted it. He manipulated me and lied to me for another three weeks straight in order to keep me hanging around as an option while he actively pursued the other girl, and had been pursuing her for weeks. He is not the person I fell in love with. He was like Jekyll and Hyde. Angry and rude and distant when we fought about it then would grovel and apologize after.

He gaslit me, mocked me at times, tried to blame me and make me seem like the bad guy. I couldn’t eat, sleep, be functional. I lost weight and was emotionally destroyed. He felt bad for less than a week maybe and then just didn’t care at all, felt no remorse. He cheated on me with a girl who’s apparently a bum and off her rocker crazy.

I’ve been finding out more and more lies and info from other people reaching out to me. I haven’t had romantic feelings for him for well over a month now, but I can’t let go of the insane amount of rage and anger and hurt I feel. We talked about a future and he freaked out saying he didn’t know if he could do distance...then cheated on me to do distance with another girl who’s obsessed with him and blowing smoke up his ass. 

I’m dating someone else now and I want to be able to move past this and give him the chance he deserves because he’s been wonderful to me. I’m not sure how to let go of all of this 

TL;DR: BF cheated, lied, and manipulated me and I can’t move on from the anger and hurt in my new relationship "
8vksqk,6,2018-07-02,Kinda Bummed,tysonsk,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/8vksqk/kinda_bummed/,"Kinda a long post…..

I am kinda bummed because I recently acquired a marijuana paraphernalia charge. Per court’s orders, I am on 6 months of probation, have to take random drug tests, have to take 16 hours of drug classes, and it’s gonna cost me $700+. The worst part about it is I feel like I should have never gotten in trouble in the first place.

I just also want to say that bringing drugs/paraphernalia to a state park is an extremely stupid idea. I have no excuse for that.  

Story: 

This happened in April. In the first week of April, I accepted an internship offer, in which I knew had a mandatory drug test on the first day. All throughout the spring I had been smoking heavily, sometimes everyday, and knew that I needed to quit weed in order to safely pass my drug test a few weeks later. This was an easy decision for me. I quit the day that I accepted my offer and stayed clean until after I successfully completed my drug testing a month later. 

Although I quit smoking, I still had a bong, that I let all my friends use. I’m a pretty generous guy. I practically gave this bong to all my friends to use on an indefinite loan. In fact, the bong was never really in my posession. My friends always kept it in their rooms, but it was technically mine since I was the one that purchased it originally. 

Fast forward to a week later, some of my friends and I decide to go camping at a local state park. I was with 7 of my friends. Plenty of weed and paraphernalia was brought out, but little did I know that, I, being the only one out of the friend group that didn’t smoke that night, would eventually get a charge. To make it worse, I didn’t even bring the bong with me to the campsite. My friend brought it in his car. 

I will say though, before we went camping, my friend asked me if he could bring the bong. I said yeah, trying to be generous and friendly, but I didn’t know that would later bite me in the back. He knew full well that I also gave up smoking a week before and had no intention to smoke that night. 

You can probably guess what happened next. In the night, a ranger pulled up to our campsite and caught us. After patting all of us down, he picks up my bong first and asks “Whose is this?” Either one of you can speak up or all of you will get the charge.” At this point I was freaking out. I wasn’t smoking, and I didn’t even bring the bong with me, but since I technically purchased it 8 months prior, I felt some sense of responsibility. Everyone remained silent. No one spoke up, not even the friend who brought the bong, the same one who I lent it to 2 weeks prior. 

I eventually, spoke up and claimed possession of the bong. Here are my questions: Should I have just remained silent and let everyone share the charge for the bong? Did I do the morally right thing by taking the charge, since I technically purchased it? What would you have done if you were in my situation? 

After that night, I was thoroughly pissed. Everyone at the campsite was using my bong EXCEPT me, and I was the one who got the charge for it. I should have never been so friendly with my possessions. I also feel like the courts wouldn’t be able to pin the bong on one person if 8 people were charged. The case would probably have been dismissed.  

I felt betrayed. I feel like there is an unspoken rule that if you lend someone illegal paraphernalia to use for an indefinite period of time, like a bong, that person automatically assumes ownership of it when shit goes down, and the cops come. Maybe that’s just me. 

Let me know what you guys think. 

TL/DR: I quit smoking because of an internship. Gave my friend my bong to use indefinitely because I couldn’t smoke. Friends got caught, cops came, but I got a charge. I feel like I didn’t deserve that charge given the circumstances. "

As I've said, our first year together was incredible. There was enough love in that year to fill most 50 year relationships.

But a few small problems started to show themselves which I ignored early on that first year. Within the first couple of months of our relationship, while I was at a concert with my buddies she texted me with an earth shattering message: ""I think I love you more than you love me. Maybe we shouldn't be together"".... it hit me like lightning to the chest. I had to drop everything at the concert with my buddies and went outside to calm her and talk her through why she said that and get her to come back to me and stay in the relationship. I convinced her and she did.

Toward the end of that first year, these situations started to become more and more frequent and I felt like she was becoming insecure with me...I'd get these same texts while I was at work and class, many times a week. She became frustrated even when I wouldn't text her back quickly enough (within an hour) while I was trying to focus on work and thought it was because I didn't love her.... Oh, I assure you that I loved her more than anything, but I had to convince her she was wrong over and over and would inevitably always get her to stay with me. Though, over time, having to constantly do this started to really wear me down and I would start to get aggressive with her and wouldn't be empathetic to what she was feeling. I would tell her that I felt like I was rolling a bolder up a mountain trying to convince her to stay with me only for it to roll back down onto me days later, and then I would have to roll the rock up again. Being aggressive with her in this way and telling her I felt like I was wearing thin made her become even more insecure with me and made her retract emotionally; these events occurred over and over, so many times that I would almost start to predict when the next one may occur.

At some point I slightly began to lose some of my attraction for her because of these incidents and felt like I was being pushed away. When she felt me wane, it felt like she would become even more insecure with me. We also started arguing about a lot of things - politics being the main topic and I was very combative/ aggressive with my arguments and stupidly took a lot of her responses as personal attacks. My aggression would shut her down completely, emotionally. When my attraction waned, being the stupid person I am, I looked to porn to quench my sexual desires. I also started saving a lot of Instagram pics of porn stars/models into my phone and I friended girls on facebook. Just to be clear, I would never cheat on her. Not ever, because i loved her more than anything I've been cheated on and I know what it feels like, and I never did cheat on her. But my behavior appeared to be heading down that path. We still had sex, but she felt crushed because she could feel my attraction fading slightly and felt like it was because I no longer found her to be physically attractive. Tangent, I assure you she is and was physically attractive - like I said, she has the body of a goddess and the face of an angel - but it was her behavior that was pushing me away from her and making me feel like I did. I also had another stupid reddit post about these events which I posted a year or so ago. Anyway, one day she got a hold of my phone one weekend and saw the porn and the pics and it hurt her so much. I was so stupid. But inevitably I got her to come around with my rationalizations (which were so wrong and so stupid looking back). I told her ""it was just a guy thing"" and that I would stop and so we went from there.

I relapsed many times and ended up becoming addicted to porn. As a result, she felt unattractive and it hurt her so much to the point where she felt emotionally damaged and she broke up with me a couple times and the second time was the worst. She was staying at my parents house for a while and she came back one day after her day at her internship, and was so incredibly sad; she talked to my mom and my dad about me and how she had to break up with me. I felt so terrible, so I came back to my home town that day after work to console her and be with her. I tried to comfort her and again was able to get her to come around; but it was a temporary fix because at this point I still didn't understand the root of the problem.

That next summer, she graduated from her program, and in the fall, we moved in together. She decided to start a graduate degree as well and I was in my last year of mine. We had a lot of really nice times together - we watched a whole bunch of anime, we spent time together studying and eating out (a lot of panda express) and listening to music and shes also a great cook so she would also cook and I would pretend to help and then eat. We went to concerts (Bruno Mars) and wed see shows together including her favorite: Phantom of the Opera. She loved me so incredibly much - I was her universe - and I loved her more than anything, too. But those occurrences didn't stop, it became even more frequent with her feeling she was not being loved. I became increasingly more and more frustrated as I was trying to balance an oppressive father who obsessed over my life, was trying to finish two master degrees (econ and stats) and was trying to roll the stone up the mountain with my girl; everything culminated with our last breakup in early April, 2018. We broke up after my interview for a Statistician position at Nissan. It was the most intense interview of my life and I had not eaten the whole day before it because of my anxiety; the interview was in my home town so I had to drive two hours for the two hour interview. The interview was in the afternoon and I felt so incredibly tired that I decided I was going to stay the night there. It was my mistake to not contact her and tell her I wasn't coming home that night; she got extremely upset about it and took it as my not caring about her and so we broke up.

After the breakup, I took some time to myself to reflect - roughly three weeks with almost zero contact with her. I spent so much time thinking about our relationship and what went wrong and I was so incredibly lonely without her and missed her so incredibly much. I started to think about my upbringing with my father and mother. My father was an intense, self made, anxiety inducing man who obsessed over my life. I grew up with him working a job in which he made six figures but that required he travel to different countries for months at a time while my mom was at home, lonely, taking care of the baby version of me. I remember as a toddler seeing her crying and pleading with him to come home and I would talk to him on the phone and always ask in a sad tone if he was coming home tonight. My dad was very neglectful of my mother and me but always told me he had to do this so my mother and I could live the comfortable life that we did.

As I grew older, my dad became an obsessive and controlling force in my life. He almost lived his life through my eyes as he pushed me to train in martial arts, wrestling, and gymnastics. I had my blackbelt at 10 years old and was at an elite level by the time I was in eighth grade in all three. At one point I was training 24 hours a week at an elite level in gymnastics and 10 hours a week in wrestling (I was varsity my freshman year; martial arts had to fall off the table). I barely had time to do my homework (but he pushed me to maintain a good gpa as well) - I barely had time to do anything but what he made me do. Because of his obsessive drive for my success in my endeavors, he continued to neglect my mother - I do not recall a time when I saw him truly show affection to her - and he failed to teach me so many important lessons about how to treat a woman. I never had a girlfriend before college. This was how I grew up. And when I finally got to university, knowing nothing about girls, I went through several groups of friends, the majority of the guys in these groups were straight womanizers... they talked about the girls they had been with, porn, who they wanted to be with... you name it, thats what we discussed. I didn't have much input because I didn't have any experience until my junior year in college in which I met a girl who i spent a brief period of time with and who inevitably lied to me and was actually seeing another guy behind my back. During my senior year, I met another girl who did the same. Now I had never had sex before at this point, and all my friends looked to me as a model man - a good disciplined guy who they actually idealized.

When I finally met the love of my life, I had almost no experience with girls... My dad never taught me how to treat girls and what I knew, I knew from my friends... I realized the problem was me!!! The reason my girl was so seemingly insecure was because I wasn't treating her like the queen she was; I wasn't giving her the attention and the affirmations she deserved: like telling her about how beautiful she was whenever I could or when she specifically did her hair or wore sexy cloths just for me - I didn't make the connection because all I knew was what I saw from my dad neglecting my mother. She would try to reach me and get my attention time after time and I didn't understand... overtime it started to make her think I didn't love her and because I never truly addressed the problem, those occurrences kept happening over and over and over and each time I failed to get it, her negative feeling and emotions started to snowball... this lead me to the porn which I believed was a normal thing for a guy from what I learned from my friends... I was so wrong! I was so so so wrong! It shouldn't have ever been about me; it should have been about making her feel like she was loved and attractive and the queen she truly was. If the porn was getting in the way of that, it wasn't a normal guy thing; it was a bad thing. I understood everything, I understood my mistakes after those revelations I had in those three weeks.

She came back from her home town one weekend which is where she was staying for those three weeks. She sat down and told me in a wavering and almost sad tone that ""she had met someone"" and that ""he was coming over that night to watch her dodgeball game"". My world came crashing down, because I didn't get a chance to tell her everything I realized and that I understood! I told her I still loved her so much and to please reconsider having him over - I was ok with him going to the game, but he was also scheduled to stay the night in our apartment that night. So that entailed me staying in the room next-door to the girl who I loved more than anything as she slept with another dude she met in the three weeks we didn't talk. I tried so hard to get her to reconsider, I did everything but she wouldn't reconsider; I felt so incredibly sad that I ended up checking into the ER that night because I was considering suicide... yes suicide... I was texting her in the time I spent in the hospital telling her everything I wish I could have had the chance to tell her without her being with him that night.

I checked out of the ER at around 5 am and I came back to my apartment. The guy had work in the morning and left around 6 am. She came to me in my room and consoled me and assured me that it was me who she wanted to be with and who she loved and who she wanted to have a family with. I felt assured that she was my girl once more (though we were not ever official again). That Friday I was in her room while she was packing for the weekend to go back to her hometown for karaoke and drinking with her family. I was ok with this and as she was packing I brought her into me and started to take her pants off because I craved her sexually. Normally she would fold like a leaf and we would have an incredible time... this time she folded but then retracted a couple times. I knew something wasn't right; she told me she felt bad because she was just with that guy and felt bad being with me - note, she also assured me that the guy she had met was a virgin and was waiting till marriage to have sex - though I was a bet apprehensive, I accepted it and she left for the weekend and told me she'd be back Sunday night.

My anxiety got to me and I began to text her a little too much because I worried she had left to see him (he lived in a town not far from her hometown) . She assured me this was not the case. I accepted it. Saturday came around and I started to feel the anxiety again! I started texting her Saturday night, incessantly, and she told me she was crying to her sister in law and didn't know what to do! She loved me more than anything, but she told me this guy also really liked her and they had kissed and that she had never not been in a relationship with someone after kissing them. I plead my case as hard as I could to get her to return to me. She told me she needed some space which I stupidly didn't give to her as I continued to text her... she returned Sunday night and everything seemed somewhat normal...

That next week was the week before finals week for her and all of her finals were take-home so she spent that week doing them and I spent that week helping her with them as well as giving her some of my adderall whenever she needed them (the courses she was taking were relatively difficult and so her finals required a lot of focus and effort). I also spent that week trying so hard to explain to her everything I realized about the problems that occurred in our relationship and how it was all completely my fault and how I understood my mistakes and was trying to change for the better. I tried my best to show her that week firsthand by spending my time with her and filling her with confidence about herself while treating her with love, kindness, and understanding. We got to the end of that week onThursday and I was a bit suspicious of her as she was texting in the corner of her bed while I was working on stuff. I tried to remain unwaivered but couldn't help but think she was talking to him even though she assured me several times that it wasn't the case.... I walked into my room and she followed... we proceeded to have the most incredible sex ever that night and then ordered dominoes and went to sleep. Come Friday night, we were cramming to finish a final that was due that Wednesday... I didn't understand why we were cramming that night so hard when there was plenty of time but she told me she was going home for karaoke again with her family that weekend. I accepted it, though I was a little suspicious... I told her I knew the guy she had been talking to cause I saw he had liked one of her facebook pics... after assuring me she wasn't talking to him, she told me at around 1 am that she had to bring a fruit salad to a cookout that her program was putting on the next day. She assured me she just wanted to go there and drop off the fruit salad and that she would be back within 15 minutes. I accepted and so we went to meijer at around 2am, got the ingredients she needed and I sat in the kitchen while she made the fruit salad she was going to bring to the cookout. We laid down around 4 am and literally had the best sex we've ever had to date (there have been some contenders, though). We got up that morning, I gave her an adderall again since she was tired and I saw that she was packing her backpack with her stuff including her computer and exam stuff... she said she was going to talk to her classmates about the final and I was completely ok with this. She needed my computer charger, though since she left hers at her house the weekend prior. That was ok with me.

I had some work that I needed to get done that day so I took an adderall as well minutes after she left... she told me she was dropping off the fruit salad and shed be back. I figured since she took her backpack that she would probably be at least an hour or two. So an couple hours pass and I realize she hadn't come back and my adderall was kicking in hardcore and I needed my computer charger so I could get my work done since my computer was dead so I contacted her through text simply asking if she was somewhere on campus where I could come to just get the charger from her - I didn't want to disturb her if she was working on her final with her friends. I got no answer, so I let another hour pass and texted her again the same thing and got no response. I texted her a half hour later and I was a bit frustrated but also worried something may have happened to her and got no response. I called and got no response. So I started driving around campus trying to find her and was extremely worried something may have happened; I did that for an hour and then contacted her friends and finally her mom who told me she was safe and that her plans must have changed as she was not planning to return that night... I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was the first time I saw my girl as someone or something that I no longer knew... I was so angered, so frustrated and so anxious! Not only was I not able to do my work since she had my computer charger, but she lied to me, she used me - my time, my drugs, my energy - and she took advantage of my trust and betrayed it! At the time I didn't know where she had gone, but later found out she left to stay at that guys house...

I was shellshocked... I tried so hard to show her I understood the mistakes I made and that I was so sorry and that they would never happen again... and she crushed me, completely!

I got so angry that night and demanded she return with my charger! She inevitably did the next day on Sunday after my struggling to get a hold of her and ended up making it a touch and go type of situation. But I convinced her to stay because of course I still love her and I wanted her with me! She was not touchy with me any longer and that's when I knew for certain, deep down, she had been still seeing and talking to that dude. We ordered some sushi and she spent time trying to finish the remainder of her finals. I came into her room and laid next to her as she finished the final she was working on... she wasn't touchy at all... I let it slide and we fell asleep.

The next day she had a Drs. appointment and took her computer and USB drive with her to the appointment to finish up one of her finals. She ended up breaking the usb drive which held her finals data and other important files. She returned to me quickly for help and skipped her appointment and I miraculously fixed the drive and recovered her files and she was able to turn in her final that that day. I was happy as she was acting closer to me again and I felt like she was my girl again even though I still had a gut feeling there was still something else going on. Sure enough, she ended up wanting to go home that night which had me anxious, yet again! She left because she said I felt unsafe (of course I was a little overly anxious about the whole situation because I didn't know what in the hell was going on and where I stood and if she was my girl or not). She always assured me she wasn't going to see that guy and I trusted her.

Let me try to wrap it up: so this sort of thing kept happening i.e. she would go back and forth from our apartment to her home and would stay in her hometown for the weekend... it turns out she was seeing that guy and I found out the hard way after driving there one weekend to find his car there (that same morning she came to me and was laying in my bed while I was helping her with something on excel - she actually reassured me that morning that she wasn't talking to him). Long story short, I was crushed again... and then they got into a relationship shortly after... she knew him only five weeks and got into a relationship with him... the next Monday she got into an argument with him and she returned to me and I took her in and comforted her, bought us dominoes and supported her with her PowerPoint presentation she had to give the next week... I was under the impression she was breaking up with him and she assured me of this and also that she ""wasn't going to lie to me anymore"" and that she ""wasn't out to hurt me"". She stayed at our place that night but was quick to leave the next day back to her hometown to take her mom to a Drs. Appointment. She stayed there that night and then returned the next day. Things seemed ok the next day - I gave her another adderall so she could get through her presentation as she stayed up late trying to finish it - and the rest of the week seemed ok, though in the back of my mind there was always something I didn't feel good about, but she acted like she did when we together again (we were telling each other we loved one another, calling the pet names, etc.) and she assured me time and time again she wasn't going to lie to me and that she wasn't out to hurt me...

She left that weekend yet again which I felt anxious about... I found out yet again she went to see him... and she didn't break up with him at all... once again she lied to me, used me, and crushed me with little remorse! I began to think ""who the fuck is this person?"" the sweet girl I knew who was so loyal to me and loved me so much now frequently manipulated and lied to me... I couldn't believe it... I still can't believe it. It feels so horrible.

She came back to me a couple more times and stayed the night even while she was in a relationship with him, so she cheated on him several times ... but she ended up signing a lease and moving in with that guy about three weeks after I found out she didn't breakup with him.

Shes been back since to my apartment on a number of more occasions and has cheated on him with me again (i am not proud of that) but still will not stay.

I am suffering so much from all of this; I've tried so hard to show her how much I love her, how much I care, how thoroughly I understand my mistakes and have taken the measures to correct them i.e. I haven't watched porn now for 12 weeks, I assured her of her beauty and intelligence (which are undeniably) every chance I got when she was with me! I did so much, so much to get her to see, to get her to hear me! I became too much, however, and she blocked me on social media... I feel so horrible because I love her so much! More than anything, even still! And I have so many options with girls I could be with, but I don't care about them at all! I've remained so devoted to her, so loyal, even now when I don't have to be. And i'm going to be interviewing for a data science position which I have about a 99% chance of getting since they reached out to me a month after I interviewed initially, I proved an excellent fit but was beaten out by someone who had a little more experience... this new position is mine for the taking! I'm going to be making six figures! I'm going to be able to do all the things I wanted to do with her which includes leaving on weekends for Florida to go to Disney World, Vegas, fuck whatever the hell we want to do! Thats what I wanted to do with her cause she means everything to me. She is also so special to me since she is the only one i've been with sexually, and thats how I wanted it! I want to marry this girl, go everywhere, and do everything with her! I'm suffering here without her and I know I could have other girls who would die for this, but she's my girl! I'm not the same dude, and I could treat her so amazingly and shes the one I want to be with! I just wish so badly that she would see that.

What are your thoughts about the situation? Is it worth my effort?

I love you so much. So much. Please return to me

\*\*tl:dr\*\* long post - part 2 regarding my second year with my girlfriend and our breakup and my hopes to be with her again - shes the love of my life

UPDATE: She admitted to me that she had several times lined up people to be with while we were still in a relationship but when she knew a breakup was on its way. The last guy she met, she met while she was still with me as well so she essentially cheated on me :(((

UPDATE: I spent two years of my life dedicated to getting my degrees and a job so I could have a future with her and a family. I am so absolutely crushed. I've felt suicidal more times than not :((( and I spent so much time trying to correct myself for her so she would be happy with me only for my soul to be annihilated over and over again. Its very hard to bare this burden. I love her, but I hate her."

1. I completed levels 1 and 2 of the Computer Programmer Analyst program last year with a Windows laptop (32GB RAM, Intel Core i7). Will I be able to use this laptop for school work, or should I purchase a Mac? Why?
2. How would you recommend I prepare (i.e. should I start teaching myself javascript, any particular concepts)?
3. Is the 'internship' in level 4 paid?
4. Will it be hard to find relevant employment, in London or in general?

The first time I watched she was one of my favorite characters. I loved Christina! She was Brilliant, focused, hard-core, and everything I wanted to be. However...After rewatching I just can't stand her whatsoever. 

All of the characters have faults, but Christina's selfishness is more than a fault. It's horrifying. She seems nearly incapable of empathy is almost every situation. The entire Burke Arc is just appalling. Burke is such a wonderful character he is so talented, loving, giving, etc. However, she ruins him. She becomes so powerful in their relationship that Burke questions fellow surgeons in their ORs, schedules his surgeries and essentially preforms them for him AS AN INTERN. Honestly, I feel like this really should've been detected and dealt with especially since this was going on at the exact same time Izzy was facing extreme punishment for unprofessionalism. Christina needed to learn her place but instead took advantage of Burke as an authority figure. It's just...awful in my opinion. She consistently has no empathy with patients and is only there for the medicine. Which is interesting because Karev often takes heat for his lack of empathy/poor bedside manor but no one ever mentions Yang because she's ""the best"". Furthermore, does no one realize how much she's harming her education by basically only doing Cardio surgeries as an intern?? Why does Bailey allow it to go on?? The entire thing is overwhelimingly frustrated. 

A lot of people love Christina because of her friendship with Merideth but does everyone seem to forget when she basically told Merideth that having children put her out of the running of being an incredible surgeon??? Merideth went on to win the Harper Avery Award. She's a brilliant surgeon and great mom even without derek there. Even before this, if you go back and rewatch their early friendship everytime merideth talks about her problems Christina is always so consumed in her own. She also never shows empathy even with Merideth. I just can't relate to how heartless she is. 

Does anyone else hate Christina????"

I want to install WinServer but for personal daily use. 

What prompted this crazy idea ? I'm running Linux for this past year, with Win7 DualBoot (for photoshop, office, and some occasional games). 

Before that I had Win10 Pro, which after some tuning was doing fine at first, but with the unstoppable stream of updates I started having some bugs (visual ones with Firefox, forced restarts, lag when the browser is the only app open ...) and this prompted the rage quit and switching to Linux (which has been nothing but smooth so far).

I now planning to switch to .NET software developing (internship) and I'd need a newer Windows version to support some software/functionalities. I read that WinServer supports all the stuff supported on Win10, but isn't bloated with unnecessary software (Cortana, WinStore ...) and I hope some control over the updates. 

So is there a way to tune WinServer 2016 for daily use or is it a madman's idea ? If so, what do I need to know/do ?

And can WinServer give me the stability that I was used to with Win7, or that shipped has sailed ?

PS: Is there any difference between Win10 Pro &amp; Entreprise, especially on how much control will you have over your OS config?

Thank you so much."
8vlsem,8,2018-07-02,I keep worrying that my codependent behaviors have ruined my relationship,redwinemami,Codependency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/8vlsem/i_keep_worrying_that_my_codependent_behaviors/,"I have been with my partner for a little over a year and a half and I love him dearly. We met at a point in my life where I was single for about 3 years prior and I was probably in the best headspace mentally. He, on the other hand, was not. We met at a time where he had gotten out of a relationship months prior, lost his job and had no means of transportation. Because I was much more strong mentally, I was always trying my best to be there for him and accept his situation. I pushed him to go back to school, I was there when he lost his job and helped him find a new one. I was there for him unconditionally. A couple of months into our relationship, I started dealing with some random anxiety. That grew stronger when I smoked weed on two different occasions and had full blown panic attacks. One while I was with a friend, the other I was with my boyfriend. After the second time, I started disassociating for several months. During this time my boyfriend was pretty much my rock. Listening to me and hugging me and giving me the love I needed while I was lost. This began the onset of reassurance seeking. As I began investing more into our relationship and began to grow more attached to him, I noticed I was losing myself in the relationship. Even though he is kind, loving, listens and gives me the support and space I need, I couldn’t help but feel that I was giving more than I was getting back. This had never bothered me completely until it built up overtime. I began to ask him for reassurance, I was noticing very small differences in tone/how he worded his texts/how often he would give me affection and even the lack of the words at times were getting to me more and more. I found myself asking for reassurance and being upset at him when he did nothing to upset me. In the past 4 months, I have been especially growing anxious as I was starting a new internship that I’m currently in right now. While my boyfriend was trying his best to guide me and give me advice and reassure me, I couldn’t help but feel that he was starting to grow tired of this. I started hearing it in the tone of his voice. This made me freak out more and become depressed thinking that my boyfriend now saw me as this “crazy girlfriend”. After having a long talk one time, he told me that he too was struggling with a lot. His mother passed away last December and his father is in his 70s. He also struggles with ADHD and has a lot on his plate. While this gave me insight and made me feel like I needed to seize asking for reassurance and crying out of nowhere to him asking for him, that didn’t last very long. I have broken down or have been insecure many times since then. At one point even accusing him of cheating because I saw an overly friendly comment he left on a girls post. He apologized for it and said he wouldn’t do it again, and I ended up checking his phone. This guilt that I felt doing that has been living with me since then and has thrown me into a massive depression. The other day, he got back from a trip from Colorado with his best friend and mentioned how he wanted to start looking for schools over there. I don’t know why this triggered something in me, but I ended up breaking down to him and telling him that I wanted to take a break. That as a result, sent me into a panic attack where I ended up going to a crisis center. I talked to him most of the time that I was there and got internally upset that he wasn’t begging for me to be with him after I asked him for a break. I WAS THE ONE WHO WANTED THE BREAK I DONT GET WHY IM LIKE THIS. I also kept obsessing before I went to bed last night about a comment he made when I got home later that day. I told him I would need solitude sometimes as that might be able to help me, and he said “oh ok that’s fine, I’ll be busy anyways so we can both be”. That comment has stuck with me, his nonchalant ness to me announcing a break (even though I told him I wanted the break) and him now being tired of my reassurance asking are started to make me feel like this relationship is doomed. Again, bringing up things I should’ve very long ago. I feel like I have completely damaged our relationship. He tells me he’s at the point where he feels like he’s the source of unhappiness. I don’t blame him for feeling like that. I know that I need to move beyond this, I know he said he wants to move beyond this too but I’m so fearful of staying in our relationship thinking that I have done too much damage. Even though I have done a lot for him in the past, I have done so much more damage. I have been selfish in not acknowledging what he also struggles with by himself. I was seeing a counselor that was not helping me with these tendencies and am currently pursuing a new one, which I have an appointment for in 2 days. I want to be able to move past this hurdle in our relationship and go back to being able to regain my confidence. He encourages this so much and pushes me to be better for myself, but I always think of being better for him. I cannot continue to do this. I want to be with him so much, he is one of the greatest partners I have had. When I am not in a headspace of obsessive thinking, he makes me beyond words happy and we are able to click and communicate very well. I keep wanting to st down and talk to him and apologize, but I’m at the point where I have apologized so much I sound like a broken record. I’m so scared I have ruined this with my codependent behaviors. Also a quick note: I have been diagnosed with anxiety/depression/pure O OCD. My therapist is the one who brought up my codependency. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. I met him when I was more confident in myself. A somewhat bad experience sent me into anxiety and made me rely on him a lot for support. I have continued to ask for reassurance at times throughout our relationship. It used to be okay, but now he has grown tired of it. I cant help but feel I have ruined the relationship, this makes me feel like asking for even more reassurance. I keep feeling a break up occurring even though he has assured me that won’t happen. I am seeing a therapist but not as often as I need to, so I’m pursuing a new therapist to deal with this directly. I want to be with my boyfriend and make this work so badly. Please help. I also deal with Pure O OCD/Depression/Anxiety.

Another note: a lot of my friends have moved away. I have made acquaintances here and there, but I have always been a bit socially withdrawn for the years (even before meeting him). "

8vlx98,91,2018-07-02,"Thank you, grandma.",LipidTitties,Wholesomenosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomenosleep/comments/8vlx98/thank_you_grandma/,"Hi, this is my first time posting anything on Reddit, so sorry if the format is wrong or anything. Sorry about the language too as I am not a really good English speaker. I just really wanted to share this moment with all of you, and to find a place to cherish this weird, yet heartwarming experience.

Growing up, I have been living with my family. It is a common thing to do in Hong Kong as we literally don’t have much lands to build apartments. I was living with my grandma, my parents and my brother. I used to be so close to my grandma, and pretty much every time I get into trouble when I was a kid. I go straight to grandma for protection (Chinese’s infamous physical parenting, ouch).

As time progress, the more mature I became, I came to realize that my grandma really does not have that pleasant personality. My grandma is, well, I don’t really know how to describe. Calculated? Annoying? Or maybe just typical Chinese? (Make no mistake, Chinese back then sure were weird as fuck. And no, Barbra, I was not coming for you and your wig. Sit down, I am not trying to induce territory conflict here) She used to brag how she owns a shoe factory back then and how she became a landlord. She also left no secret on how she forces mainland refugees to do her biddings using her landlord/factory lead status. She also revealed some disturbing things she had done in the past, but that is another story for another day.

People get all sorts of sickness when they get old. That is when shit hits the fan. My grandma grew paranoid, had delusions that we are all plotting against her, blah blah blah, and is diagnosed with Alzheimer. We would argue all day try to convince her that we are not the enemy, we are the family and all the things we do are for her best interests (She literally thought the pills to suppress her delusions are the pills to end her life). She demanded us to send her to a nursing home and kept saying the local senator (-ish, and by the way she never actually met him) person can help set her up. As family, we surely did not like the decision and tried to convince her that staying with us, so she can get better care (We Chinese people do not trust nursing homes, and back at that time, there were some scandals on how nursing home employees mistreat the elderly residents by physical abusing or forcing them to eat their own feces.)

At the end of the day, after discussions after discussions, we agreed to follow her will and send her to a nursing home. We followed the standard procedure, contacted social welfare department and things like that. She did get sent to an elderly house of our choice (Good living condition, clean background checks, plenty of activities for the elderly residents, and genuine caring employees).

Then things settled, I moved to university dormitory and lived for a brief 2 years and have to move back since I have to start my internship. The number we visit my grandma became fewer and fewer, from once a week to whenever we feel like it. We make sure she is in good care thou, we constantly check on her status, and buy clothes / anything she desires to the nursing home for her.

And here comes this absurd night. 3:50 AM, as I am typing. About an hour ago, I had a super weird dream. In the dream I was with my grandma, sitting at a restaurant which no longer exist in present days, having some kind of meal together with her. The dream was silent, at least as that’s how I felt. She was sitting beside me, I cannot remember how she looked in the dream. She stood up and left some money on the table, and then, she slowly walked away. For that moment, I felt like the good old grandma who would take good care of me when I was a child, the one who genuinely loved me was there, saying goodbye, like she’s just here to take one final look of her grandson. The moment the dream ended, I literally jumped out of bed, sprinted right to my parent’s bedroom and cried like a fucking pig. (FYI, my parents studied Chinese feng shui and had related experience in exorcism and the spiritual realm. I once have a “classmate” who bullied me that turns out to be a ghost attached to me when I was 5 years old. Again, another story.) They comforted me by saying it’s just a bad dream, and even if she did pass away (God forbid.) she’s already 101 years old, that is totally normal.

I must say I am not a superstitious person as I study Computer Science (yeah, the satire), I trust science more than the whole Chinese feng shui stuff, but I must be completely honest, I haven’t thought of my grandma for about few months now thanks to my internship and final year project. And another reason that we are starting to reduce our number of visit is because her Alzheimer is getting worse, she can no longer tell which is which, albeit no longer having unpleasant delusions. This is why this dream meant so much to me and why I decided it belongs to this subredddit, I felt like her original self is back, trying to bid me one final farewell. She always tries to stuff money to me and my brother despite we are now university students and have decent incomes from our grad job / internship.

I decided to go to the nursing home this Sunday to go check on her. And I think, if the remaining part of her original soul (Chinese feng shui considers that, people with Alzheimer, their intact soul will slowly die out and go to the afterlife earlier than their vessels), the loving grandma I once rely on did pay me a final visit, I wanted to tell her that I am all grown up now, and there is no need to look back anymore.

Oh, by the way, thanks for the meal, grandma.

Have any of you had any burnout?  Feeling like your manifestations are, in some ways, hard work?  Not to say that I am holding onto them and expecting them to be different, but boy, I am getting pretty exhausted having to consistently bring myself up.  I manifest, I let go, and it's that lately, I'm still attracting bad luck.  It's quite frustrating!  Today I just feel too burnt out to try to find a way to make myself feel better.  I am writing in my gratitude journal to knock me out of the malaise, but today it's not working so great.

My vent, to get it off my chest:

I found out that my internship will be terminating nearly a month earlier than I initially planned for.  I had a suspicion this was coming.  No matter how hard I worked on the projects my boss gave me, I consistently saw him set ridiculously high expectations - and fall it on me that I didn't deliver.  I at first thought maybe I was a bad developer, but once I saw other interns projects, I recognize I'm doing mid-level developer work and he's misappropriating the amount of scope, unknowns, and work.  I have communicated this to him but he seems to be evasive, and figure his esoteric hinting somehow makes it easier for me to ""figure it out what he wants"".

I worked very hard at this job even with his constant changing of what he wanted.  I made three prototypes, which took me a month, only to follow the next request and he changed his mind again!  Then I rewrote the change request I had, and started to minorly rewrite the other one I wrote last month (prototype four!).  During this frustration, I wrote in my gratitude journal that I did a great job at my job.  I wrote that I tried very hard to achieve as high as people expected me to achieve: if people think you are capable of such things, why not try?  Unfortunately, it seems that no matter what I did, how much positive vibes, or how much I worked, it did not work out.

I'm not too thrilled, of course.  It's a little bit of a downer to think that coming home I don't have a tub of ice cream waiting for me: I have mountains of coursework to attend to, and I'm trying to lose weight so splurging isn't going to help things.  Also doesn't help in about two weeks I am going to be out of money again.

What do you do to find ways to promote self love?  If you lack friendships, time, and even the luck (hahah), how do you manage to make yourself still peaceful while sailing the storm?

Thanks, and hope you're having a great day.

Of course, the President of the United States does not necessarily require the use of a written notice to authorize the use of nuclear weapons. Instead, the President turns to the ""[nuclear football](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/real-story-football-follows-president-everywhere-180952779/),"" a suitcase holding a menu detailing the options for carrying out a nuclear strike, documents outlying the procedures for the Emergency Alert System, and the nuclear authentications codes. With the authentication codes, known as a ""[biscuit](https://allthingsnuclear.org/dwright/trump-and-the-nuclear-codes-how-to-launch-a-nuclear-weapon)"" in some circles, the President will verify his identity with the [National Military Command Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Military_Command_Center), which will then send an ""[Emergency Action Message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Action_Message),"" detailing the actual launch orders for the United States military. From there, either by land, air, or sea, nothing stands between the enemies of the United States and its wrath.

&amp;nbsp;

Rather, this proposal is being written out by White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller, who, after hurriedly texting Vice President Mike Pence, would be using Trump's lack of understanding for governmental procedure to stall out that furious President. But this maneuver will only work for so long. God have mercy on us all.

Vice President Pence finds himself facing off against the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, the President pro tempore of the Senate Patrick Leahy, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. It sets the odd picture, following the Democrat's seizure of the Senate and House, leaders of America's left threatened to shut down the government following the revelation of President Trump's impropriety in the 2020 Election. Even now, Pelosi and Schumer appear irritated at having been summoned so urgently, though Leahy seems more relaxed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I find it hard to believe what you're saying is true. First, you open up with the note from the White House Physician, and now you're throwing out some fringe nuclear strike rumor? Even then, isn't it your job to deter off the worse impulses of the President. What are you doing here?

&gt;*Madame Speaker, I understand your perspective. But, from my judgement as Vice President, I didn't see a feasible way to-*

&gt;Look at the conouct of Republicans for the last twelve years! Breaking legislative traditions everywhere. Just yesterday, I was speaking with McConnell, and he seems more than happy to stonewall Democratic legislation like he did under Obama. How is this not just an attempt by the Republicans to twist the Constitution to fit their own interests again?
***
&gt;Maybe I can help with that, Mr. Schumer.

&amp;nbsp;

Pence's unexpected guest returns into the room, leaving a hand over the mouth of her phone before speaking.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I just got off the phone with Mitch, and he understands the seriousness of the situation. For the benefit of the Republic, he will agree to be more cooperative with Democratic legislative efforts in the future. Otherwise, he'll make sure the whole country understands that it was the Democrats who blocked off this country's first attempt at containing the unchecked powers of the executive.

&amp;nbsp;

Schumer blinks for a second, surprised by the presence of Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, and wife to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Finally, Schumer grumpily pushes in the bridge of his glasses.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Unless if Pelosi - or Leahy, have any objections, I think its best for the American people if we let this go. The notice of [dementia](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-mental-health-michael-wolff-learning-disabilities-dementia-adhd-read-semi-literate-fire-a8146176.html) from the White House physician seems to be enough of a basis, at least. Consider this to be tentative support, however. This won't fix the wounds that the President has dealt to the political discourse in this country for the last eight years.

&gt;Where is he! He needs to be here now, right now!

&amp;nbsp;

Secretary Mattis rapidly paces back and forth in front of the entrance to the Oval Office. The documents he had previously carried, now transferred over to Vice President Pence, left his hands empty to be anxiously wrought about. Moments later, an intern hurriedly rushes down to the stressed Secretary.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Secretary Mattis, I'm from the Hill. Discussions took longer, the Vice President is on his way, but he'll need time to get here.

&amp;nbsp;

Mattis issues a short remark that is ill-befitting of his position.

&gt;God help me in what we are about to face.

&amp;nbsp;

After issuing a short text over his mobile phone, Mattis enters.

&amp;nbsp;

##15:14, November 25^th, 2023

&amp;nbsp;

President Trump sits at the Resolute Desk, once again surrounded by a crowd of advisers, secretaries, directors, and bureaucrats that make up the government that he has sworn to lead. Each one seems to be presenting a different argument why a nuclear response is inappropriate, and each argument seems to only make President Trump grow angrier and angrier.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Look, I wrote down the orders for the Air Force right here! This is happening, someone go send this down!**
***
&gt;Mr. President, as your National Security Adviser, I don't believe that it is current protocol for a written notice to be submitted to the Secretary of the Air Force for a nuclear launch. Rather, you issue the launch codes through the nuclear football, which is right over... there, with Officer Edwards in the back.
***
&gt;**Well, walrus face, looks like you did your job. Good for you, not so much anyone else here. Miller, did you know about this?**

&amp;nbsp;

To shocked silence, John Bolton [quietly grins](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/03/john-bolton-north-korea/556370/) at the assembled crowd. Finally, a nervous Miller breaks the silence.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Mr. President, with all due respect, I have informed you as-
***
&gt;**Get you and your forehead out of here. [You are fired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75SEy1qu71).**

&amp;nbsp;

Former Senior Adviser to the President Stephen Miller flinches. It takes the presence of an approaching secret service agent for some color to return to his face, as Miller allows himself to be escorted out of the Oval Office.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Alright, who's next?**

&amp;nbsp;

Dead silence. President Trump, with a smug grin plastered on his face, orders Officer Edwards to approach the Resolute Desk with the football. After a short conversation with the National Military Command Center, the order is issued. And not followed.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Now, Mattis, from what I'm hearing, these officers are resigning from their posts?**
***
&gt;Yes Donald. It appears that the [military is unable to comply with an illegal order](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-north-korea-crisis-nuclear-weapons-us-military-duty-refuse-illegal-instructions-war-a8055991.html), and so are unable to follow through with the launch.
***
&gt;**So, you're directing them to resign instead?**
***
&gt;Donald, this is serious. These are human lives, the lives of people at stake here. These people know, we all know that you can't just throw around these weapons as if they're nothing-
***
&gt;**Mattis, I love you, but you've got to go. Is the military going to work with me on this?**
***
&gt;I would rather resign than work with a President who would issue such an order.
***
&gt;**Well then. [Consider yourself fired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75SEy1qu71). Who's next?**
***
&gt;*No one, Donald. No one is getting fired.*

&amp;nbsp;

Vice President Mike Pence walks into the room, with Director of the CIA Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao close behind. Pence's hand tightly clutches a written document, containing two separate signatures upon it.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Pence, late as always. The military is leading a coup against-**
***
&gt;*Donald. Mr. Pompeo, Mrs. Chao and I have just spoken with McConnell and McCarthy. Under the power invested me by the 25^th Amendment, you are relieved of office.*
***
&gt;**What?! You can't do that!**

&amp;nbsp;

Donald Trump suddenly stands up from the Resolute Desk, eyes wide, his hands shaking. Two secret service agents hesitantly approach, appearing uncertain at this announcement from the former Vice President.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*Gentlemen, I have with me a signed affidavit from the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House acknowledging that Section 4 of the 25^th Amendment has been invoked. Secretary Mattis has informed the National Military Command Center of the development, and the Chief Justice is on his way at this moment to complete the ceremony. Please escort Mr. Trump out of the White House.*

&amp;nbsp;

With the brandishing of the document, the agents appear satisfied. A raging Trump is dragged out of his chair, and firmly led out of the building.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Should someone go get Miller as well?
***
&gt;*Don't bother. He won't be staying regardless.*

&amp;nbsp;

A small chorus of chuckles, before Chief Justice John Roberts enters the room. With right hand over the Bible, and left hand raised in the air, President Pence delivers his oath of office. And like that, the coup is complete."
8vn8so,234,2018-07-02,"Disappointing, biased and expected finale",pravekpatel97,ShaneDawson,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShaneDawson/comments/8vn8so/disappointing_biased_and_expected_finale/,"Part 1 &amp; Part 2 were so great Shane. You reeled us in by playing devil's advocate and listening to both sides of the story and that's great. But that's where the good ends for me, and I'll try to explain why as well as I can. Sadly, the majority of your audience will have eaten up this bullshit just like you ate up Tana's. There are so many holes in her story and she's gotten away with it again.

Part 3 was outrageous. On YOUR part Shane. It was an extremely biased portrayal. Facilitating unprofessional ""interview"" over FaceTime that came across as an onslaught on Michael. You barely jumped in to mediate whilst Tana was spouting claims left right and centre without concrete evidence... or at least it wasn't shown. Post-interview, there was extra input from Tana but NOT Michael... or at least it wasn't shown. Tana commentating over selected footage showing her best sides whilst you eat it up ridiculously. Like ""We've got to make this work"" when talking about 5000 people in the parking lot... I'm sorry, what the flying fuck is wrong with saying that? Like actually think about it and then look at your reaction Shane. It just enables Tana as she continues with her ""See, look I cared because I asked about the lighting!"". Her ""See look at this clip that works in my favour"" attitude AFTER accepting culpability does not add up. She never meant any of that. She just said it because the camera was running because she's used to this manipulation of an audience.

Michael is the CEO organiser of the event. It was a failure, so he is HIGHLY CULPABLE. This should go without saying. The Marriot contract ""1000 capacity"" was a massive red flag. The refund contingency was naive. There is so much more that he did wrong and there's no real excuse for him. BUT Tana is HIGHLY CULPABLE too. 
Down the street from Vidcon on the same dates? Great idea! 
2 months organisation time with a Hawaii holiday before? Okay, mate. 
Fake-holding yourself accountable then playing the victim and acknowledging that the ""real problem is how to fix this"" after attacking Michael continuously? Seems legit.
Actually wanting people to wait outside? Lovely.

The difference between the two personalities here tells you enough. Tana primary intention behind the convention was not ""free fan meet-up"" but was actually rooted in a ""Fuck You"" to VidCon: childish spite that sums her up as a person.
Tana will cry on camera and accept responsibility when she's alone on the couch with Shane, but attack Michael with legitimately random comments that she makes up as she goes, like ""the interns are afraid of him,"" or ""20 people will back me up about scamming"" or ""I was warned about him so many times"" then breaking down into tears yet again for pity.
Meanwhile, Michael sits there unable to respond to the 10 questions with no answer opportunity but maintains a professional attitude. He doesn't say a single bad word about her. That tells a story. 
She is a compulsive liar feigning ignorance to situations that she surely knew about and improvising side-stories to paint him as a villain. It is inherent in her behaviour. She constantly states I wanted this I wanted that and you said you would do it"". Grow up and take some responsibility yourself Tana. It's your convention. You didn't care as soon as the tickets were sold. That was job done for you, time to go to Hawaii the day before. WOOP.

Tana about Michael potentially losing his house: ""When everyone's attacking you like that he might want... p- pity I dunno how to say this Shane""... NICE PROJECTION THERE! Definitely not what you're doing at all Tana!

She displays all the characteristics of a spoilt child who can't accept accountability for her actions. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING IF YOUR ACTIONS AFTERWARDS SAY OTHERWISE. Acting sorry for the camera then shifting all the blame? Oh but it's okay because just before she shifted the blame, she said ""I'm not trying to shift the blame"" (paraphrased). Shane this goes for you too. Acknowledging that Michael isn't there to defend himself DOESN'T MEAN ITS OKAY FOR YOU TO ENABLE AN NARRATIVE AGAINST HIM. Its a facade of a portrayal of yourself as this White Knight mediator, when really you're very skewed. 

This finale was so so biased, Shane. Where is Michael's footage? You should have waited until it was sent to be truly unbiased. The sad thing is that I think you planned that from the beginning, since you are obviously closer with Tana than Michael. The devil's advocate you played on his side was to set him up for an even bigger fall. Because even if you hadn't finished editing this video before today, you were always going to show him in the worst light.

Very very disappointed with the editing of the final episode Shane, because the other two were so good.
You've taken 3 episodes to portray a villain that you wanted to paint from the beginning. The REAL conclusion is that they are both equally to blame but for different reasons. 
Michael because he couldn't handle the project and was naive with execution. None of the scamming, scary bullshit. 
But TANA because of... her. Inherently. Her personality: childish, irresponsible, spoilt, dishonest, manipulative and bitter. She's lied in the past, played the victim and gotten away with it before, and you've allowed her to do it again."
8vnfdx,1,2018-07-02,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8vnfdx/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
  
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "

The CEO will send me job descriptions with the title of the role, location, required skills, salary, all the things you would expect. But now he has started to include ""Alternative Titles"".

For example, he will send me a description for a CTO but the alternative title is ""Senior Developer"". Another is a Junior (almost internship level) Social Media job but the alternative title is ""Social Media Manager"". 

I asked him about it since the real and ""alternative"" titles don't match up at all. He said to tell the candidates the role by it's alternative name is order to ""get the right kind of candidates."" He thinks if we list a CTO job the only people who will apply are ""Self important egomaniacs"" and if we list a job with Junior in the title we'll get nothing but ""high school dropouts"". He says he would then reveal the ""real title"" of the role once they are in interviews.

I've explained to him that while I understand his concerns all he's going to get are the exact WRONG people for the role. He says I don't understand ""how people's minds work"" and that as a CEO he ""knows about these kind of things"".  

He now checks with the candidates I send him that I'm telling them the ""right title"". I'm so close to just giving up on him entirely. It's hard enough to keep the details of all my clients and jobs and candidates straight without having to run them through my decoder ring!

8vnrlv,1,2018-07-02,M4F - Mother/teenaged daughter bonding! But with her adult son...,Hola2346,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8vnrlv/m4f_motherteenaged_daughter_bonding_but_with_her/,"It hasn’t been easy for you, being a single mother.

You  were the shining example of an attractive, successful co-ed in college.  The girl who balanced school, a social life, and all the other millions  of things you got involved in. The college student who wasn’t against a  fun night out for drinks or at the club every once in a while, but also  studious and dedicated to her studies and future first and foremost.  The lady who loved the proactive crop tops and skintight leggings, but  looked stunning in a professional suit or simple blouse and business  casual skirt.

That all changed junior  year...you were usually so careful, but one night out with your friends,  a few too many drinks, so many guys, and...well.

Boom. Babytown. Population: you.

You  knew this would possibly end your career expectations, but against the  advice of most friends and family, you decided to keep it. You managed  to finish your semester, just barely, before having to take time off.  And when you were secure enough to go back to school, it was mostly  night and online classes. Still, you didn’t regret the decision for a  moment. You gave birth to a beautiful, healthy boy, as sweet, smart, and  kind as you.

And against all odds, your  career didn’t turn purely into “single mom.” It took several years  longer than most, but you finished your degree, chipping away at it  credit by credit. A degree let you fit in an underpaid internship  amongst the several minimum wage jobs that barely kept you and your boy  afloat. An internship that soon turned into a solid position with  benefits, letting you trade in the waitressing and hotel desk jobs for a  real career. Which led to an MBA...before you knew it, you were head of  HR at a fairly large company while in your 30s. You were as well-off if  not better than most of your peers.

Yet...you  always sighed at what you missed out on. You said you wouldn’t trade  having a kid for the world - which was true. But those long days and  nights of constant work, little sleep, trying to balance everything...it  was stressful. Your friends all drifted off with their own lives, you  barely a ghost not included in any yearbooks or reunions. Dating was a  non-starter - even with your well-paying position, age and a child were  hurdles in today’s dating culture. You just wished you could let your  hair back again and relax...

Your chance  seemed to come. You received an award at work, giving you a nice bonus  and a two-week vacation at a spa resort for two. You were thrilled at  the time off...except for the “for two” part. You  couldn’t find any  guys interested - even practically advertising it on dating sites did  little but draw a few spambots and get your account temporarily  suspended. You disappointedly considered selling them and just taking a  starvation...until you looked at the tickets more closely...

“Valid for couple’s spa vacation package or ‘mother/daughter bonding’ package.”

That  gave you hope...your son, now in his 20z and with the summer off  between semesters. Perhaps you could...”condition” him. Just for two  weeks! You knew a few “programs” that could help. Perhaps knock him back  to his teen or even preteen years, just...as a girl. He wouldn’t even  realize if it was done right. And you read how it is important to be in  touch with your feminine side even as a guy. You’ve given him the world  his whole life...he can temporarily give you a daughter, right? It would  be a great bonding opportunity...not to mention, an opportunity for you  to explore some “feminine urges” you always wished you could have  experienced with your girlfriends back in college... ———————————— If you  read this far, thanks for your interest! The prompt will involve the  mother (you) conditioning her son (me) into being her daughter for a  special lengthy spa retreat vacation. I’d expect gentle femdom, femdom,  feminization, brainwashing, pegging, and more to be involved. Hard  limits include gore, extreme pain/violence, and death. If you have any  other favorite kinks, just ask!

Shoot me a  message if you’re interested with a description and/or pic of your  character and any additions/changes you’d like to make!"

""Well, *this* certainly sounds promising,"" you say, holding the four-inch steel needle by its heavy, round chrome head.


Abigail, your young assistant, nods and goes back to reading off a list of effects, ""liquefaction of brain tissues resulting in irreversible IQ drop, extreme pain and swelling, but also profound increase in sexual response, including olfactory and oral fixations. It says here that in lab rats, when the serum reaches the bloodstream it travels to the brain and breaks down the tissue into a kind of liquid aphrodisiac.""


While the laboratory where you both work spends a good amount of its resources on frivolities like hair products and erectile dysfunction remedies, you're bankrolled by some very rich and morally repugnant gentlemen from Saudi Arabia, who are always on the lookout for more *fringe* scientific discoveries.


""Well,"" you say, looking at the sterile plastic box containing a hundred of these wicked, serum-laced steel needles, ""I guess we'd better test these, don't you think?""


Abigail gulps and backs away. You roll your eyes.


""Not on *you*, Abigail, I need to keep you around. Besides,"" you gesture to Abigail's respectable but modest C-cups, ""we need a test subject with more *real estate*.""


As if on cue, I wander past the laboratory, just another Summer intern, running errands between labs. *Unlike* the other Summer interns, though, I'm gifted with the kind of body that women pay tens of thousands of dollars for: slender, with a tight and thick round butt, and a pair of almost comic-book-proportioned breasts. Barely five feet in height, my stature only amplifies the obscenity or my other qualities.


""You!"" You shout as I pass.


I meekly turn back to the door, leaning in. ""Who, me?""


""Yes, you. Come in. What's your name?"" You ask, as you set down the long silver needle and pick up a pistol-grip hypodermic.


""Uh, Denise?"" I say, as Abigail locks the door behind me.


""Denise, we need your help for a few minutes. Here, we have to conduct a quick experiment. Abigail, turn on the cameras, please."" You approach me, pushing my hair away from my neck.


""What kind of experiment?"" I ask.


""Well, I'm just going to place this microchip behind your ear,"" with a sting and a clicking sound, you inject me with the hypodermic, implanting the tiny chip just under the skin. A large monitor stutters and flashes with ""IQ - 109.""


""There, you see? This chip will keep a running tally of your IQ,"" you smile, handing the hypodermic to Abigail, who has already turned on the room's cameras, and who carries a digital camera in her one hand. Images of the room and its occupants flash onto the rest of the monitors set up around the lab.


""Oh..."" I say, ""Well, why do you need to see *that*?"" I ask, cocking my head to the side and looking at the monitors while you retrieve a handful of the long, serum-tainted chrome needles.


""Oh, you'll see, Denise."" You smile a perversely sadistic grin."

8vpunj,30,2018-07-03,2018 domestic Studio Box Office Share — June,ItsBobDoleYo,boxoffice,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/8vpunj/2018_domestic_studio_box_office_share_june/,"[**Incredibles 2 leads Disney to 5th consecutive month of share growth**](https://imgur.com/a/5ybypOH)

The domestic box office hit $6 billion at the fastest pace this past week, over a third of which came from **Disney** which raised its share of the 2018 box office to 36.3% (up two percentage points) from $2.24B. In fact, the $556M the studio earned in June is its largest monthly amount so far this year, ahead of the $482M [it made in May](https://i.imgur.com/Jdi4oc7.png) and in all likelihood will stay that way as its biggest movies have all been released: *Ant-Man* is no *Avengers* while December only has seven days of *Mary Poppins Returns* and November will leech away a week of *Wreck-It Ralph 2*. Not surprisingly, the bulk (over three-quarters) of Disney's June gross came from *The Incredibles 2*'s $426M while *Solo: A Star Wars Story* kicked in $87M and *Avengers: Infinity War* $40M. With a hefty reshoot-inflated budget of ~$275M, *Solo* will be Disney's fourth consecutive Memorial weekend underperformer following *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales*; *Alice Through the Looking Glass*; and *Tomorrowland*. Despite unprofitability, it will be Disney's second-best Memorial weekend movie behind 2007's *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*, has the seventh-best Memorial weekend opening, and *may* overtake *Mission: Impossible II*'s $215M gross to enter the top 10 grossing movies that opened over the holiday weekend (not accounting for inflation). 

Finally, with a good idea of where *Infinity War*, *Incredibles 2*, and *Jurassic World 2* will end up, it is likely the February 16th release *Black Panther* will be the calendar year's highest-grossing movie. Excepting prior-year holdovers (e.g. *Avatar*, *Titanic*), this will be the earliest a year's #1 movie has been released since 1974's *Blazing Saddles* (February 7). Looking at the past thirty-eight years, the bulk of highest-grossing movies of the calendar year come from May (12), June (12), or July (8) with no other month producing more than two year-leading movies in that time frame.

**FOX** remained in second place but lost two points, down to 13.5% share. While it is the closest non-Disney studio to hitting $1B, as mentioned in [last month's post](https://old.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/8ofmob/2018_domestic_studio_box_office_share_may/), as it doesn't have a major movie until September's *The Predator*, it will continue to lose steam through the rest of summer and will likely be lapped by Universal and possibly WB as *Deadpool 2*'s tail is FOX's only movie making money at the box office.

Speaking of lapping, **Universal** did just that, jumping two percentage points (biggest jump of the month) to 12% almost entirely thanks to *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom*'s $246M. After the four-quad success of *Fallen Kingdom*, the studio then goes after individual quadrants in July with *The First Purge*, *Skyscraper*, and *Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again*.

**WB** crept up half a point to 11.4% with $700M for the year. Its pair of June comedies—*Ocean's 8* and *Tag*—are showing legs to kick in a combined $152M. If it continues having sub-50% weekend drops, it's not impossible for *Ocean* to top *Ready Player One* which it's currently pacing 7% behind. *Player One* fell a steep 65% in its fifth weekend against *Infinity Wars*'s opening; incidentally, *Ocean*'s upcoming fifth weekend lands during the opening weekend of another MCU movie and if it can hold its own against it and the other two blockbusters, it could narrow the gap between it and *Player One*.

Releases from this past weekend made up a chunk of the month's grosses for **Sony** (staying in fifth at 7.5%) and **Lionsgate** (stuck at seventh with 3.2%). Lionsgate lost half a point with only *Uncle Drew*'s $11M and *Overboard*'s $7M. With a sub-$200M total, this is the worst start to a year since 2011 for the mini-major that had elbowed its way past some major studios in recent years. While the YTD gross beats the YTD gross of years prior to 2008 in the earlier days of the studio, after 2008, only one year (2011) has had a lower grossing January-June as past years have been bolstered by *La La Land*, the *Divergent* series, *Now You See Me*, even the tail-end of a *Hunger Games* movie was good for $20M. Save a breakout for *Robin Hood* (November) or a *Bad Moms*-like run for *The Spy Who Dumped Me* (August), this could well be an off-year for the studio. With the *Hellboy* reboot, a Tyler Perry movie, and *John Wick: Chapter 3*, the first half of 2019 looks to get thing back on track for Lionsgate. A quiet June led to Sony losing a point as *Superfly* made $18M and *Sicario: Day of the Soldado* brought in $14M. July looks to be a more competitive one for the studio as it releases the kid sequel *Hotel Transylvania 3* and action sequel *The Equalizer 2*.

**Paramount** lost a bit more than half a point as it stayed in sixth with 5.6% share. Its April release *A Quiet Place* ($5.4M) and May release *Book Club* ($25M) each made more than June 1 release *Action Point* ($5M). In fact, *Action* was dropped from every single theater in which it was playing in two weeks. 2032 theaters for fourteen days, then nothing. The only other wide release movie that exited theaters as quickly this year was Focus Features's  tepidly-received historical drama *7 Days in Entebbe*. And at 838 theaters, it barely qualifies as a wide release (if even). Even *Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero* from Fun Academy stayed in theaters for a surprisingly long 53 days despite opening at half of *Action Point*'s weekend from 1633 theaters. STX's *Gringo* stayed in theaters for four weeks with a $2.7M opening (2404 theaters). Bleecker Street's *Unsane* managed three weeks off a $3.8M opening (2023) as did *Bad Samaritan* off a $1.7m opening in 2007 theaters from Electric Entertainment. These are all much smaller, indie (or new) studios that don't have nearly as much history (or contracts/business agreements) with theater owners as a major like Paramount might. Comparable freefalls from 2017 include Open Road's action non-starter *Collide* which opened to $1.5M in 2045, lost half its theaters in its second weekend, and lasted 14 days; FOX's horror-mystery *A Cure for Wellness* started with $4.3M in 2704 theaters, lost 2616 theaters two weekend later, and lasted 21 days; and Paramount's own *Suburbicon* premiered to $2.8M in 2046 theaters and lasted 21 days.

On the other end of the spectrum, at $66M *Book Club* has a 4.86x multiplier off its $13.6M opening; though its legginess is not unexpected of a movie catering to the 50-and-over crowd, its nearly 5x multiplier is one of the better ones for recent geriatric movies. 

Movie | OW | Final Dom | Multiplier
:- | :- | :- | :-:
Calendar Girls* | $4.4M | $31M | 6.8x
The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel* | $6.4M | $46M | 5.67x
Woman in Gold*^ | $5.5M | $33.3M | 5.44x
It's Complicated | $22.1M | $112.7M | 5.09x
The Hundred-Foot Journey^ | $10.9M | $54.2M | 4.97x
**Book Club** | **$13.6M** | **$66M** | **4.86x**
The Bucket List* | $19.4M | $93.5M | 4.7x
Last Vegas | $16.3M | $63.9M | 3.92x
Hope Springs | $14.7M | $63.5M | 4.3x
The Intern^ | $17.7M | $75.8M | 4.28x
The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel | $8.5M | $33M | 3.88x
Going in Style | $12M | $45M | 3.78x
A Walk in the Woods | $8.3M | $29.5M | 3.55x
Just Getting Started | $3.2M | $6.1M | 1.88x

*Initially opened in limited release. Multiplier calculated by (final - gross during limited release) / Wide OW gross

^ May/may not conform with the typical geriatric flick of an ensemble of older stars, instead pairs/surrounds an older actor (Helen Mirren, Robert DeNiro) with a younger one(s) (Ryan Reynolds, Anne Hathaway)

By total gross, *Book Club* falls short of only *The Intern*, *The Bucket List*, and *It's Complicated*, and the latter two were released during the end-of-year holidays where legs are typically stronger. While *Just Getting Started* was also released during the holidays, as it was the last theatrical release by Broad Green Pictures months after the studio announced it was ceasing film production, the movie was essentially dumped. One other notable ""geriatric flick"" is *Quartet*, which grossed $18.4M in early 2013 despite never making more than $1.78M any given weekend and never playing in more than 725 theaters.

One last note on *Book Club*, it has out-grossed *Tomb Raider* despite *Raider* opening 73% higher; *Maze Runner: Death Cure* (77% higher OW); *Pacific Rim: Uprising* (106% higher OW); and has a chance at surpassing  *Insidious: The Last Key* (118% higher OW).

**A24**'s *Hereditary* is showing far better legs (3x so far) than most would've expected from the indie studio purveyor of artsy horror flicks that routinely score highly with critics but lowly with general audiences. Its $39M gross pushes it past **MGM**'s *Death Wish* ($34M) to be the fourth highest-grossing non-major studio release of the year behind **Roadside Attractions**'s *I Can Only Imagine* ($83M) and a pair of **STX** films, *I Feel Pretty* ($49M) and *Den of Thieves* ($45M).

Finally, it should come as no surprise that Disney entries litter the [top daily grosses for the first half of the year](https://i.imgur.com/mJOAJpX.png), making up eight of the top ten daily grosses and thirty-two of the top forty. The third day of *Infinity War* grossed more than the first day of *Fallen Kingdom*, *Deadpool 2*, and, well, every movie so far this year not released by Disney. Though it's just outside the cut-off for the chart, the first day of *Quiet Place* slots below its second day.

1. (—) Disney // 36.3% // $2.2B

2. (—) FOX // 13.5% // $834M

3. (↑) Universal // 12.0% // $744M

4. (↓) WB // 11.4% // $703M

5. (—) Sony // 7.5% // $463M

7. (—) Lionsgate // 3.21% // $199M

*Box office figures as of June 30 unless otherwise noted

*While Rupert Murdoch and Bob Iger reached an agreement on Disney acquiring much of 21st Century Fox (including its film assets) and the DOJ gave approval (requiring divestitures of regional sports networks), the acquisition still needs approval from other government bodies and shareholders while Comcast is also bidding for 21st Century FOX/up the price. As such, Fox &amp; Disney continue operating as separate studios as reflected here

I used to think of myself as an outgoing guy, always looking for adventure, but lately I feel like I've lost that about myself.

Let me preface by saying that in high school I had an... interesting time. I started off high school with high expectations. I was looking forward to party's, drugs, sex, romance, and everything thing else I was made to think high school was about. All that really came true of the preciously stated was drugs.  I tried to surround myself with who I thought had similar interests, but it turned dark quick. For times sake lets just say I learned a great deal in those years about life in general.

Anyways, I cut everyone off for my own mental healths sake and I kind of kept to myself for my senior year of high school. Having a girlfriend (who i recently broke up with) helped during this time to keep me socially alive, but not having a core group of friends limited my experiences. High school made me a very different person than who I was when I started. Im no longer as energetic, happy, I barely talk anymore. Im more awkward, less outgoing, but on the bright side I am definitely smarter. I fear I just lost who I was.

Now that Im in college, being home for the summer is very lonely. I hang out with people occasionally, but I really don't like the culture in my area. It does not suit me well at all.

Since I cut people off, Ive really just been focusing  on finding myself and my passions in life. I got a radio shift at my college radio station, Ive made tons of connections, and I even started a home studio where I book clients to record their music which led me to an internship at a professional studio. 

What Im hoping is that my great years will come as a result of my work. It just pains me seeing everyone seemingly at their peak while I'm sitting at home with few people to talk to. And when I do go out, I feel even more lonely. Should I make an effort to find a scene and experience shit? Or should I keep doing what Im doing and let the scene find me? 


tl;dr - highschool took the soul out of me, made me less social, but I still crave social interaction. Now that im home from college im bored and lonely, but productive in other beneficial ways. I fear im missing out on my golden years. What do I do?

8vrd7p,80,2018-07-03,Ex-parent-pleaser trying to cope with guilt plus constant gas lighting makes me feel I'm the crazy one.,Clickdummy,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/8vrd7p/exparentpleaser_trying_to_cope_with_guilt_plus/,"**\[WARNING very long post ; TW Anxiety, Suicidal thoughts\]**

Hi everyone, I wanted to share my story to get reinsurance on how my situation is and that I'm reading it properly.  It's been going on for 4 years and it is seriously starting weigh on me. I've been browsing this sub and found people also struggling the same way I am. Trying to cope with guilt and toxic families and I am looking for support too. It is a bit long, I am trying to make it as readable as possible.

I am a French woman in her end 20s. My parents being (highly educated, with PHDs and so) immigrants had extremely high expectations for us personally, academically and professionally. I was always the perfect daughter/student. Being the oldest child I was also trying to be a role model for the younger ones and was very early helping my parents.  We were a very tight knot family. My mother was my best friend and I was the kind of big sister who would take her younger siblings with her to parties or to hang out and so.

This whole thing started when I was outed by a person I do not even know to my mother a few months after starting dating my girlfriend. It was 4 years ago. I was 23 at the time and living 500 km away from my family for university.I knew my family wouldn't be so gay friendly so I was waiting for finishing my studies and being financially independent to come out. This kinda messed everything up.

My mother waited until I visited to ambush me.She started crying, she hit me and insulted me. She said that ""**death she could accept but not this""** and that **"" this was harder than when her own sister died""** . She kept going on and on like this. Saying it is not what she planned for her children. That I destroyed her.

I was terrified my dad would hear, I tried to lay low.

My father was always scary for me. He is an abusive man with his children *(not with my mom).* For him, terror means authority and a child disagreeing with him means disrespect. He would insult and threaten and sometimes hit you to submission. It's messed up.Growing up, my mother was always the buffer between him and me. She would support us *(my sister, my brother and I)*. This time she wasn't in my side and I felt really lost.

At that time I was only 6 months away from finishing my master's degree. I only had to do an internship and my thesis. I was supposed to fly to Germany for interviews, my mother linked it with the fact that my girlfriend was German, threatened to tell my father if I didn't cancel *(while this was unrelated, sure she helped me with my papers but nothing else).*So I cancelled and had to stay longer at my parents', being locked there. I wasn't allowed to go anywhere without any of my siblings with me **(as they agreed with my mother and found me selfish for making her suffer like that)**, couldn't use my phone and my mother was coming every 2 hours in my room to guilt me and repeat how I destroyed her and that I am only gay because no man had ever wanted me because I'm ugly *(I’m not...just sayin’)* etc. ...

I managed to leave to get back to university as exams were coming. My mother set an *ultimatum*: **by the end of my studies I would have to choose between being gay and being part of the family.**The day I finally got back to my place, my mother calls me and asked me what I chose (*so much for end of my studies*). And for the first time in my life, I didn’t act like a **parent-pleaser** and stood up for myself. **I said I did not want to break up**.

My mother was furious and said that she would tell my father immediately and he will probably just drive all the way here to burn me (*her words*) and hung up.  I was freaked out, my exams were in two days, I did not have an internship anymore and now this?  I could not possibly stay in my apartment, they had a key.

We *(my gf who made all the way with bus from Germany because she was scared for me)* packed a few things and booked the first train to Germany *(it was so expensive, I did not have any money).* I stayed at her place a while taking the bus back to France several days in a row for exams and then back to Germany (*11hrs of bus* …)

After a few weeks my mother told me she did not tell my father after all and said I could go back to my apartment safely.

**Then I made a bad move**.

As I wanted to show my mother that even if I refused to break up, it did not mean I was rejecting the family. My girlfriend and I decided that I would look for an internship closer to my parents'. It would make our relationship a bit harder and would not be able to see each other as often but this was just for 6 months.

I moved 100km away from them and my life turned into a **nightmare**.

My family would come visit spontaneously to ""check on me"", force me to visit every weekend and harass me if I would not come. My father would threaten to beat me up and insult me if I tried to negotiate a weekend to stay home but since he did not officially know, my hands were tied.

I had to come from Friday evening directly after work to Sunday evening. I did not even have time my thesis that I was writing  during week days at night and using my breaks during the internship as my weekend were blocked.

My mother would blow hot and cold. She accused me of stealing money to give it to my girlfriend (*not true*) and decided to cut me off financially.

\----------------------

***Little explanation about money:*** *In France, university is ""free"". It costs around 400-600€/year plus another 200€ for healthcare. The state can also give scholarships to students (between 100 and 500€/month) if they show their parents do not support them and depending on the parents' earnings. I had an agreement with my parents. In exchange of 200€/month, they would keep me on their tax declaration. They would get a tax cut but this would prevent me from asking for state help. My rent was 500€ while ma salary as an intern was 498€, those 200€ were important for me, not just for food but I had also to* ***pay my own fucking train tickets to visit them every week*** *and also to meet my thesis director 400km away from here since I moved away for them.*

\-----------------------

She did not say a word to me for 2 months when she learned by girlfriend came to visit me *(she was bringing me suitcases of food because I could not afford it anymore; my girlfriend took so many small shit jobs while still being a student to gather a bit of money to help while she is from a poor family....I am not)* . Even when I would visit them, my mother would answer my ""Hello"" with a ""mmmm"" which made my dad more pressing asking to to fix whatever I did.

I started developing anxiety and suicidal thoughts, I was really on the edge.  I just wanted it to end. The words of my mother telling me that death was easier to accept resonated in me constantly. My girlfriend was the only reason I did not throw myself under a train. God knows I tried many times.

I pulled through, managed to graduate, got a job in my field and moved back to Paris *(they tried to sabotage this*) having learned from this terrible mistake but I was really not feeling good.  The depression and anxiety did not leave and it was starting affect my work. I had nightmares, hearing my phone ring would make me puke out of anxiety. It was bad. The contact with my family dwindled but their impact remained strong. The few messages I would get from my mother would often be passive aggressive or really guilting me. She would say how much she suffers and wants to see the family together again.  I'd be blamed for not texting my siblings but they're not texting me either.

No one ever asked me how I felt so I decided to write my mother to tell her and I mentioned what she said to me back then. That it kept haunting me to think that for her, my death would be easier for her and this had lead me to have suicidal thoughts.

Her answer was such a slap in the face, she said that she still thinks so because at least death she can explain to herself and that I should not guilt her with my suicidal thoughts. I have to say for honesty now that **my mother is a shrink.**

Needless to say that this did not help at all, on the contrary.

Eventually my father learned about it and he called me to insult me and said he would come to ""take matters in his own hands"".  I was living again terror and had a mental breakdown. My employer said I needed to sort myself out which lead me to just quit my job and move to Germany. I joined my girlfriend who had just graduated too and we got an apartment together.

Life got much better. Fast forward a couple years, my career is going well, we have own nest together, build our lives, go on holidays, I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore. As for depression and anxiety, I have sometimes episodes but I guess the distance helped a lot sort things out but also living with someone who loves me and that I love so deeply.

But the woulds and scars are there and I really have a hard time coping sometimes. I feel extremely guilty over things.

During the little contacts we have, my whole family asks (implicitly) me how I could do such a thing, that I was always the selfish one anyway probably because I'm the oldest child and was an only child for 3 years before my siblings came along (*wtf*). That they never did anything bad to me. And it is hard to argue or prove because you cannot pinpoint one event that causes everything. It is a constant flow that had been going for 4 years now.

I tried to write it now but I cannot make a list of every little things, I tried to show the main events but it is hard to show the real depth of it. Even more when their mind set is to deny it up front.

The worst is that I **know** I did not do anything wrong but my family, *with whom I was so close before*, being so adamant and now acting like nothing is wrong really messes up my perception of what happened. I have to do some extra mental gymnastics to remind myself that I should not fall for it.

\----------------------------------------

**Conclusion and summary:**

My relationship with my family crashed after I got outed. I do not blame homophobia directly but the fact that they  have become toxic and controlling. I had always lived my life trying to make them proud of me, I was a parent-pleaser and the only time I decided something for myself, hell broke loose and they abused me emotionally, psychologically, tried to sabotage my future and studies.

I had depression and was suicidal because of the situation and when I tried to confront them about their behavior or just saying I was not feeling good, they dismissed it. Claimed I was just looking for attention and trying to guilt them.

In the end, I cut ties but I feel extremely guilty having distanced myself even if I am aware that I should not. I get sad texts from my mother saying how she wished the family to be united again, sweeping under the rug everything that happened while I cannot talk about my personal life with them or anything related to my girlfriend. It is very alienating and really messed up. I don't think I can change my family, the solution is not in my hands on that one and I have to accept it but I do not know how to get rid those feelings.

**I would like help to cope with it or just support or opinions on this whole thing. I never really had the occasion to share it. Thank you.**

\------------------------------------

PS: My girlfriend is the most supportive and caring partner in the universe, after all we have been through I do not want it to weigh on her any more than it already did. We try very hard to live fully our relationship and not having this affecting us but sometimes, it is hard to ignore it.

Currently, I live in NJ and will be relocating for the position in Virginia for the Summer.

I plan on graduating NJIT in the Spring of 2020 with:

BS Computer Technology

BS Medical Informatics

MS Infomation Systems

I am doing a BS/MS Program so even though I will finish my undergrad requirements by spring 2019, I will not obtain any of my degrees until Spring 2020 when I complete my maters. 

The Agency recruiter I spoke with informed me that I can participate in the program summer until I do graduate! Following graduation, I will be reviewed for full-time employment.

I was wondering if anyone could:

Give me some advice on relocating?

Info in the position if you have ever participated?

Benefits of the program? 

Has anyone gone through this program and received a full time offer? 

And some things to do in the area when I am not at work?

I am working at a facility that has never dealt with Modbus, and none of the engineers here are very familiar with it. At this point I feel like I have a better understanding than they do through all my research.   

Currently there are 3 large industrial compressors that are all linked with Modbus RTU and go to a Modbus RTU/Ethernet switch. Then from the switch to a computer with an Ingersoll Rand program to monitor and control. My job is to get the same information that computer is getting onto a PLC so we can get it on our local company network for logging purposes.   I have a Switch/Bridge that I have put in between the line from the current bridge to the computer, this keeps that connection while also giving me a connection so I can talk Ethernet/IP with my Allen Bradley PLC. The switch/bridge in between the original line goes from Modbus TCP to Ethernet/IP.  

The problem I am running into is finding out how to properly communicate with the compressors through the PLC. I have an add on profile where I have set up the basics of the switch into RSLogix 5000. When I go to make a transaction in the software in the add on profile, it asks for quite a lot of information that I am unsure how to get.   

1. Unit Identifier

* I understand what it is, I don't understand how to get it. The software on the current monitoring computer does not have access to it for whatever reason. It would make sense that they would be 1,2,3 but I don't believe that they are. 

2.  Baud Rate/Timeout/etc.

* These all have to be the same on the compressors and in the PLC to communicate correctly?

I understand the registers, and how that works.   I am missing something to make this all communicate.   Is there a checklist that I should be going through to make sure I have all of the required information?  I found in the settings of the newest controller (the other 2 are too old) that says Modbus address = 16. What does this mean?  
Thank you for the help, if anyone has questions or needs more information let me know and I can provide.   Thank you.  "

TLDR: My company has a system that's like facebook. Mike is an 'admin' of a group. He is awkward, annoying, and cringey. He has a god complex due to being an 'admin' of this group. He PMed me and behaved like a little baby bitch because I didn't reply to one of his comments to one of my posts.

In my company we have this system that’s basically like a copy of facebook. This is to replace email and messaging systems plus allows everyone to get to know each other without being physically present with them for extended periods of time and it’s actually very effective.

So like facebook, you can make groups. I am a team leader/manager/whatever so we have a group for all the managers. So everyone in the same position, no matter which branch or city you are in are in this group.

And like facebook you need an admin. But the admin isn’t REALLY an admin, the system is just set up that you need at least 3 ‘admins’ per group to manage things like the banner, removing old accounts of people who have left the company, adding new members who request to join, etc. But they don’t really moderate posts and stuff like that.

But there’s this one Mike. God, this Mike is fucking weird as hell. He lives in a different city so I’ve never met the man, but the first post I’ve ever read from this guy when I first joined the group I could tell that he’s awkward as fuck.

At first it was kind of funny. I would see his awkward posts and replies and kind of cringe, shudder, chuckle, and move on.

But then I realized: He definitely developed a god complex by being an admin in this group.

He makes a post EVERY SINGLE DAY and calls it, “Today’s Daily Discussion” (redundant much?!). He obviously runs out of topics most of the time. One time his post was, “Should we allow white out in the office?” All the replies had an air of, “wtf is this stupid fucking question” in a very polite way and he explained that when he was a high school student he had one teacher who didn’t allow white out and only allowed the students to cross out their mistakes so he could see what mistake the students made. Ok, dude but we’re not fucking children in school, we’re fucking adults working in a professional environment and sometimes we fucking use white out.

Another post he made which was fucking inappropriate as fuck was, “what do you think about attractive people? Are they better workers or not?” What the fuck, dude. What the fuck.

I have to add in this one: He posted pictures of two erasers. One of them were those old school pink ones that’s like a parallelogram. He wrote, “which eraser is better for the office?” And in the replies he said this was not a serious question, just a funny jokey discussion. Ok…. Hilarious, man.

Like facebook, the group has a ‘like’ function. Not everyone uses this function. He made a stupid fucking post saying things like people should make more of an effort to ‘like’ posts. Ugh. He was just being a baby because most people ignore his stupid fucking posts. Then he made a really stupid fucking rule – if you don’t ‘actively participate’ you can be kicked out of the group! He does a purge every 6 months! What the fuck. This is not part of company policy and it’s fucking bullshit. We actually don’t HAVE to be in groups, we can be in whatever group we want (to an extent – for example, an intern can’t join the managers’ group, but you don’t HAVE to join the managers’ group if you are a manager). A lot of people actually left the group on their own or didn’t give a fuck if they got kicked out.

After a recent purge it came up in conversation at work and there was a guy who actually knew Mike and said yes, he’s fucking awkward as hell. Before there was this facebook-esque system he would send out group messages saying shit like, “I’m at this Starbucks, if anyone wants to drop by” and whoever came would be treated better at work. For example, an intern got a full time position after consistently responding to these messages.

I am pretty new in the company and in the group but I actually like all the other members. They’re all great and give helpful information. Literally everyone is fine except for Mike. So I actually participate a lot. And when Mike posted that stupid BS about liking posts, I decided to like the fucking posts even though I think ‘like’ functions are fucking stupid (same with upvotes on reddit, I never use that shit). And I reply to comments to my posts as much as I can. I didn’t realize that Mike was a stupid fucking baby at the time and that rule was so that he would get likes and replies so I just wanted to do as Romans do and adapt to the culture of the group. Turns out it was one of many of Mike’s stupid rules to up his ego.

But Mike was too fucking annoying and since I can’t block him like on real facebook, I decided to just ignore him. If I he makes a fucking stupid post I cringe and shudder at how fucking weird and annoying this poor bastard is and move on. I don’t bother liking or replying to his posts or comments. What’s annoying is he ALWAYS replies to every single post made. Obviously he can’t make a valuable reply for EVERY post so he sometimes rephrases the post in his own words as a question. What the fuck.

For example, the post would be:

&gt; I am having issues with two of my team members who don’t get along well because of their different working styles. Does anyone have any tips to help me with this problem?

His stupid fucking reply:

&gt; So you’re asking how to help two people who don’t work well together?

OP replies:

&gt; Yes.

And then Mike doesn’t fucking reply because he doesn’t have any fucking tips, he just wanted reply for the fucking sake of replying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

At first I thought everyone felt obligated to reply to Mike because he was an admin but I realized the truth. When I make a post, he always comments and at first I would be polite and reply but then I gave up and didn’t reply to his comment to my post because it was a stupid empty reply. A couple of days later, he replied to himself trying to confirm that I’ve read the post and I ‘should’ acknowledge it in some way. At the same time, he sent me a private message asking me if I’ve read the post. Then he had the audacity to tell me how I should reply to “everyone’s” (ie. HIS) comments and I should make more of an effort to show appreciation to “everyone’s” (HIS!!!) comments.

I politely told him that I do make the effort to like and reply (as I’ve mentioned previously in this rant here) but sometimes I miss a comment. I honestly wanted to say, “I don’t reply to empty comments and I don’t appreciate you policing how I participate in this group,” but I refrained from doing so.

He goes on to say that some of my posts may be too specific to me and doesn’t add value to the group and if I don’t change the \~admins\~ (ie. purely him) may reconsider my membership. What the fuck. I ignore one comment and he wants to kick me out of the group? Fuck him. I’ll be more than happy to fucking report him to HR. Fucking prick. And he probably has HUNDREDS of stupid posts that hold no value, like the three examples I gave above.

He’s just being a little baby bitch because I ignored him. So I realized that everyone replies to his stupid fucking comments because they probably got a PM from him if they ignored him like I did.

I asked him if there’s a rule page for this group and if he could direct me to it so I wouldn’t make any mistakes but since it’s a fucking company system and not like facebook where group admins can make their own rules of course there isn’t any fucking stupid special rules. The rules are the same as in real life at the company. There’s no special rules just for the group. Honestly, I was being a bit passive aggressive and pointing out that his ‘rules’ are fucking bullshit. He completely ignored my question and said he considers the issue resolved. LOL. He said that in the future I should be more considerate of his interpretation of posts. DUDE. I don’t fucking KNOW you. I’ve never MET you. How the fuck would I know how you interpret things?!??! Whenever I make a post I get TONES of great and helpful replies. Obviously everyone else thinks my posts are ‘appropriate’ to the group. Does he expect me to think, “How would Mike interpret this post?” every time I’m writing a post? Dude, fuck the hell off!

If I search back old posts I can see which members have left the group. There are multiple reasons why they could have left the group. For example, they left the company and the account is just deleted, or they were promoted and joined another group, maybe they left on their own, or Mike kicked them out. I'm pretty sure I found some people who were definitely kicked out by Mike. I mean, he's purged a lot of members but I can't tell if they were purged or left for other reasons but based on posts on the managers' group, other groups they're in and public posts, I put two and two together i think I am sure about a handful of people who were kicked out. For example, some of them didn't reply to baby bitch Mike consistently. I really want to PM them and then contact them outside the confines of the company and just fucking gossip about Mike. He's suck a fucking annoying little prick. I already talk about him with my coworker who knew him for a couple of months and Mike is just such a pathetic loser.

I just realized another thing. After about 2\~3 weeks into joining this group I completely stopped replying to any post Mike makes or any comments he makes to other people's posts. I honestly wonder if he keeps a record of who replies and who doesn't and I'm on the list of who doesn't lol.

He told me he noticed that i don't reply enough to other people's posts and I told him to use the search function to check because I actually do reply regularly but now I realized that he means i never reply to his stupid fucking posts! (Also he said my posts have been made before and I should use the search function -- but he didn't know that I always search for old posts before making new ones and all of my posts have been unique and never posted so far -- and that's why i told him back to use the search function, lol). I guess he really did search my posts because he ignored that reply and said that he interpreted that I didn't reply to other people enough (how can he 'INTERPRET' that? It's a fact if I did or did not reply a regular amount. Jeeze)."
8vtboa,6,2018-07-03,Thoughts on Taking Courses at Community College?,IcyViolin,UCONN,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCONN/comments/8vtboa/thoughts_on_taking_courses_at_community_college/,"I'm an incoming freshman planning on pursuing a dual degree (computer science &amp; engineering + business management), which would require a pretty high credit load (would need to request excess credits every other semester) to graduate in 4 years. Because of this, I tried to find other ways to lighten the load.  


During my search, I was surprised to learn that the local community colleges offer a lot more of my major-required classes during the summer than the nearest regional campus (Hartford). In fact, 64 credits worth of required classes are offered by the CCs, with the majority of them also available during the summer.  


Two summers at CC would reduce my credit load from something like 19, 19, 22, 22, 22, 21, 21, 21 to something like 19, 19, 18, 16, 18, 16, 18, 15. However, I'd also like to participate in some summer internships if possible.  


Would you guys recommend I take some classes at at CCs? If so, to what extent? (Didn't mean for that to sound like a high school essay prompt, haha.)  


Should I only take gen eds and nonessential required courses at CCs during the summer? This assumes that material will be taught more thoroughly at Storrs than CC.  


Should I purposely take harder/weak classes at CCs since grades don't transfer? For example, if I know that English is a weak point, should drop ENGL 1010 and take the CC equivalent? Or if PHYS 1501Q is known to be hard, should I just take it at a CC to save my GPA?  


I know that there isn't one right answer for any of this, but I'd like to hear your opinions."

Working as an intern this summer for an MSP and a lot of my work has me checking configs on CE routers running two VLAN's over a single circuit to our Core routers. 

For the most part most of these are broken up using standard subinterfaces configured for each VLAN. 

Today I ran across an ASR-920 that had 2 BDI's set up to separate the traffic instead of using VLAN's like I've seen on the ISR routers. 

I did some research on lunch and got the gist of the general difference between the two services but I'm still not seeing the  benefits behind using BDI's. 

If anyone could spare some time to shed some light on this I'd really appreciate it. 

Sorry If my description is unclear or kind of fucked... let me know and I'll do my best to clarify. "

Exam results come 8 weeks after the exam so would not having the results hurt my chances of getting an offer? This would be my first exam completed and I am going into my Junior year (I switched from Computer Science which is why my first exam completion might be a bit late). 

I read somewhere about prometric giving unofficial pass/fail results immediately that are generally correct, would that be enough to put on a resume before I get official results? 

Junior Math major in the Honors college at my college with a 3.8 GPA. No internship experience but I am currently participating in a paid group research at my College about signal processing (takes place from May 20 to July 20th which is why I didn't sign up for an earlier exam). Also considering taking the FM exam in October before school starts ramping up.

This has come right as we have to move 150 miles from each other (college internships) and we've both decided to try to make it work. I want it to work so bad, I love her more than anything and have for a while. 

But she's been telling me about her internship and how there's loads of people her age there and how they go out all the time. I had fears before that the distance word kill us, but it's so much worst now that I know she's surrounded by other guys her age.

Her feelings for me have come and gone so many times since she's known me, they're just not consistent. And she's the sort of person who will sleep with any guy who tries it on with her on a night out.

I want to be with her so bad, and she wants to be with me, but I  terrified she will do something regrettable when drunk, after she's lost interest in me die to the distance.

My gut feeling is almost always right, and it's telling me this will happen.

I know it's not rational but I'm so scared I'm shaking. I love her and I just want to make it work.

8vvotb,30,2018-07-03,What sort of qualities does NVIDA look for in a programming/software engineering intern?,dreymatic,nvidia,https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/8vvotb/what_sort_of_qualities_does_nvida_look_for_in_a/,"Hi all, I'm a computer science student and one of my ""dream"" internships is with NVIDA. I figured there was probably bound to be both current and former employees/interns browsing this sub reddit and figured it would still remain on topic as this is NVIDIA specific, not what companies look for in interns in general.

Obviously we can take a look at the general advice:

- Get good at interviewing

- Build a portfolio with quality projects

- Network

- Do research/other academic but CS related things such as being a TA


But how could you specifically apply this advice to NVIDIA? What kind of projects is NVIDIA ideally looking for, what kind of languages and technologies, what class would make you pop out in the applicant pool for being a TA in, how difficult is NVIDIA's interview process, etc.


This is all very new to me still but I have plenty of time I believe to build myself and make myself a great applicant for NVIDIA as an intern despite not being from a top school what so ever (not even top 100)


Any advice is great and thanks for helping out an aspiring student, I know we run rampant like rodents some time haha

Edit: Thanks a ton to the people who decided to be helpful, a lot of insight can be taken away from this post and I appreciate it a ton!"
8vvq8o,1,2018-07-03,How to not give in to their divide and conquer tactics between GC and SG?,[deleted],raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8vvq8o/how_to_not_give_in_to_their_divide_and_conquer/,"I’m the SG (23F) and GCsis is 14. Nmom has recently been pressuring GCsis ever since she started high school, being a perfectionist about her grades, so that she doesn’t “screw up like this one.” Because yanno, rug sweeping mental disorders is the way to go.  Bear with me since there’s a lot of events, before I circle back to the question.

This afternoon, nmom was screaming at GCsis to make her tea, which she did, while watching something on the iPad simultaneously. Around the same time, nmom was also flipping out on GCsis for not oiling and washing her hair. So GCsis goes to do so, while forgetting to serve nmom her tea, in her cup and saucer. 

While nmom is fuming that GCsis ran off without giving her her tea (I MEAN HOW HARD IS IT TO JUST POUR A DAMN CUP OF TEA), I decide to be nice and stick up for her. I simply say “you told her to wash her hair. She at least made the tea for you,” while pouring her her tea myself. Nmom then proceeds to go off in a rage. “I’ve been telling her to wash her hair for the past three days! Btw, out of seven of her classes, she got a B in math, and a B in bio! And you didn’t help her! She’s going to end up with a 2.69 and unemployed just like you!” SHES NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY AND SHE GETS ALL PRISSY AND ACTS LIKE SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING AND DOESNT NEED YOU IF YOU TRY TO HELP.

Meanwhile, n/edad takes that as his cue to join in and goes off on how I haven’t reached out to any of the connections he introduced me to (THEY’RE IT CONNECTIONS WHO HAVE IT LEADS AND I’M TRYING TO FOCUS ON BIO), and I don’t do anything to help myself jobwise, putting my eggs into one basket, depending solely on a recruiter-obtained job that I merely interviewed for (IS IT MY FAULT SOMEONE IN MY INTERVIEWERS FAMILY DIED SO THERES BEEN A DELAY IN THE PROCESS). Meanwhile, they neglect the fact that I just spent pretty much most of this morning revamping my LinkedIn, and coming up with a decent bio and headline, trying to get a good professional photo all weekend, as well as updating my career and internship finder profile on my university website?! I EVEN MET WITH CAREER SERVICES YESTERDAY AS AN ALUMNI! 

So I have to reach out to these people, whose phone numbers he won’t give me, despite me asking and him giving vague answers. I DON’T WANT TO DO CONSULTING JUST YET. Anyway, I grab some ice cream from the fridge, and go to my room to disengage and I hear them bitching about me. 

He says he doesn’t care about being PC or if it sounds like body shaming, but all I do is spend half my day eating ice cream and playing on the iPad. I HAVE BARELY TOUCHED THE IPAD. I DIDNT PLAY ON IT LAST WEEK AND ONLY PLAYED A LITTLE. AND I DONT FUCKING EAT ICE CREAM EVERY GODDAMN DAY AND EVEN IF I DID ITS NOT LIKE I EAT MORE THAN ONE SERVING A DAY. And he tries to justify badgering me to go to the gym as being healthy and not about looks. I sometimes lack the motivation and drive to cross the street and go. At one point it was all there but now it isn’t. 

Nmom then proceeds to cry about how I’m wasting her money on a therapist, who then tells her she’s wrong and attacked her(PRETTY SURE THAT ISNT WHAT HAPPENED! But what do I know, I wasn’t in the room) and that I’m running my mouth saying she’s the enemy and ruined my life. Actually, you said it not me. I don’t even say that on this sub. All I said is that she rug swept my mental illness and up and left to another country. 

So I text nmom that I spent all morning doing job related shit, and edad tries to be like “I’m wrong sry.” ALL THIS BECAUSE I TRIED TO STICK UP FOR GCSIS. Is this part of their divide and conquer tactic? GCsis has not said anything on the matter, and we probably aren’t going to discuss it. Should I depend on her to come to me and apologize for not smelling the roses?"

I have 2 supervisors and one of them complemented my work ethic and spends time chatting every now and again. The other sits in the cubicle across from me and actively avoids looking at me or talking to me, even though I'm on his project team and everything I do is related to his work.

When I ask him something, he seems anxious to give me an answer and turn back to his computer before I finish asking. When he assigns me something, he does it through a third party, right in front of me, instead of telling me directly. When he leaves the office for the day, he says goodbye to everyone sitting in his immediate area but me. I arrived early for a meeting last week and he was sitting alone in the room. He didn't look up from his lap top until the next person arrived, and suddenly he stopped typing and wanted to chat about their weekend.What makes it even weirder is that I started off on a really good foot with this guy. He got me this job after I met him at a networking event, and seemed very friendly and genuinely impressed by my work experience.  I have no idea what I did wrong, but it's really starting to both me.

I could name some things that may have gone wrong: for instance, I was really overwhelmed by a report I was assigned to put together, and the task took way longer than it should; like, a whole day longer than it should. The report was way thicker than the binder could handle, and since I was a novice with the equipent, I didn't have the finesse to make it work: the equipment kept malfunctioning, or I'd screw up and lose hours of work. He ended up having to help me finish and I was visibly stressed and flustered by that point. That's my best guess. I don't know why that would cause him to not ever want to engage with me again, but it's all I have to work with.

I know it's not really that big of a deal, since I'll be moving on in about six weeks anyway. But it still bothers me, because I have absolutely no idea what I could have done. And I've had bosses in my life who weren't huge fans of me before, but at least they were polite... with this guy, I just... I don't know. I wish I knew what the problem was. That's all."
8vw92y,1,2018-07-03,"How do you start ""believing"" your ex was abusive?",geraldine000,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8vw92y/how_do_you_start_believing_your_ex_was_abusive/,"So me (25f) was in a six year relationship with my ex (33m). He was my first serious boyfriend, the first guy I lived with and I think the first guy I loved.

He ended our relationship on Christmas eve saying that he had to leave because I was too dependent on him (I have depression and anxiety) . I later found out he had been cheating on me with his intern who he is now together with.

The breakup has been messy to say the least. There were the complications like me moving out the flat, him keeping the dog, him refusing to give me my salary back and the continuing refusal to let me get off the flat contract unless I pay his new contract. It all kind of escalated and about 2 months ago I became increasingly suicidal. It ended up with me writing the letters, setting off to the metro to jump before realising what I was doing, flying to my parents house and staying in bed there for near a month.

I've been going to counselling as a result and the counsellor, alongside my friends and family have been telling me I've been in an abusive relationship with a narcissist.

I do recognise things were abusive from him. On the physical side he regularly pushed me. The first time was up the stairs and later it became pushing me into corners, whacking my head off the bed frame repeatedly and taking my phone, keys and laptop away so I couldn't escape. In these times he would become verbally abusive shouting in my face, laughing in my face, telling me how pathetic I am, how noone would want me because of my mental health stuff, how I'm a fat cunt, how my parents took anti depressants because they were around me, how i caused my dad's affair etc etc etc.

Now. I know if this was someone else I wouldn't think twice about it being abusive. But for some reason I can't help but feel I'm deluding myself trying to think it was. I can't help thinking firstly, that what he did wasn't wrong, that I'm making a big deal out of nothing and it's pathetic to be upset about it or feel wronged. I almost feel that it's selfish of me. I also blame myself completely for it I think. If I'd have been better etc.. And if it was abusive, why did I make someone turn into that? I can't imagine him being like that with anyone else and can't accept that it was him and not me no matter what my counsellor tells me.

So I guess my question is, how do I start healing and realising what I was in was wrong? Do I need to accept the abuse as abuse to heal from it?

I'm really struggling with it all right now and just want to be able to sleep without lying in bed thinking about specific occasions, I want to stop leaving work crying and I want to stop feeling so confused and pathetic... "
8vwl5q,3,2018-07-03,No idea why,Justfordeepshit,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8vwl5q/no_idea_why/,"Background: About two months ago, I was 5 minutes away from booking a one way plane ticket and walking to the airport. It was the end of freshman year of college, a lot of shit had been going on, I was in a whirlwind of emotions, and I wanted it all to stop, but I didn't want to kill myself no matter how much the little voice inside me said ""you're a 5 minute walk from the highway, just go"". 

It was one of those things that I wanted to say ""Fuck it, I'm out. Maybe I'll come back, maybe I won't.""

Ever since then, I've just been feeling ups and downs, but the downs have been a lot more minor than what they were. I visited my sister a month later and enjoyed the hell out of it. I didn't want to leave.

I got home and everything was normal as ever. I started my internship back up with the I.T. department of the company I work for. Last year I was with marketing, but they switched me over to I.T. this year. I thought it was gonna be great, considering I'm an I.T. Management major and I absolutely love working with computers.

I fucking hate this job. I'm working 40 hours a week doing jack fucking shit. 

Today I did absolutely nothing except install Windows and a few programs on a laptop. A 7 HOUR DAY OF DOING NOTHING. I WAS SO FUCKING BORED AND IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS THE WHOLE WEEK.

My parents think I should talk to my supervisor when he gets back from vacation. I'm going to, but I'm dreading it. I've been dreading going to work everyday. Hell, in the beginning of June I was considering changing my major and transferring schools I was so freaked out. I love the hands on aspect of I.T. and I know it exists, it just doesn't at this job. 

I felt like shit on the drive home today and just got in bed. I don't want to leave my room and I just want to cry for no fucking reason. I've felt this way before and I hate it. I don't know if I'm depressed or what. I'm already on the highest dose I can be for my anxiety medication and I don't want to have to explain all of this to my psychiatrist. I just don't know what to do anymore. 

There have been times I thought about posting here, but whenever I started typing out a post I said fuck it and erased everything. But I guess at this point I don't know where else to turn to say this all anonymously and I just want to see someone say that it's going to be okay even though they've never met me. I think I'm going to talk to my therapist about this.

Thanks

Edit: whole week and it's only Tuesday lmao my bad. But in all seriousness, the past couple weeks have been boring as shit with me just sitting at my cubicle."
8vwlrm,2,2018-07-03,Debating cutting off my relationship with my mother,HangryFB,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8vwlrm/debating_cutting_off_my_relationship_with_my/,"This turned out to be a very long post, I'm sorry. 

I feel like I need to give a lot of a backstory, so if you feel like skipping the backstory and going to current events, I'll mark that out so you can skip ahead. I'm sorry for the very long post, this is my first time every posting.

My mother has always been a little overly involved in my life. She expects a phone call every day (since getting married I've worked it down to a text message conversation every day and a phone call every other) and if I go a day without calling her I get chewed out. Since childhood I can remember my mom treating me more as a buddy than her kid. She'd vent about my grandmother to me (she lived with us), she'd complain about work, as a teenager I wasn't allowed to spend more time hanging out with friends than I was with her. When I was about 16yrs old both of my grandparents (her mom and dad) became very ill. All of their care was left to me. 

Once my grandmother died my mom started online dating. At the time the computer was in my bedroom, and she'd be on the computer sometimes until 2am, which meant I couldn't get any sleep before school. Sometimes, if I needed to use the computer for school, I would just have to make sure I went to the library because I knew I wouldn't be able to get on the computer at home. She made a promise to herself that she would be married within a year. She got very close to marrying one man that she'd known for two weeks. They started looking at houses together and taking me with them. At one point he started grabbing my ass and then cornered me in one of the houses we were looking at saying ""I guess this would be your room"" and winked at me. I was grossed out, and told my mom, to which she told me I was overreacting and he was just teasing. Fortunately, she didn't end up marrying him. He turned out to be a con artist on the run, so he's in prison now. She did meet another man that same year on Halloween night, and she married him January 6th. She didn't understand why I was having a hard time adjusting to her being single my entire childhood to suddenly marrying someone who was basically a stranger to me. 

My mom's husband and I do not get along. We're very different people. I don't hate him, and I love him the way you love family that irritates the hell out of you, but we've always butt heads and clashed. 

After that I graduated high school and went to a community college within 3 miles of our house. My mom and her husband adopted a little girl and I was essentially used as a nanny. Now. I expect, as family and big sister still living at home, to have taken care of my sister from time to time. What I mean when I say I was used as a nanny is that I was never allowed to go out with my friends unless I took my sister (then less than 2yrs old) with me. My mom boasts that she never changed a single diaper when my sister was a baby. The only time I wasn't required to take her out with me was if it was a date, but if I wasn't home by a certain time I'd get a screaming phone call. Once I finished my Associate's degree I decided to go away to get my bachelor's at the state college that was farthest away.

I thought being 6 hours away would minimize my interactions with my mother. But I quickly learned that I would be screamed at if I didn't call every day and I would be screamed at if I didn't come home every single three day weekend or break period. I ended up having to take time off school and quit my job because my grandfather was diagnosed with colon cancer and my mom needed me to come home and take care of him. 

Once I graduated college I moved back home to continue taking care of my grandpa, my little sister, and help prep for another little girl that my mom and step-dad were adopting. I eventually got an internship in the closest major city--it was over an hour commute and I worked 6 days a week. I was still expected to take care of my sisters. Fortunately, my grandpa made a successful recovery from his colon cancer. I started to make friends in the city, and started staying some nights with friends because they'd invite me out. Mixed in with all the drama before I finally moved out: I tried to reconnect with my father, only to find out via a facebook message that he'd died three years prior, and my uncle (her little brother that also lived with us) was arrested for holding up a gas station. When I found out about my father I was really depressed for a while. The day after I'd found out she asked me why I was so sad. I just looked at her and said ""because my father is dead"" and her response was ""well how do you think I feel? He was my husband for two years, you barely knew him."" I felt like she had punched me in the stomach.

Then my mom's husband got sick. Very sick. I was expected to be present for every doctor appointment, procedure and test. If I wasn't, I was told how selfish I was. The final blowout was when I was trying to plan something for my birthday. I was planning a day at a theme park with friends, which would involve me spending two nights away from home. This resulted in a massive screaming match, because I was told that I was selfish for staying away that long when her husband was having a (routine and standard) procedure done. This became my breaking point and I stood up for myself. Being told that I was selfish and only cared for myself just made me snap. I packed up a few bags and went to stay at a friend's house for a week, and proceeded to find a place to live in the city. I figured being 24, it was more than expected for me to try to live on my own.

That was more of a fight. I was selfish for wanting to move to the city, because my sisters would miss me. Because it would be harder for her take care of everyone. Because she rented a house with enough bedrooms so that I could have my own room (the house before I shared a bedroom with my two sisters, when we moved I got my own room and they still shared). It became just like college all over again. I was expected over every holiday, birthday, special event, or long weekend. Work wasn't a good enough excuse for her, but I eventually told her she had to deal with it because I had bills to pay.

Since then, I met someone and was in a long distance relationship. We're now happily married and live about an hour and a half from my mother. She made the process of planning my wedding miserable. She complained because the location was too far from her (it was in the city we live in, she wanted to have it at a restaurant literally down the street from her). She complained because the bridal shower was hosted in my city. She complained that between her and her husband and my grandfather they only had one car, so I gave her my car to use during the week of the wedding so she could come the day before my step-dad and grandpa could come the day of the wedding. She got mad at me when I told her I had invited my father's widow and my half-brothers and told me that if they showed up she would not sit near them or speak to them. It was going to be the first time I'd ever meet my brothers. The entire time we were looking at wedding dresses she just told me to hurry up and pick one because she was hungry and wanted to go eat, but then complained later on that she didn't feel like I included her enough and that my friend (who is a seamstress and I specifically invited because of her skills with dresses) took over too much. During the wedding, just before I'm about to walk down the aisle, she hands me my car keys and tells me she's going to ride home that night with her husband, so I needed to drive my own car home that night (she was originally staying at a hotel the night of the wedding and driving back home the next day). During the reception she handed me her glass and asked me to go get her another drink. My husband's jaw dropped at that. Then she went up to the caterer's and said she was taking all of the left over food. She walked out with about $500 worth of catering and never said one word to me before she left the reception. 

There have been a lot of other issues and confrontations with my mother, but I already feel bad for how long this is getting. Constantly making comments on my weight and my appearance, pressuring me to have kids (even though I've tried explaining to her I have fertility issues and it upsets me every time she brings it up), tells me how much she doesn't like my friends and why I should stop talking to them, etc. 

\*\*CURRENT EVENTS: The straw that broke the camel's back\*\*

My grandpa is now at the ripe age of 89, and still in decently good health and has now been cancer free for 8 years. He recently decided to take himself off his blood pressure medication and that caused some problems that landed him in the hospital. After a day of observation, they decided he was fine, and he was released and told to continue to follow up with his primary care and to take his medication as prescribed. My mom tells me she's stressed out and wants me to plan something fun for her and my sisters. I offer to have them over, play in the pool, and keep my sisters over the weekend. Then our AC broke, so those plans had to be postponed.

This morning I got a text from my mom, ""back at the doctor with my dad, you should consider coming over for a few days, I'm stressed and I need an outlet."" I can't stay at their house because one of their dogs tries to bite anyone who comes into the house (I still have a scar on my hand from one incident), so I'd have to get a hotel. My husband and I share one vehicle because we're buying our first house and trying to save as much as we can for the down payment, so that would leave him at home without a vehicle and it's too short notice for my husband to get off work. I explain that I can't really come over for multiple days, because of these reasons, but I could come over for a day if she wanted. 

That wasn't good enough. I was told that I don't care about her, I'm disinterested in her and the entire family. That I needed to step up and be a big sister (because I couldn't make it to an award ceremony in the middle of a work week, an hour and a half away, that apparently makes me a bad sister). She listed out all of the things she feels I've done wrong to her, including not lending her money to finalize paperwork for my sisters' adoptions (paperwork she should have done 10yrs ago). Mind you, we're trying to buy our first house. I don't make very much money, almost all of the money comes from my husband. So that money wouldn't be coming from me, it would be coming from my husband. But according to her we're being selfish in buying a home when we should give her money to take care of her children. That it's not fair that I tell her she needs to save money for my sister's paperwork because her finances are so tight (literally the only advice I've ever given her is ""hey, maybe just put $20 here and there into a savings account"" or ""hey I know you like going to the movies every week, have you looked in MoviePass, that might help you save money"" or ""it might not be best idea to get a tattoo when you still need to get the girls' paperwork done""). Meanwhile, all this time, she refused to tell me what had happened with my grandfather at the doctors and proceeded to tell me that my sisters hate me for not coming over to their awards ceremony. 

I broke down. I've been dealing with a lot of depression and anxiety lately. And this just made me snap. My husband does his best to console me, but we're currently trying to get me in to see a counselor because I went into full panic attack and couldn't stop shaking for two hours. My husband has a very different relationship with his parents, and while his mother does get manipulative to get attention, he said it never goes as far as he sees my mother go. I told my mother if she felt I was so awful then she should just cut me out of her life and be done with me. She said she was done talking to me because I just get defensive. That I was being over emotional. Anytime I tell her I don't appreciate what she's saying to me or how she's talking to me, the response is always that I'm too emotional or too defensive. 

I'm genuinely at the point where I'm considering cutting off or at least severely minimizing my contact with my mother. I used to never want to completely cut off, because I know that would cut me off from my sisters and my grandpa, but I feel like she just uses them as ammo against me when she doesn't get her way. I know whenever my husband and I do have a kid (we're planning to adopt in a couple years), the controlling and the guilting will get worse. 

I feel like I gave up so much to help my family. It took me an extra year to graduate college because I took time off to come back home and care for them. I passed up multiple job offers because they were out of state. And I don't resent having done that, but I resent being told I'm selfish and that I don't care about my family. 

Like I said, I'm working on getting an appointment with a professional because my anxiety has gotten out of hand. I don't cope well with my mother, and that's my fault for not setting boundaries early on. Today during my panic attack I managed to scratch up my arm without really realizing it. I worry that I'm a burden on my husband. He assures me that I'm not, but I know that my anxiety has an affect on him and stresses him out, and that's the last thing I want. So I try to limit what I vent to him. My friends are all very busy with their own lives and they all have their own problems, so I don't want to burden them with mine. So I thought maybe getting it all off my chest here would help until I can get in with a therapist. "

Now they are threatening to take the money for my tuition and go on a vacation, while also asking for money from me for the electric bill. Apparently I am ""a terrible son."" I am financially dependent on them and I don't know what to do. They are threatening to take away my keys to the car, which is the only way I can get to and from work. When I'm at home I just stay in my bedroom all day because I am afraid of being yelled at whenever I leave. I am almost 20 and I was so happy when I was away at college, so I was hoping to get a summer internship but  I wasn't able to get any offers.

I live in Poland and Im interning as a front end web developer, I'm not the best but I'm not bad, a solid junior. The rate for this position averages 2k - 3.5k (PLN). Before the internship started I told them I want to make 3.5k net. However during my internship the firm's BD guy quit, and I happen to be a ex buissnes developer with about 4  1/2 years of experience in the US/France, I have been doing it since I got my first job (I'm 23 now). 

I shuld also mention that I hold a dule US/Polish citizenship and I lived in the US my whole life, I moved to Poland because my wife got in to medical school in Kraków. Long story short my value on the polish market in BD is about 5-8k + commotion. 

I offered to help out with BD 1 month into my Internship and I quickly closed a few deals for them and with more in the pipeline. Obviously they are very happy. They gave me a sperate rate for when I do BD @35 an hour + 4%. 

However I'm not sure how to approach the salary negotiation, shuld I ask to be paid at my BD rate for everything I do including programming? Or should I ask for a hourly rate that come out to the 3.5k for my programming hours, and stick to the current arrangement for BD hours? I already made it clear that programming will be my main focus.

8vx86j,1,2018-07-03,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8vx86j/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
  
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
8vxh4p,184,2018-07-03,Titanbeard,StorytellerBox,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/8vxh4p/titanbeard/,"Now, I want you to picture the most typical and disgusting American stereotype possible. Imagine a person that's obese due to eating at McDonald's too often. Not only that, said person has a gun collection and extremely rude. That, was who Titanbeard was. I'll call Titanbeard T. 

I met T during an internship. All of the interns had to make introductions and that's when i saw T. He was HUGE from what I saw,at least 6ft with floppy arms, legs, and a massive belly. 
Not to mention his scraggly beard which he was waaay to proud of. To top it all off, he had shoulder length hair which looked like it was just dipped in grease. 

But, the real problems happened during lunch break. I was talking with the other interns when T interrupted our conversation. He said,  ""I didn't know you could speak english"". While looking at me straight in the eye. By the way, for context I am Asian. At first, I thought nothing of it. But then he immediately  continued, You should stop stealing American jobs and go back to China. Now, while I am ethnically Chinese, I wasn't born in China (I can barely speak Chinese). Luckily, one of my coworkers responded and said, ""T, that's just rude, you shouldn't say that."" 

T's response, was comical at best and disgusting at worst. He said ""You plebians could never understand my train of thought, it wasn't racist I was just stating facts."" Due note that up to this point nobody mentioned racism except T himself. After this I just asked everyone except T to move elsewhere and so we left T behind. While moving, I heard T scream, ""Typical, you people don't want to hear opposing opinions."" 

I had thought that this would be the worst thing about T, but no he never ceases to disappoint . During the internship, T would constantly brag about his gun collection and how it helped him in getting ""multiple girlfriends."" He also kept bragging about his sexlife (which I believe is nonexistent), things he would talk about include how descriptions of sex which were so comical you would only believe it if it was in a porno. Here's a taste of what he said,  ""So, I fucked this one chick so hard, slapped her in the ass repeatedly as well while she was calling me master the whole time."" Of course, no one believed him because well, you would need to have zero dignity to ever call T your ""master."" 
Coming from T, his stories sounded more like cries of desperation than bragging. 

And it gets worse. Eventually, my manager informed us that the company was hosting a welcome dinner for the interns. The restaurant that was chosen had a hefty discount for groups of 4. In total, we were 7 people so my manager asks if anyone wanted to bring an extra person. Nobody else offered so I asked if I could take my girlfriend, and my manager said yes. Shortly after, when everyone was leaving T came up to me for no reason. He said, ""there's no way you have a girlfriend, women would never date Asian men due to their tiny genitals."" I was silent, and left as if T had never said a word. I regretted not punching T in the face, but what's done is done. 

Eventually dinner came up. When me and my gf
arrived everyone was nice and polite. Most just asked about our relationship and our size. For context, I'm a short and skinny Asian dude with an girlfriend who is just as skinny but even shorter. Picture two twigs side by side and that's how I assume most people view me and my gf. It was all good until T showed up. When he saw my gf, he went straight to her, held her right hand and said, ""I find Asian women to be very attractive, why don't you come with me instead of him? I'm sure he doesn't satisfy your needs."" My gf was understandably confused and scared, so she shook T off and have me the  ""please help me"" look. I had enough  and said, ""T, stop hitting  on my gf in front of my face."" and before T could reply, my manager said, ""T, our company promotes respect as one of its core values and all employees must follow said values."" Fortunately, that was enough to stop T. 

For those of you who are disgusted by T, relax. Everyone except T was given a certificate and a letter of recommendation to another company.

I'm getting used to the city, it's not too alien since I'm from connecticut and go to college about 20 miles outside of the city. I'm very happy about breaking up w my ex because I realized after the fact that it wasn't healthy and caused a lot sexual issues that I'm currently trying to work through. I have a good amount of friends that are in or around the city, which means I should have a good social outlet but..here's the thing. 

I used to be a heavy introvert, but I think i'm changing drastically bc now whenever a friend doesn't respond or can't hang out my anxiety really goes up and I get very restless and I just feel a little crazy and manic. And I guess lonely? I've always been very self sustaining so i'm not really sure what lonely feels like. But being in the city makes it worse bc I see everyone around me going out and having fun with friends or partners and I feel like I'm missing out and it makes me so fucking sad. A theory I have is that bc I was constantly with my ex (like every day and night) I now don't know how to be alone and that makes me really scared, I hate the idea that I can't be independent bc I thought I was completely done with my heartbreak. And it makes me angry bc I don't want to be that affected by him bc I know I'm better without him. 

I also liked being an introvert, I miss feeling good about being alone, self-sufficient, mature. I try to go on walks or cook or just do something to take up my time after work but I just feel like these are supposed to be my peak years and I'm wasting them. 

I'm not really sure what I want out of posting this but I hoping maybe someone can give me some advice with any of the things I just mentioned or maybe if anyone else is going through this too we can empathize w each other ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
8vy0hr,2,2018-07-03,Am I (18F) not doing enough for my sister (23F)?,dumnoddle,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8vy0hr/am_i_18f_not_doing_enough_for_my_sister_23f/,"Hello!!

Just a year ago, my sister (23F) and I (18F) were best friends. We became really close sisters around five years ago and until a year ago, we were inseparable. One of the reasons we got along so well is because we have incredibly overbearing and restrictive parents. My parents aren't perfect and definitely could be considered narcissists, and my sister moved out because of that. I have admittedly been treated better than my parents all my life. Starting at a young age, my sister (let's call her Ava!) was sneaky. Ava was really bad at being sneaky and was caught in multiple lies (and it's mostly justified because my parents were strict and Ava didn't think she had any choice but to lie). I, in fear of being reprimanded the way Ava was, was more truthful and maybe even more complacent.

Ava kind of blindsided my parents with moving out; Ava asked my parents, ""what would you say if I moved out"" and considered that to be her notice, but one day, we came home and Ava moved all of her stuff into her car and left to move in with her boyfriend. For my old-fashioned immigrant parents, this was all unimaginable. Before she left, she told my parents she loved them and it was my understanding that Ava was upset things came to this and wished my parents were more understanding.

So Ava left and the two of us had a very teary goodbye because we both understood that I wouldn't be able to see her very often- my parents make it difficult for me to go out. I'm the kid who'll plan out the one day she'll have fun a month in advance and then wait another month for it to be appropriate for me to hang out with my friends again.

Throughout this, Ava and I would text each other and occasionally videochat. I 'dorm' at my college (which is pretty close to home). Dorming for me means staying at the dorms 2-3 nights a week and being home for the other days. When we communicated, Ava would ask me when I would go over to her house and in the span of six months, I had only been over to her place twice. This made Ava understandably angry, but from my point of view, I barely got to spend time with my friends and it was inconvenient getting to Ava. I also was not comfortable going to Ava's place because my mother told me that I could meet Ava outside of her home, but not in her home where her boyfriend also lived. I am also allergic to Ava's cat. I suggested alternative places to meet (like my dorm), but Ava never took me up on the offer. Whenever I did have a free day, I told Ava, but her schedule would not let me meet her. I have to work my schedule around my parents too, which makes weekends difficult, but the times I could see Ava, she told me that she had plans with her friends that day.

Ava and I did see each other a couple of times outside of her home- once right after work. We used to work (I had an internship) an avenue away from each other, but only met up twice. We went shopping together with her boyfriend and I once spent a day alone with her boyfriend while she was at work to show that I was making an effort to spend time with him.

I thought that Ava would be more understanding about my schedule because she grew up with my parents and knew how impossible it was to go out. When she went out, she only had to try to see her friends. I had to figure out how to be able to hang out with my friends and how to hang out with my sister.

During all of this, I would also update Ava about aspects of my life: my love life, school and she pretty much had an inventory of all of the items in my closet because I told her the smallest thing. Ava pretty much only reached out to me to send me a meme. I once confronted Ava about how her messages to me were extremely brief and how she never made an effort and she, after that, made more of an effort to facilitate conversations, but then went back to the brief messages. I tried never to breach the topic of my parents because I've been stuck in the middle of the sides, but Ava would randomly relate something I said to my parents and say something extremely negative about them.

We had relatives coming over and my parents asked me to ask Ava to come back home for some time because they didn't want word getting out that Ava moved out and in with her boyfriend. I've been painting Ava out to be a kid who felt abandoned by her parents and who wanted to have a good relationship with her parents. And up until having to ask her to come back, I genuinely did think that she wanted to have a relationship with my parents and having to tell my mom that Ava was not coming back simply because she did not want to come back was such a crushing moment.

I have asked Ava to visit (with permission from my mother) a couple of times and she would always consider it and then send me an extremely long response about why she shouldn't have to come back and why it was unhealthy for her to do so. The last time Ava and I talked, it was after I made one last plea to her to come back because my mother kept asking me to ask Ava. Ava came back with a very long message telling me that I was manipulative just like my parents and a shitty mediator and ultimately, a shitty sister. She kept repeating that I chose ""them""- my parents. I told Ava that she was a shitty sister too and she replied with the thumbs up sign. Half an hour later, I told her that she was not a shitty sister and that she just made me mad. She didn't respond and deactivated her facebook.

It is difficult for me to completely wrap my head around all of this because living with my parents for the past year, I just haven't found their behavior toxic. I've been slowly going out more (not at a normal level, but maybe that's more my fault than theirs) and they've been more reasonable. When my parents and I argue, they compromise and we have real conversations. Part of me feels like they've always been reasonable, but Ava always resorted to lying so I automatically assumed they were the problem. Now that Ava's been gone, our family has a lot of good moments. The other part of me thinks that I have just been blinded now that Ava is not home and here to point out any manipulative behavior that my parents are using or I've just become complacent.

Ava called me a shitty mediator, but she left no room for me to mediate. Any time any relative or my parents wanted to meet with her, she would automatically say no and say something about not wanting these people in her life. Was she always the unreasonable one or is my parents' behavior inexcusable and is she in the right?

Ava and I have not talked in a month now and it's been killing me. I will randomly break out into sobs because I miss her and my parents caught me for the first time today and comforted me. They told me that I can go see Ava even if it is in her home and my mom offered to call Ava and tell her how much I'm hurting, but I'm scared that Ava will see that as manipulative behavior, but also, it feels too little too late for me to start seeing her now. Another part of me is slightly relieved because talking to Ava meant having to listen to her shit on my parents and that always made me anxious.

There are so many details that I've had to gloss over because ahhhh this is so long- i'm sorry-, but am I in the wrong? Because I feel like I might be- when I talk to both sides, I'm constantly playing devil's advocated. I will defend Ava to my parents and defend my parents when talking to Ava or sometimes I'll be silent because it makes me so uncomfortable, but I am now realizing that sometimes people need to hear someone agree with them. i figured I would try to get one side to empathize with the other because I know how stubborn my family is, but that obviously has not work. I'm frustrated because I feel like Ava does not recognize my awkward position, but also because I feel like I am just trying to defend myself and might just be a shitty sister. This entire spiel is probably riddled with bias, but any input you have would be helpful. I'm just so torn and conflicted and sad.

tl;dr: my sister is not talking to me because I have not been more supportive of her. Am I the problem?"

8vyott,14,2018-07-04,Trying to figure out you Austrian men,Demuremiss,Austria,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austria/comments/8vyott/trying_to_figure_out_you_austrian_men/,"Servus lovely Austrian people!

This might trigger TLDR, but I am desperate enough for some insight or else I wouldn't be here...

A little background about myself: 
- Female
- Late 20s
- Hongkonger/Asian
- Multicultural background 

I've been to Vienna twice and have always thought its people were very nice (although I felt a few stares at times that made me feel a bit uncomfortable), unfortunately my stays were never long enough to allow me to befriend any locals.

However, during my last trip to Eastern Europe, I stayed at an airbnb and the guy staying across my room happened to be Austrian. He was very friendly. The first time I ran into him was on a Friday evening in the hallway when I came back from exploring the city (I had arrived earlier that day from a long haul flight). He politely introduced himself with a handshake and a smile. We talked for about 10 minutes and I took the chance to ask him what nice local places I should visit. He said X, Y, Z and casually said ""maybe I can show you around during the weekend"" and I said sure (brushing it off as it just being empty politeness). Towards the end of the conversation, he said that he was running late to meet up with a bunch of friends and asked if I wanted to come along. I kindly refused because I really was tired and needed some rest. 

I didn't see him all Saturday. Sunday morning, I was preparing tea and eating some fruits in the common kitchen. He came in, we were both still in our PJs and since I don't ever travel without my personal tea supply, I offered to make him a cup too. We chatted for almost 2hrs, everything from our upbringing, racism, politics, education and it all felt very natural.

I learned he was:
- University student
- early 20s
- from a small town about 1hr from Vienna
- grew up helping in the family business 
- doing an internship in the city we're currently at

He offered to show me around again and also explained that he had spent the whole Saturday sleeping in because he had too much to drink the other night. Said good thing you didn't come (cause he found out I don't drink) and said he doesn't like drinking too much either with a smirk (by Austrian standards I guess).

So we both go get ready to head out. When we do, it starts pouring and sought shelter from the rain in a random museum for a few hours (both paid for our own tickets). It was one of those interactive ones (targeted at kids), where you get to play with the displays. We both sucked at figuring out the puzzles and had a good laugh at ourselves.

When the sky cleared out, we headed into the city and he took me to sights I would have otherwise missed out on. For our late lunch, we went to this local restaurant, sat at the outdoor tables and we had a really nice meal. Silly me, I ordered fish thinking it would be fillet. When my dish came out as one big grilled fish, he saw me struggling with it and offered to debone it for me properly. Which was a really nice gesture in my head. (I offered to pay, since I really was grateful he spent the day sightseeing with me. Plus, he's a student and I am already working). Surprisingly, he was ok with that.

We walked around some more and spent the evening by a pond having some refreshments (he paid). And on our way back, we went separate ways since I had to shop for some warmer clothes and he said he would go for a run. Which was great, I thought that would be all for the day.

Two hours later, I am back at the apartment chilling in my own room. I hear a knock on my door and he says ""hey, you wanna go out for a drink, or some tea?"". A bit in disbelief, I carelessly asked ""again?"" Composed myself when I realized he meant it. ""Sure, give me a minute to fix myself"". And so we spent the evening chatting away some more at a half empty little bar. Me with my tea and he with his beer (his treat again). I think I caught him looking at me a few times... he mentioned I was the only Asian he had ever gotten to get to know and at this point I think I would have to be super dense to not suspect he was at least a tiny bit interested in me. On our way home, we walked closer together. But he didn't do anything. Not a thing. And I thought to myself: well, maybe I overthought and he really was a small town guy who really was simply curious about me being Asian - nothing else. Called it a night each at our doors.

Early next morning I would be heading to another town (but I was coming back in a week). He came out the door to say goodmorning (and goodbye, shirtless). Having grown up in a pretty macho society, I've been pretty spoiled. If a lady was carrying heavy luggage, any man would offer to help you carry it downstairs. He didn't. 

I went on my own journey and in the middle of the week, he texts me: ""if you ever need help with x in Austria, just write me :-)"". So I took the opportunity to ask if he'd like to hang out on Sunday when I'd be back in town since I didn't want to spend the day alone. He agreed. And on the day, he mentioned he would be with flatmate A &amp; B too. Which was a relief, since it that meant I didn't have to keep guessing at that point.

Fast forward a few months to Christmas, I had been back home for a while and was sending holiday greetings to some friends and family via whatsapp. We caught up a bit and told me he was also back to his hometown for a few weeks before heading to Q for Erasmus. And since one of my hobbies is writing old-fashioned letters &amp; sending holiday cards to my friends/family, I took the chance to ask him for his address so I could send one to him too. Ever since, we've been texting (we playfully call it ""spamming"" each other with pics of our lifes/travels). Sometimes everyday, sometimes once/twice a week. But regularly. We both tend to not reply immediately.

I have always thought it was purely platonic. Until an European friend on mine saw me texting him, asked about him and commented ""He definitely likes you, Austrian men don't text like that unless they do"". Which got me thinking again... Does he really?

I am much older than him (~7 years, does this age gap matter?). 
We're half a world apart (although I am aware distance has become quite irrelevant nowadays)
He just graduated (I have been working for 5+ years)
I would say he's quite sheltered (I remember one of his comments could have been interpreted as being outright racist if I were in the US and he did admit his family were just recently opening up to hiring black immigrants)

Since I have limited  experience with dating European men, let alone Austrians (you guys are a rare specimen)... 
Is he really interested in me? 
If so, how could I break out of this situation into possibly something more?
Would it be worthwhile to contemplate a relationship? 
At this point in my life, if it's not serious, I'd rather not get into any relationships and if I do explore that with him, I'm a bit concerned we will come across some potential difficulties since he comes from a traditional Austrian family that hasn't been exposed much to other cultures/races.

Can any kind soul shed some light on me please?

We were so excited for the trip and would talk about it constantly. During April a really good internship opportunity came up for me that reluctantly I agreed to take on. I know I made the right decision but I'm really wishing I made the wrong one. She left Monday morning and I've been handling it pretty badly.

She's my only close friend, the only one I can open up to, the only  one who touches me. Her leaving has made me realize just how overly attached I am. I'm just constantly wanting to talk to her on the phone, text her, talk about my feelings even though she's understandably trying to not use her phone as much while she's away. I feel really bad because especially today my sadness has been bringing her down and I really don't want that to be the case. I just don't have anyone else to confide in. I realized that for the next four weeks the only thing I have to look forward to is her coming back home, so I'm trying to think of fun things I can go do by myself. I'm having a hard time with that."

Disclaimer: I don't like either party. Each have parts I agree with and disagree with.

I'd like to reach out and check if there were any established groups already for helping his campaign here in Springfield.

Just noticed he was running on the Republican ticket this year vs Billy Long in the August *Republican Primary*. I think that's the absolute best chance for the 7th District to get a level headed Centrist into a deeply divisive and historically hard right leaning area of Missouri. I'm so tired of the political sports mentality and I feel like this is one of those real and few chances to be the change I want to see in the world. 

The turnout in midterm primaries pales in comparison to the General in November and the facts for SW Missouri is that DEM doesn't have a chance just by affiliation. It's a 7:1 difference. I think if most people took a look at his campaign you'd probably find more things in common with his stances and ideals than not and anyone who was going to vote Democratic in November anyways should definitely consider grabbing a Republican ticket in August. 

If you're interested in helping out as well - feel free to reach out to me and maybe we can start something up. 

Edit/Update: This post has only been up for a few days, but I feel like only having 30 days until the Primary we can't sit and wait. Hope in one hand, shit in the other yada yada. I am going to reach out to his Contact tab on [WEBSITE](https://jimevansforcongress.com/jim-evans/) and check there. I will just keep updating this thread as more comes in so check back if you're interested, on the fence, or a Congressman Long paid intern snooping. We're coming for you, Billy. 

Edit/Update: So Jim Evans has agreed to do an AMA on some Missouri-centric subreddits. Luckily he lives in our neighborhood so I may drag his ass over to my house and just start typing for him as the questions come in. We met him at a coffee shop and he's just a genuine, funny, old man that wants things to change.

We almost finish our internship with only one week left but just when we come back home today, we saw the message from airbnb demand us to leave within tomorrow afternoon. It is very surprise as the host normally talk to us very friendly but this time they not inform us and even refuse to talk to us.  

We talk to airbnb and they said that the host need to fix the house due to humidity issue and don’t want our livelihood to be bad. Well, now our livelihood is bad because we don’t have a place to live!

The funny thing is that the host came in two days ago and take the picture of the wall and everything that seem to have humidity issue(which I think they send this picture to airbnb)  but after that they fix everything so where is this humidity issue they talking about.

One thing that make me angry is that airbnb customer service said that the host already talk to us and why we still misunderstood the situation. As you know, the host didn’t talk to us and also lock the door the window and everything when this situation happen. We knock on the door and no response.

We decide to use airbnb chat and try to beg him to just extend one more day for us to get new place but after several hour they reply to us that  they don’t care and demand us to leave because they got a new reservation!

Can the owner even do this, justify themselves to kick us out and without even inform us. This make me feel very bad as for the whole trip we stayed here ,we are very friendly to them and we do everything they tell us to do. Don’t airbnb has any policy to protect customer when this situation happen. Maybe, just have a policy to give guest one or two days to acknowledge that cancellation will happen not just half a day."
8vzmp4,1,2018-07-04,Starting my marketing career &amp; I'm struggling to decide between 2 job offers- help!,Pros_and_Conns,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/8vzmp4/starting_my_marketing_career_im_struggling_to/,"Background: I graduated in Dec. 2017 and finished a 1 yr. marketing internship at a tech company in late May 2018. I received two job offers this week and cant decide . I currently live w/ my parents in a city a few hours from NY.

The first offer is an entry-level, associate job at a global CPG company in NYC and the second is an assistant marketing manager role at a regional healthcare company(10,000 employees) in my current city. 

I had my heart set on the CPG job, until I saw the salary was less than 45K (I realize I'm just starting out but thought it would be higher given the company, and cost of living in NY). The team is very friendly, has interesting projects and it seems like a great learning opportunity  that could pay off in the long run / boost my career prospects.

My second offer was completely unexpected and came a day after the first one. I know I would enjoy it and the salary is 15K more than the CPG job. However, I am nervous that that I will miss out on valuable experience for a short term salary boost, but it would give me more financial security, a lower cost of living, and provide more digital experience, which I wanted.

Essentially, I am very anxious about making the wrong decision. Both are great opportunities however, I'm struggling to put one ahead of the other and compare salary with long term potential. The idea of relocating and the high cost of living in NYC would be very difficult given the salary and I want to avoid debt, but also want the best opportunity for my future. I am unsure if the risk is worth the reward, or if there is even substantial long-term benefits. I appreciate any guidance or advice. Thanks!!"

Growing up, we moved around a lot due to my parents changing their jobs. This affected my college applications as my grades faltered due to the change in system. I went to an average uni, got an average job in CS.

My sister did exactly what I did but didn't repeat the mistakes, as I guided her through high school. I wrote her college essays, sat her through long night study sessions, and we got into a great Uni. I referred her to my compay,  my friends company and got her 2 internships. She was still slightly dependent on me and I wrote her mails, cover letters etc. during the interview process.

She lands a jon in the top 4 and as happy as I'm for her, I feel resentful. She earns 3x the amount that I do, gets paid for everything at work whereas I take my personal laptop. 

How do I deal with this in a mature manner?

What I'd like to ask of you, if you're willing, is to help me out and provide some information. This can be from where to look for housing to things I definitely need to try or see during my time in Gothenburg. I'd love to explore the city but I also want to hang out and meet people (other students maybe?) to make my time there more enjoyable and maybe make some friends along the way.

First things first, I'm gonna need a room to stay in. I have had some tips on where to look (facebook groups and [blocket.se](https://blocket.se/)) but I don't know if there are any others.

Are any of you familiar with Chalmers university and any student focused activities or maybe something for internationals to do? Otherwise, what are some good places to meet other people/students? any places in the city that are worthwhile checking out?

Let me start off by saying this is my first relationship. I'm shy, selfish, and a hardcore introvert. Any who, I've been in a long distance relationship with this girl for some a year and a half. She is loyal, sweet, and cute. At first I was hard core in love and only thought about her. Then after 2 months she moved in with me for the summer while I was on my internship. I'm not much of a people person and enjoy my time alone (it is the only way I can fully relax and recharge). However the summer was fine. I do think I became less sweet to her and such because I was taking her for granted or whatever. But I was working full time and taking calc. So I didn't have much of any free time. She was taking college algebra and had to drop it because she wasn't passing. I understood that it could be hard and that she might not have not understood it. But that was all she did. She didn't have a job, didn't clean the apartment and got to do anything she wanted all day. In the end I ended up paying her $20.00 a day to clean it so she could have some money. I did feel bad because she was bored all (it would have been a dream for me to stay home and do anything I wanted.). And I think she lost weight because she felt like she was eating my food. I told her she could have anything she wanted at the store. I just didn't want to have to eat out all the time. She would get some stuff at the store, but not a lot. I thought it was fine. We still did eat out every weekend 2-5 times ( which blew my mind that people did that.) Anyway it was fine.

Then college classes started back up and we both went to our colleges ( 2 hours apart). It was fine. I honestly barely talked to her during the day but every night we talked on the phone for 1-2 hours. Like there has never been a night that we haven't talked at least 30 minutes. I don't enjoy it much but she does. So that was fine. During winter break we both have a month off. I spent 5 days at my parents house and a week with her. A friend wanted me to come see him and I had talked to him in a few months so I did want to see him for two days. I asked her if I could see him and she got upset and said that I didn't like spending long amounts of time with her (which I guess is true. I didn't like spending over a week with her or anyone and nothing else to do). In the end she let me go but cried a lot and I felt super guilty. Then I spent time with him. At around 10:30pm she asked if I wanted to say goodnight and said yes. I tried to make it quick because I was at his house. So we talked for like 10 minutes. Then I went back and hung out with him. Then later she texted to see if I was still awake and said yes. She said she wanted the goodnight before I went to bed. I said okay I tell her before I go to bed. So around 1:30am we decided to go to bed I called her and she was upset that I waited so long. I felt so guilty that night I couldn't sleep. I ended up typing this not about how much of a baby she was for getting upset ( the note was just for me to vent.) Then later she found that note on my ipad that I let her have. It was very hateful and made her cry. She told her family about it and I felt embarrassed and so bad. I was having a hard time in classes and I just hurt my girlfriend bad. So that day I talked on the phone with her for probably 4 hours. Then I went to sleep and she tried to call me while I was asleep. My goes on do not disturb mode when I sleep so I didn't get it. So then she was very upset the next day by this time I didn't care anymore. I felt bad about the note, but not about not answering my phone. Before I meant her I was made sleep a priority and would go to bed around 9:30 and wake up at 6. I loved going to bed early and would only stay up occasily once a month or if I saw an old friend. However after I meant her I would go to bed around 1am - 2am talking to her. (in the beginning we talked for 4 hours minium a night). I told her that all the time, I would call her around 8pm and was hopping to get of the phone around 9ish but it would usually be 11. I don't have much to say tbh. She always wants to know about my day, but nothing really happens but she always has a problem or something great happened.

Fast forward to this summer I'm doing the same internship but she had to stay at her college town to work. I was kind of relieve at this. But this summer I'm taking Calc II and working full time. I work from 8-5 and have class 6pm-8pm and it's a 30 minute drive. So I'm really exhausted. I did it to myself with failing Calc II and having to retake it though. So we don't have much time to talk, I always have homework and such. I talk to her on my drive back and sometimes to class ( so 30minutes to an hour). She then wants to talk before I got to bed. So at 10:30pm I call her after my homework and I try to get her off the phone by 11pm which usually works. Then once she came on a week day to wait for me to get off work and was cleaning my house and found condoms (which were ours but she forgot). So then she went though my internet history. I clicked on a picture of a naked girl on the internet and you know what i did lol. But she found that and kept texting me at work and got so mad. Again she told her family that I jacked off and that really embarrassed me. She again forgave me after a while though.

I really just needed to vent and get this off my chest. Other things. I'm an atheist she's a christian. I don't want kids she does. I think I'm healthy I work out every weekday and I'm training for an ironman race. I'm pretty frugal and like improving myself. I'm pretty independent and like to do my own thing. Once I biked 125 miles one day and slept in the woods and biked back. I loved that. I had so much freedom. Now I could never do that. She would worry and want to talk the whole time. I do miss that. But when I was single. I always dreamed of having a girlfriend. I thought I would never get one I liked though. I would hook up with girls who I thought were attractive on tinder and that was nice. I miss that sometimes. Having no strings attached. Her and I met on tinder by the way ( we didn't have sex for a while though which i didn't mind) . I'm not very good at talking to girls so tinder makes it nicer. One more thing is I don't know what I want. I want to be single and just travel and do my own thing the rest of my life. Other times I want a relationship. I really just want a girlfriend I could talk to once a week or just spend every other weekend together.

So that's my story right now. If you made it this far thank you for reading all of this. Sorry for all the typos. I just needed someone to hear me.

TL;DR

I think I'm meant to be single. I'm too selfish to care 100&amp;#37; about my girlfriend."

I am a 24 y/o American female tho, org. from Virginia!

Does anyone want to meet at the SAN PEDRO SQUARE MARKET tonight for dinner and a beer or two? I think the Fireworks are somewhere near there but idk, haha.

I am in a relationship so I would prefer to meet with other women or a mixed group! Let me know if I can join!!

I am a little shy but I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone! This is the first July 4th I have been able to celebrate in the US for three years!!

I looked on meetup and the discord group but there wasn't really anything so I thought I could ask here."
8w2n9z,163,2018-07-04,Why the end of last episode was so beautiful,LilPotato911,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8w2n9z/why_the_end_of_last_episode_was_so_beautiful/,"And no, it wasn't *just* because of Tsuyu. 

Okay, it was.

But it's emblematic of why this show is so good at handling its characters despite having an Adventure Time-sized cast. Because most shows don't do ""nuance"" all that great in the character department. Even in the best of shows, characters are pretty clear cut in who they are and what they want. 

Don't mistake me, MHA does this quite shamelessly. But it gets away with it because these students clearly have more to than mere one-dimensional personalities. Even Mineta, who, for example, is actually quite clever and is slowly losing his instinctive ""flight"" response to danger. 

Of Class 1-A, Tsuyu is one of my favorite examples of this. I'd call her a secondary character, yet, despite not having a ton of screen time, Tsuyu's scenes have established the following: 

- She is a good at keeping a leveled head, likely due to practice in taking care of her younger siblings a lot of the time

- Blunt, because of her fixed expression 

- Vies for friendship, because she insists on everyone calling her ""Tsuyu"" instead of the more formal ""Asui."" This is definitely stemming from her nigh-friendless life before UA, which is implied to be because of her strange, ""emotionless"" demeanor - a fact Tsuyu isn't totally confident with sharing, or even acknowledging, which is totally understandable. But this is important because it tells me she's not the absolute cool, collected badass you initially think she is at the USJ. 

(In fact, even there when she asks Midoriya, ""Stop saying those things, you're freaking me out,"" outright tells us that she's doing everything she can to keep it together). 

So when I finally got around to watching the newest episode yesterday, I was blown away by this pleasant surprise at the end: a touching scene for Froppy. 

Quoting from what I said in a thread yesterday, Tsu felt terrible for two reasons.

First of all, what she said at the hospital was damn harsh: ""If you break the law, even to save your friend, you're still a criminal."" 

At the end of Episode 13, Tsuyu explains that she really didn't want to lay this truth. She was fully aware of the impact her words will have on the three boys most gearing up to go save Katsuki. But she said it anyway, because she didn't want any of her friends getting hurt.

Unlike Iida, however, Tsu didn't go the extra mile and make sure they didn't go. So now, the unofficial ""big sister"" of Class 1-A feels doubly bad for this; after hearing Aizawa reveal that they actually DID go to Kamino Ward, I believe Tsuyu can't help but dwell on what would have happened had everyone not come out in one piece. 

I imagine she'd shoulder the blame for not being courageous enough to stop Izuku and co. by force. But Tusyu believed that that was enough, which I don't believe myself; she's smart enough to know Midoriya or Kirishima were going to go if they were really determined. She knows of their drive. 

So, I think Tsuyu was afraid of losing her friends, and that's why she was afraid of pushing harder. She admits as much, but she doesn't blurt out her reasoning (thank God), since no one would be doing that in this situation - on a side note, thank you Horikoshi for making this such a nuanced scene. 

So, Tsuyu was consumed by a realistic but all around irrational fear. And because of that, I imagine she couldn't help but wonder about what would've happened to her friends had they not gotten out in one piece. She'd probably shoulder the blame, because Tsuyu is just like that and would thus feel ""responsible."" 

Not only that, but Tsuyu is filled with more shame and guilt because she thinks she *should* have done something more to stop them. Because this decision of her's contradicts the growth she achieved at her internship - that is to say, a hero has to do what is necessary, not what they themselves want to do. 

I'm willing to bet Tsuyu realized how hard she failed here, the poor baby. 

And it doesn't stop there. On top of all that, she shoulders the burden of everyone having nearly lost their future ""because of her."" Had All Might vs All for One not happened, Tsuyu would've been ""responsible"" for this, because she didn't push it.

All in all, an unspoken tension lingered between the students of 1-A because of this fiasco, and at the center of it, there was Tsuyu: sad, angry, scared, relieved. She couldn't even function with all these powerful emotions pulling her apart. She was too uncomfortable to approach anyone on her own, likely because Tsuyu was afraid everyone would hate her for bluntly speaking her mind/feelings. I'm sure in her head she really wanted to let them have it, but Tsuyu really didn't know what to do. She was afraid, and that fear locked up her insides and prevented her from being the collected badass we love her for. 

She hid away because of this, and it took Ochako to be the bridge between her and the Kamino group. When everyone was apologizing to her for making her feel this way - and, in my opinion, disregarding her feelings in the same way Iida asked of Izuku: ""Do you not care about how I feel?"" - Tsuyu looks stunned for a moment before she starts to outright bawl. 

In my opinion, she was relieved to have such great friends. "
8w2smt,0,2018-07-04,Great Apple Store Experience,themazuu,apple,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8w2smt/great_apple_store_experience/,"Just had this great experience in the Apple Store:

While getting my MacBook keyboard replaced (for free, yay!) an old couple (around 60-70 years) just bought a new iMac. 

The woman asked the Apple store employee if he could help her carry the iMac to the parking space (which is approximately a 5-10min walk)
The employee answered that they don’t usually do this, but because she asked so nice he could discuss this with his manager.

Not more than five minutes later, another employee (probably intern of some sort, he seemed quite young) got send to help her carry the iMac.

Long Story short: Apple‘s shopping experience is superb - as always!"
8w3me8,1,2018-07-04,I want a writing job that won’t make me hate my life,moodyspice,writing,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/8w3me8/i_want_a_writing_job_that_wont_make_me_hate_my/,"First of all, I just want to say that this is my first ever post on Reddit, and I have no experience with how this is supposed to go. Sorry if I’m doing it wrong, I will delete or edit it if necessary!

Ok, so I love writing. I’ve loved it since I first learned how to read and write. I always dreamed of writing as a career, but now that I’m an adult I feel very... jaded about it, I guess. All the jobs I see when I search for writing careers online are things like advertising, social media stuff, copywriting... and all these things just seem SO depressing to me; as depressing (or maybe even more depressing) than doing something unrelated to writing.

As I’ve grown up I’ve found that what I love most is... descriptive writing in general I guess (sorry if I’m not doing a good job of explaining or using the right phrases—writing has always been sort of intuitive for me and I’m not learned in the technical stuff at this point). I have started writing several stories (not really knowing where I’m going with them, maybe towards a novel?) but never finished them. I also loved it when in my high school English class, the teacher would give us five random words and have us craft a few creative paragraphs with them, and I would come up with super creative little stories, struggling to cram it all into the paper. Lastly, I’ve found (oddly enough) that I actually somewhat enjoy researching and writing essays, using sources like scientific articles etc. I’m sorry this is all very vague, I’m just trying to give a general idea of what I enjoy writing.

Are there any writing jobs out there where I could put this to good use? Or just any that lie outside the realm of advertising, copywriting, journalism, etc? I feel so defeated by the thought of waking up every day and doing work that I feel absolutely no affinity for, something I hate. I know, most people hate their jobs and I should just suck it up. I just find myself yearning for something more fulfilling or even simply more... bearable. I’ve been through some customer service jobs and they honestly made me want to die. I know that may sound melodramatic but I’m being serious. Social anxiety added to that a lot.

If it’s of relevance, I’m 20 credits away from getting my bachelor’s degree in anthropology. My school has an awesome creative writing program, but I let myself be convinced that it was impractical/worthless and would not only lack any benefit, but would actually set me back in life. Now I wish I hadn’t listened. But hopefully my major wouldn’t count against me after graduating if I want to have a writing career.

It would be really amazing to even find a writing-related internship or something along those lines, that I could get school credit for. I wouldn’t care in the slightest about it being unpaid. All I have left are electives, so it wouldn’t need to be related to my major. Regardless, it would help a ton just to know there’s some sort of good writing job to look forward to after graduating. I don’t care about money as long as I can scrape by. I’m having a really hard time even making it through the last credits of my degree because of lack of motivation for a future that seems so bleak to me. Despite college being so taxing on my mental health, graduating doesn’t even seem like a reward or a step forward.

Anyways, I guess this post is sort of a desperate last attempt to find even just some knowledge a job where I can wake up in the morning and not dread it. I’m sorry if it’s too long and rambly. I’m just searching for something that I have no idea how to find and am hoping against hope that someone might be able to point me in even the slightest right direction.



Tl;dr Basically I want a writing career outside of advertising, social media work or copywriting."
8w3qv5,0,2018-07-04,What should I do with my life?,AshamedCupcake,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8w3qv5/what_should_i_do_with_my_life/," I never knew what I should do with my life. I've always been ""smart"" and I graduated at the top of my class in high school, but I never had a specific career goal. Senior year of high school I decided I would study environmental engineering because I love (and was good at) math and I'm very passionate about the environment.

I just finished my first year of university and this summer I have an internship which is making me question everything. Now that I have some job experience and I have done hours and hours of research, enve sounds kind of terrible.

Environmental engineers seem to be way too specific, deal with waste management and regulations, and not really help the environment that much. I know it would be a better idea to major in civil and minor in enve but civil does not interest me much. I feel like I'm back at square one and I have no idea what to do with my life. I don't want to graduate late and I don't want to be stuck in a career but I'm very lost.

At my internship I'm jealous of all the people working in the business side of the company. It seems so much more glamorous (just by comparison to dealing with waste all day) and enjoyable. This, google, and some conversations have lead me to wondering if I should change my major to actuarial science. I know that actuaries make much more money, work way better hours, and apparently like their jobs more. I like interacting with people, business interests me, and I love math so it is a pretty appealing path. I also like that it's a liberal arts major with many gen eds instead of only engineering classes so I can learn about many different things.

I keep ""deciding"" that I'm going to change to actuarial science but whenever I feel like I'm there, I start to think about how much I care about the future of the planet. It seems to be the only career related thing that actually excites me, but at the end of the day I feel like if I work in enve I won't actually help the environment and I'll be stuck in a job where I can't advance. On the other hand, it's hard to get a job as an actuary and what if I can't pass the exams??

I know this post is literally all over the place but if anyone has any advice or experience in either field or just in general that would be great.

 If you are an environmental engineer or an actuary: do you like your job? How did you get there? Would you recommend this path to others?"

8w3z2z,10,2018-07-04,CS Questions from an Incoming Freshman,jkim545,UGA,https://www.reddit.com/r/UGA/comments/8w3z2z/cs_questions_from_an_incoming_freshman/," Hello. I'm new to reddit and to UGA. I have never taken any CS classes in high school, and I want to ask some questions about the CS program at UGA.

1) I really want to actively engage in computer science outside of classes whether that'd be joining a club like ACM or IEEE, learning a computer language, or getting a job related to CS. What do you recommend? 

2) I heard that the first language you learn in CS is Java, but I am currently learning Python because I heard that Python is much easier to learn and grasp. Are there any benefits to learning Python before classes begin in the fall?

3) Like I said in my intro, I have no experience with computer science, and I am worried that I will struggle with the new material. Are there any resources the freshmen can use for help like tutoring or review materials?

4) From previous posts, some people posted about doing side projects to enhance their resume for internships. What are these side projects? Are they given to you in class or something that you do on your own?

5) I know GT has really strong internship and co-op programs because of their really good programs, and I do know that UGA offers internship. Does UGA have a co-op program for CS and do big companies like Amazon and Google come to UGA?

6) Does anyone know a good seminar related to CS for the ""First Year Odyssey?""

7) Lastly, do you have general tips or advice for an incoming freshman majoring in CS like myself?"

I'm a Computer Science student at Carleton Unvieristy and have had a recent growing interest in the world of UX/UI design and research. I think it's such a great field and would be a fit for me because I love to create experiences and have technical skills. I've been trying to learn off online courses but some of it seems too general and/or too expensive to even start learning. I was hoping there are any UX/UI people willing to take in a intern to mentor from September. I was looking for a hands on learning experience, thus not looking for any pay. I know this is a long shot given I have zero experience, but I was keen on giving it a try. If there is any one in the Ottawa area (hopefully downtown) let me know!

Thanks"

He'd only fuck you with his tiny cock slowly, because he was afraid he'd hurt you. And blowing you or eating you out was a huge no no, he just thought it was disgusting. And fucking him? Please, what a joke. You needed something, someone more, and that's where I come in.

Who am I? The new intern at work, your younger neighbor, step son/son? I'm happy to play any role, as long as I get to steal you away. 


Hey there, for this roleplay, I'm looking for a lonely, maybe even depraved older woman. One of us would seduce the other, eventually leading to a relationship, cucking your husband in the process.


I think it would be fun to play with someone with few limits (mine are gore, sounding, and scat). As for my kinks, you can find most of them here

Some things I'd love to implement are definitely cucking the husband, maybe some force bi, dp, and lots of oral.

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this.

I'm currently a junior attending University of California - Santa  Barbara. For as long as I can remember, my grandparents have had a  vacation house here, located a couple miles away from the beach up in  some hills, mostly covered by trees. It still has a decent overlooking  view of the ocean, but it backs up to some woods. Anyways, I lived in  the dorms freshman year and then spent sophomore year in an apartment  with some buddies. 

For this upcoming year, I wanted a little more responsibility because  of a major internship I have lined up in the fall. Plus, I wanted to  show my parents I could handle my own. After asking my grandparents if  they had anyone living in the condo. My grandpa said, ""No, its been  empty for awhile and we never have the time to make it out there  anymore."" After hearing that, I inquired if I could move in and pay a  cheap but fair rent living by myself. At first, he hesitated then agreed  saying, ""That should be fine, but you have to be careful in that area.  I've heard a small Satanic group has broken into a few other homes in  that area and conducted some... rituals."" I remember laughing and  jokingly responding, ""This isn't the sixties Grandpa, Charles Manson has  been locked up for awhile and those groups don't exist anymore."" 

Last week, I finally moved in. The big brown cabin-style house was  exactly as I remembered, but definitely had some wear and tear  inflicted. On move-in day, I found that a window on the back door had  been broken but the door was still locked. After getting the rest of my  stuff in, I sorted out my boxes by room and planned on running to the  hardware store after seeing if the condo needed any additional work  done. After making a small list of house essentials as well, I was  sitting in my bedroom when I heard a bang outside, it startled me and  almost knocked the crucifix off the wall. 

Thinking nothing of it, I continued onto the store, gathered my  necessities, and quickly returned. Later that night, I was trying to  fall asleep and it proved difficult due to first night jitters (an eerie  sensation when you're spending your first night alone in a new place  and your imagination gets the best of you). Drifting in and out of  sleep, my eyes opened after hearing what I assumed to be the back door  closing. When I swung out of bed, I saw that the crucifix had been moved  to the center of the room, I tossed it up to being delirious and headed  downstairs to find an empty living room. After seeing nothing was  missing, it appeared no one was here either. The only thing that was out  of place was the back door being now somehow unlocked. Thinking I'm  tough, I opened the door and yelled, ""Great joke guys, you got me."" I  was under the impression it was probably some teenagers trying find some  trouble. 

After getting everything under order, I headed back upstairs to my  bedroom and saw it was around 3:15 am on my bed-stand clock. My mouth  dropped as soon as I entered the room, the crucifix I THOUGHT I imagined  being moved to middle of the room was now upside down, and appeared to  be screwed or dead-bolted in. Being too tired to deal with it but still  not wanting to look at an upside cross while trying to sleep, I covered  it with my Marilyn Monroe poster (which is a painting of her face with a  real emphasis on the big, red lips and luscious blonde hair). Unable to  fall asleep, I laid with my eyes open and they appeared to be fixated  on the Marilyn poster for the longest time. 

This is where it starts to get weird. Everyone I've told has said  this was a dream and not to worry. I swear I was awake but when I was  lying there, I was staring at the lips thinking, ""how scary would it be  if they moved."" Within 3 minutes of thinking that, the whiteness of her  teeth disappeared as her lips began to move and the face became somewhat  animated. The eyes slightly adjusted and were looking directly into  mine. The apple-red lips were moving but no words came out, only what  sounded like the hissing of a snake. It did this for a few minutes  before I jumped out of bed to find the painting had not changed at all.  Freaked out, I jumped in my car and took off to stay at a friends for  the rest of the night.

The following morning, I told him I was at a party close by and just  needed to crash. He accepted my story and I decided to head back to the  house. The backdoor was still locked and everything seemed to be in  place. When I entered my room, the Marilyn Monroe poster had been torn  off the wall and ripped to shreds and a red,messy pentagram was drawn  around the still upside down crucifix. At this point, I know someone  (possibly more) have been in my house. In disbelief, I go into my  bathroom to think and written with lipstick across the mirror was,  ""Prepare to see Lucifer.""

A few days pass and nothing happens so I'm starting to think I was  just apart of some fucked up joke. Then last night, I get home from work  to find the back door window broken again. It was too late to do  anything about it and after a long day, I just wanted to rest so I hop  in the shower. When I get out, there was more lipstick on the mirror but  no words this time, just the beginning of a line. I follow the line  along the walls and I see an arrowhead at the end of it pointing right  out my bedroom window. When I approach the glass and look down, there  are six purge-looking masked individuals all looking directly at me, all  pointing with the same hand at me (possibly behind me?). Immediately, I  locked my room and called the cops. When they finally arrived,  obviously the group had dispersed and were long gone. 

After all this trouble, is it still worth living here?? "

In that, I “graduated” from my therapist. I felt really good. The last 3 session where light and nothing bad was mentioned. My therapist was quite pleased where I was and I felt the best I felt in years. I hadn’t had any suicidal thoughts since mid February.

The first month of my internship went well. I was never in a major negative situations that would impact my mental health. However, my sleep quality had severely decreased and was getting less sleep because of how early I’m waking up. 

About two weeks ago I noticed the same symptoms of my depression starting back up. I started doing my normal routine of combating these thoughts. I began trying to get my sleep in order but failed night after night.

On Monday I woke up wishing I had killed myself. The entire day was just full of thoughts of death and knowing I wouldn’t ever get better. Thinking “why am I here” and “you’ll never get a job and you’ll continue to be a waste a space”. 

I feel defeated and sad. I really thought I could do this by myself and I feel I failed. My family was really happy to see me be done with therapy. I haven’t told my parents yet because they have been busy moving to a new state. I also feel like how can they help? 

I don’t know what I’m looking for, I just needed to vent. I’m just really sad because I though I could get more than a few months before having these thoughts again. "

I've been trying to learn off online courses but some of it seems too general and/or too expensive to even start learning. I was hoping there are any UX/UI people willing to take in a intern to mentor from September. I was looking for a hands on learning experience, thus not looking for any pay. I know this is a long shot given I have zero experience, but I was keen on giving it a try. If there is any one in the Ottawa area (hopefully downtown) let me know!

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

I knew moving home would be hard for a number of reasons. I went from a 4 year school where you live on campus to a commuter school. I knew it would be harder to meet people that way and that it WOULD be hard since it was hard enough at the 4 year school. 

But come, on! 1.5 years without a single new friend. I want to say it's not destroying me, but it is. I have social anxiety so I know that's a big part of it. But I have grown so much since I started therapy in college. It's a 180 where I am today versus then yet it sure doesn't feel like it in the friend department.

It used to be when I went to work or school that I would never talk to someone the entire day. I would go 9 hours without talking to anyone - be it co-workers or classmates. But after moving home I opened up a lot. I became chatty with my co-workers and we would give each other little gifts and exchanged numbers and would laugh. It was such a change. I felt like this was a huge step for me. But I switched jobs and I saw my co-workers once outside of work since then, but that was it. They might like my picture online or send me a snap every few months, but that's it. I can't break that invisible wall between work friends and real friends. It's devastating to me since I've come so far in being conversational and getting along with people I might not usually talk to. But I have few friends than ever. It just doesn't seem to add up.

I've really tried to put myself out there in other ways too. 

But another thing that sets me back is I don't drink or party or do drugs or anything like that. Which is an automatic turnoff to everyone my age.

So I was like fine, I'll try church groups. But it hasn't worked for me. Everyone already knows each other or everything is a happy hour. I'm really into poetry so I was like alright let's try poetry slams and groups but the people have honestly been awful. 

I had an internship group at school and we became very close. They pretty much know my life story and I was super open with them. We talked constantly. I wasn't the quiet one anymore. It felt liberating. But summer rolls around and no one is talking to me anymore. I've texted a few, only to have a few replies. I saw some of them got together without me. It's hard not to take personally. Like I FINALLY put myself out there and opened myself up, just to be rejected.

My therapist said my strength is perseverance, which I agree on. Every time I see her I tell her about some new weird event I  went to trying to meet people that ended up sucking majorly. But each time I do it over again. But I'm sick of it. I just want to stop caring. I want to be okay with being alone, but I just can't turn it off."

8w8eb9,0,2018-07-05,What's up with the hate for unpaid internships?,Subway_ajumma,sydney,https://www.reddit.com/r/sydney/comments/8w8eb9/whats_up_with_the_hate_for_unpaid_internships/,"There seems to be a lot of hate around here anytime anyone suggests an unpaid internship and I am curious why.

 Sydney is massively competitive for grad jobs / internships so it's pretty common for people to not receive any offers.


Now bear with me, I am a strong believer that internships are a great fallback plan if you fail to secure a paid internship during university. 


Why do I think unpaid internships are good? Well many moons ago when I was completing my Comp Sci degree, I, like many others, missed out on getting a prestigious internship in banking/consulting/tech.

Realizing this would severely hamper my chances of  securing a grad job, I reached out to some start ups seeing if they had anything going. 

I ended up securing an offer from a fintech start up who only had early stage VC funding (i.e fuck all) and said they would take me on but couldn't pay me. 

So for 6 months I worked 3 days a week unpaid whilst completing uni and would do my casual job after uni or work or weekends so I could live.  


Now what I learnt during those 3 months was more valuable than anything i'd learnt at university. I learnt how to write production code, fine tuned my python skills, learnt a metric tonne about finance and trading. I received mentoring and people took significant time to teach me things 
This to me was worth more money then anything.


Eventually when I applied for graduate positions, I received a truckload of offers with everyone interested about  my internship experience. I ended up going into trading earning 100k + pre bonus my first year


***TL;DR I think unpaid internships are good because Sydney is so competitive you need every leg up you can get. They teach you a bunch of shit you wouldn't otherwise learn and the experience is invaluable to securing a graduate job out of university***"

This was also during my last semester of university and hence I was really busy, and we only went on 4 dates. I had a few weeks between my graduation and when I had to start work so I ended up visiting Henrik in his home country (he is from somewhere incredibly beautiful that I have always wanted to visit.) While I was there we spent every minute together for the full 3 weeks. Usually after spending too much time with someone I need space, but this was not the case with Henrik. I liked him more and more each day. I am not back in the US and have started work, but Henrik and I video chat every day. Even several thousand miles away from him, he still makes me smile and my feelings for him grow. The thing is I'm not sure if this is too fast to be in love with someone. My last relationship (2 years ago) was 2 years long, and I have dated other guys, so this is not a case of me just being inexperienced and not knowing what love is. Also, I am not sure how to deal with being long distance with no end in sight to the distance (he cannot work here for visa reasons unless he is incredibly lucky and gets a greencard, and the work I do requires me to stay in the US). 

TLDR; Went on 4 dates with a guy over the course of 3 months and then visited him for 3 weeks in his home country. I think I am in love but am not sure if 3 weeks is too fast to be in love. Also, I'm not sure if it is crazy because there is no end in sight to the longdistance. "

In my point of view, hard labor will be replaced by combining good robotics system and AI control units. We should be aware of this but not afraid. Is it normal that in the XXI century some people are earning just enough to survive by doing hard labor, even if it causes physical injuries ? I don't think so.
We could be glad that the 4.0 industry will remove a lot of physical jobs as at the same time it will create tons of others. Maybe it is the time to rethink our society and our vision of work. 

Unemployment has to be redefined. In the north of Europe some people are talking about universal financial support. Maybe this is one way, the other way would be to develop training  for unskilled workers but we can't force someone to learn new aptitudes..

In the USA, Congress is very worried about work replacement due to AI. This replacement will definitely happen, same as in the early 1800 when industry revolution changed our society. We have to be prepared for this before it is too late.

One ethical system would be to give enough to everyone to be able to live decently without work and more to the one who are creating value. Would it be possible to implement such a system with automation of food supply, distribution and services ?
Some start-up in California are building autonomous farming robots and they can reduce environment impact (no need to use pesticides) as well as producing good food. This is one example of using in a good way robots and AI.

I dream of a world where you don't have to work but you can do whatever please your mind. Spiritual elevation, culture and happiness  should become at the center of our society. Automation and IA doesn't mean we can't be in control, we could have the better control on our environment and society than ever. 

On the other hand, from what I know of robotics systems, AI and governments behavior, I am very afraid of what people could do with such technologies. Robotic system are already able to track moving target, they are all based on stream of informations. Boston Dynamics is funded partially by the U.S army and this might lead to a very scary application of their robotics systems.
Same with behavior prediction, with the right learning everyone could become predictable and governments would be able to control most of us. They already have a gigantic database on more than 50 procent of people.

The problem will be to implement a new balance between control and freedom.

**TL,DR**: Got  denied by universtiy and fucked over by boss, contemplating drug addiction and suicide now.

To preface, I've been dealing with major depressive disorder my entire life (diagnosed at 6 years old) and am unable to persue a normal work as a result. I can only work 60-80% of a normal 40 hour week before feeling like blowing my brain out again.

Anyway I finally finished the school I hated last year and applied to an **amazing** universtiy of arts where I wanted to persue a career in filmmaking. Additionally I also got very lucky and landed an internship at a local TV station.

For the first time in my life I was truly *happy*. I could stand up in the morning without hating my life and everything that is coming to me that day.

But today it kinda all came crushing down. 

I had gotten a rejection from the university after getting invited for an interview a month prior. Not that big a deal, I'll try again next year and just work, I thought. 

On friday I sat down with my boss and explained my entire situation to her and she agreed to hire me at 80% even when I would have been willing to do 100% just to keep this job that did not make me feel like a piece of shit every day. I was so fucking happy coming out of that meeting.

Well I continued to work for the company this week, under the assumption I had gotten a full position. Until today, when my boss called me into her office and told me she would not be able to afford to hire me and that today was my last day. I and my colleagues were totally devastated and I dont really know what to do with my life now.

My current life plan is to finally get addicted to opiates and then kill myself once I can no longer support the addiction.

We had been broken up for 1 year, 8 months ago. We have been together for roughly 8 months now.

To hopefully make a long story short, I grew up in a household where my parents never drank. I never once saw alcohol in the house or even an event where they were drinking. I occasionally have a drink and will sometimes go to the bars with my buddies and girlfriend. We drink and have a great time while getting a good buzz/ almost drunk. When we are together this happens about once a month.

However, my girlfriend grew up in a house where her parents drink just about every night. Just the casual drink, nothing crazy. On some weekends, they head to the bars for more than just a casual drink. 

We’ve broken up in the past due to being immature and telling her she can’t drink at all. (Yes I now know this is stupid and it was 2-3 years ago) I’ve come to realize that for her to be happy and I to be happy together, there would need to be a compromise.

About 3 months ago we agreed on a compromise that she can drink whenever she wants as long as she doesn’t get super drunk. (I don’t know why I just don’t like seeing her like that. It really upsets me)

She’s currently in a different country doing an internship for another 45 days. She now doesn’t agree with this compromise and says that there shouldn’t be a compromise at all. She feels I am trying to control her by having a compromise. I told her that if she didn’t think the compromise was fair then we could change it to where both people are happy. She said that she should get to do what she wants and I should get to do what I want. 

I feel in order to make this relationship work we need to meet in the middle. That’s just me though. Is the compromise we had fair? Should we have a compromise at all? I’m open to some suggestions. Thanks for taking the time to read.

Should I apply for 2019 Match?",apollo_san,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/8wbdoc/residency_nonus_img_graduated_4_years_back/,"Hey guys. I need some reality check and confidence boost right now. This might take a while, there's a TLDR at the end. 

I finished Medical School in my home country in **late 2014**. I loved the science and the responsibility in medicine, but as it can be with some medical schools in the developing world, I did not find the environment to be very academically intriguing, instead focused on rote memorisation for exams and displays of seniority/hierarchy by faculty to the point of impeding interactive learning. I struggled in that system and did not score well, even though I was among the top students in high school. 

I am a c/o Hashimoto's Thyroiditis diagnosed when I was prepubescent (so are my Mom and Sister) and I take Thyroxine supplements daily. This might be related to it or not, I have had to battle depression/dysthymia for a while in my life (my Mom has been on SSRIs for 10+ years), when I was in school and after. **I also found out later that I was/am suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder** (which goes unnoticed and un-heeded around our place) about which I probably wont elaborate on, but suffice to say that today I am observant of that part of myself and have coping techniques in my arsenal to manage it.  

We had 1 year Internship at the end of our Medical Training, and it was then, being directly responsible for patient care, that I truly felt like I have an important and interesting job and I again immersed myself into medicine/learning. 

After med school had been over for a while, we had a humanitarian disaster around our place and volunteering for that made me question my life and my priorities and value my time with my family. I was in a ""gap year"" that is not vouched for by any of my professors, etc (I found out later that it is a common practice to have references for that). 

During the gap, I self-studied things that I could not study during medical school, things I felt I had missed out on (economics, little bit of dabbling into data analytics/coding, music - guitar, piano to name a few), especially because in our country with an undergraduate entry program for medicine, we do not get to explore interests and extra subjects/research like Premedical students typically can (if they want to) in the US. This I think is the beauty of US Medical training (and others with graduate entry programs). 

After my gap of about 1 year, I taught paramedics basic science subjects like anatomy, physiology, pathology for a couple months on contract. Later I worked as a primary care physician for a year in a remote location and then the odd housejob as a locum (sitting in for colleagues). 

I did not decide to give USMLE until the year 2017 when I was sure that I did not want to pursue residency options in my home country. Being an Asian, it was also not straightforward to convince my family that I wanted to try my luck far away from home and that took a while. The fact that I grew up watching quite a bit of Hollywood movies and TV shows and following the pop culture also drove me towards US rather than Europe. And the fact that I have decent written/spoken English proficiency already (was also the chief editor of my High School Magazine). 

I also felt that I needed to prove to myself that I got the medical degree (MBBS) I have not just as a technicality for passing/clearing through the years but that I could be globally competitive and a deserving medical graduate. So I decided to test the waters with Step 1. I gave it in November 2017 and scored **266**.

I have Step 2 CK scheduled in my home country for August 21st 2018 which will get my scores out by Sep 15th ERAS opening. 

I could not get better dates than October 25th 2018 for Step 2 CS which will hopefully get my scores out around mid-December. 

As an IMG, I have come to know that it is less than ideal to apply without ECFMG certification (i.e. Step 1, Step 2 CK &amp; CS, all done). 

I have no research publications to my name or any USCE/US LORS. I am yet to figure out how to get observerships in the US for LORs. 

I have some house-job/work experience and some teaching experience in my home country. I have some volunteering experience during disasters where we started a grassroots thing - no papers to verify this but a now defunct facebook page/group exists. 

I am sure **I want Internal Medicine for a pathway towards Critical Care** down the line. I was a tinkerer as a kid (still am) and I'm better than my peers in medicine with technology. I know now that the best option for my personality is Critical Care. I like the focus that this requires, and less number of patients. Looking at the patient from a systems perspective, with the help of machines, data, algorithms and scores. I also am good at arithmetic compared to many peers. 

What worries me now is that I'm very close to the 5 year cut off from graduation period. And my CV is lackluster compared to many peers who might apply with me, in terms of really noteworthy work/research/USCE. 

Also the fact that I wont have all parts of my Step 2 results sent to Programs I apply for until sometime in mid-December, by when presumably most IMG seats would be filled. 

I am also wondering about pre-match and SOAP which I know nothing about. Possible to get IM from those pathways? (Edit: I'm also very willing for research assistant position, research fellowship, etc to improve my CV if it helps)

**TLDR**: Non-US IMG, YOG 2014. Step 1 266 (Nov 2017). Some gap, some work/volunteer experience. No research publication or USCE/US-LORs. Step 2 CK approaching on Aug 21st.

We started dating after I'd been single for over a year after a bad, long off and on relationship. To be honest I think we mainly started dating because I was so depressed and lonely at the time. I had no one to hangout with, and no girls showed any interest in me, so when I noticed she liked me, we started seeing each other all the time. We had a few things in common, but I wasn't head over heels for her or anything.

After a few weeks I knew she wasn't totally right for me, but we kept dating, I guess just because I was still so lonely all the time, it was really nice just having a friend to hangout with.

Now she's been on a trip since the beginning of May to a country on the other side of the world, and she doesn't come back until the end of August. I tried so hard to break up with her before that, but things just kept getting in the way, and I couldn't figure out how to even do it. I feel like it would be wrong to break up with her while she's on her trip, but she's gone for so long. It's been driving me crazy for months and I can't string her on any longer.

8wbihn,5,2018-07-05,Best course of action for this type of web app?,loganbrand,bigdata,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigdata/comments/8wbihn/best_course_of_action_for_this_type_of_web_app/,"I am interning at a non-profit energy research center and I am trying to make a web app that connects researchers to a valuable, and decently sized dataset of approximately 3 billion points and roughly 100 gigs. I am very new to web app development and big data and I am looking for advice as to which path would be best to take given my situation. A few important pieces of information before I outline what I’ve tried so far: There is little to no budget for this project, so throwing money around at fancy services isn’t really an option, or at least shouldn’t be the first, but I am a student at an accredited university and my internship is at a non-profit operating out of a university, so I have access to educational discounts. Additionally, this non-profit has their own server I can host the web app on which will save some money. And lastly, my data is in three separate feather files, and the dataset is static and will remain so, which should make things significantly easier. The main problem is how can I create an app that has interactive visualizations from which researchers can draw insights, but is fast enough to provide a nice UX. I created a prototype Dash app with python and with a scaled down version of the dataset, but came to find out that deployment was harder than necessary. I tried using Heroku but my ""memory quota was vastly exceeded"". That led me to looking into outsourcing the data querying with Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift, but I got lost trying to determine which service was right for my situation since I’m so new to the field. I then tried to recreate the app with R and Shiny. After about a week of learning R, playing with Shiny apps, and trying to translate the old app, I realized I could practically do everything I needed to do for this project using Tableau and I wouldn’t have to learn a whole new language. I have only just begun looking into the Tableau option, but my timeline is shortening quickly and I can’t afford to spend many more weeks just figuring out the best path to take in a field saturated with a million different tools and services. So if you were able to understand my poorly written situation and are able to offer any insights/guidance, it would be much appreciated!"

I received an Internship in North York and due to that I will be moving to Toronto in September from Winnipeg (around the 5th, hopefully). I was looking at apartments for the last 3 weeks but every time I call up a place they would say ""we have August 1st availability but not September""... any reason why? When is a good time to look for September? 

I was interested in moving in the area around Yonge &amp; Finch, maybe Yonge, Doris and Finch that whole square of area!

Any tips for places to look? Websites? Agents? Etc.

Budget for rent: $1500 and less.

Thanks!"
8wcey9,1,2018-07-05,Best way to find Anxiety Dr (S.E. PA),Double_Minimum,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8wcey9/best_way_to_find_anxiety_dr_se_pa/,"So my primary care doctor is a turd.  I had gotten really sick, and over about 17 appointments (3 years?), I'm not sure he gave me one prescription.  And I'm not talking about opioids or the like. Also I saw interns like 12 of those times...

I had a good friend who offered to pay for me to see his Dr, a psychiatrist.  This man admitted on his first visit that he based his practice on medications.  I found it totally understandable, as a therapist can listen to your troubles, but a man with 40+ years can know you are depressed and how to help without really going into things too deeply.


This Doctor started prescribing me Xanax after a really bad car accident made me to scared to drive (it also made me practically unable to complete school, had to take time off, and it coincided with a bout of Mono (my second, much worse as an adult then first time).  The xanax worked great.  Life got better for a good bit

Fast forward two years and my brother dies.  The kind of death where I find him on my parents couch, am forced to do resuscitation by the 911 operator even though I knew it had been many hours since he must have died.  I then had the most useless cops try to grill me, that my brother must have overdosed (he was diabetic, and lazy, and this left scars).  They made a tough situation considerably worse.  I had to then walk back to my own house and tell a good friend (and father-ish figure) that my brother was dead.  That was hard, he just couldn't believe it.

I then had to call my parents, and my bro lived with my parents, and this was their first vacation in years. Imagine doing that...  He was 32, they claimed heart attack, I am almost positive it was sleep apnea/sleep positioning combined with overweight (but what do I know, I only saved his live twice with CPR before... same thing, just happened to be there by miracle).  

Then my father figure died.  He was very sick, but he started to get better.  I spent 12 hours a day as a nurse until he could do more on his own.  But I got to watch him die at the hospital (in the same way as my brothers best friend 2 years before), where a nurse comes around, says 'well how are things?', everyone looks at me, and I have to do what no one else can handle, which is say ""maybe we up the morphine"", and depending on their state, we do this until breathing stops (or in the case of my bros friend, he drowned in his own body).

A common theme has always been that people look to me to handle the tough situations.  My brother's best friend was taken out of a coma (we were told he was getting better), but the next day, after about an hour, I was brought out to talk to the family.  No ONE had told him he was dying.  Whelp, all look to me, I tried to be honest, but also told him hookers could be arranged, whatever he wanted, but he was not long for this world.  At my father-figures funeral, not a member of his family gave a Eulogy.   They love bitching about me, but seriously, if you are left millions, someone can stand up and say something.  


This brings me to my problem.  I was kicked out (lied to and illegally) of my apartment when my older friend died, and all my xanax was stuck in there.  I was lucky to find a doctor who saw me for free for several months (and got me out of that jam), but he ended up prescribing 8mg a day and in the form of 2mg Xanax bars.  The pharmacist just straight up refused to fill it after the second time (IMO, because the amount and the bars even I find shady, but I was never told WTF was up).  The doctor gave a short script of Ativan, but promised to meet with me for free until the whole Estate process finished.  Sadly, when I called, that changed, leaving me in a position with no meds (and I have suffered seizures before (including one at a hospital after surgery, guess they thought 7 days without meds was smart...).


I was somehow placed on medicaid two years back, although it actually makes sense now.  Using their phone help, I got info on clinics, etc, but essentially was told to go down the list calling and maybe one will have a psychiatrist .  

I can pay cash again, I just can't do it the way the system has it set up.   I know doctors are nervous about this stuff, and I know why.  But seizures suck.  But hw do I find a prescribing doctor without wasting a ton of money, making a bunch of appointments, all that crap.  I will be seeing a therapist/psychologist, but I need to at-least ween off these meds.  Google is great, but it really doesn't help me much with this. 



SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

SHORT VERSION:  Anyone know a cash accepting, quickly seeing doctor/psychiatrist in Philly, greater Philly area that will actually prescribe Benzos.  Xanax works best, Klonopin doesn't avoid panic attacks or help with them, and Ativan is like a joke, and gives me nightmares.  

I have Medicaid, but that system blows, and I would have to make likely 6 appointments before finding even a useful doctor.

I'm really at the end of a rope here, the system in place has gotten me addicted to a drug, then has treated me as an addict for not wanting to have a seizure...  imagine the extra anxiety there..."

I am a student of mathematics, and was considering studying in Spain for my master's. I have shortlisted some universities and program for the same if you could help me with the same .
1. University Carlos 3 Madrid : masters in big data and masters  statistics in data analysis.
2. University of Granada : masters in maths.
3. University of Barcelona: masters in maths and masters in finance and actuarial science.
4. University of polytechnic, Barcelona : masters in maths.
 
Any other good University in Spain for mathematics and data science you would suggest me.

My questions are:

Which one is good for my subject? Also which would cost me less on accommodation, living expenses front? One which would cost less?
Also after completing my education is there any chance of getting a good and decent internship/ job in Spain or it's tough and less paying there in Spain?
Thank you very much for helping me out."
8wcqtb,6,2018-07-05,"I really need a friend, but I can't be a good friend to anyone until I get my emotional health in order. This makes me really lonely. Big ole long vent.",IReallyNeedABuddy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8wcqtb/i_really_need_a_friend_but_i_cant_be_a_good/,"I need to get something bothering me off my chest, and its just been how the last few months have been. 

I don't have the money or time to get a therapist right now, as much as I need one. I spent 10 years getting abused or neglected, then 4 years in therapy 2x a month, and then January of 2018 I stopped going to a therapist cold turkey because I graduated college (go me!) so instead of potentially dipping into self medication with alcohol, self harm or food (or lack thereof), I'm going to blurt out how I feel anonymously on the internet until I can develop healthier coping mechanisms with a therapist. 

since January, its been a slow decline in my mental and emotional health. I put myself through school by myself since I had no family to help, and I was a basket-case coming in so by the time I graduated, I had two friends, at best, and a network of acquaintances I never got too close too for fear of fucking it up because I'm Too Much. 

I'm writing today because I'm at risk of plunging my husband and I into serious debt because I can't Get My shit Together and I can't do *that* until I fucking talk to someone (or something, like an empty web page). I'm at the library trying to focus my out of control ADHD to just do FIVE things that I've had two months to do, and each day feels more pressure-riffic than the last. 

Timeline:

January: Last month at first internship ever with a wonderful company. I miss them. 

February: First month of second internship at a huge international company, get hired same day, huge ego boost

March-April: slow spiral into depression because of horrible wedding planning and terrible familial relationships, performance slips at work. 

May: End of internship. I felt like I made no friends and I disappointed everyone. I don't even have anything in my portfolio, and what I could have posted I was ghosted on. I assume because of a social faux pas I made, but I can't figure which one it was that did me over. I got married, and the future was sort of bright. More family fighting because 50-somethings can't ever be mature when they don't get what they want, I guess. 

June and into July was a slow bleed of failing at my first big freelance contract, with the client just saying fuck it and hiring someone else. Husabnd and mentor agrees that the failure of the project is mostly the clients fault, but I still feel like a failure. The failure of these first ventures of my professional life really stung and, compiled with everything else from the wedding, overwhelmed me and put me through a stand still. I also considered a life changing career change on a recent camping trip that opened me up to the possibility that I don't HAVE to hate my job. 

since May, I've needed to update my resume from what I did at that huge internship, but I'm embarassed because it amounted to nothing. The manager at the job ignored my last email asking for her to send pictures of a project I had a part in, and I didn't know anyone else well enough to ask so I just never bothered.. bothering her again. I know the failures are my own and I know *why* I'm failing; years of being socially isolated and emotionally starved for a healthy relationship made me overemotional, overshare, and overkind into creepy territory (I assme), and even though I try to reign it in (hard coz of a diagnosis of severe ADHD-I and GAD) I still have moments where I mess up. I'm decent at my job and chosen college major, but as a person I'm a fucking wreck. 

\[MEGA TW- CHILD ABUsE\]

so all of this stuff is going on, and then- mother fucking curve ball- My mom calls me up yesterday and tells me that *my abuser was found dead in his apartment.* Like, okay. This guy beat the shit out of me. cps was useless after I went to school with a black hand print that covered my face and made my mouth and nose bleed. As an adult, I can't hear out of that ear well, which I attribute to him. He beat the shit out of my mom, and raped her constantly, but he didn't believe in birth control so anytime she fell pregnant he'd threaten to slit my throat in front of her, then kill her.  He starved us and stole all of my mom's money to fuel his cocaine habit. An eight year old shouldn't weigh 35 fucking pounds kind of starved. He was an animal abuser and killed my first pet by throwing it across the room because.. I don't know, I block out a lot of it. He had a hand in the most truamatic and formalitive years of my life, from 6-10. When I was 11, my dad got custody, but he didn't know how to deal with a fucked up child so he eventually sent me back to my mom after considering sending me to my grandmother in a third world country to deal with it. 

In the years afterward I dealt with minor emotional abuse and medical neglect, but it was nothin' like my abuser so I dealt with it. I knew mom was fucked up from that and her parents so I didn't care much what she did to me. But the thing is that one of the rapes resulted in my sister. An innocent baby girl was brought into this mess and I spent a decade hating her. 

we had a rough relationship. when she was born, she got all of the resources while my mom and I was ostracized from her family. we were all alone in the southwest and my little sister had an entire loving family with the dark secret, but my mother and I were acceptable causalities to the golden child's abuse. my god, I hated my sister. she grew up with all of the resources she needs to be successful. she's at a normal weight, shes well adjusted, she had childhood pets and friendships and family, and she even had a good relationship with god. There's something so... comforting about religion that I feel especially bitter that it was ripped away from me, because I cannot get over a god who is supposed to know all and love all let what happened happen to me and my mom. my atheism aside, I'm just enitrely fucking bitter at the stark difference between my sister and I

That is until I learned that she was getting abused too. she recently turned 15 and her family constantly berates her. My mom's mental illness has progressed into something ugly, like mother-gothel-in-rapunzel-ugly. my stepd dad is totally emotionally disengaged from his wife's bullshit and my sister has been minorly parentified because my mom can't function on her own, and sister really needed an adult that wasn't fucking crazy. I moved 3000 miles away from home for that purpose, even though I knew I hated her for bad reasons, but I knew eventually I would have to step in and say, ""Hey, My husband and I are functioning adults, let us help"" because there's no one in my sister's circle that can help. My therapist said I was putting myself- again- in the parents shoes because that's the role my mom put me in all my life, but, my god you just don't let a 15yo deal with this. so I tried doing sister-supportive things. I got to know my sister as a person instead of a kid. I discovered we both like makeup and she's incredibly smart, like myself, but on different schools of thought (think she's stem and I'm an art kid). she's got such a bright future ahead of her and I will move heaven and earth in a sister capacity to make sure she can do it. 

\[TW - DEATH\]

but then wednesday she and her grandmother opened her father's silent govt housing apartment and saw his feet on the floor, and piles of bloody tissues around while he was crawlign to his phone. He died. All alone, with severe health issues. In his last years of the ripe ole age of 39 he died all alone, everyone he ever loved dumping him because he was terrible, diabetes taking away everything he could do, having to take 15+ meds a day just to survive. But this man dropped 200 lbs when he finally got into rehab, and he commited to being the best dad he could be to my sister. And that's the man who died on wednesday. My sister was in hysterics, staring at his feet while her grandmother-- his mother-- begged her to call 911, and there's something so visceral to my 15yo sister sreaming into the void because the paramedics wouldn't tell her what was going on and that she was begging for a pulse- a sign that he was alive even though everyone knew he had been dead since at least monday. 

that boogeyman from my childhood died in a violent, profoundly lonely way, and while I feel a weird mix of nothing and deep, deep empathy for my sister, I feel so fucked up by this news. 

Like, how fucking fitting, right? The last reminder of the life I used to have died exactly in the way a lot of people on reddit dream their abusers die. But he WAsNT just some 2D child and wife beater with a coke habit. He was a loving dad that really tried, in his own shitty way, to be a good dad to my sister. Maybe I'm sad he couldn't live out his second chance through her. I'd be content to never see him again except for like, my sister's wedding or whatever, but he'll never be around again. My sister lost her father in such a traumatic way. 

I did my best to comfort her when I called; I gave her some self care tips, I told her death fucking sucks, people are gonna tell her to be strong and all of this shit- the unhelpful crap that people say- and I gave it to her straight. she was so relieved that she laughed through most of the call with me, other than telling me how she discovered upon his body. 

his death was a violent end to something dark I carried around that I didn't know I carried, and I don't know how to live in a world where the catalyst for the way I am is dead and how I can explain why I am this way even though the reason is gone. He was the last vestige of that bad time in my life, so for all intents and purposes, I should be able to pick myself up and deal with it

instead, I can't add four paragraphs to my resume, put together some pictures in a pdf, and update my resume, and the threat of debt or even homelessness hasn't been enough to stir me into fucking doing something. so I think word barfing into the void will help. Maybe. I don't know. 

I so desperately wish I could be 23 and have happy friendships like my ex-classmates do on instagram. I want so badly to be accpeted into a group where all I worried about was how much I spent at sephora or what my favorite starbucks frapp is. I'm friendly and I laugh infectioously and I'm a riot at parties- why can't THAT version of me be the permanent one instead of the mess I am all alone. Even my boogeyman under the bed is gone and its just me, with the demons inside of my head. 

If they aren't gone now, does this mean I'll never get better? should I just try to get a bullshit easy job in my field and quietly work away from anything I love in disgrace? thinking about job searching makes my heart ache and my blood pressure rise. I'm so goddamn paralyzed. 

I need a fucking therapist. "

Who knew huh? Hi there! So, introductions! I'm Rebecca, 19 and from the UK. I'm a mixed race girl with an Indian Mother and African Dad. I've got 32B breasts and long smooth legs.

Though you didn't come here to hear about me - you came for my idea.

So what is it?

Well it's a celeb scene if you couldn't tell haha. So, you're a celebrity. Someone big on the Hollywood scene. But behind closed doors - you're a massive pervert. So when you're in town for an interview and find yourself behind closed doors with a young intern well... You can't help but be a little handsy right?

My kinks are feet, tribbing, golden showers, clothed sex, spankings, mommy kinks, breastfeeding, public and forced orgasms. And leg grinding.

Limits are unnatural stuff like futa. Gore vore and blood. Along with anal and extreme pain. And shit.

8wcvzb,0,2018-07-05,Advice on my car situation?,ViciousGrick,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8wcvzb/advice_on_my_car_situation/,"Hi, all. Recently I have had some bad luck with cars, and I am trying to consider all the possibilities moving forward, and I would also like some advice/feedback on my current financial standing. 

Some info about me is that I:

 • am a 23yo university student about to start my final year of engineering in Ohio

 • have an internship that brings in about $650/week until Aug 17th (so I'll have 7 more weeks of getting paid at this rate, and then nothing as I won't be at work during the school year) 

 • have a bank balance of ~$6800 saved from previous jobs

  • have TransUnion and Equifax credit scores in the ""Excellent"" bracket

 • Essentially live at home, don't have to worry about rent/utilities, and I can walk/bike to class.

Expenses:

 • Monthly CC Payment of $49

 • Food and gas are the other big expenses, ~$300/mo. combined

  • ~$70/mo. in car insurance

Debts include my current CC and my student loans, but I won't worry about those until I graduate. 

Ideally, at the start of the semester (assuming no big purchases), I'll have ~$10000 in my account. 

In regards to the car situation, I have been in limbo for a month now. My daily driver was a 2002 Ford Taurus which had a transmission failure and was scrapped. 

A friend let me borrow their car for a week so I could get on my feet. Then my dad said that I could use his old car for a bit, but it ended up also having transmission problems and is now essentially undriveable.

Both cars (my car and my dad's) were well taken care of and had regular maintenance done on them, and I even did some small repairs myself to save money. It seemed like a freak accident, but I believe those models of Taurus were infamous for their unreliable transmissions which failed relatively early (mine was at 125000mi), and my dad's car had about 250,000mi on it, so he and I both realized it was on its way out anyways. 

So now I need to figure out what to do financially in regards to a car. I commute to my internship (~65mi away, one way) which seems like a lot but I honestly don't mind it. Unfortunately, any car I do get will get a decent amount of wear put on it as soon as I obtain it. 

I'll only be commuting this much until the end of my internship, which means that during my final year I'll just use my car for getting around town/occasional weekend trips.

However, since I am so close to graduating, I am entertaining the idea of getting something a bit nicer that will last me a few years into my first ""real"" engineering job rather than rolling up in a beater. It would also be nice to have something that can take me from Ohio to anywhere else if I happen to get a job outside of here. I also recently got my motorcycle license and would *like* to get a cheap, low cc bike to practice on/ride around town, but I understand that is totally a luxury. While technically possible, I am absolutely NOT confident in my abilities to only buy a motorcycle and commute on the freeway using that. 

So my ideas were to either:

• Finance a used car in the 8-15k range (with a sizeable down payment to reduce monthly cost) so I at least have a decent, semi-reliable car to get to work with, and then hopefully have it last at least another couple of years or so. I could also finance a decent pickup for moving a potential motorcycle around while I'm still learning. I understand there will be a decrease in fuel economy, but I don't mind paying for that. 

• OR buy another cheap car which may get beat up from the miles I'll be putting on it until the end of the summer. It also may not be as reliable and could cost more in repairs in the long run (especially in the winter, which can get fairly bad here and was a pain in the ass when I owned my Taurus, as a lot of those cheap plastic parts would crack from the cold, so I had to replace them)

I've never financed a car, so I'm not entirely sure if it's a smart move, but the added comfort (both of a nicer car and better reliability) makes it more enticing. I don't want to shoot myself in the foot somehow.

Any input on the situation or how I am doing overall?"

Because of this I wanted to visit my Nmom's family (they live 5 hours away) since I know that I won't be seeing them any time soon, and my grandma and grandpa might die before I get back to the states. This has caused the latest of many fights with my Nmom. I have an internship this summer and so I don't have a lot of time off to visit my relatives, so I have to visit them on a weekend. I have asked my Nmom to drive me one weekend since May and she has always said no, but for no real reason. Fast forward to yesterday, my birthday, when I ask her one last time. I expressed how much this meant to me and how she was my only way of getting there (I don't have a car I can take and the train would cause me to miss a day of work and lose out on the money) and she still said no, and something in me snapped. I just couldn't believe that she wouldn't do something this simple when I have asked her for nothing recently and I just started crying. I just went off on her about how I just wanted to see my family and how much this was hurting me and she was saying that this is all my fault because if I wanted to go I could take the train. She also called my grandma and forced me to talk to her even though I said I did not want to talk to her. Then the real kicker was at the end of the conversation when she told me that she loved me and she wished me a happy birthday, the woman who made me cry for 30+ minutes wanted me to have a happy birthday as if she didn't just ruin it. I decided that I was not going to stay at her house next week and stay with my dad instead, but later that night my little brother told me about how she was crying to him about this situation and I know that I did nothing wrong, but I still feel guilty. I don't know how to stop falling for her minipulation tactics, especially since I know I am not going to see her for 27 months. This has been going on my entire life and she always makes me feel guilty when I know I didn't do anything, what do I do?"

I know it’s just an 6-month internship and not like I will 100% work at this company, after this internship but its definitely a huge step forward to fulfil my dream 

I don’t have much money, that’s why I can’t treat myself with something like legit Balenciaga or SLP

I can’t decide between these things:

A) Legit The North Face Nuptse in a Fire colorway
B) Some Fire high quality reps
C) Any recommendation from you guys?

I'm doing a 5 year degree, and honestly being home over summer has just been so boring. I do work but the hours are limited by necessity (I work with kids so its only really from 4-8pm until schools break up, and thats only 3 /4 times a week at most).

I had 2 groups of friends at school/6th form, the nerdy group I did my subjects with (I'm a Physics student),and the ""lads"" I played football and went drinking with. I've fallen away from the ""lads"" group over the past 3 years as tbh I've matured as a person and actually find a lot of the shit I used to do/say with them pretty distateful. As its the end of my 3rd year, most of my friends from the ""nerd"" group are all starting jobs/internships as they've graduated and so they're not really free to hang out with that often.

Most of my Uni friends live far away, those who don't have graduated and are doing long internships (12+ hours a day at investment bank sort of things) and the like so have no real time to go out either.

So yeah, I'm lucky if I can manage to do 2 things a week with any of my friends.

Idk where this post is going, but its starting to get me down. I guess its real life getting in the way of stuff and nothing to do with me, but its pretty depressing to go from having a decently big group of friends at uni where I could do stuff every day if I wanted to to being lucky to do something once a week.

 Anyone else feel like this? Any ideas to help get over this feeling?

At one point I remember one of the guys (I think it was Bruce but this was a while back) saying something  that if you wanted to work as a YouTuber, why aren’t you already on YouTube. For some reason it finally clicked to me that I shouldn’t just sit around and wait for someone to hire me and that that really wasn’t a realistic expectation. 

So I started my own channel with a couple friends. 

That channel very recently hit 3,000 subs and while that’s not a ton by any stretch of the imagination, it’s far more than I ever thought I’d actually get on my own.  It’s also helped me get an internship back in college and even the (kind of) editor position I have now. 

So thank you Funhaus for finally getting it through to me that I actually need to get out and work in order to reach my goals.

8wegqa,97,2018-07-05,I got suckered into buying a MLM product yesterday because I didn't realize it was.,punkpixz,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8wegqa/i_got_suckered_into_buying_a_mlm_product/,"So, yesterday, while I was fighting with my nearly one year old daughter to get down for a nap I get this knock on the door. I'm frazzled, sleep deprived, and stressed out but I answer because I am polite. It's a college student who has apparently been by already and spoken to my husband (she used his name) who told her to come back later. Well, she did, and that later happened to be when I was home alone with baby. She is wanting to sit down with us (Or rather just me since I am home alone) and talk about educational books/program/app stuff she is selling.

So, I let her in. Again, I plead insanity due to sleep deprivation and baby frustration. She doesn't have the usual lines I am used to for MLMs. Shes talks about being up here selling this stuff as part of an internship. The books actually look kind of cool. There were of course some warning signs that I just didn't catch on because I am not good at telling people no when they are being super duper pushy but in a kind of hidden way. The girl was also super bubblying and friendly and I liked that. 

But anyway. Some of the clues I should have listened to:

1) Told me she has to do 35 sitdowns a day to meet her quotas

2) Talked about how books like those are like ""$50 in the store"" (they absolutely are not)

3) Made a comment about how she couldn't come back later when I had a chance to talk it over with my husband because she has other people she needs to meet with and it was a take it or leave it once in a life time chance (Okay that last part wasn't the exact wording she used but that was the message)

4) When I tried to say I didn't think so, she kept pushing on why I didn't want to while also saying at the same time ""that it was cool if I declined it was fine"")

5) If I so much as attempted to use my phone for something (I had to respond to a text from my husband and then I was going to do some basics about the company she said she worked for) she basically gained my attention back and discouraged me from using it. Like I was ignoring her for looking at my phone for two seconds or something.

6) Talked about how she had to order the books and any check or cash went directly to her. 

7) She kept using my daughter as a distraction tool if I started saying how I didn't think I was interested at this time. ""Oh, question, why do you think education is important for your daughters future?"" Like I don't know, she's one, I don't want her to grow up to be an illerate? What kind of question is that even......Basically anytime my attention or disinterest started showing she asked me some rando question like that. She also wanted to know how I balance work and having a baby, if I read regularly to baby, if being a parent was hard, and what kind of future did I hope for baby. 

So, due to all the pressure, the sleep deprivation, actually thinking the books look cool I ordered some. Then about a half an hour later I seemed to come to my sense and did some research. 

  
She was ""interning"" (that is literally what she called it) for Southwestern Advantage. Which is in fact an MLM. I already canceled my order. And also put a stop on the check just in case. Next time I am hoping I don't get fooled. "

I'm a college student, and I'm currently working for the summer as an intern. I'm a computer science major, and in my free time I enjoy computers, pc games, and hanging out with friends. 

Kink wise ,I'm a switch. I'm pretty inexperienced as a dom. I do, however, have experience as a sub so I'm not completely flying blind here. I think it's good to have the perspective of having been a sub for being a dom. My favorite kinks are body worship, tease/denial, and some bondage. I also really like aftercare, I think it's important. I'm not comfortable with or looking for any watersports, scat play, or any pain that leaves a really lasting mark (like cuts or bruises). That being said, I'm very open to trying new kinks so as long as it's not one of those few I'm game to try! Obviously I will respect any and all limits you have.

I'm looking for a submissive girl in the Boston area. You don't have to be in the city itself (I'm not). I'd really like to get to know you, your kinks, and have a friendship outside of kink as well. It would be nice to start online (preferably with kik) to get to know each other, then meet up once we're comfortable! If this sounds interesting at all to you send me a pm with a bit about yourself (and maybe a picture?) . I'd love to chat!"

I (M21) have been a bit frustrated with dating in my age group. I'm a university student going into senior year in east coast USA and I've been single for most of my time studying. However, this has been by choice mostly because it seems like women (this sentiment also applies to many men at this age I know as well) within the undergrad college age group (18-22) have no idea what they want out of a relationship and typically have no plans for the future. As a result, I have a hard time finding myself attracted to someone who isn't mature enough to take their future seriously and get their life together.

Since university is ending in a year I'm trying to position myself for long term success by building my career (currently working an unpaid tech internship alongside my paid tech job for my university) and planning out my future after I graduate. Ideally I'd like a partner who has similar priorities to grow together with. However, although I'm sure there are many of those kinds of people out there the majority of women I've met/dated in college don't seem to take their future/relationships seriously and have very little knowledge of the real world and lofty career aspirations. 

I'm not trying to sound condescending here, as I believe everyone has their own path in life but some take longer to find it than others. I've dated around enough to know what I'm looking for in a partner and out of a relationship, so I guess my qualms come from having developed a strong sense of self and future and not meeting anyone else who really feels the same or prioritizes those two things as well.

I suppose my overall questions for you guys is: am I putting too much emphasis on people having their crap together while dating at my age? Or is it okay to excuse it more than I do because a lot of people are still finding themselves around my age and it'll come with time if I meet the right person? When do people usually begin getting their life together?

Thanks in advance everybody, I hope I didn't come off as some kind of know it all. "

My goal here is to hopefully receive some good advice on the situation and what to do next.

A brief overview of where we are in life:

Wife - healthcare professional in the military who just finished a 1 year post grad residency, currently in another state and will be moving to a new state for a 3 year tour that is 2 hours away from my current location. She will be alone, away from friends and family, and likely want to hang out with me again.

Me - medical resident that just finished my internship year (first year out of med school) and moved to a new state to start a 3 year residency.

Us - dated for 4.5 years before getting married, lived together for 2 years, have always had each other's backs and been best friends. Never really heavy drinkers except for undergrad.

The situation: (it's long and includes maybe 50&amp;#37; of what happened)

About 7 months ago I started to notice changes in my wife's behavior, I wasn't really sure what it was at the time but something was off. One of the first times I knew something wasn't right was when we went on a ski trip to the mountains with some of my wife's resident friends. During our first night there we were all sitting around a table drinking. My wife was sitting on a bench seat next to - let's call him Alex - and I was sitting at the end of the table. Throughout the night my wife pretty much ignored me all the while she and Alex were getting along almost a little too well. Poking, flirty behavior, whispering things into each other's ears, etc. The real kicker came when he put his hand on her thigh and she didn't brush it away. I lost it and drank heavily and passed out upstairs. The weekend continued and my wife proceeded to drink with Alex (not married) and a major character to the story - let's call him John (married). We ended up cutting the long weekend short and on the drive back my wife proceeds to tell me how John is so much fun to drink with and that I'm not. She says that she no longer finds me physically attractive and that my behavior has changed a lot since I started my medical internship. I'm obviously crushed and in an attempt to repair things go to two counseling sessions (this is all I could do before my schedule picked back up - 26 days on 4 days off) by myself to figure out what I did wrong. My wife repeatedly says she'll go to a counselor too but wouldn't know what to talk about because there's nothing to fix.

Fast forward a couple months and my wife and I have an opportunity to go to one of my friend's birthday party. I tell my wife about it a week before, and the day before making plans to get dinner before we go and that the latest we could leave was 7pm. The day off I have a cancellation in my schedule and I'm able to go home so I can pick her up early. She tells me that her commander is taking the squad out for drinks after giving presentations all day. I get home at 5 and wait 2 hours before she gets home just before 7. She tells me how she only had ""2 beers"" but she ""shouldn't have been driving"" because she was ""swerving on the road."" Naturally I'm upset because I was 10 min away and could have easily picked her up. She gets mad and tells me that she ""is not going to tell me things anymore because I always get upset"" and ""she'd rather drink with her friends because mine are boring."" I'm upset but decided to go to the bday party and she goes drinking with John and friends.

The day after I sit her down and have a conversation about things that have been going on. These conversations rarely last 10 min because she doesn't like talking about things. I end up asking her if she has feelings for John, that are ""more than a friend"" and she looks at me and then looks away without saying anything. I take that as a yes (which I say out loud). I then ask her if she finds him physically attractive - she says yes and mutters a few things to downplay it. At this point I'm freaked out and think this is why she's been acting so weird.

A few weeks later my wife leaves to go to a 1 week long conference with John and her other resident friends. She downplays the event saying she doesn't even know if she's going out at all because it's going to be long lectures. Each resident gets their own private hotel room. The first night there she goes out and ""forgets"" to text me for 6 hours. All the while I can see the credit card reports from various bars adding up and her location - which at one point is in a hospital. When she gets back to her hotel at 1:30am she finally calls me hammered drunk and I'm upset. The week goes on and she does this every night. My mind is in overdrive as she fails to text or call me to let me know what's up. I feel disconnected and confused. I call her mom and explain everything that is going on to try to gain some clarity. Wife's mom says she hasn't talked to her at all (this was a lie she talked to her that morning) but proceeds to brush all of the concerns off and downplay everything (including the feelings for John). When my wife gets back we talk and I actually break through and we have a moment together talking about our feelings.

Speed forward another month. I find that my wife is snap chatting John a lot - like a lot. I ask her if she would mind not snapping him, to which she ""promises to not snap him anymore."" This makes me happy as I feel like he could be the crux of the problem here. As the weeks go by our relationship continues to degrade. I had been looking for marriage counselors for months (she looked for none) that would fit our schedule. I finally find a match and we go. Lots of stuff is said but the biggest part is when the marriage counselor asks my wife how important marriage is to her. She responds ""uhhhhh....important?"" I'm crushed as marriage is more important to me than my career, money, etc.

A few weeks later it's the night before I leave to drive to my new state to start my residency program. I see her snap chatting and think I see John's name. I look at her phone and realize they are #1 best friends which means they are snapping each other the most. I ask her about it and she gets a big smile and says yes she had been snapping him (obviously). I asked her about the promise and she doesn't have an answer. I leave the next morning crushed this is the note we end on. She leaves for work and I cry hard at home, thinking about everything.

A few days later I text her to revist the snapchat thing with John. She says that she can't promise she won't snap him (because they are friends and it would be weird to just stop) but she will make it ""few and far between."" I figure this is reasonable and agree. I'm super busy in my new residency orientation all week and it flies by. I have a great time and meet lots of new people, which is nice because I didn't have a lot of time to hang out during my internship year. Saturday rolls around and I finally have a chance to start setting up my apartment. My wife texts me some rude thing about my snapchat story and then says she's going to her friends bday party. I figure I need to give her space and she doesn't contact me for 12 hours. I finally decide to send her a text and check her location. I realize she's in a new apartment that neither of us have been to. It turns out she was blackout drunk and at Alex's apartment and luckily his girlfriend was there too. I call her and we talk for a whole 5 seconds before she passes out and hangs up - a conversation she does not recall the next day. I'm furious as this is the exact behavior I've been upset about for months. The next day I text my wife a little bit but keep it light. Things improve that day until the groundbreaker. I ask her how the snapping thing with John is going and she replies that she has not snapped him ""at all."" Through the snapchat emojis I realize that she's lying to me and I confront her. She sends me a cropped screenshot of her snapchat but refuses to send me anything else stating I'm making her ""jump through hoops."" I'm absolutely done at this point.

That night I call her to tell her that the way she acts and how it makes me feel is devastating. I'm constantly worried about her drinking, lying, and interactions with John and that I don't want to be with someone that does these things. She's surprised but says she ""can't change"" and thinks there's a lot of things going on right now. We agree to take a week long break and talk the following Sunday.

It's been 4 days now and I've received a lot of advice from friends and family. Their reactions are all the same when I talk about everything that has been going on. I'm not sure if she even wants to work this out and at this point I'm not sure I want to be with someone that acts the way she does. She never used to act like this at all and I can't pinpoint what happened - and probably never will. I'm somewhat relieved but also sad because we had so much planned together and had always been good before. My feelings now are that I'm tired of being worried and trying to fix our relationship single handedly and I am fully prepared to walk away from this.

TLDR: my wife has been acting crazy going out drinking, lying to me, and generally being a selfish person. I've had enough and we are considering divorce after being married for 1.5 years.

I would like any and all thoughts and advice. How to approach the situation and what I might need to do next.

One of the first times I knew something wasn't right was when we went on a ski trip to the mountains with some of my wife's resident friends. During our first night there we were all sitting around a table drinking. My wife was sitting on a bench seat next to - let's call him Alex - and I was sitting at the end of the table. Throughout the night my wife pretty much ignored me all the while she and Alex were getting along almost a little too well. Poking, flirty behavior, whispering things into each other's ears, etc. The real kicker came when he put his hand on her thigh and she didn't brush it away. I lost it and drank heavily and passed out upstairs. The weekend continued and my wife proceeded to drink with Alex (not married) and a major character to the story - let's call him John (married). We ended up cutting the long weekend short and on the drive back my wife proceeds to tell me how John is so much fun to drink with and that I'm not. She says that she no longer finds me physically attractive and that my behavior has changed a lot since I started my medical internship. I'm obviously crushed and in an attempt to repair things go to two counseling sessions (this is all I could do before my schedule picked back up - 26 days on 4 days off) by myself to figure out what I did wrong. My wife repeatedly says she'll go to a counselor too but wouldn't know what to talk about because there's nothing to fix.

Fast forward a couple months and my wife and I have an opportunity to go to one of my friend's birthday party. I tell my wife about it a week before, and the day before making plans to get dinner before we go and that the latest we could leave was 7pm. The day off I have a cancellation in my schedule and I'm able to go home so I can pick her up early. She tells me that her commander is taking the squad out for drinks after giving presentations all day. I get home at 5 and wait 2 hours before she gets home just before 7. She tells me how she only had ""2 beers"" but she ""shouldn't have been driving"" because she was ""swerving on the road."" Naturally I'm upset because I was 10 min away and could have easily picked her up. She gets mad and tells me that she ""is not going to tell me things anymore because I always get upset"" and ""she'd rather drink with her friends because mine are boring."" I'm upset but decided to go to the bday party and she goes drinking with John and friends.

The day after I sit her down and have a conversation about things that have been going on. These conversations rarely last 10 min because she doesn't like talking about things. I end up asking her if she has feelings for John, that are ""more than a friend"" and she looks at me and then looks away without saying anything. I take that as a yes (which I say out loud). I then ask her if she finds him physically attractive - she says yes and mutters a few things to downplay it. At this point I'm freaked out and think this is why she's been acting so weird.

A few weeks later my wife leaves to go to a 1 week long conference with John and her other resident friends. She downplays the event saying she doesn't even know if she's going out at all because it's going to be long lectures. Each resident gets their own private hotel room. The first night there she goes out and ""forgets"" to text me for 6 hours. All the while I can see the credit card reports from various bars adding up and her location - which at one point is in a hospital. When she gets back to her hotel at 1:30am she finally calls me hammered drunk and I'm upset. The week goes on and she does this every night. My mind is in overdrive as she fails to text or call me to let me know what's up. I feel disconnected and confused. I call her mom and explain everything that is going on to try to gain some clarity. Wife's mom says she hasn't talked to her at all (this was a lie she talked to her that morning) but proceeds to brush all of the concerns off and downplay everything (including the feelings for John). When my wife gets back we talk and I actually break through and we have a moment together talking about our feelings.

Speed forward another month. I find that my wife is snap chatting John a lot - like a lot. I ask her if she would mind not snapping him, to which she ""promises to not snap him anymore."" This makes me happy as I feel like he could be the crux of the problem here. As the weeks go by our relationship continues to degrade. I had been looking for marriage counselors for months (she looked for none) that would fit our schedule. I finally find a match and we go. Lots of stuff is said but the biggest part is when the marriage counselor asks my wife how important marriage is to her. She responds ""uhhhhh....important?"" I'm crushed as marriage is more important to me than my career, money, etc.

A few weeks later it's the night before I leave to drive to my new state to start my residency program. I see her snap chatting and think I see John's name. I look at her phone and realize they are #1 best friends which means they are snapping each other the most. I ask her about it and she gets a big smile and says yes she had been snapping him (obviously). I asked her about the promise and she doesn't have an answer. I leave the next morning crushed this is the note we end on. She leaves for work and I cry hard at home, thinking about everything.

A few days later I text her to revist the snapchat thing with John. She says that she can't promise she won't snap him (because they are friends and it would be weird to just stop) but she will make it ""few and far between."" I figure this is reasonable and agree. I'm super busy in my new residency orientation all week and it flies by. I have a great time and meet lots of new people, which is nice because I didn't have a lot of time to hang out during my internship year. Saturday rolls around and I finally have a chance to start setting up my apartment. My wife texts me some rude thing about my snapchat story and then says she's going to her friends bday party. I figure I need to give her space and she doesn't contact me for 12 hours. I finally decide to send her a text and check her location. I realize she's in a new apartment that neither of us have been to. It turns out she was blackout drunk and at Alex's apartment and luckily his girlfriend was there too. I call her and we talk for a whole 5 seconds before she passes out and hangs up - a conversation she does not recall the next day. I'm furious as this is the exact behavior I've been upset about for months. The next day I text my wife a little bit but keep it light. Things improve that day until the groundbreaker. I ask her how the snapping thing with John is going and she replies that she has not snapped him ""at all."" Through the snapchat emojis I realize that she's lying to me and I confront her. She sends me a cropped screenshot of her snapchat but refuses to send me anything else stating I'm making her ""jump through hoops."" I'm absolutely done at this point.

That night I call her to tell her that the way she acts and how it makes me feel is devastating. I'm constantly worried about her drinking, lying, and interactions with John and that I don't want to be with someone that does these things. She's surprised but says she ""can't change"" and thinks there's a lot of things going on right now. We agree to take a week long break and talk the following Sunday.

The now:

It's been 4 days now and I've received a lot of advice from friends and family. Their reactions are all the same when I talk about everything that has been going on. I'm not sure if she even wants to work this out and at this point I'm not sure I want to be with someone that acts the way she does. She never used to act like this at all and I can't pinpoint what happened - and probably never will. I'm somewhat relieved but also sad because we were in a great relationship less than 1 year ago and in love. My feelings now are that I'm tired of being worried and trying to fix our relationship single handedly and I am fully prepared to walk away from this. She says I'm smothering her and controlling. I agree to a degree, but think that it's only because of the way she's acting.

TLDR: my wife has been acting crazy going out drinking, lying to me, and generally being a selfish person. I've had enough and we are considering divorce after being married for 1.5 years.

I would like any and all thoughts and advice. How to approach the situation and what I might need to do next."

8wgm5b,62,2018-07-05,Girlfriend and I just had an argument over medical decisions. Possibly pending breakup?,darkpassxnger,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8wgm5b/girlfriend_and_i_just_had_an_argument_over/,"Sorry for formatting issues. I'm kind of distraught right now as this just happened and I don't know where else to go.

My girlfriend and I have been together for \~3 years. At this point in our relationship we're discussing moving in together, we're happy but still working on some communication issues as we're still young and this is kind of the first serious relationship we've both been in. Just kind of working everything out as it comes up.

Now for some background: Growing up I had many surgeries (due to a birth injury) but have never really gone to the doctor unless whatever illness I had was pretty bad. In my family we just kind of work through it and hope for the best, which in some situations is kind of a shitty way to deal with things, but it's always worked for us. Girlfriend on the other hand is very on top of her health, family is very health conscious, etc., and views doctors very positively. Obviously this is a difference neither of us has been able to meet in the middle on until possibly now?

Today my girlfriend went to the doctor and discovered she has strep throat for the second time in two weeks. She has been ill for the entire month of June. I had what I thought was a cold at the end of May/beginning of June that I never got checked up on because it was gone within a few days. My girlfriend has always had a problem with me not seeing a doctor for things I think I can treat at home and just wait out, so now we have the problem of worrying whether or not I am a carrier for strep throat because I might have left it untreated a few weeks ago. We figure this is the only possible reason that she has strep again after being on antibiotics the first time around.

All she asked from me is that I promise to start taking care of myself and taking care of my health. I have agreed to go see a doctor tomorrow morning to get tested for strep and get on antibiotics to get rid of it if I am a carrier. That is fine, I have also promised to start seeing a doctor when I need to go to prevent this from happening again. I've even looked into going to see a permanent doctor at her doctor's office and shown her screenshots of me researching doctors at the medical center she goes to.

Now to the argument: Girlfriend starts bringing up my family and how they don't see a doctor. She questions whether or not my sibling takes their children to the doctor, if they give them all of their antibiotics, etc. Starts talking about how I'm brainwashed and I don't give a shit about my health, my family doesn't give a shit about their health, etc., and how we might as well just break up because we're essentially making her sick. I asked her continuously not to talk about my family, and to stop bringing them up because their poor medical decisions shouldn't be taken out on me, and I didn't think it was fair she was holding it against me because I don't judge her family's medical decisions and don't view her differently based on how her family cares for themselves.

I guess I just need advice. I'm not mad at my girlfriend because I understand that she is just scared. I just feel that she crossed a lot of lines and I'm really upset with how she handled the situation. She doesn't feel like she's done anything wrong and thinks that I'm being unreasonable because I don't want her to talk about my family, and that I should realize I'm the unfair one because she's bedridden and having to miss work and her internship. Am I overreacting to be upset about this?

tldr; Girlfriend has strep and it's possibly my fault. I agree to see a doctor. She starts talking about my family's medical decisions, we have an argument, threaten to break up."

This is probably an important detail. 
Also ,after reading, please consider upvoting so this post can be visible. The best way to help me is by making epic staff see my post.
Anyway, before, my father was paying for any of my skin purchases with his credit card. Now however, as I do not own my own card and since I don't live with my father currently, I made a deal with my roommate to buy skins for me in return for cash. When he entered his debit card, he got a message to contact epic support. After two weeks of no response, they finally replied with :


Hello,
Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support. We apologize for the delay in our response.
Due to your account attempting to add a card that has been reported as lost or stolen, purchasing has been permanently blocked on your account. This is done in order to protect card holders from having their lost or stolen cards used without their authorization.
Epic Games support is unable to remove this block upon request. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
If you have any additional issues or questions, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

The card was NEVER reported stolen before, and IS owned by my roommate. I don't understand how epic came up with the response that it was a stolen card, because my roommate literally uses it to buy skins on his own account. I tried telling epic support that I can provide any proof of ID, literally anything they ask for to prove that it is not a stolen card, and is owned by my roommate, but instead they just give me copy and pasted replies saying that they can't do anything and aren't even willing to look into this issue for me.
My account is an account with many skins, including rare season 1 skins which I love and do not want to lose. I however cannot see myself playing it when I literally can't buy anything else that will be added into the store, including future battle passes. I would really love for an epic employee to see this, and maybe even look into this for me. I can provide any proof that is needed to prove that the card was never stolen."

* GW: 118.8 lb (53.9 kg, 21.8 BMI)

Long-time lurker, first time poster here to share my story to hopefully inspire others as they've inspired me.

**My story**:

As long as I can remember, I've had a strange relationship with food. As a kid, I categorically refused to eat any fruits or vegetables besides crinkle cut carrots and canned corn (appetizing, I know). While my food choices have expanded considerably, I still feel visceral disgust at the thought of eating green vegetables (besides zucchini--I eat about half a pound (\~225 g) of zucchini every night).

My first binge was at age 10 or 11. I remember feeling vaguely hungry and stuffing 2-4 Safeway brand hot dog or hamburger buns into my mouth. I'd compress them into little ""bread balls"". I thought I was hungry, but maybe I was just bored. My mom caught me a few times and I lied about it, despite leaving the obvious evidence (an empty bag) behind. Thus, shame began to define my relationship with food.

Over time, I got craftier about my binges. I'd always leave at least one thing in the package. I'd put the individual portion package underneath other trash to hide it in the can. I'd wait until late at night after everyone had gone to sleep or nobody was home. The only person I ever fooled was myself. I wasn't getting fat. I was muscular. I was athletic. Playing sports throughout middle and high school kept the weight off. For a time.

College came around. I became less active, and my weight ballooned. I was in denial about the size of my body. I'd sneak measurements on my roommates' scales every now and again, using the fact that I was weighing myself on carpet as an excuse to ignore the numbers creeping up. I stress ate. I didn't control my portions. A summer of professional marching band (drum corps) helped me drop 15 pounds at one point, but I never solved the underlying food problem, so the pounds came back with a vengeance.

The first time I had any semblance of control was when I lived in my first apartment in summer 2016 after my junior year of college. For the first time ever I was in complete control of not just what I put in my body, but what was available for me to put in my body. That simple fact of having to do my own grocery shopping helped me to gain some semblance of control over my food intake. It's easier to avoid binging if you don't buy food to binge on.

Senior year with an open kitchen in my campus housing undid any progress I made the previous summer. Late night snacking was a thing a lot of people did, and wasn't anything to be ashamed of. I saw a number of people I'd known since my freshman year gain substantial amounts of weight. This allowed me endless fodder for excuses: it's not me, it's the system. I'll get this under control when I live on my own. 

I hit rock bottom when I saw my GP for a physical on June 23, 2017. My weight: 168.8 pounds. BMI: 30.87. That's obese. My super shitty bachelor's degree graduation photos were also very motivating.

You can't be healthy at any size. You might not notice it much in your 20s, but decades of overeating will kill you if you let it. That's not even mentioning the fact that I hated my body. I struggled to hike and be outdoors doing the things I love, despite exercising regularly. My body just couldn't carry around the extra pounds I put on it. I was a giant piece of blubber. My clothes, which consist of loose fitting jeans, cargo shorts, flannels, and t-shirts, barely fit me. I couldn't be in denial anymore. It was easier for me to change my lifestyle that to go on trying to do mental gymnastics to convince myself that fat acceptance is acceptable or that I didn't have a problem (I attended a liberal American university with very vocal HAES supporters. Even when you're firm in your beliefs in science, it can be hard not to be influenced by the people peddling nonsense if it lets you off the personal responsibility hook.)

That's not saying lifestyle change is easy. When I moved for a 6 month internship in July 2017, I had a plan. Log all of my calories in MFP. Eat at a 500 kcal/day deficit to lose a pound a week (\~1300 kcal/day). Go to the gym at least 2-3 days a week. Weigh in every day, despite daily bodily fluctuations. Don't buy food you can binge on.

It worked.

I'm not saying it was easy. The first two months were a struggle. I had to undo a dozen years worth of disordered thinking and habits. I didn't trust my body's satiety signals. I used the best science I knew to set a daily calorie budget and stick to it. I failed a lot at first. But even exceeding my daily budget by a few hundred calories here and there, I started to see results. Slowly but surely the pounds began to come off. Some days, I just told myself that I'd committed to trying this for three months and I'd stick it out, no matter what. If it didn't work, it was only 3 months and I could go back to my old ways or try something else. I lurked heavily on r/loseit for support. It was amazing reading people's stories--stories very different yet so similar to my own of how they struggled daily and yet succeeded over the long term. You can't outrun your fork. Failure will happen, but it's important to forgive yourself and move on. One extra cookie won't derail your entire week/month's effort. These and other aphorisms, combined with my own halting progress, told me that it is possible to undo half a lifetime's worth of damage.

Since last July, I've lost 45 pounds, almost to my goal of 50 pounds lost in a year. I binge far less than I used to. I log those binges and move on. I've discovered that it's possible to love myself and my body, and that sustainable change can happen. I can spend time with my mom and not be worried about her judgment of my body or food intake, since I have a plan and I won't be preoccupied by my insecurities every minute of my interaction with her. (My interactions with my mom have long been strained by her approach towards food, body image, gender presentation, etc. It's safe to say her shaming drove a large part of my early binging, but that's a different story and doesn't absolve me of my indiscipline as an adult.) I'm not preoccupied by food nearly as much as I used to be (this isn't to say I don't still have days where all I can think about is food).

**Lessons learned**:

* You cannot outrun your fork. It's cliche but true.
* That extra cookie isn't worth it (most of the time). If it's a shitty Safeway-brand sugar cookie, no thanks. If it's someone's homemade chocolate chip brownies, oh yes it is.
* Slow progress is still progress.
* You can't eat it if you don't buy it. Control over my food environment was the biggest factor in helping me shed the pounds.
* Short women like myself really benefit from exercise, Just a 100-300 kcal/day difference in my TDEE and in what I can eat makes a huge difference in my mood and energy level.
* Since my TDEE is so low (thanks for the short genes, Grandma!) I have to make very strategic choices about what I eat, or my deficit for the day can be gone. I find large quantities of meat and vegetables are my best friends. I don't go out of my way to avoid carbs, but don't find myself eating a lot of them either (besides sandwiches, fruits, and desserts). I pre-log most of my food for the day either in the morning or by lunchtime. I meal prep 4-5 meals once a week and eat packaged dinners/go out the other 2 nights. I eat pretty much the same breakfast (2 scrambled eggs + apple/pineapple/banana) and lunch (turkey &amp; cheese sandwich + fruit + granola bar/chips) daily. I thrive on routine and don't mind eating the same thing over &amp; over again. I think it's really all about my feeling of control.
* Taking a break every now and again is OK. I was losing 1 lb/week steadily until March, when I went on a 10 day European vacation and was eating \~2000-3000 kcal/day. I gained 2 actual lbs of fat from that. My weight loss from April-June was slower due to increased stress from being back in school for the first time in 9 months (previous 9 months were a 6 month internship + 3 months studying abroad). I lost about 7 lbs from April-June and gained a couple back around graduation festivities and a week-long road trip of somewhat uncontrolled eating.
* Contrary to popular opinion here, I don't weigh my food. This was initially due to fear of embarrassment around my roommates, but now it's more a matter of laziness. I use the measurements from pre-packaged food and the weights of my meat and produce from the grocery store divided over the number of items/meals I get from that weight. I may start weighing my food if my progress stalls. It's been in line with my estimated TDEE &amp; consumption, so I feel fine about this for now.
* Weight fluctuates **a lot** day to day. I weigh myself daily in the morning. It's just a number that gives me information on what my body's doing. If it's way off from what I'm expecting, I don't worry too much about it and just keep with what I know works.
* Weight loss and fitness are very individual-specific. What works for me may not work for other people. Don't be afraid to experiment. If something doesn't work for you after trying it for a couple weeks, don't sweat it! Just try something else. The weight won't stay off if you hate what you're doing.

**Moving forward**:

* I'm really, really tired of 1300 kcal/day. I'm bumping up my MFP goal to 1500, but still shooting to eat lower. My sedentary TDEE is about 1500, so I'm expecting progress to be slower from here on out. That's okay. Slower and more sustainable is better than crashing it off faster and then regaining by reverting to old habits.
* I'm trying to cut my BF&amp;#37; from \~30&amp;#37; (my best guess based on the Navy method) to \~20&amp;#37;. I've been following r/bwf's recommended routine since April (with 3 weeks off due to graduation/moving). I haven't set a deadline on this. I'm continuing to eat at a smaller deficit and working on increasing strength. (Estmated TDEE is \~1800, so eating at 1400-1500). I also hike a fair amount. Since I'm looking for a job right now, I have plenty of time to devote to fitness!
* I'm going to be logging my calories for the foreseeable future. Intuitive eating doesn't cut it for me--I can knock back 2500+ kcal without much effort if I'm not careful and I still don't trust my satiety cues. I don't even see it as an inconvenience any more--it's an incredibly useful tool that keeps me accountable.

**TLDR:** Move more, eat less, with emphasis on the latter. There are no shortcuts to self-discipline. Lost 45 lbs in a year and learned how to adult."

8whkhi,1,2018-07-06,Me [24M] with my friend [25F] of ~2 years. Unsure if I should pursue her,unsureaboutfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8whkhi/me_24m_with_my_friend_25f_of_2_years_unsure_if_i/,"Hi all. Thanks in advance for any advice, and I apologise if this is a bit of a silly question. I’m supposed to be entering the workforce soon, but this situation is making me feel like I’m in high school again. 

I first met Emma about 2 years ago. I was aware of who she before then, through her reputation in our graduate school program (a prestigious professional program, say law). We met when we were assigned to do a group project together, and I found her to be smart, diligent, and as committed as I was to get a good grade (a rare combo!). After working together that semester, I asked if she wanted to partner together in the next semester’s group presentation, which she accepted. 

It was around this time that I started to have feelings for her. I reasoned that although we were in the same program, which could potentially cause some issues if things became sour, the potential benefits outweighed the negatives. I resolved to ask her out after our project was concluded. At the time I was in the position that I normally am with girls I’m interested in; I know them well enough to consider asking them out, but am not supremely invested or know them super well. 

This however became somewhat complicated. Whilst we were working together on the project, I learnt that she had applied for the same internship as I had for a large, competitive firm. I was about a month further along in the process than she was, so she began to ask me questions to assist her. Evidently we became closer over this time. 

A few months later and she let me know that she’d been offered the internship, as had I. At this point I decided that I should squash my feeling for her, for the sake of maintaining a professional relationship. Whilst this made me a little sad at the time, I realised it was for the best. 

Naturally, given that we only knew each other at the firm, we began to spend a lot of time together. Lunches together became walking each other to and from work, to hanging out together with other interns. At this point, my feelings began to reoccur. I resolved that I would ask her out at the end of the internship. At this point my feeling were much stronger than prior. 

She also asked my advice on work related things, including her final meeting with the bosses, that would determine whether or not she would get the job. I had already been offered mine, and when asked for my intern recommendation, I looked at it objectively and realised that I wouldn’t want to work with anyone else but her. I have a lot of respect for her as a lawyer, and she’s on a short list of people that I’d trust to work with. Surprise surprise, of the 50 interns, her and i were the only 2 to be offered full time work, to begin after our last year of grad school was completed. At this point she had also asked me what options I was taking for our final year, and then selected all the same so that we could work together on projects again. There’s no doubt that she respects me as a lawyer. 

Obviously at this point I had to squash my feelings again. We would be closely working together at college, then at work. Just didn’t seem like a good idea. I was a little bummed by this but decided it was for the best. 

Fast forward through this year, and we’ve almost spent every day at college together. Lectures sitting together, lunch together, everything. I’ve only gotten closer to her. I’d now classify her as a close friend. 

Only a few weeks ago all the interns we were close to decided to hang out and have dinner at someone’s place. The minute she walked in, dressed up and looking pretty, i knew I still felt something for her. Something that’s only stronger than before. 

My question basically surrounds advice from others that may have been in this position. Evidently we’re in a precarious position that could have a significant fallout of things become sour. But I just can’t shake these feelings. At the same time, I’m unsure as to whether she even considers me in this way. When we talk she laughs at my (incredibly unfunny) jokes. We message occasionally, though I wouldn’t exactly call it flowing, I definitely initiate it. It just seems easy when we’re together. She definitely sees me as a friend, and we have a lot of the same interests. So what’s the call here? Grow up and drop the feelings? Maybe give it a go? 

Thanks

tl;dr: I keep developing feelings for a (now) good friend, who I will be working with soon. Unsure if I should pursue it, or if she’s even interested.

Hey guys, I worked as an intern for three summers this one included. My hourly wage went from 18, 26, then 33 this summer. I am about to graduate also so I am hoping to raise in wage.

Ive been worried recently that Surveying is a dead end- surveyors seem to have much lower wages than I expected when I began school. For example, a friend I know is looking to hit 100k from graduation with a low demand field, however I look like I will be at 60k with a high demand field, not counting winters lack of work. 

I also feel forced into working in the bay if I ever want to afford a house in my lifetime, and that house will definitely not be in the bay due to cost. If I survey outside of the bay I expect to cut my wages in half, which means im barely better off than working a carwash.

If any of you guys have some info on this, id love to hear it. I am worried to the point I feel like I wasted the last few years of my life. The field work is great, office is alright, but the forseeable future wages are not enough to build a life upon it seems like."

~Plot~

My OC works has just been hired in as an intern for a large corporation in Tokyo, Japan. She is struggling to pay rent, and barely has enough to feed herself. The CEO of the corporation (your OC), notices my OC's attitudes are changing, and she seems to be in a very rough situation. Your OC takes a liking to her, and decides to make a deal with my character: he will help her through all of her financial stress - so long as she agrees to become his 'pet'. Anything he desires, she must give him. Gradually, our characters grow on each other and begin to fall in love, though neither would like to admit it.

However, there's a giant secret that your character keeps. He is the boss of a well-known and feared mafia of Tokyo, creating a ring of underground crimes daily. Obviously, my character eventually gets forced into the violence, and it is then that our characters become close romantically, and your character begins protecting mine with his life. 

I will introduce my OC once you've messaged me, and I expect you to do the same. If you message me with just ""hey"", or ""rp"", you'll be blocked! Sorry! I also only expect experienced partners who know what they're doing. I ask that you play in 3rd person, paragraph form.

~Requirements/Rules~

1) Obviously, I ask that you be over 18. There will be many adult themes included in our writing.

2) I only want experienced partners, please -- someone who can write more than a paragraph.

3) Please be able to write in 3rd person, present tense.

4) Please have a detailed description of your muse (OC) ready to go.

5)Please also have a list of kinks and limits.

6) Lastly, please do not abandon the conversation without notice. I absolutely despise that. Of course, I'll understand emergencies.

We can further discuss storyline details (location, world building, etc.) once you've messaged me.

I have searched previous posts on this sub about bringing a Desktop PC over to china,however all examples were of short term expats. The general response was ""you are only there for a year, buy a laptop"".

I am moving to Beijing in September on an internship for a South African company based in Beijing.
The move is permanent and not short term.

I would like to save on the costs of buying a new desktop PC and would like to know if there is any issue with bringing a computer into China? I have the space in my luggage as well as the weight in mind.


TLDR:moving to china,want to bring Desktop PC, are there any issues involved I.e customs etc."
8wi89o,2,2018-07-06,M4M - The Alpha Apocalypse,[deleted],AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8wi89o/m4m_the_alpha_apocalypse/,"I hope you can tell from my sparkling prose that I'm an adult. I'm also only looking for adult partners for roleplay - its like let's pretend only stickier

Here's a taste for how things could start start out. I'm amenable to a lot of different ideas for how this change affects people.

I should be getting ready for work or school. Instead I just state at the TV set, hand over my mouth, watching the still confused reporter trying to explain what was happening

""... and another report in, from the Midwest... Oh Jesus. Viewer discretion is advised... ""

The screen changes to a shakey camera, taken from outside a bus. There seems to be a lot of movement inside, though it's hard to tell whats happening. It's too windy to pick up much with the camera, but then I hear a man (holding the phone) say ""oh my God"" softly.

The phone focuses better on the front of the school bus, or rather the drivers seat. A group of men on board appear to be crowding round the driver, cheering and whooping. Most of them are in various states of undress, or stripping as the camera rolls.

""Viewers may wish to turn away now "" the reporter says over the top, as it becomes clear what's happening. Sitting on the drivers seat is one of the men, with the driver sitting on his lap. The student bodily lifts the driver up a full foot, showing a slick, monstrously thick cock, before slamming the woman down again.

""Christ, what the hell is-"" I whisper, fascinated at the strength and ferocity of the fucking. The woman in the seat appears to be in ecstasy, one of the guys in the crowd moving now to show her decent body, if a little flat. Also the foot long cock pounding in and out of her mouth.

She puts her hands down to steady herself, and in doing so reveals something impossible - her, wait, his own cock, flopping uselessly and less than a third of the length fucking what I realise must be her ass. Holy fuck, its true!

Looking back at the bus we can see the change isn't universal, or at least that version of it-a couple of guys are pinned to windows by their former best friends, rivals or just fellow passengers, and though I can't hear the sounds the sentiment is obvious.

One of the gang must pull the lever, because at thay point the doors of the bus opens. The group almost seem to sniff the air before turning, smiling menacingly at the crowd that watched their impromptu gangbang.

Each one is... Well, each one is more than twice as long as me, and extremely aroused. They yell with excitement as they run into the crowd, effortlessly pulling down the group and starting to strip them. To my horror I even see one run right past a hot, stacked woman to grab her husband, flipping him onto his back and then...

The camera man starts to run but it's obvious to anyone it's too late. In only a few seconds the camera sitters to the floor, recording only sky.

Back in the studio both reporters (male and female) are bright red, breathing hard.

""We still don't know what's causing these... Incidents"" she starts."" But we're being told to advise people to stay indoors. ""

The man reads off a piece of paper that's rushed into shot by an intern ""we're also getting advice to try to isolate anyone showing any symptoms or indeed in the group that appears to be susceptible - though there's no sign it's universal yet""

 &gt; what next? Do I think about you upstairs, realising you're in the group? Maybe a knock on my door? Maybe we're one of those pairs that's out in the streets and suddenly at odds in a way we didn't think was possible.

So! A certain group suddenly feel themselves becoming hung, powerful alpha males, driven to use those they see around them as fuck toys by instinct. But what makes an alpha?

 * Age - I love younger dominant prompts. Pretty much every age combination works as well - from me being just out of the possible alpha range to a significant separation. We could be friends, siblings, father/son, student teacher - hell, just in the wrong place at the wrong time

 * Race - I know, it's in theory kind of a cliche. However instead of one of the more typical versions here, the race isn't inherently more alpha in terms of public perception, it's the change that causes it to happen. I'm also happy to choose literally any combination for our characters.

 * Lottery - There's no way to predict it, it just happens. I could be your jock, bullying roommate and you're the least intimidating nerd of all time but when the alpha virus hits you can pin me to the wall and breed me with a 12"" cock

 * Weirdness - Something really odd - money? How many sexual partners? All gay men become alphas and can wreak there revenge on straight victims? I'm very flexible!

 * Choice - something like Alpha Vampires choosing the worthy to be their allies and the rest of humanity being at worst cattle and at best concubines

 * Reversal - Women start waking up with thick cocks. These new futas can't resist the urge to use their former husbands', sons', fathers' and brothers' bodies - and that's just before they leave the house

Kinks:

 * Huge cocks on alpha males - pretty much my favourite. I'd definitely want you to be in the 9-12"" range, and me at about half your size. Comparison and some humiliation is definitely favoured.

 * Starting out with nonconsent - I mean, it's the Alpha apocalypse, not the alpha group hug.

 * Mental changes - for both of us. You go from your previous personality to a domineering, sex hungry predator and once you start fucking me I'll have my defences broken down.

 * Physical changes - they don't have to be obvious (realism is not a huge priority) but I'd love for you to become much stronger with the changes. Can include feminization/sissifcation changes for my character and I'm willing to go all the way to mpreg.

 * A reversal of the original power dynamic would be great. I go from being in control to controlled, so maybe I was your parent, teacher, bully - basically, it's not just the fucking but a chance for you to get back

Thank you for all the kind messages I have revived. I’m going to try and explain everything in chronological order as best as I can but this is going to be very difficult to type so I’ll probably split it into parts. 

June 20th Wednesday
Me and Lb flew out to Arizona to spend a month in Arizona for the trials that would take place there. During this time it was just me and Lb no one else. His parents let us use the room they held a time share in and gave no one our location. We didn’t tell anyone that we had left. During this time I met up with my lawyer who was a little nervous to be going to court. During this time I was still 17, a minor. I had plenty of evidence and he complemented me on my documentation skills because he said it was some of the best he had ever seen. 

After I reassured my lawyer that I would be 18 when we go to court he told me our game plan. He wanted me to play the scared emotional victim and cry a lot. Now if you remember I’m majoring in law and psych. I have an internship at a law firm and asked me to call if I needed anything. So I let my lawyer know that I had spoken to the lawyers I study under and they told me to not go for a crying approach. That my evidence would speak itself. That crying throughout the case would make me seem annoying and to be honest I didn’t want to cry in front of my abusers. He relented and we left for the day. 

June 22nd Friday 
It’s my birthday I turned 18 and me and Lb went to celebrate. I did get a text from church boy saying that now that I’m legal we can get together to start our family. I took a screenshot sent it to my lawyer and continued on with my birthday. I also got calls from all my extended family that I’m pretty sure are flying monkeys. Me and lb just wandered around the city had dinner and generally got mentally prepared for my trial that was happening the next day. 

June 23rd Saturday 
This is when it starts to get crazy. Now I have changed my look from the last time my grandparents saw me. I cut my hair, dyed it and I pierced my ears. The moment they looked at me their faces screamed rage. They also had many of my family members there and members from their church. I on the other hand only had Lb who was also my witness. 

We were sworn in and the trial begins. I tell my side of the story and provide the judge with all my evidence. I am suing my grandparents for my medical, trial and lawyer fees as well as the pay I am missing from work. All in all it’s a pretty good amount of money they would owe me. 

Time passes and church boy pulls out a file with photographs saying I was sending him nude photos of myself to him and his friends. That I was just nervous about our upcoming wedding and just need to be put in my place. Now I hate having my picture taken and there is no way I’m sending pictures of myself naked to anyone let alone church boy. I’ll be honest not even LB has seen me naked and we promised ourselves to each other. 

The photos were very convincing to since they matched my skin tone and none showed my face. But they had a date in the corner that would have made me 17. And in one photo you had a clear view of the woman’s right side. On my right side I have a tattoo. 

When I was 14 my youngest sister was diagnosed with cancer. I was so scared and spent all my time with her. After 2 years she was deemed to be cancer free. In celebration I went and got a tattoo of a butterfly that she drew for me and her favorite song lyrics on my side. Since I’m not allowed to wear revealing clothes no one saw it. I was young and stupid and its probably illegal but I had forged my parents signatures to get it. I don’t regret getting the tattoo since it was very important to my little sister. 

When I was able to prove that the pictures were not me because of the tattoo They flipped out and started yelling in court saying that I was there baby and they could do whatever they wanted to do with me and pulled out my birth certificate. The judge held them in contempt of court and we were then scheduled to come in Sunday to finish this. This also gave the judge time to review all the evidence. My lawyer then revived a copy of my birth certificate and on the lines where my mom and dad should have signed were my grandparents name. I was shocked and when we got to the hotel room I called my “parents” immediately to find out what the hell was going on. 


Here’s the very messed up story about my life. 

When my mom was 18 she met my dad who was 19-20. They started to date and when my mom was 22 she became pregnant with me. Like anyone would do she told her parents and they freaked out. Saying that all their plans were ruined that she was going to burn in hell and they would report her boyfriend, my father for rape.  Now my mom was the youngest and only girl in her family. She had 3 older brothers who all knocked up their girlfriends when they were in high school and they didn’t freak out. 

So my grandparents gave my mom and dad a choice. They could either try and survive on their own as broke college students. Or when the baby, I, was born they would be the ones to sign the birth certificate and they would support them. My parents chose the second option. I am a do over child for my mom. Which is why they let them do everything they wanted. 

During my moms pregnancy they would brag about getting a chance to fix my moms mistake. They had even became friends with church boys parents during this time. Church boy was 2 and they decided that in order to right my parents wrong I would marry church boy when I got older. 

My parents weren’t even the first to hold me when I was born. My grandparents were they chose my name and everything. Everything in my life was their choice. Which now that I think back at many of my childhood memories it makes sense.  They had my life planned out for me. But because they were too old to raise a child I developed a different personality then what they wanted. 

I felt betrayed and I asked if my sisters were my grandparents children as well. They weren’t by that time they had grown a spine and figured there was no need to change my birth certificate. I was broken and said for them to forget about me I was done. I hung up and called my law firm to ask about removing my grandparents from my certificate. I also want to change my name and everything because it’s something that they choose. 

I’m sorry it’s just so much I’ll try and tell more of what’s happened later but this post is getting long and I’m lost, broke and feeling betrayed. "

8wj548,121,2018-07-06,How do I become a paleontologist?,davehone,Paleontology,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paleontology/comments/8wj548/how_do_i_become_a_paleontologist/,"This question comes round and round again on here and I regularly get e-mails asking exactly this from people who are interested in becoming palaeontologists. There is plenty of good advice out there in various formus and answers to questions, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a really long and detailed answer and as much as anything, having something like this will hopefully serve as a one-stop shop for people who have this question.

For anyone who doesn’t know me, I am a palaeontologist working on dinosaur behaviour and have been for over a decade (I got my PhD back in 2005). Though I’m British and based in the UK, I’ve had palaeo jobs in Ireland, Germany and China and I’ve got numerous colleagues in the US, Canada, all over Europe and in places like Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and South Africa that I have talked to about working there, so I have a decent picture of what issues are relevant wherever you are from and where you want to be. There will of course be things I don’t cover below or that vary significantly (e.g. the duration of various degree programs and what they specialise in etc.) but this should cover the basics.

Hopefully this will help answer the major questions, and clear up some big misunderstandings and offer some advice to get into palaeontology. There are also some harsh truths here but I’m trying to be open and honest about the realities of trying to make a career of this competitive branch of science. So, with that in mind…

What do you think a palaeontologist does?

A lot of people asking about getting into the field seem to be seduced by the apparent image of the field as a glamorous science. There’s fieldwork in exciting places, media coverage (you can be on TV, in movies!), new discoveries, naming new species and generally being a bit cooler than the average biochemist or experimental physicist. But if this is what you think, it’s actually pretty misleading. You are only seeing the very top people and most of us don’t get much time in the field or travelling in a given year, and spend most of their time in an office and while that might include writing papers, there’s plenty of grant writing, admin and less exciting stuff. I rarely get into the field and probably &gt;90% of my time is spent teaching and doing admin work for my university. A fair chunk of my research and outreach output is done in my own time taking up evenings and weekend and even vacations. I don’t get to sit around and play with fossils all day and there are very, very few people with senior enough research positions who get perhaps even 50% of their time to do real research and fieldwork – there will always be paperwork and admin that needs doing and even writing research papers or planning a field season can be really quite tedious at times. Real joy comes from discoveries in the field or in research but these are moments you work for, there’s not a constant stream of them.

So it’s worth making sure you have a realistic impression of real life as a palaeontologist and ask yourself if you have realistic expectations of what the job might entail and where you may end up. That said…

Do you know what jobs are available?

Palaeontology tends to be thought of as people digging up fossils and then maybe researching on them and / or teaching about them. Palaeontologists are scientists and they work in museums or maybe universities. That’s not wrong, but it masks a pretty wide range of careers and employers. It goes back to my point above, there are lots of jobs for palaeontologists or people working in the field of palaeontology and in addition to researchers and lecturers, there are science educators, museum curators and managers, exhibition designers, specimen preparators, photographers, science writers, palaeoartists and consultants of various kinds. People can work for media outlets, national parks and other government bodies, companies that mount or mould specimens, that monitor building sites and roads for uncovered fossils, and others. One of these might be more what you are interested in – you don’t have to end up as the senior researcher in your national museum to have ‘made it’ and similarly, that can mean you have a very different set of requirements to get a different kind of job. You pretty much have to have a PhD to teach at a university, but you can potentially get a job working preparing fossils with little more than a good high school education. Experience and engagement with the field can always lead to you changing paths and I know of people who started out in science without a degree that are now full professors or have some senior palaeontological position.

There are also lots of opportunities in various places to be a volunteer and you certainly don’t need a PhD or even a degree to get involved in scientific research and i know of high scoolers who have managed to publish papers – some drive and knoweldge can go a long way. There are opportunities to engage in the science without actually holding a professorship at a big university. If some of the information coming up is a bit daunting, there are options and alternatives.

Do you know what the job market is like?

Despite the above listed variety of jobs out there, there are still not a huge number of jobs in palaeo, and fewer still for academic positions. Worse, there a lot of people who want them. If you are desperate to get into an especially sexy area like dinosaurs or carnivorans then it’s even worse. For every academic job there are likely to be 10 well qualified candidates (and quite possibly 20 or more) and these are all people who have held at least one postdoctoral position (maybe 1 available for every 5 people) and have a PhD (maybe 1 available for every 20 or 30 people who want to do it). It’s very common for people for slowly drift out of the field simply because they cannot find a job even after years and years of training and experience and a good record of research. I know of colleagues who did their PhD around the same time I did and have yet to find a permanent position. Others are stuck in jobs they would rather not be in, hoping for something better and, sadly, when finances are tight, palaeontology is often a field which suffers cuts more than other sciences. As with the point above, I’m not saying this to put people off (though I’m sure it does) but it is worth knowing the reality of the situation. Getting on a degree program, even coming top of the class will in no way ensure you get on a doctorate program, let alone in the field you want to study, let alone a job at the end of it.

Do you know what the career trajectory is?

As noted above this can vary enormously depending on what you may want to try and do, but I’ll focus here on academic positions since that’s what most people do want to do, and it’s generally the longest and most involved pathway. First off you will need an undergraduate degree, increasingly this tends to be in the biological sciences though there are lots of people with a background in geology. You’ll need to know at least some of each but it’s perfectly possible to forge a palaeontology career (depending on what you do) with a very heavily biased knowledge in favour of one or the other. Most people don’t specialise seriously until later so don’t worry about doing one and assuming it’s a problem, and don’t get hung up on doing a palaeontology degree – there simply aren’t many of them about and it’s not a deal at all if you have not done one. With a good degree you can get onto a Masters program which will obviously increase your knowledge further and improve your skills, and then onto a doctorate which will be anything from 3-6 years depening where you do it. It could take a year or two to get onto this programs if there is something specific you want or of course you may need to work to get the funds necessary for tuition fees etc. Most people will also then go on a take one or two positions as a postdoctoral researcher or similar before finding a job. Some of these are short term (a year or so) and some can be much longer (5 year special research fellowships are rare and great if you can get them, a one or two year contract is more common). You may end up taking some short-term jobs (parental leave cover, or for a sabbatical etc.) and can bounce around on contracts for a while before landing a permanent position/ All told, it’s likely to be at least 10 years and could easily be 15 or 20 between starting at university and a first year undergraduate and having a permanent position at a university as an academic. This can also involve moving round the country or between countries (and continents) to find a job. Again. if you are dead set on working on taxon group X at university Y, be aware that it’s likely to be a very, very long shot or needs to be a very long-term career goal.

How do you start?

So assuming that this is still something you think you want to go for, how do you actually start on the road to becoming a palaeontologist? Well, the short version is go to university and do well. That’s what I did, at least in part because I wasn’t any more interested in palaeo than some other fields in biology and I kinda drifted this way (this is really common, even people who start absolutely dedicated to working on one particular area get sidetracked by new interests or simply the available opportunities). Of course with so much more information out there now online there are much better ways to get started and to learn something about possible careers, universities, current research, museums to go to, etc. etc. You may be surprised to find that a what of what you know is not that relevant or important for getting into the field. Knowing a whole bunch of facts isn’t a bad thing, but understanding principles, being good at absorbing knowledge and interpreting things and coming up with ideas and testing them are more important. You can always look up a fact if you forgot it or don’t know it, but if you can’t effectively come up woith ideas to test, collect good data and organise your thoughts then it’s obviously hard to do good science. Learning things like names of species and times and places they are from is obviously a good start, but don’t think it’s a massive head start on potential peers. Obviously you’ll want to focus on palaeontology, but biology and geo sources are important too, a wider knowledge base will be better than a narrow one. So, in sort of an order that will lead to you learning and understanding more and getting better:

    Read online. There are tons of good sources out there – follow people on Twitter, join Facebook groups, listen to podcasts, read blogs etc. etc. Absorb information on biology, geology, current research trends, the history of the subject and the fundamentals of science. Engage and discuss things with people.
    Read books. Build up your knowledge base with some good popular science books and then if you can access them, get hold of some university level books that are introductory for subjects you want to engage in. There are good books out there on palaeontology generally and various branches like invertebrate palaeo, mammals, human origins etc. Public libraries can often get even very technical works in for free and there are others online. Some books can be very cheap second hand.
    Get more practical experience and engage with the field and fossils if you can. Visit museums and go fossil hunting. If you can, volunteer at a museum and get some experience and training no matter what form it might be.
    Read papers. Large chunks of the scientific literature are online and available. You won’t get everything you want, but you will be able to see a lot of things. Learn from them, not just the science being done, but look at patterns and trends and look at how papers are written and delivered, how hypotheses are produced and tested. See what makes a good argument and a good peice of work.
    Get to a scientific conference if you can. As with reading papers, it may be hard to dig into technical material given by experts aimed at other experts but you will learn something from it and get to see scientific discourse in action and meet people. Speak to students about how they got started in the field and speak to academics about their programs and what finding or positions may be available.
    Try to get involved in scientific research if you can. Offer your services to academics with whatever your current skills and knowledge you have and see if you can help. It might be very peripheral sorting out specimens, or merely collating data or drawing things for a figure and it might not end up in authorship on a paper, but it would get you actively engaged and see the process of research up close. I have had people assist me from Germany and Australia so you don’t need to be physically in the smae building to collaborate and get valuable experience and training.

Any, though in particular all, of these will give you a huge advantage when it comes to getting started for real on a degree or with a new palaeontology job or internship. The best students know what they know and what they don’t, and have the initiative and drive to seek out opportunities to learn and get experience and are not put off by setbacks. You may not be able to get to a conference or find an academic looking for help, but you really should be able to start at least reading papers and developing your knowledge and understanding. That will massively appeal to people looking to recruit to positions or studentships and can make a big difference.

TLDR

Palaeontology is a hard field to break into, most don’t make it even if they are hard-working and talented and deserve it. But if it’s what you really want to do, then be aware of the risks and go into it open eyed but also hopefully armed with a bit of knowledge and advice as to what you can do to stand a better chance. Be prepared to have to move, be prepared to have to sacrifice a great deal, be prepared to end up somewhere very different to what you might have expected or planned, but also be prepared for the possibility of a fantastic job. All of it is of course up to you, but I wish you the best of luck and I hope this is some useful advice.

Also: sorry for my english. 
Also: trigger warning

We were highschool sweethearts. He transferred to our school when we were sophomores,  and we kinda clicked since he's American and I was one of the people in our class who can speak english (it's taught in our school,  but only a few dared to speak it because we're all afraid to be laughed at.) He told me he's thankful that I was speaking to him because our classmates wouldn't. Then,  after five months,  we started to date. 
There were things that we had to go through,  like my parents thinking that our relationship would hinder my studies, my being reserved (introvert)  and him being so friendly (extrovert)  and all those culture shocks. Eventually, we surpassed them. 
When we graduated in high school,  we got into our own paths. He went to an engineering school while I went to medical. We still went out, but we rarely had time for each other.  Luckily,  internet and phone were there. 

September, last year. I was interning in a hospital as a nurse while he's in another city that's five hours away if you travel by bus. While I was getting ready for my shift,  he called me and told me he missed me and wanted to see me. I reminded him that we're both busy,  so we couldn't really see each other,  and he said that he's going to see me after my shift,  which was 7pm-7am. It's good because we both were free after my shift and we could actually meet,  although I was worried because I knew he's had many things to do even in his free time. We kinda talked for a while until my shift started. 
When we met up, he held my hand and we had a date. He was smiling all the time,  and I was happy to see him. We complained about the things in our workplace,  but all was good. It was a good time. 
Until he broke down. Night came and while we were on his apartment,  he held my hand and told me he's thinking of killing himself.  He showed me strings of email asking for help (to josamaritans) about what he's feeling. He also told me how,  despite every loving person in his life,  he felt lonely and depressed all the time. I was so shocked. I'd known him for a long time and I'd never thought he's depressed. I remembered there were lots of crying and me telling him how much I love him,  how much he's worthy of happiness. He hugged me and told me how thankful he was that he finally had someone to tell about what he truly felt. I told him that he could tell me everything eveb before that night. 
  I remembered texting my parents that I couldn't come home because I had to do some things related to my internship (parents are still strict even until now) just to stay with him. We laid in bed to sleep,  and he was aslept after two hours or three. I couldn't sleep because I was worried that if I closed my eyes,  he'd be gone. I remembered touching his chest and feeling his pulse just to make sure. 
After that night,  he promised that he wouldnt do something dangerous and we went to see a psychiatrist I know. He had therapy sessions after that. 
March,  this year. I was studying in my room when my mother called. She said he shot himself. I was in denial because I didn't think it was real, but mother couldn't have joked about something like this. I calmed myself, but couldnt keep myself from crying and shaking. It's so painful. Up until now, it's still stabbing me. 
He didn't leave any notes,  and the months after his breakdown were good memories. In the headlines, it was said that he did what he did because of too much school works. I was so angry because they couldnt have been more wrong. 

It has been months, and all I could think of was him. I miss him so much and I love him so much. I try to focus to other things, but after everything,  I go back to thinking about him.  I couldnt tell anyone because they're already worried for me


I dont know what to feel anymore

8wjt5r,1,2018-07-06,Making a web accessible DB through ADOdb,Eloyas,DatabaseHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatabaseHelp/comments/8wjt5r/making_a_web_accessible_db_through_adodb/,"So I have an internship in a mining engineering company. My boss just gave me a new task:


Everyday, he receives a report from each mine they own saying if they accomplished their daily goals. He says he's sick of those reports cluttering his mail, so he want me to find a way to get those reports (a mix of pdf, excel sheets and word documents) into a database and see the trends in a nice graphic.


For now, he suggested making every report into an excel sheet, sending all the reports to a dedicated email adress, have a program open the new mail and identify the right template to use and finally have the template send the data to an access database.


As I have worked with VBA until now, I'm thinking it would be simpler to modify the Template used for each report into an excel sheet and having a button on the sheet that'll upload everything to the database directly. Problem is, I have no idea how to connect a database to the web securely (there's no global corporate network connecting all the mines). Also, I suppose I will need something better than Access to make this work.


So would anybody here have advice on how to begin a project like this? Recommended readings are also welcome."

It ended with her tweaked out and insane on meth . I grabbed the kids got them away from her chaos . She melted down and made the usual false allegations and threats . I intern got an order of protection for the kids and myself for two years . Which she has broken more than once. She gets a three hour controlled supervised visit every other Saturday.  

I knew something bad was coming due to it being the one year anniversary of her royal fuck up . Well my gut feeling was right . The kids and I had left town for a mini vacation a couple hours away . As we were getting back to our room from the water park I get a call from my neighbor.  She had  driven her car though my yard then got out and confronted him .  Screaming crazy shit and telling him everyone’s gonna get fucked up ! Then she went back to her car and grabbed some spray paint and went to town on my house . Not much my neighbor could do since he is elderly and just had hip surgery other than call 911. She spray-painted my garage door the kids bedroom windows my bedroom window my lawnmower the kids electric car they drive around in and various other things.By the time the police showed she was gone of course but pictures were taken and report was made. Then the next day my neighbor was coming home and noticed his mail my mail and our other neighbors mail was thrown all over the street. So here comes visit from the cops number 2 . Another report made. The kids and I get back from our vacation to survey the damage done to our house. She spray-painted my younger son’s name over and over and over again. And not only was it on my house but various street signs around our  nice Working class neighborhood . On top of this insanity I’m looking at my vehicle and noticed one of my ARB fog lights have been smashed out. 

So there we have it she has went completely over the deep end. A warrant has been produced for her arrest and it’s just a matter of time before she gets picked up. Violation of the order protection vandalizing public property trespassing on and on. I don’t even know how to feel about any of this at this point. I’m sad to say  that I’m happy it happened.  I doubt she will even get supervised visits after all this but I could be wrong. "

To get to the point, I am a ""Computer and Communications Engineering"" undergrad, I have already finished my final project on May and all remaining courses. I just have 6 remaining credits for which I am currently doing an internship (after Internship ends I get those 6 credits).

So Everyday my Unpaid internship (IT Helpdesk position) place is a great multinational company but its far, it takes me about an hour going another coming back home, I of course stay for at least 8 hours for work (although I have done more up to 13 hours yesterday).

Usually I come back exhausted ( I leave home between 6:40 and 7:00 AM and come back by 6:00 to 7:40 PM )and as  I do not eat anything during work, I fix a meal just after getting back and mostly just read a bit until I can barely keep my eyes open without effort, I then proceed to iron my clothes for the next day and hit the sack.

So I am thinking about trying to continue the research I did for my final project, maybe even publish something in that field (computer vision), I am also not sure if I want to get a masters degree and in the mean time during work I was told that I might be able to get the chance to configure so high grade equipment so I am studying on that.

How can I balance my time to be able to do all 3 of the above competently? what did you guys do? what would you suggest anyways? DO you guys use software, or just write out daily plans on calendar books.

Edit: I forgot to Add I was actively studying the German language before doing my final project (began on final project by January and ended may) and stopped to focus on my final project, can I also pursue that?"

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a  lucky guy that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ocudk/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
8wltnp,2,2018-07-06,"Physical science PhD student, want to quit it and looking into other career options. What would I have to do to enter the actuarial field? Does anyone here currently work as an actuary (or related job) but used to be in physical science/academia?",iammaxhailme,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8wltnp/physical_science_phd_student_want_to_quit_it_and/,"Background: Graduated undergrad in 2013 with two BS's: Chemistry and Applied Math + Statistics. Studying in, and was born in, the NYC area. 26/Male.

Since 2015 I have been pursuing a PhD in chemistry, specifically in computational chemistry/quantum chemical theory. I've found that neither research nor the general academic lifestyle really suit me well. A few reasons are:

- Academia is extraordinarily unstructured. There are basically no clear benchmarks for progress. I find it very hard to self-motivate under that kind of structure. However I did well when I was in an environment with more clear tasks (classes, chemistry internships, teaching undergrad chem lab)...
- Related to the above: Academia really fosters a sort of ""martyr"" personality where people love to humblebrag about how much work they do, and look down on people for having a personal life. I'm not the kind of person who can get obsessed with one problem and spend 10 hours a day, 6 days a week on it with no vacation for 
 multiple years. Based on the kinds of people I've seen succeeding in the PhD program, that's what you have to do.
- I have found the ""chemistry"" and ""quantum"" parts of computational quantum chemistry to be less enjoyable than the computational/mathematical/data analysis parts. So I think that it may be right for me to go into a field focusing more on that. I do have an interest in the physical sciences, but I don't think it's enough to really propel me to the postgrad level.

I have done a fairly large amount of using python for number crunching, and C++ for heavy calculations. Nothing super complex in either (in terms of how deep my CS knowledge goes; it was all self-taught to achieve specific goals for my research). I don't have anything published and probably won't. I did quite well in my upper level statistics and applied math courses, although I have not put much thought into prob + stat courses for quite a while (I'm sure I could refresh myself on them pretty well, though). 

I've been considering what sort of direction I can take my career if I leave my PhD. The field I'm researching, computational chemistry, absolutely requires a PhD, even in industry. So that's out. I won't really miss it anyway. Other jobs I've been considering are data scientist, data analyst, software engineer, actuary, chem/math teacher... I think I could do well at any of those, but hopping between different fields is hard and I'm sure it would be advantageous to focus on a primary one. Some of my primary ""wants"" in whatever job I take will be:

- having more than a pittance of free time (In a PhD, you are sort of indoctrinated to feel guilty basically any spare minute which isn't work, even if nobody is explicity pushing you on a given day)

-reasonably interesting in a quantitative way (won't just be doing the same thing for years and years)

- Hopefully will not have to get another degree. Some certifications or a few courses are okay, but I don't want to go back to school full time for a masters or something else.

- Hopefully not too formal of a setting. I'm sure I won't be able to wear a t-shirt and jeans every day like you can in grad school, but if I have to actually wear formal business attire constantly, I will not like that at all.

I'm sure I would start by taking the P and FM exam, but I don't know what I'd do after that. I have good quantitative skills that I use constantly in my comp chem research, and decent programming/scripting skills. However I don't really have any specific financial or business training, and I am somewhat rusty on prob and stat (the math I use for research is much more aligned with calculus &amp; linear algebra). Would online (free) resources be enough for at least passing those two exams, and would passing those two exams be enough to get my foot in the door, and a non-dead end entry level job?

If I do leave my PhD program, it'll be with a M. Phil degree in chemistry, and it'll be in December or January. I won't have much to do until then, except teach an undergrad course or two, but I don't think that will add up to more than 15 hours a week or so. I may have to get another part time job to pay my rent until I can leave with the masters, but if I can manage it, I'd like to spend some of that time preparing for whatever I'm going to do next.

Edit: Forgot to mention a probably important point... my job history is pretty sparse. During college I had a summer internship at a government ocean water protection/chemistry lab. I've tutored calc, chem, and algebra for years. I got paid as a research assistant &amp; adjunct during my PhD program. That's it, except my dad giving me 100$ to organize files at his law firm for one spring break during college."

#### Part 1 / 3

This day in the height of summer in the city played out like any other. Highrises sprouted from the rich concrete soil, exploding skyward in pedestals of glass and stone and steel. The sun beat down onto the cement, and the cement simply spit the heat back out in contempt, slowly cooking everyone caught in the crossfire. But the city's heartbeat pounded on nonetheless: cars fought for pole position in the race to get to the next red light, foot traffic strolled alongside on the sidewalk, and flocks of birds moved from this electrical wire to the next. Ringtones blared, lattes were poured, and people moved.

And of course, as usual, everyone fucked in broad daylight.

At the tiny coffee bar in the lobby of the massive Livingston Financial building, the morning crowd gathered. A barista called out orders and left them waiting at the bar for the few seconds it took for them to be scooped up and carried away. At the cashier, a pleasant young girl was busy taking orders from a line of businessmen. As each man finished announcing his order, he would step off to the side and unbuckle his belt where a second girl, waiting on her knees, would begin fellating him with intent. 

This morning, a sprightly blonde college-aged girl sat patiently on her haunches wearing nothing more than a green apron with a white logo on it. This particular apron looked like heavy cream from the coffee bar had been liberally splashed all over it and allowed to dry there. Her pert pink breasts bounced jubilantly out from around the edges of the seed-soaked apron as she smiled with starry blue eyes gazing obediently upward, her delicate hand quickly stroking a customer to completion. The man, in the middle of a phone call, muted his cell out of courtesy and stared down at the beautiful girl as she dutifully finished her work. She opened her mouth wide as the moment arrived, stroking and sucking out every last drop from his aching tip. A few droplets dribbled off of her chin and mingled with the others on her apron.

""Thanks for coming! Your order will be ready in just a minute,"" she stated with a giggle as the man sighed with relief and stepped aside to sheathe himself while making room for the next customer.

At the lobby concierge, two parties consisting of three businesspeople each converged and shook hands as though meeting for the first time regarding a successful business deal. At the lead of the group on one side, a dark-skinned woman with neatly-kept natural hair shook hands with the tall, handsome Hispanic man leading his associates in the other group. ""It's so nice to finally meet you in person, Ms. Baker,"" stated the man as he shook her hand firmly.

""Please, Ricardo -- call me Camilla,"" the woman stated with a coy smile. The other group members greeted each other warmly, and then almost as if continuing a natural conversation beat, began fucking.

Ricardo wrapped one of his thick, heavy hands gently but firmly around Camilla's throat and grabbed a fistful of her hair with the other before pulling her head back and chewing gently on her neck and earlobe. *""Okay, Camilla,""* he whispered into her ear as her face melted with glee. The woman moaned before gathering her wits enough to begin forcefully unfastening the man's pants, exposing a pair of gray boxer briefs which she yanked aside so that she could begin stroking at the meat beneath.

By this time, the other associates around them had paired off and were nearly half-naked. A woman with a tight, raven-haired updo was on her knees playing with a line of spit that had traced between her partner's cock and her blood-red lips. Another man slammed her partner down over the concierge desk, hiking her skirt up over her ass and inserting himself into her wetness in one single, practiced motion. She moaned in release as he began pounding her from behind, the clapping of their thighs echoing throughout the lobby. A man next to them who was asking for directions at the desk simply moved aside to make more room for them and continued his conversation.

Among all this, Aine stumbled confusedly like a wounded animal in the middle of an active warzone.

She was smartly dressed, as would be expected of a first-day intern. A fashionable gray pencil skirt clung tightly to white, milky thighs and stretched down to the knee, capped off at the bottom with modestly high, glossy black heels. A white keyhole blouse clasped at her neck, leaving just a hint of creamy skin exposed at either of her shoulders and through the stylish cutout at her chest, leaving the rest of her substantial cleavage to be imagined. Her curly shoulder length hair had been up in a clasp, but that was lost now, and fiery curls bounced about with the rest of her body as she walked.

Rather, she was stumbling: one of her heels had broken in the scuttling she'd done to get from the 25th floor down to the lobby to begin with. And instead of two modestly-sized gaps in fabric at the shoulders, one was torn long down to the arm, leaving the fabric splayed below one of her elbows. A white brassiere strap flopped helplessly over her arm as she walked as purposefully as she could, leaving one of her breasts wobbling about unsupported. Her green eyes were wide and confused, as though she were wearing magnifying glasses. Behind her, a small bag of luggage rolled, and she yanked angrily at it while shouldering the briefcase slung haphazardly over her shoulder.

She would have watched where she was going, if she wasn't so intent on getting a car secured on her ridesharing app: one was right around the corner now. *""Getting the bloody... fucking hell... out of this place...""* she mumbled to herself as she summoned the car. Her single-heeled footfalls sounded like a peg-legged pirate pulling a wagon. ""Get me... the bloody *oh!*--""

Aine bumped into a man unexpectedly and looked sheepishly into his glassy, distracted eyes.

""Oh gosh sir, I'm so sorry,"" she stated in her wry Irish accent. ""I didn't... see...""

Aine's apology sputtered and ran out of fuel as her eyes glanced down from the man's face and finally fell to his hips, where a pair of women waited on their knees, tending to a rather sizable, dripping-wet staff of an erection that was protruding from his zipper. One of the girls, a brunette with a ferocious look in her eye, drilled her own face with the head of his cock as though she needed it to breathe. The other, an older woman with a streak of silver in her short jet-black bob, licked tenderly at the shaft and searched desperately at the zipper for his balls so that she might lick those too. The both of them had their tits folded out of their blouses so that he could enjoy the ensemble of breasts, eyes, and lips in his lap.

The brunette cleared her mouth with an audible *pop* and spit the excess of the man's precum and saliva back onto his cockhead as she looked cordially up at Aine with a lipstick-smeared smile. ""Oh fuck, are you okay hon? I'm so sorry!""

""Fucking hell!"" Aine gasped as she stumbled back, nearly falling flat over her luggage.

""Oh my gosh, so sorry!"" the older woman said. ""Morning rush and all. Did you need a turn? You're just in time! He's almost ready, I think.""

Aine never heard the friendly query -- she was too busy staring at the scene that she realized was playing out around her in the lobby, past the windows, into the streets outside, horrified that it wasn't confined to the 25th floor where she had just decided to make her first day at work into her last. The women returned to their morning blowjob in the middle of the lobby, politely taking turns basting the man's cock with spit and sucking him ever closer to the inevitable. 

The concierge, the coffee bar, the bus stop outside, the lounge, right on the sidewalk in the shade where it was a bit cooler -- nearly everyone was either fucking, having an orgasm, or cleaning up after having just finished.

*""Oh dear Lord,""* Aine mumbled to herself.

#### Part 2 / 3

""ShareCar for... *Anne? Ayne?*"" the driver struggled, squinting at the app on his dashboard as though doing so would help him get the pronunciation right.

""Aine. Pronounced *An-ya*,"" the girl growled as she violently threw her luggage over the passenger seat into the empty back seats.

""Ah, yes... I see,"" the man stated as he dodged the edge of the bag, watching carefully as his passenger all but threw herself into the front seat in the same fashion. She slammed the door behind her and spilled her briefcase at her feet, splaying her red hair all over her own face.

""Just drive, if you could?"" she asked with fevered worry.

""A visitor from overseas,"" he observed, sampling Aine's accent. ""Welcome to the 'States. Where to?""

""Straight to the *fucking airport*,"" Aine demanded, whipping the seatbelt across her chest.

The madness didn't stop as the car drove down the main boulevard and back towards the airport to what Aine hoped was a hasty escape. As the sedan changed lanes to dodge around a bus, Aine noticed that it was nearly full in capacity, and many of the people on board were engaged in just as lewd of conduct as she had seen at the office. One woman's breasts were pressed flat against the glass as she was roughly taken from behind. She kept one hand braced against the glass to stop her head from bashing into it, and another hand thumbed lazily through her phone. Her face contorted now and again every time her partner hit the right spot, and finally she tossed the phone aside and slapped the window as she gnashed her teeth and bucked back into him. Her eyes rolled white and her jaw slacked loose as her partner pounded her cunt into an oil slick, rattling the window with every thrust.

Aine groaned in a mixture of shame and fear. She reached beneath the gap in her blouse and produced a cross, which she kissed gently as she began mumbling a prayer to herself.

""So, uh... that's Irish I hear in your voice, Aine?"" the driver asked. Nothing was worse than a ShareCar driver making smalltalk, and it was doubly worse as Aina was quietly begging the saints to save her from whatever madness had taken over the world.

She glanced at the app the driver had secured to his dashboard. It displayed a map of the city, with a blue arrow at the center calmly navigating the gray lines of the streets, and a red box all too far away representing the airport. His name appeared at the top -- *Warren*.

""Yes, *Warren*, I'm from Ireland,"" Aine snapped, ""where *none of this fucking shite is happening*.""

Warren smiled a casual, friendly smile. ""Yeah, the UK isn't on board yet, are they?""

There was a long silence -- *I don't know what that means and I don't care*, she thought to herself as the minutes passed. The possibilities streamed through Aine's head like streaks of water over a window as she clasped her cross and rocked gently back and forth.

""Is... is it a disease or something?"" she ventured.

""Sorry?"" Warren stated.

""Like... like a *Walking Dead* thing? Some sickness affecting everyone?"" she wondered, before her eyes fell still and her skin drained even more ghastly white. ""Am... am I infected?""

""Well if there's a sickness, then everyone's got it,"" Warren chuckled. His smile melted away as he saw the look on Aine's face when she whipped her head to his, her eyes boiling with anxiety and fear as though she were just as likely to stab either him or herself to death with one more wrong word. ""Uh... no, no it's not a sickness.""

Aine nodded, carefully; she wasn't sure if she believed it, but that would have to for now. ""How... how long has it been like this?""

Warren sighed and ballooned his cheeks as he did the math. ""Gosh, I don't know. Few months now? You don't watch a lot of international news, do you?""

It had been a whirlwind -- finals, the internship, plane tickets, breakups, goodbyes. She had only been able to afford to fly in on the first day of the Livingston internship, arriving at 4:45 AM. The company shuttle had picked her up from the airport, and she hadn't even bothered checking in at the hotel yet: she wanted to be smart, on time, and ready to sieze the day. *The intern should be the first one at the office*, she'd said to herself, and so she was.

""Is there... I mean, is this like a special sort of... *rule* in this city?"" Aine asked drunkenly.

""I mean, you must have heard about the GLAMOR Act?"" Warren asked, her silence indicating that no, she had not.

""*'Genitive Liberty and Monetary Replacement?'*"" he offered again. ""You're in finance, right? Didn't I just pick you up from the Livingston building--""

Aine hissed with anger. ""--*what the fuck is the*... Genitive... Liberty? Wait, people pay for things... with sex?""

""It's more complicated than that,"" Warren offered with a careful tone as he swerved to dodge a motorcycle. ""Lots of people just kinda go at it for the fun. But yeah, payment is one part of it.""

Aine boggled. ""Only that? How the hell is the economy intact?""

""How have you not heard of this,"" boggled Warren, ""it's the biggest piece of international news since Brexit--""

*""Can ye answer the fuckin' question?""* Aine scowled, the less composed part of her Irish lilt breaking through in the rage.

""Government says this is one of -- three, I think? -- trial cities,"" Warren wondered. ""Something like that. So far the economy's booming here. No idea how it all works. Heck, I was hoping *you'd tell me why!*"" he added with a chuckle.

Suddenly it all made sense to Aine. *A globally-rated financial firm in a major US city,* she thought to herself. *One where finance isn't about currency anymore... oh God in heaven...*

The morning Aine had arrived before the massive skyscraper had more than a handful of people, she'd asked a maintenance worker how to get to the right office, and she'd felt his greasy eyes piercing her body as she walked away. Once she arrived at the office, even the receptionist -- a lithe young blonde girl not much older than her -- had given her a bit of the eye as well. *Perhaps currency,* she wondered, *is how attractive you are?*

But it was, as Warren had said, more than that. The first morning meeting in the massive conference room, she had introduced herself as the new overseas intern from Kilkenny county, New Ross, Ireland, who was so excited at the chance to work for such a successful firm fresh out of school, and so on. She'd humblebragged about her academics, her extracurriculars, her stellar track record. Everyone had clapped as she stood alongside the other interns, proud and excited.

Then, people just started fucking.

Two of the American interns all but ripped each others' clothes off and fucked on the table. A few got down on the floor and started working there, and others used the privacy glass for leverage. One of the boys who Aine had originally fancied as quite a handsome young man suddenly tried to undo her blouse, and she screamed and fled.

But there were more hands and eyes and hardons and wet slits in the rest of the office, no matter where she looked or what corner she turned. Things spiraled out of control, and she was taken by surprise by the floor manager and the young secretary girl who'd given her a look when she'd first arrived. The manager tried to pin her down on the floor, and the secretary had locked lips with her and grabbed at her breasts with her tiny hands in a fever, desperately trying to breach Aine's mouth with her tongue. Aine could still taste the girl's lipgloss on her teeth.

She settled, as much as she could for the insane explanation. *No matter, then,* she thought. *Back on the plane, and back home...*

But a thought clawed a chill from Aine's brainstem as it slid all the way down her spine. ""Everyone pays for things here with sex,"" she stated.

""That's right,"" Warren answered cordially.

""Only sex,"" she continued. ""Not cash.""

""Totally. We don't have paper money anymore, really,"" Warren replied. ""They sent collectors to burn it all weeks ago. Melted down the coins too, I think.""

A stunning realization settled over Aine, and her face fell limp. She stared at her own dumbstruck ghost in the reflection of the car's windshield. ""What about... at the--""

""--the airport? Yeah, when you go to purchase a ticket at the desk? You'll be asked to pay."" Warren stated.

Aine's eyes glanced back and forth as she searched for exits from the imaginary situation -- an attendant at the airline desk asking for her passport, and inevitably, for her to lean herself up against the kiosk and hike up her skirt so he could enter her. ""I... I have money,"" she reasoned, clutching her briefcase. ""I've got at least a thousand Euro in my checking account...""

""Yeah, we don't use any currency here anymore,"" replied Warren. ""Not even international. Just sex. For everything financial. *So* much easier.""

Aine followed the train of reason down the maddening railway of logic Warren was attempting to help her understand. ""I have credit cards...""

""Under EU credit standards,"" Warren replied as he changed lanes to avoid a slowly rumbling garbage truck. ""The new credit agency here revolves around how well you've repaid your non-tendered debt, and you, uh... well I'm guessing you don't have any credit history here.""

A certain dizziness spilled over Aine as she slowly realized the truth: there was nowhere she could go without getting fucked. The airport would have one line to check in bags and scan papers, and another line for *payment*. The bus she'd seen, full of passengers fucking for fun, they'd all have to fuck for business eventually. She imagined a weekend queue at the transportation department building at the city center, with throngs of people paying for their monthly civic transport passes...

""Hasn't the serum set in yet?"" Warren asked.

Aine glared at him with clover-green, terrified eyes. ""What the bloody hell do you mean?""

""Usually takes about three hours. You said you arrived just this morning, right?""

""I did, yes.""

""Did you go through customs?"" he continued. ""Show your passport, declare your things?""

""Yes.""

""Did they have you update your vaccinations at the medical center there?"" Warren asked as he ran the yellower edge of a red light. ""They usually just give the shots to everyone right there, in a medical room at customs or something. You sign the forms, they take you over...""

Aine froze completely. She remembered: the queue for the medical room, the syringe in her vein, the cold sensation of the fluid, her pen signing the carbon copy form. *""Give it a few hours and you'll be good to go,""* the nurse had told her.

""What... what's a... what serum?"" Aine mumbled with a paralyzed face.

----

#### Part 3 / 3

""We've got an experimental economy to run here,"" Warren explained. ""The serum is just... how we make it work. I'm so sorry you had to learn this the hard way.""

The rest of the words registered with Aine somehow, but they were muffled by the sensation of blood pouding between in her ears. A blinding dizziness set in as her vision began to white out. Everything seemed to move more slowly, and as Warren drove on through the busy city street, Aine felt like she was riding a great, lazily swimming whale. Countless cars swam by them, like schools of giant metal fish.

""I mean, you know all about the basics I'm sure, supply and demand... you're one of those financial types. So the serum makes sure there's enough of both, you know? Makes women get hungry,"" he stated, causally navigating traffic. ""Sometimes *real* hungry. Make sure you get to the hospital if it hits you too hard.""

She would have been brutally annoyed by her chatty driver, but the inside of Aine's head turned to a fog, as though her brain was still quite functional, but had suddenly evaporated. Everything felt light: her limbs, her head, the car itself, as though it might take flight and sail into the sun.

""Us guys take it, and you know, we... *produce more*, if you know what I mean. But this stuff makes us regenerate it harder, and a lot of it,"" Warren explained as he flipped a turn signal and merged into another lane. ""Our libido spikes a bit, but most men, we're already up there, you know?""

Aine looked down at her body, slowly, like a baby learning to use its neck muscles. Her hands were limp in her lap, and had ripped the cross from her neck by accident. It slid out of her palm and fell down between the door and the seat as a bump in the road loosened her grip.

*""No,""* she mumbled helplessly, barely able to form the sounds. *""Nnn.""*

""So, there you have it: supply and demand,"" concluded Warren. ""I mean, *realistically* it doesn't make any sense that it'd work but, here we are. I mean, it's funny that nobody ever thought of this idea before...""

Then, between Aine's legs was a *burning*, suddenly. A comfortable, desirable warmth, welcome like an electric blanket on a cold night. The button nestled safely in her lips and clenched tightly between her thighs swelled and bloomed -- she was completely conscious of the feeling as though she were filling it herself, like pouring a glass of water. As the seconds passed, the heat became something she couldn't ignore, as though she'd been looking forward to seeing her ex-boyfriend in college and he'd just walked through the door looking proper handsome. She felt her lips blossom open at the very thought of him pounding her into the mattress.

""I mean, there's still plenty I don't understand,"" Warren started anew, oblivious to the girl falling apart next to him. ""The stock exchange is totally different now -- man, it gets *super messy* there, too...""

Aine stared straight down now. Her breasts were there, heavy and thick as ever. The blouse was rather revealing from her point of view, looking down the valley of her cleavage beneath her chin, and she enjoyed them. They were large and round enough to settle all the way down to her bellybutton, even with her brassiere on. They were the next things to regain feeling -- the entire mass of flesh became outstandingly sensitive. Each nipple yearned with a tingle that Aine had only known when she was masturbating herself in the bathtub and her breasts ached with a need that would only be satisifed if she clutched and pinched at them tightly.

""But I guess there's some serious math that goes into the uh... the 'index' I guess it's called? Now there's this separate one for the *'value'* of sex. Changes based on how much need there is for different stuff? Oral and plain old intercourse, I guess those are the commodities. Anal is always super valuable -- not my thing, mind you...""

Suddenly, she was back in the car seat again, feeling quite familiar in her own skin, except for the sensations beneath her blouse and between her thighs that were nagging at her, reminding her over and over with every beat of her heart that they had *need*. Her brain began to solidify, and her hearing slowly faded back in.

Aine looked at her image in the windshield again: the face staring back at her was smiling. The reflection sipped the pool of saliva that was gathering under her tongue, and licked her lips. She looked hungry.

""Anyway, look,"" Warren began with a fateful tone, ""my last fare paid me *really* well. You seem like you're in a bit over your head... let's get you to the airport. No fare.""

""Yes,"" Aine finally said, but the words had fallen out of her mouth as if by accident. Her fingernails absentmindedly caressed her own thigh, and chills erupted over her skin, edging the sensation that was simmering in her chest and between her legs, threatening to boil it over.

""Do you have family you can contact?"" Warren asked. ""Or I don't know, try the Irish consulate, they'll probably fly you home.""

""No,"" Aine replied distantly. Her body was fearfully still, as though worried some movement would trigger further eruptions of sensation over her flesh. *How am I... so close...* she wondered distantly.

As her vision finally cleared from its hazy, blurred state, she blinked her eyes slowly, and it was as though she were Dorothy stepping out from her battered house into the Techinicolor world of Oz. The gray, bland concrete was nearly phosphorescent: the sunlight seemed to splash brilliantly through the dirt and grime. Rows of vehicles were now life-sized, brightly colored children's toys racing to infinity on a glowing plastic race track.

""Oh my,"" Aine whimpered happily as she smiled.

""We should be there in ten or so -- ah hell,"" Warren grumbled as he drew in behind a slow line of cars that seemed to stretch for a mile down the dark concrete boulevard. They grinded to a stop there behind a column of tail lights. ""Better make it fifteen...""

As Warren turned his gaze to his passenger for the first time in a few moments, it was immediately evident what was happening. Aine glared at him amorously from under the prison bars of her eyelashes, an intentful smile curling gently over her freckled face as she parted her lips slightly and threw the seatbelt's strap over her shoulder. Her fingers unhooked the top clasp of her blouse, and her arms slid from her sleeves before letting the wispy cloth crumple around her tummy, leaving two massive, lace-sheathed breasts in between her and Warren.

""Oh,"" Warren mumbled, looking at the masses of pale flesh which were very well-concealed beneath Aine's loosely flowing blouse just a moment ago. Even in his position, driving between fares all over town and accepting payments, once in a long while he still saw something that stunned him. ""Wow.""

""D'you like?"" Aine's voice asked knowingly as her forearms squeezed against the outsides of her tits as if to show off how soft and pillowy they were.

""Look... you can still make it home,"" Warren said slowly. ""It's okay. I'm not even sure if I can... if, uh--""

Before he could finish speaking, Aine's palm was placed just below her clavicle while the other peeled the lacy white brassiere cup down over the edge of her massive, creamy breast, folding the lacy fabric underneath. Hands switched sides to uncup the other. Her arms squeezed again to bounce her tits together, and soft cerise pink nipples appeared at the outside center of each. A familiar sensation seethed beneath Warren's lap.

""You gon' to gawk or answer, then?"" asked Aine with a pout.

She considered the man -- he was plain but friendly. A neatly-combed head of black hair, clean-shaven face, medium build. Strong forearms showing from the sleeves of a neat but casual polo shirt. A bit olive-skinned, smooth and clear. Dark jeans, the button-down kind. At that moment, he might as well have been a naked fitness model.

""Aine,"" Warren said, swallowing a knot of ice. ""Let's... I can take the expressway instead... instead of the... streets...""

Aine's hands, unsatisfied with his response, unlocked her seatbelt and laid across the center column, then into Warren's lap before settling the weight of her gently swaying breasts firmly into his thighs. They settled one over the other, like a stack of overfull water balloons. ""What's hiding here?"" her voice exclaimed in mock surprise. Her elbow rested against Warren's door as her palm massaged gently around Warren's lap where the delicate head might be. ""Give us a peek then, yeah?""

Warren gazed into two green, glassy pools, glistening with the same light that seemed to sparkle in everyone's eyes. ""Aine,"" he sighed.

""Don't look up here, love,"" Aine's voice said as her hand began unbuckling, unfastening, and unbuttoning. ""Look down there.""

Warren did. Aine's hungry hands produced a long, engorged cock from the unlocked vault of his jeans. *""Ooh,""* her voice purred, the tongue licking her lips. ""Here's a bold lad."" The wet heat of the girl's mouth was enough to stifle any further complaints.

Aine remembered the time her ex-boyfriend gave her a surprise visit in the dormitory at university. She hugged him so tightly, so happily, and dragged him off to her room without so much as an introduction to any of her friends. The moment the door to her suite was closed, her mouth was within his, and a few minutes later, she was on her knees as she knew he liked, plunging her mouth around his cock.

Her tongue fluttered under the tip, greasing it with warm, hungry spit as it slinked about, searching for the spot that would make him moan. When he did, she drove the length of it into her mouth, pursing her lips at the corners to baste the spit all the way down to the root, then to suck as much of it on the way back up. A slow, steady stroke began, and his head tilted back helplessly.

Warren grunted as she settled into a rhythm, and gazed down at her to try to understand what was happening, only to find a pile of red hair, big tits, and greedy eyes scowling up at him. Aine's hand found a way to grab the shaft of his cock while her other hand squeezed at one of her breasts for a moment before venturing down to the pencil skirt that had hiked up just under her ass in the adjustment.

She remembered the way her man would start to thrust into her as she found the pattern he liked. She would just hold her head there patiently in place while he fucked her face like a toy, focusing her best to keep her mouth and tongue in the exact shape he wanted.

Warren's hips bucked up from beneath Aine a bit, bouncing her with every pump as her mouth waited patiently for him. Her voice laughed that certain laugh that a woman can only give with a mouthful of cock that she knows she has completely at her mercy. Warren's aching tip speared the inside of her cheek over and over as her tongue silently tortured him from within, teasing out a steady, sticky stream of precum.

Aine remembered the feeling that she'd learned to sense, the one when the moment approached: her lover's thighs would grow tight like steel, his balls would clench themselves up in preparation to empty themselves, and he'd grow strangely still. The control would be given back to her so that she could tend to him properly and suck the load out of him while she gazed into his eyes to see if she could sense the exact moment when the inevitable warm spatter would surge into her mouth.

Warren held back after a short while of pumping her face, and Aine's mouth only found this as a welcome to attack. She redoubled her efforts: tongue swirling, mouth sucking, fluids simmering out from the edges in long strings of bubbly spittle and precum. Warren glared down at her and struggled to hold on to the sensation. Aine's eyes didn't break their gaze. Warren quickly realized there was nothing he could do, and his breathing began huffing with rhythm.

""Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!"" Aine moaned, counting on it.

Aine's open mouth began slowly rubbing the tip of his red, urgently erupting hardness with the flat of her tongue as burst after burst of milky white cum painted the inside of her mouth, the both of them moaning furiously as it did. A surprise blast in the middle of his orgasm sprayed over Aine's cheek and sprinkled through her hair, and then another splashed off of her cheek as she adjusted, splattering almost invisibly over one of her massive, creamy-skinned tits. Her voice giggled with utter joy as her mouth swallowed the load of hot spit and cum without a second thought, and continued sucking until she could be sure Warren had given her the rest of it.

Eventually he was all but passed out in the driver's seat. The girl sat up back in the passenger's seat and happily fingered the droplets of cum from her breast. Her face looked confusedly at her hand as she did: it was soaked to the bone in her own fluids. Aine's eyes glanced down at the passenger seat beneath her, where an apple-sized dollop of her own juices had soaked over her leg and into the cloth of the passenger's seat. She had orgasmed as well, at least once -- she'd not even noticed it. She didn't even remember rubbing herself.

""We're settled up then?"" Aine's voice asked Warren as her hand cleaned itself on her tongue.

""Wh... what?"" he asked confusedly.

""The fare, love,"" her voice replied happily.

""Yeah,"" Warren replied, checking the road again finally. The car ahead had barely moved. ""Yeah.""

""Grand,"" Aine's voice cooed. ""I'll walk the rest of the way. Thanks!"" With that, her hand keyed the lock, opened the door, and she shuffled herself from the vehicle.

""W-wait..."" mumbled Warren.

Aine stumbled down the boulevard of the massive, beautiful city and its warm, festive glow that seemed to blossom from every surface. *Things are so lovely here*, she thought to herself as Warren shouted from the driver's seat that she had forgotten her bags. It was far more than that: she had forgotten her bags existed.

Not completely aware of anything beyond the sensation of her heavy, freckled tits in the breeze, and the slowly re-escalating sensation of want brimming with every swish of her thighs, Aine kicked off her good shoe and stepped on her own heel to peel off the broken one. *Where do I need to go again?* she wondered, struggling to remember. *Where do I go...*

She did remember the car, the airport, and Warren -- she happily tasted salty remnants of him on her palate. Her memory of him seemed to wane as the taste diluted. She remembered the bus full of people enjoying their bodies as he drove her around town. She hoped to see him again someday.

She remembered the lobby of the Livingston building. She remembered the coffee shop there lined with happily serviced people, the casual business meeting at the concierge, and the pair of women pleasuring a businessman together in the lobby with their mouths. She remembered their eager, ravenous eyes, like they'd not had their breakfast and were hungry for something. Like they hadn't taken their morning medicine, the one that they needed to function properly.

She remembered the 25th floor, and the eruption of hungry lust that had suddenly overtaken everyone. She remembered introducing herself to everyone, and she remembered the way one of the handsome boys had glanced at her breasts while she did. She remembered the conference room full of her new co-workers desperately fucking and sucking each other to completion. She remembered the secretary's lip gloss, and the floor manager's rough, heavy hands. 

Aine remembered where she needed to go: she was late for work. Maybe if she took the subway, she could make it back in time to join them."

Unfortunately, I just failed my Platform Developer I exam today(Failed by two questions... sigh). I'm not too upset with failing, because I tried to cram too much information into a small period of time to study, so I'll learn from this and take much more time to study when I retake it within a year. I know a lot of jobs require the cert, but does anyone know how difficult it is to get a Salesforce Dev job without it? I'm a CS Major and I have three internships under my belt, with my current one actually being a Salesforce Dev internship. I'm actually admin certified, so I got knowledge of the platform but I'm unsure how difficult it will be to get a dev job right out of college. 

Also, I know that I'm young and I have time to retake the exam eventually and I know that my future is by no means hindered because I failed, I'm simply just curious. Don't mean to come off as bragging so if I do, sorry about that. "
8wmm7a,16,2018-07-06,GF's (23f) Dad is terminally ill. Should I (25m) propose while we still have time? Together 3 years.,cbkcbk,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8wmm7a/gfs_23f_dad_is_terminally_ill_should_i_25m/,"Danielle and I started seeing each other during my last semester at college. We both had just gotten out of long term relationships, but we were so incredibly fond of each other we decided to continue seeing each other even though we both were looking forward to the single life. We spent a ton of time together during my last semester. I repeatedly found myself thinking, could this girl be any more perfect?

After I graduated, I moved to a new city 5 hours away to start my career. We weren't sure if distance was going to work for us, but we wanted to try. And, we made it work! It took a lot of sacrifice and a TON of driving, but to us it was undoubtedly worth it because our relationship was just that good. During our first summer while we were doing distance, Dani got an internship in my city. During this time, she lived with me for three months. We used this time as a ""Trial run"" to see how compatible we really are and verify the distance was worth it. We had a fantastic summer and we both knew it was worth it to continue the distance for the next year and a half.

About 6 months after that summer, we got news her father has stage 4 lung cancer (hereditary, he never even smoked). Tumors had spread in his lungs and brain. This was devastating for her and her family. It was for me as well, but over time I learned how to support her as best as I could. The treatment plan for him was to put him on a new medicine that had proven to be very effective, however the average time this medicine lasts is 11 months. The longest it has ever worked was 7 years. Once the medicine stops working, the tumors return, and more traditional treatment resumes to remove the tumors. 

Her father is her biggest role model. He quickly became one of my biggest role models as well. He truly is an amazing, successful, kind, great man and I strive to be more like him. He means an incredible amount to Danielle.

On to the present. Danielle graduated this past March and has since moved to my city to begin her career. We have been living together in our apartment for 3 months and it has been amazing. We have a cat together and could not be happier, we have so much fun together and have a solid relationship in every aspect. 

However, just last week we got news the brain tumors have started growing again as they have found 4 new tumors. The medicine is no longer taking affect. No one has any idea what is to come or how much time we have left. Gamma knife surgery is scheduled  to remove the tumors. This was obviously once again devastating (cancer is such a terrible experience the way it pushes and pulls you). 

I know I want to marry Danielle eventually. I truly do not want to be with anyone else. In fact, when we initially heard the news he had cancer, we discussed marriage at that time because of badly she wants him at her wedding. At that time I said I couldn't get married then, not while we were long distance and not before we lived together. I told her I didn't feel right being pushed into a decision as big as marriage and it needs to come on my own terms or else it could lead to disaster or resentment. 

It was always my plan to live together for at least a year before popping the question. I know I want to marry this girl and am committed to her, but I was not planning on getting married until I was at least 28. But, due to the circumstances I am considering buying a ring. It means so much to her to have her dad at her wedding, and it would mean a lot to me too. However, I don't like the idea of getting married before I'm ready to take that leap. It's a scary thought for me, as it is for most people. But, I have no reservations when I think about spending the rest of my life with this woman. If I asked her today, I know she would say yes. I guess I'm looking for advice from those married couples out there. Neither Danielle nor myself would want to be married so young under normal circumstances, but in this case I'm wondering if it would be worth it for us to have that experience with her dad while we still can? 

TL;DR Not sure if GF's dad has more than a year left. I plan on marrying her one day but was not planning on doing so for a few more years. Is it worth it to pop the question now so he can be at our wedding?"

I was pretty confident that my feelings were reciprocated at the time. We would go back and forth with banter and talk about things we had in common. The coworker would text and snapchat me back and generally act warm towards me. However, I’ve been getting really mixed signals lately. Last week, we hung out after work, just the two of us, and it went well but nothing happened. But since then he’s been holding back and not answering my snaps/texts. Every once and a while we will have a fun interaction but it seems different. I asked him to hang out after work again today and I got a dumb excuse. 

I’m not a physical flirter but I make sure to always make eye contact, smile, give compliments, ect. Maybe that’s not enough. 

I’m starting to think that I waited too long to tell him how I feel. But I was hoping to get more feedback from him first. He’s a pretty good communicator, so I don’t understand why he would hold back if he did like me. 

What should I do? I just want to tell him but I’m too shy. Should I text him? Should I just give up? I can’t tell if I’m doing too much or not enough.

8wnm7k,1,2018-07-06,"I'm not satisfied by the time, effort and attention my girlfriend is giving me.",PeeAlright,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wnm7k/im_not_satisfied_by_the_time_effort_and_attention/,"Me and my girlfriend are both 19, and have been dating for almost a year. And it has been amazing. She's the best thing that has ever happened to me and meeting her has changed my life for the better very dramatically. We're both in a residential college and for 8 months a year we see each other every day. But, as we're from different cities, for 4 months in a year we have to stay apart. Currently, we're having our 2-month-vacation. 
A couple of weeks ago she got a summer job and things have been really hectic for her. She's also very social and has tons of friends. I, on the other hand, have decided not to expend my energies at an internship or job and have decided to spend my time off, on a holiday. Ever since, she got the job, she has been extremely busy and her days have been very hectic. And since she doesn't have a lot of time, we haven't been talking to each other, as much as we used to. Now, initially I tried to be as supportive as I could be. I was being the best boyfriend I could be and was doing everything I could to support her. She's also having family trouble and hence, one night when we were talking on the phone she was crying and was pretty upset about her parents and other domestic issues. In order to make her feel better after she slept, I sent her 100 messages so that she feels better, in the morning. They were all positive and encouraging. The next morning however, she didn't acknowledge them at all. However, I still didn't pay much attention to it and was still supportive. Then later she had to go to a party the next day and I was still being supportive and understanding and not making her feel bad for the lack of attention she was giving me. However, the next day I did get a bit upset, and told her that I understand that she's busy but she could drop a line here and there, appreciating what I was doing for her. However, she refused to do that and told me that I didn't call her as much, and hence she wasn't able to appreciate. She's always telling me to call her more. And I'm not really a call person and she's not a text person. However, we did make it work and I do call her frequently. Then that night, we fought and I told her she wasn't putting any efforts and I was the only one who gave a fuck and was being a good boyfriend. To this she said, I wasn't being a good boyfriend as I didn't call her. I did call her, for the record and I also was being very supportive otherwise doing other things that she refused to see. However a few days later we sorted it all out. But the thing is I've told her so many times to give me more attention and time, but I'm not satisfied even after that. I always feel, like she has stopped giving a fuck. I feel like I won't ever be satisfied with the amount of time she gives to me, and it's my fault. She keeps saying she's doing everything I can. Also, whenever I try to talk to her about it, she keeps saying I'm creating drama and nagging too much. I just want more of her time. And I want her to appreciate my efforts. But she gets upset everytime I bring it up and says she doesn't want to fight. And I don't want to either, but everytime we talk, I just feel she's distant and doesn't wanna talk to me and is not interested in me anymore. She's almost always busy with something or the other. 
So, after all this, for the past few days I've been cold with her and not been talking properly. For the entire day yesterday she didn't say anything but tonight she caught it and said that she missed me a lot and she sent me all these posts she wrote about that day (she's a journalism student). Then I told her, I was tired with the lack of time she was giving me and she got upset again and said she doesn't want to talk about it and said she doesn't want to fight and said we should talk after a few days. So my questions is, what do you guys think I should do now? Should I apologise to her for being too needy and clingy? Or do you think I'm right and I should hold my ground and only talk until she realizes what she's doing wrong and apologizes to me? Should I not talk to her for a few days? Please help, sorry for the long post. 

Tl;dr - Girlfriend got a new job, hasn't been giving me enough attention. Am I being too needy, or is she actually wrong? What should I do? "

I’m a current student and intern at a company focusing on the O&amp;G upstream space. I don’t have an O&amp;G background and have been trying to get up to speed on the industry and was hoping you guys could help. I did some searches so far and could not find any answers.

Would anyone happen to know the general price range a typical large O&amp;G company like Exxon, Shell, or BP would pay for reservoir simulation softwares like Schlumberger’s Petrel and Eclipse or Landmark’s Nexus program? I know the costs vary due to different variables like contract length, size of the organization, and additional modules but a general range (cost per user, per year) would be very helpful for me to at least begin to map out the price ranges. Contacting the software companies directly didn't really lead anywhere. 

Any info would help even if it's from smaller E&amp;P companies using the same or different reservoir simulation software like Emerson or Paradigm. My intern project really depends on some kind of price range. You can DM too if you don't want to share publicly.

I greatly appreciate the help, thanks!"
8woc58,0,2018-07-06,"Essay: Appreciation for the Art of Villainy, which Ant-Man does not have",Twigryph,marvelstudios,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/8woc58/essay_appreciation_for_the_art_of_villainy_which/,"Here's an excerpt from a piece I'm writing about the MCU. This section came from my feelings about Ant-Man. Curious if I can get some discussion about what I feel is the greatest failure of the film: The lack of a main theme, exacerbated and demonstrated by its dull and confusing villain. It has a bit of a lead-up, apologies for length.



**Alright, Let’s Talk Marvel’s (and everyone else’s) Villain Problem: 
Why Good Villains Make Good Stories Make Good Heroes**

Everyone knows about the MCU’s villain problem. Kevin Feige, CEO of Marvel Studios, has indicated it’s intentional - that he wanted their company to be the one that focused on the heroes. They do sell more toys, after all. He’s been quoted saying they don’t really want spotlight the baddies at all, that they’d rather make it about the hero’s inner journey. That can work - Iron Man proved as much. But Iron Man did so because, as I’ve previously written, Iron Man is both hero and villain of that story. He has a lot of personal issues to overcome. The same can’t be said of Scott Lang, who, yes, is a former criminal trying to go straight for the sake of his kid, but he still begins the film a decent person and ends the film as more-or-less the same decent person. In fact, the film goes to great lengths to reveal that his supposed ‘crime’ was more of a Robin Hood affair, protecting the little guy from the big, bad corporations and being unfairly punished it. I suppose the real journey belongs to Hank Pym, who learns to trust Hope, his daughter, with both the truth of her mother’s death and in her abilities to save the day and get home safe. But she herself also has no real character arc. In my opinion, both of these problems can be tied to the larger one in the MCU; that goshdarn villain problem. 

It’s no secret that I am and always have been a major villain fan. My favourite Disney songs were always the villain songs. The first movie I remember crying during was  1998’s Godzilla when the titular creature was killed (specifically, I can recall loving Godzilla because ‘she’ was the first female bad guy I saw who also wasn’t ‘sexy’, and that was cool and why would they kill her, she just had cute babies!). My catholic elementary school would encourage us to pray for people before bed, but I’d throw in a little prayer for the Devil at the end, since I always felt sorry for him and thought it’d be nice if Hell could be closed for good. It seemed a rather nasty place for a benevolent God to have created at all, to be honest. Oh dear, are my issues with my religious upbringing showing again? 

Point being:  I’m very, very biased. Or maybe I’ve just always had good taste. After all, it’s common knowledge amongst animators that the villains are the roles you want to animate for. There were grumbles amongst the staff who had to animate Aurora in Sleeping Beauty because she was notoriously difficult to keep on-model, dainty and blandly appealing. Those who got to sink their teeth into the voice work of George Sanders with Shere Khan created an animated performance whose study is encouraged to this day. The delicious array of emotions and twisted expressions that flash across the faces of the caricatured Jafar, Ursula, Cruella, Dr. Facilier and Captain Hook far exceed the capacity of their heroes. One could argue that even these relatively flatly evil characters have within them a greater range of humanity than any of the other characters: they are allowed to show the negative traits other characters aren’t.

To me, the best villains are those who act on the impulses we all secretly have. Some motivations may seem bland - the desire for power, greed, revenge, etc. Yet they come from human places that, if fleshed out well enough, remind us of why vices are so tempting. Who hasn’t watched the news and felt so tired with incompetence and corruption in government and thought If I ran the world, there’d be a lot less of this bullpucky? Who hasn’t seen others flaunting their extreme wealth and wondered What could I do with such riches? What dreams or good could I accomplish? And who hasn’t felt wronged in some way and wished to level the playing field? I just want you to know what it feels like.

Superhero films have often been described as wish-fulfilment fantasies. It seems to me that it’s important to have the murky flipside of that examined if you’re going to examine those fantasies critically. I’ve heard complaints about Marvel’s ‘Dark Mirror’ villains, but I don’t have a problem with the concept of a villain who reflects their hero to reveal potential negatives. The problem with the MCU’s mirrors is that they often resemble the characters in costume, but they are too shallow to be an ideological mirror. Thus the hero and their actions are never really tested or countered. They are not made to question themselves, to reflect on their own dark potential, and therefore make changes that better themselves and their heroism. 

**The best hero and villain pairings better each other. They create rivals who vie for the soul of the story, and sometimes, the audience.** 

In *The Dark Knight*, Heath Ledger’s Joker confronts Batman’s vigilantism and subversion of law by supporting complete Anarchy. After all, if the law and its legal upholders aren’t good enough to a point where a man in a Halloween costume has to brutalize poor people to keep the peace - why have law at all? Joker’s faith in the inherent cannibalism of humanity clashes against Batman’s purported belief in hope, optimism and human decency. His actions test Bruce Wayne into crossing his moral lines - making the audience and the protagonists question Batman’s entire approach to heroism. 

Nurse Ratched’s love of order on pain of humiliation clashes with Randle McMurphy’s sense of spirited freedom and camaraderie. Their clash delineates the central themes of *One Flew Over a Cuckoo’s Nest*: how power over the lives of others can influence for help or for harm. Petty, corrupting bureaucracy failing to be adequate mental health treatment, versus rebellious spirit and individualized care and empathy. 

*Schindler’s List* supplies Amon Goeth, a Nazi whose fundamental lack of humanity allows him to use those in his ‘care’ for target practice, while Oskar Schindler comes to value every individual he saves so highly that the loss of a few potential more causes him unbearable heartbreak. 
**
The rivalry between antagonist and protagonist is fundamental to the soul of a film. Narrative is often based on conflict, and without a compelling conflict, you are left with a less-than-lustery film.** 

So, who is the villain in Ant-Man? A man by the name of Darren Cross, AKA Yellowjacket. Per MCU regulation he comes with the standard ‘evil’ version of the protagonist’s powers, namely a shrinking suit but with inhuman appendages to help make him appear more monstrous and less deserving of empathy. His connection to the protagonist is distant at best - there’s some quick exposition about how he took an internship with Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man, and felt slighted when Hank didn’t teach him what he knew. He doesn’t seem to have any connection to Scott Lang, the protagonist-apparent. His relationship with Hope van Dyne, Pym’s daughter, seems more promising - both feel that Hank kept secrets and knowledge from them, despite their sacrifices and love for him. This isn’t really explored, however, and can’t be said to be the theme of the film. 

Ant-Man seems to be a film about fathers and daughters (a nice change from the usual fathers and sons that can be found in nearly every other MCU film). Scott Lang feels like he failed his daughter by being in prison instead of being present in her life. Hank Pym has actively pushed his daughter out of his own life by failing to trust her with the truth of her mother’s (the original Wasp to his Ant-Man) disappearance. That’s all fine and dandy, but these two character arcs aren’t really the focus of the film either. Scott Lang actively endangers his daughter by making himself - and therefore his loved ones - a target for Yellowjacket, and yet he faces no repercussions for this. Instead, he’s bizarrely rewarded by being welcomed into his ex-wife’s family. All he’s done is save his daughter from a danger he created - how does that show personal growth on his part? Hope proves her competence to her father and he relents on his secrecy, reforging their bond. And yet that final beat of her receiving her mother’s costume is reserved for a post-credits scene; an addendum. The only real growth is from Pym, and even then it’s difficult to say how the plot of the film conspired to change his mind. There’s a beautifully acted scene where Hope tearfully confesses her feelings of isolation and betrayal to her father, stemming from her frustration with being second fiddle to the less-competent Scott. But as a moment, it feels disconnected from the larger threat of the film. There’s no sense that the fallout of that scene is going to affect the story in a large way. 

Every emotional beat in this film lands a little flat simply because it’s difficult to connect it to the overarching story. Fighting a guy who wants to use shrinking technology as a military weapon has jag-all to do with an ex-con having trouble getting work and reconnecting with his family. One feels the film would be stronger without an antagonist at all. As it is, Darren Cross is just a jerk who kills sweet baby lambs and goes crazy, just so he can do illogical things in the climax for the sake of cool. Not even a specific kind of crazy. Just...whoops, he shrunk too much, now he’s no good at making sense. How convenient. 

**Rewrite Time**

Imagine this hypothetical Ant-Man film I’m gonna pretentiously rewrite here. The largest change I’m going to make is to the villain’s motivation: 

Scott Lang was a petty crook. During the financial crisis of 2008, his family was in danger of bankruptcy. He fell in with a bad crowd and stole to keep the lights on. He was arrested, prosecuted and served his time. He gets out of prison, wanting to go straight. However, thanks to the well-known problem of having to declare a criminal past on his job applications, he struggles to find work. Luis tries to tempt him back to a life of crime, saying that society just won’t forgive an ex-con, and he really has no other options. Hank Pym finds him and wants to use his criminal skills in conjunction with Pym tech to do the basic heist set-up of the film, as is. But in exchange, once he has control of his company back, he’ll hire Scott on for a legitimate career, ensuring he can pay child support for his daughter and lead an above-board life. 

Now, for Darren Cross. First off, Cross has a daughter. That’s right, another daughter. We’re gonna make this a father-daughter superhero movie for the ages. I’m gonna call her Avery. Cross’ teenage daughter (putting her halfway between the ages of Cassie Lang and Hope) actually has a great relationship with her father. He’s rich, and so can provide for her - guaranteeing her future (Scott’s worry). He’s very close to her, and they both confide in each other. They have a mutual respect (what Hank lacks with Hope). Now we’ve humanized Cross and made him a kinda likeable guy - sure, he’s a rich jerk, but he’s still a loving father who has something our protagonists lack. This also encourages sympathy for Hank and Scott and connects both of them in an emotional way to the antagonist. He has what they want - and he came by it unfairly. 

Unfairly how? Let’s say Darren got his wealth and control of Hank’s company through white-collar crime. Thanks to his wealth and position, he was able to hire the best lawyers and avoid jail time, even as those who suffered for his swindling went unavenged. 

Now we have a theme. Fathers and daughters, the desire to provide for one’s children - financially and emotionally - and the drastic class inequality when it comes to crime and punishment in America. Now THAT is a movie that would give me something to talk about. The sense of injustice an audience would feel to see Scott serve his time for his crimes and yet continue to be punished by society after release, even while those like Darren Cross, who did far more damage, get off scott-free would make Scott so much more compelling. That Hank, who earned his company and wealth with his intelligence and engineering, could have it stolen away by litigation by those who want to turn his life’s work into something that takes life? So frustrating! That Cross, their supposed enemy, treats his daughter with the respect and trust that Hope craves from her own father? Now we want these characters to rise up, be better, and cheer when they overcome their hurdles. 

Through the events of the film, Cross’ white-collar crimes could be publicized, and as a result his daughter feels betrayed and lied to. She tells him she doesn’t want any of his ‘dirty money’ and that she never wants to see him again. All while the long arm of the law is forced to act, now that his crimes can’t be ignored or easily bribed away. 

Now we have a reason for Cross to act unhinged - he’s had a severe emotional blow and feels like he has nothing left to lose. Unlike Scott, who’s worked for redemption and wants to find forgiveness and a way back into his daughter’s life, Darren falls into despair. Unlike Hank, who manages to have a heart-to-heart with Hope where they’re at last totally honest with each other and Hank reveals his guilt for her mother’s fate, Darren is convinced his daughter will never forgive him the truth.  Darren decides he wants revenge, just like the original script - but now his targeting of Scott’s daughter makes an emotional sense. He wants to take away from Scott what he feels was taken away from him. In addition, I might add him taking Hank hostage and trapping him like he did the miniature lambs before. That pays off that rather macabre set-up, and is a nice inversion on the damsel-in-distress trope. Now he’s also taking away and imprisoning a father away from his daughter - what happened to Scott, and what he’s afraid is about to happen to himself. A little bit of poetry there.  

Fight proceeds as before, only this time Scott is joined by a last-minute cavalry - Hope in the Wasp suit. Instead of being sidelined until a post-credits scene, now Hope gets to shine alongside Scott. A father and a daughter, kicking butt together. The father to save his daughter, the daughter to save her father. Things proceed as they do in the film, only instead of killing Yellowjacket, they break his mechanism for returning to normal size so he’s stuck at a few inches tall. After rescuing Hank first, of course. They then deliver Cross to the authorities in something humorous - like, say, Cassie’s dollhouse.

Scott can apologize to his ex-wife for putting her new family in danger, and she can realize that he’s contrite, but that the world is more difficult to navigate for him than before, and that he could use some forgiveness and compassion. Hank also makes good on getting him that new job. As for Hank and his daughter, Hope saving Hank from a terrible, shrinking fate is a nice parallel to how Hank failed to save Janet from hers. She’s proven that she can be a hero, and can maybe even succeed where he failed. 

This also has the nice effect of not sidelining the female characters, and incorporates Wasp in a more fulfilling way (since in the original you’re left wondering why she isn’t the protagonist in the first place). 

Finally, you can have a final scene of Avery Cross talking to her father in prison. They have a sweet conversation that maybe gives a little hope to their reconciliation. As a gift, she gives him some of her old miniature furniture, since his prison cell is currently still a dollhouse. Being that Ha-ha - but also, kinda sweet, and a bit of a role reversal. Now his kid daughter’s the one who has to take care of him. It’s a bit sad, but still touching, and a reminder of what age eventually does to us all. 

And there we have it. By fixing the motivation of the villain, we’ve also

* Solidified the themes of the film - and made it about something topical and relevant
* Differentiated it from Iron Man by focusing on the Father-Daughter relationship instead of the military angle
* Created new opportunities for emotion
* Made it easier to root for Scott and Hank
* Made a villain people might actually remember, and kept him alive instead of giving him the original’s gruesome death in a child’s bedroom - I thought this was supposed to be a comedy? 
* Incorporated female characters into the film in a more equal way


Now, I know making movies is a series of compromises, so it’s possible such ideas were had and lost while the project was masticated by the great Hollywood machine. Still, I feel like Marvel’s deliberate decision to weaken their antagonists has come at great cost to their protagonists, whether they realize it or not. Kevin Feige, the head of Marvel Studios, claimed to have Batman Returns and The Dark Knight on his mind when he said that DC put their efforts into their villains, so Marvel would put theirs on their heroes. I get it, Batman was barely in Returns and The Dark Knight was dominated by Heath Ledger’s performance of a lifetime as the Joker. But those flaws are just that - flaws.  (Also Batman is a terrible character who deserves to be sidelined in his own films come at me) It’s not a knock on the concept of a well-written antagonist - a well-written antagonist’s job is to make a good story alongside the hero. If your villain, should you choose to have one, is weak and confused, so, too, will the conflict between him and your hero be. You’ll be left with a weak and confused film. 

Like, unfortunately, Ant-Man is.

Better luck next time...

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.
 
Open to either short or long-term scenes, so feel free to PM me anytime you see this.

8wp2b5,168,2018-07-06,[MF] Rendezvous With a Cougar (39) that I (26) Met Online (with pictures),GoySauce11,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8wp2b5/mf_rendezvous_with_a_cougar_39_that_i_26_met/,"This story occurred in early 2016.  It involves me meeting up with an older married woman I met through Craigslist for some of the most thrilling sex I have ever had.

I was 26 years old at the time and had just finished grad school and was working at a summer internship with plans to move in a month to start a new job in a different city.  My then-girlfriend and I recently broke up over a petty fight and I wasn’t keen on looking for a new relationship, especially with only about a month left before I moved away.  However, I did want someone to fool around with, if possible. 

It seemed like a long shot, but I created a few posts on Craiglist seeking a no strings attached hookup with each post centered around a different fantasy or activity that turned me on.  One of the posts was searching for a woman to watch me masturbate or mutually masturbate together; it has always been a turn on for me to finish in front of a partner.  Unsurprisingly, I got myriad responses from bots and dudes.  With the sheer volume of “m4w” posts online, I figured I had a snowball’s chance in hell at finding a sane, attractive woman through such a seedy medium.  However, fortune was soon to favor me.

I got an email at work one day from what seemed like a real person, or at the very least a bot that could pass the Turing Test or Voight-Kampff Machine.  From the initial emails we exchanged I learned that she was a married woman in her late 30’s whose sex life was in a real slump; she and her older husband had a good marriage but he had a heart condition and they hadn’t had sex in nearly a year.  To fill this void (no pun intended), she had turned to erotic fiction, porn, and toys.  Those things sated her appetite for a time, but she wanted more.  The idea stripping down and pleasuring herself in front of a stranger doing similarly was alluring to her.  She had never cheated on her husband and that doing something like this was like putting her toe in the Rubicon before deciding whether to ford it or not.  From her emails I gleaned that she was nervous and giggly but very turned on by the idea of us meeting up.

To my chagrin, I never learned her name; she always signed off her with “M”.  The last time we met she asked if I wanted to know her name and I said no because I had seen something like that in a movie, Last Tango in Paris, and thought it was hot to never even exchange names.  For the purposes of this story I will refer to her as Megan because Mildred is a not quite as titilating of a name.  Anyways…

We agreed that discretion was paramount and therefore agreed to meet up that weekend at a Starbuck’s inside a nearby department store to ensure that we were both comfortable and that there was physical chemistry between us before potentially heading back to my apartment.  In the meantime, we sent sexts throughout the day.  Megan sent me pictures that gave me arduous, throbbing erections while at work.  https://imgur.com/zryWPwe.  I sent her pictures too.  https://imgur.com/Gpby22h.

I arrived at the coffee shop Saturday afternoon several minutes early and anxiously waited for her.  I had seen her body before, but not her face.  Megan told me she would be in blue jeans, a black jacket, and those white converse all-star shoes that came back into style.  She kept reiterating that if I didn’t find her attractive we could call the whole thing off, no feelings hurt.  This didn’t make much sense because when I saw her walk by there was no doubt in my mind that I found her extremely attractive.  She had a toned body from spending her days playing tennis, slightly curly blonde hair, a pretty face, and nervous smile.  The next few moments are a blur, but we instantly agreed there was a mutual attraction, exited the store, and Megan followed me back to my place.

The giddiness and sexual tension in the elevator ride up to my apartment were palpable.  We worked in the same profession, although Megan retired after she got married.  This gave us some icebreaking conversation, but I could tell we were both eager to fool around as soon we got inside.  As soon as the door was shut we immediately began kissing and pressing our bodies against one another.  We began tearing off each other’s clothing in a frenzied haste.  Soon we were both standing in the middle of my apartment completely naked with her nipples protruding like joysticks and my cock throbbing to the point it was almost painful.  https://imgur.com/uvXP8UN

I’ve read enough stories on this subreddit to know that this is the part where I humbly shoehorn some mention about my penis being 8” long and, like everyone else who posts here, on the extreme end of the bell curve.  I’m not that gifted but at that moment my dick was about an 8 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. https://imgur.com/jeH8Y1J

Our plan was to strip naked and watch each other masturbate.  The best laid plans of mine and Megan's often go awry.  Megan grabbed my cock like Lenny holding a puppy, dropped to her knees and sucked me with more force and vigor than I had ever experienced.  https://imgur.com/tqUtyze.   I exchanged the favor and soon we were on the floor with my head between her legs, my tongue circling her clit, and my fingers massaging inside her.  When she came she wrapped her legs around my head and pulled my hair so frantically that it almost caused me to cum as well.  https://imgur.com/vgvkgik

It went unspoken, but we both knew that we were going to fuck each other that night.  Megan laid back on my couch as I fingered her intensely, wet succulent sounds being made with each stroke.  She was dripping from her pussy down to her legs.  Whether she acquired it from reading erotic literature, watching porn, or just some innate kink, Megan loved to be called dirty names and for me to say the filthiest things I wanted to do to her.  Two weeks prior, I never would’ve imagined there would be a 39-year old woman with a professional degree, completely naked in my apartment, getting fucked by me while I tell her that I wanted to drown her in my cum or that I would turn her into a humidor like Bill Clinton did to Monica Lewinsky.  The dirty talk was somewhat uncomfortable and kinda degrading for me do to her, so I tried to couch it in humor.

What happened next shocked me.  Megan asked me to film us fucking on my phone; she wanted to be able to watch it again and again.  I immediately assented and grabbed my phone.  She bent over my couch with her ass sticking up as I pummeled her from behind capturing the sights and sounds of our ecstasy.  https://imgur.com/LcoqJAS.  We took a breather after we exhausted ourselves.  Per Megan’s request, I tied a scarf around her neck and lead this gorgeous naked woman, 13 years older than me, crawling on her hands and knees, towards my bedroom. 

Once in bed, we fucked like two horny freshman who had years of pent-up sexual urges that were unfettered and came bursting free.  Almost every fantasy Megan had cultivated while reading those god-awful romance novels was explored that night.  https://imgur.com/o3GYFIM  Megan was euphoric lying on her stomach while I was on top of her, holding her hands down, thrusting inside her, biting her ear, and whispering to her how bad she was for making me so uncontrollably horny all week.  https://imgur.com/bv87uLm

I had been edging for what felt like an hour and I finally could not last any longer.  I told Megan I was going to cum and she was elated.  She asked me to cover her with my cum and I did.  Megan laid on her back while I straddled above her stroking myself while looking at her eager face below, her eyes enthralled by my dick.  It took only a few seconds of me looking down and her squeezing her boobs together for me to cum.  It felt like that scene in The Two Towers when the Ents break the dam at Isengard and release the river.  In reality, it wasn’t quite as thematic as that, but her breasts were soon coated by several ropes of my seed. https://imgur.com/A5VQwGU.  We were both shuddering with ecstasy before the post-coital relief washed over us.  https://imgur.com/QdfbYEz

Reality kicked in and we both quickly cleaned up so she could be on her way home to relieve the babysitter.  It may be divisive for someone else to read this, but I didn’t feel pangs of guilt that she was married.  I could sympathize with her not having sex in almost a year and it sounded like that part of her otherwise happy marriage had died out.  If this was the release she needed to keep things on an even keel, then so be it.

We only met up one other time.  It was pretty similar to the first time, and some of the attached pictures are from our second rendezvous.  For a few months after I moved town, we would exchange emails and sexts.  I would send her the pictures and videos she wanted us to film, we talked about meeting up again, but it never came to fruition.  One day I got an error while emailing her notifying me that the account had been deleted.  Since I never got her name, I had no way to figure out who she really was to try and discreetly get in touch with her again.  Like that, she had vanished into the ether as if Thanos snapped his fingers.  I hope you enjoyed this story as it's one of the few stories I have that might warrant posting to this subreddit!"

So a little back story first, I have been with this company for over 2 years now, science based job. I started there as an intern for the summer and then worked part time there while I finished my degree that year. Once finished I was offered a full time position, which I accepted but I saw there wasn't much chance for advancement in that department.

There was an opening in a different department for a similar position, but chance for more opportunity to advance so I applied and got the job. I was told they could not offer me more money than what I was already making, but I still wanted the job for more experience. Fast forward 5 months of doing this job by myself they finally hire on another co-worker to help with responsibilities of this job. After months of me training and working with my co-worker I find out that she is being paid more than me.

I am more qualified than her, have been with the company longer, and carry on more responsibilities of this job than her and she still struggles do the simplest tasks we have. I like this job and the people I work with, but the fact that I am basically her boss and making less than her feels like a bit of a slap in the face to me. On top of the fact that they told me that they could not offer me more money.

What is the best way to approach this? Ask my boss for a raise? Start looking for a new job and hope my old job matches what they offer?"

8wq82o,3,2018-07-06,Loser or skizo,AmIskizo,schizophrenia,https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/8wq82o/loser_or_skizo/,"Sorry for my bad english and all the typo im not english native.

Hello i did a psychose 3 years ago. I took too much drugs. And i was hearing voices and i people face were transforming into zombie face lol :) and i wasnt caring about anything everything was fine i was so lost.  It lasted a day or two then i did go to hospital , but i saw no one in hospital beside a psy but she did nothing beside looking at me for 5 min so i did go back home, i took more drugs for a few days and i was still lost i was hearing voice people wanted to shot me and i had confused ideas.. i was sleeping on floor hided from the window ect. After the drug effect was off i saw my father but i was feeling ok and i didnt have halucination just confusion from past event and i was saying some random shit to him but i dont think it was a symptom of skyphrenia i was just tired and emotionaly down and i wasnt giving a fuck about what happened before (weird). So they called hospital and i finally saw a psychiatre and i they kept me, interned. 

While i was there i was clean for few days but a guy in a room was talking to me and i was seeing those ""nurse"" going in that room and ect. He seemed to know me . I live in a little place everyone know each other. But the Psy was telling me he wasnt there ... i beleive he is lying to me . I made a call to my mom cause i was mad at her and i yelled at her when she came to visit me , i asked her why i did they intern me ect But the guy told me it wasnt ok i dont recall the exact words cause its been 3 years So i called her to make beg forgivness and the guy told the nurse to come see if i was talking to him, we were talking trought window and i saw her(the nurse) come on the balcony (its a big balcony that reunit every window of the patients room... so im sure did guy was really there ! i want to ask my psychiatre again if there was trully someone or not. 

Also i smoke of cigs. so i was passing most of time outside on the balcony, and i was hearing the cook in the floor bellow on the front side (the hospital make a U form. Talk to me and saying bad thing. But i saw the guy in the window while saying ""i think he saw me""

It was clear voices always but form a distance not like when i did my psychose. Not like on that video with what you guys must hear. 

So i asked my psy if they knew me, and he said no. 

I wanst liking the place and the nurses were awfuly not giving a fuck and i suspect my psy to have told other patient to not come close to me. And i was hearing them from the door of my room saying shit about me sometime. So i started to listen music and kept staying in my room and not give a fuck about what was going on till no one seemed to like me and was in hurry to have me leave the fucking floor. One nurse told me it was a good idea to listen music but she wasnt knowing anything about me cause i wasnt talking much. And once they decided to give me med i heard one saying if he decided to inject him the medoc is because he need it to the other nurse from the door. 

But now im on med . invega substaina . And i dont see much people , im a perfect loser, and i live with my parents and im wondering if im truly skyzo or just a perfect loser, cause i dont hear voice while im alone,  i have been ok for 3 years in my pathetic life recolting most money that i can to leave this fucking house and learn a new job that i can be good at. But when im at work i hear my coworker , just one saying shit often about me when i have the back turned, but when i look back at him to see if i heard right he is doing work and not speaking but the guy is a perfect ass and tell shit about everyone and openly say that im bad and ect. So im wondering if he really say shit or not. 

Also when i did go to get my injection from the nurse at a CLSC i hear the nurse say bad thing about me but she was in front of me and i think i recall seeing her lips move. And then she told me I wasnt seeing you i had the sun in my eyes. But there was no windows behind me o\_O. 

Also one instance my sister came visit us and i heard her tell my mom that i was stupid or something like that. But i was right next to them.

Im thinking about what happent 3 years ago and the mounth i passed at this hospital, and im beggining to think something wasnt right and something i dont know happened. Anyway i think everyone just hate me and it did goes out of proportion. What do you guys think ?"

I have been interning but it looks like my internship is about to become a full time job! Something I am so excited about. But all my mom can do is ask how much I will be making, then when I tell her what I think it will be (still haven't received an offer letter so I can only guess) she looks at me with a disapproving look and says, ""hmmm I don't think so, I mean I don't know your field but I really don't think so"". Then goes on to say how her and my dad will be helping me and how I won't be able to move out. Literally the other day my mom had a conversation with me about how moving out is extremely expensive (as if I didn't know) and told me how she doesn't think I can do it, that I don't understand how hard it is.

To make it all worse my mom keeps making me feel bad about my job. In college I wanted to be a local news reporter. I recently decided to forgo that path to pursue marketing and social media (which she does not approve of because she could very blatantly brag about reporting because I was on TV, but now she can't which she really hates). But the other day me, her, and my boyfriend were watching the world cup, she thought I was asleep and asked my boyfriend why I wasn't going to be a reporter and how she thinks I should be doing that. Like what the hell, just give it up. I don't want to do that. Not only will she not let it go and is visibly distraught that I am not following the path she approved of, she is invading so much privacy by going around me to ask my boyfriend while I was, ""asleep"".

Living in my house is suffocating and it feels like my mom is infantilizing me. Has anyone else experienced that, I am just now learning about it. Looking for any tips or encouragement. I know as soon as I am financially independent I am going to at least turn a new corner. I have already been waiting 22 years and while the light at the end of the tunnel is so close, I am so discouraged. "
8wqewq,2,2018-07-06,How to Escape,Jaspy6,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8wqewq/how_to_escape/,"First time posting on Reddit. 

I [21F] live with nmother [40sF] and GC brother [17M]. I've been wanting to move out since I turned 18 but mother always has excuses. 

When I finished high school, I wanted to move out and she threw a fit, yelling and throwing shit at me. She agreed that I could move out for university and that she wouldn't put up a fight.

When I was picking universities she made me go to the local one to ""save money"", but really she wanted to continue to have control over me. Then when I told her I was moving out, she had the same reaction and said I could move out when I had a decent paying job.

Now I'm starting an internship after my third year in uni and will be making more than enough to rent my own place. I even bought a decent car this month. She says this is still not good enough, that I'm not responsible enough to live on my own and that if I want to move out, I should buy. I thought if buying a place would keep the family happy, I'd find a way to manage. But now that I'm looking for places, she's still acting the same way. She starts crying, trying to make me feel guilty for leaving her. Saying ""what will the family say? They'll think I was a bad parent and drove my daughter away"". It's very clear that she only cares about what everyone else will think about her. She doesnt give a fuck about me or my happiness. 

Now she is saying that I can move out when I graduate. I know that once I graduate she will say that I can move out once I'm married (arranged). She is just giving me false hope so I will stay here under her control for as long as possible. And then it will be my arranged husband's job to keep me under control. I can't handle this anymore. I have no privacy, or independence. I don't have my own room, and I have to be home by 10 pm even at 21 years old. I need to leave this house for my own mental health.

Other important details - I started my first part time job in grade 10. I saved around $9000 over the years in high school. She forced me to take the money out of my account and put it in hers for ""safe-keeping"". I have no access to MY money which would help me a lot in my escape.

My abusive alcoholic dad [50sM] doesn't live with us but is very influential. Mother thinks if I move out that he will blame her and beat her. He has done this many times in the past so I know this isn't one of her tricks to prevent me from leaving. But she has had many opportunities to divorce him. But mother claims she loves him and that hes a good person. Dad lives in another country and is unable to visit the country I'm currently in. So mother could divorce him and never have to worry about the abuse again. Instead, she has hired lawyers to try to bring him back her. She even forced me to write a letter on his behalf for the lawyers to use as evidence in his case. I want to move out before he enters this country because he is even worse than mother. He is very controlling and sexist. He believes that women are incapable of doing things alone, that they should have no interaction with men until marriage (arranged, of course), and should be completely covered at all times. I want to leave this house before he comes because that would make it even harder.

I also have a boyfriend [20M] right now that the family would not approve of because they want me to have an arranged marriage with a man of the culture/religion/etc. If they found out about my boyfriend, they would beat me near death. My boyfriend has met mother only but none of the other family. She was aggressive for months after I told her. Again, she forced me to take out another $5000 out of my account because she was worried I might leave her. We had one major fight a couple days after I told her about the boyfriend and I had enough. I packed my shit and was trying to walk about the door. She blocked the door and wouldnt let me pass. She called my grandma (dads side) and grandma told her to physically restrain me because allowing me to leave with bring dishonor onto the family. I was unable to get through and was forced to stay.

So now, I'm completely ready to move out and want to do it in secret because the first time was unsuccessful. I have a decent job starting up in Sept and then will have one year of school left. I have no student loans (government assistance has helped me greatly) and could take out a loan for my last year if needed. My boyfriend has even offered me a place to stay. While I appreciate the offer and may even take him up on it for a little while, i want my own place so I can finally be completely independent. 

Im worried about my safety after I leave. I will have to leave in secret because she has given me no other options. She knows where my boyfriend lives, where I go to school and where my new job will be. How do I make sure that I don't see her or any of my other family around after I leave (I need to stay in the same city as them for at least 2 more years). And im scared of what they would do if they did end up finding me. They would try to kidnap me and force me to come back home. Also, I'm worried what my dad will do to mother when he finds out and I'm worried about mother's wellbeing. She threatens to commit suicide when I tell her I'm leaving. I feel trapped, like a prisoner. No one on the outside understands why I need to leave so badly. They think my family is normal and I'm just having common disagreements every family has. I feel alone, like there is nothing I can do to get out of this situation.

TLDR - nmother gives false hope every time I bring up moving out. I'm ready now and need advice on how to leave."

A true rags to riches story. AMA",Ragstorichesthrow,AMA,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/8wqy7u/28_years_old_male_who_grew_up_very_poor_been/,"Not sure if you guys would like to hear my story out but I know there are a lot of people out there who are struggling with life and are on the brink of suicide like I was. 

I grew up very poor I'm California. My mom left me when I was 3 and my father took care of me since. He would beat me very often even for mistakes that I didn't make. He had a severe anger problem and that was the reason my mom left him. He has pulled a knife to my throat on several occasions. We're also very poor and have shared a bowl of food on multiple occasions. I remembered that we lived on the streets very briefly sharing a piece of bread. This horrible upbringing lead me to join a gang and I dropped out of highschool in 10th grade and was addicted to meth at age 13. I got locked up as well but that was to me a god send because when I was released, something sparked in me.

As I got older, I was always working minimum wage jobs and was just hating life. I thought about suicide everyday and even attempted but failed. I was always living paycheck to paycheck and never had enough money for food or gas. I was borrowing money for drugs and am also in debt by $20,000. My whole family shunned me and I was considered the black sheep. No one thought I could make anything of myself and I was always getting yelled lecturted ar.. They all knew I was getting heavily abused but none of my family would stand up for me and just watched as I was getting beat. 

One day I got fed up and realized we are gifted with a very smart and complex brain so why not take advantage of it, so I decided I couldnt do this anymore, I needed to find a way out. I researched high paying jobs that didn't require a degree and found programming to be one. I self taught myself for 3 months, then sent out my resume like crazy and even offered to work for free. I finally found an intern job and it went from there. I lived in my car while working as a data developer because i didn't have money for rent and being in Cali, rent is super expensive.  After two years of moving state to state  working as a data developer, I now make 80k a year as the lead Data Engineer at my company. 

So for all the people who are struggling, you can do it too. It just takes determination and how bad you want it. Take it from a former drug addict/gang member. 

Ask me anything and I can help in anyway I can. I will show you different ways to advance your career. .


EDIT: I see a lot of of you are asking for proof and I will try to find something to show the mods to confirm that this story is indeed not a lie.


EDIT: I see some of you have asked but I did receive my GED while I was locked up. They had a program for it."
8wruqm,1,2018-07-07,"American student looking for some advice on investments, IRA, cash lying around",canigetadad,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8wruqm/american_student_looking_for_some_advice_on/,"Hi there,

I'm feeling a bit confused and directionless financially and would love some advice. Here's where I am right now.

I have about $30K in a checking account, $10K in a custodian investment account (not sure if that's what it's called) invested in an ETF, and $5500 in cash in a standard IRA. This is from summer jobs and internships from the past few years. I'm 18 and just finished my second year of my Bachelor's at an American public university, which has been paid for so far from an educational account that my father set up many years ago for my siblings and me (I know I'm very lucky that I have been able to keep most of my earnings, except for paying rent and groceries.)

I'm looking for advice on managing my finances for the next few years. I've heard that putting the max amount I can in an IRA every year is good for tax purposes and retirement so I did that last year, and will for the next tax season. I have $5500 there right now in cash - should it be in an ETF or something?

I don't really understand what my $10K in the ETF is doing. I put the $10K there as a long-term investment - it's currently in S&amp;P 500 - I understand the idea of a portfolio and stuff, but I'm not sure how exactly this helps for long-term.

And I don't know if I should just have $30K sitting in a checking account, or if I should put it somewhere. 

One worrisome thing is that my father cut me off a while ago because he disapproved of the direction of my education - I'm going for computer engineering but he doesn't think it's a good pursuit for a girl. He used to make tuition payments out of the educational account, but we got into a big argument several months ago about whether I was going to finish my degree (I really want to and think I'm going in the right direction, he's opposed to my school and degree) and he has made only 1 payment out of 4 since then (he also blocked my number and told my mom/siblings not to talk to me so I'm really not anticipating any help). I have been paying the tuition from my savings instead (and still paying rent + groceries, which I have consistently been keeping very low cost by sharing a room/cooking/not going out). Tuition and housing comes out to $23K per year after aid and I don't qualify for any additional aid because of my father's income. I make tuition and housing payments every month during the school year - should I invest my $30K and then convert some to cash for my tuition/housing payments every month, or should I just leave it in my checking account?

Really I'm just looking for any advice or simple wisdom on how I should be approaching these problems. I'm pretty confused and a bit worried about not having enough money to finish my degree should any problems crop up (sibling troubles, health, maybe an addiction to fancy Italian food, I don't know) and I don't have anyone to go to for advice. These may seem like really basic questions but they puzzle me a lot, haha.

Thanks for reading and I would appreciate any advice :)"

Not spoilerish + Hh 7 has been out for a long time anyway.

Perfect timing too because we now know what Khayon is part of. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^plus-im-going-to-be-even-more-super-busy-soon-so-may-aswell-have-this-naow

[Helpful also to pair this stuff with how the Thousand Sons were during the Great Crusade too.
](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/8n0sr5/repostbook_excerpt_a_thousand_sonshow_the/)

&gt;#**The Five Fold Cults**

&gt;The pillars of the psychic mysteries of the Thousand Sons were known as the Five Fold Cults. Each Cult specialized in a single strand of psychic power and every psyker of manifest power within the Legion belonged to a Cult which mirrored their foremost ability. As an initiate mastered their art, they ascended through the complex layers of their Cult, learning its mysteries as their abilities grew. Each Cult was headed by a Magister Templi, ranked lower only to the Arch-Magus of all Cults in the form of Magnus Himself, and the Emperor perhaps beyond that. The ranks within each Cult varied both in number and title, though many titles were common between them all.

It's more detailed in aTS for the history of the cults and how it came to be + why it is 5.

Also the rank of the Big Red Nerd was  the *Magus*- Master of the Cults.

He made 1 rank above that thou reserved for His dad: *Ipsissimus*- A being free from limitations, who lives in balance with the
corporeal and incorporeal universe; for all intents and purposes, a perfect being.

I found this move nice honestly, reminds me of the Skaven with the Great Horned Rat having a seat...


Anyway, now on to the cults. Its perfectly fitting when you remember the [Inter-legional internship they had.](https://www.reddit.com/r/40kLore/comments/8oiivw/book_excerpt_a_thousand_sonsextralegional/)

&gt;#The Pavoni

&gt;The Pavoni concerned themselves with the interaction of the aetheric and living flesh. Biomances, they were flash sharpers and re-makers, and their initiates could channel the powers of the Warp to harden their flesh against damage, boil the blood of their enemies, and even to heal the bones and flesh of their bodies. Deeply connected to the process of life, the Pavoni were often said to hold the heart and passions of the Legion, and in matters of doctrine, oratory and belief, their adepts often dominated.

Notable members are Hathor Ma'at and Hastur. Note that Hathor was able to psyker-zap a squad of Vertus Praetors(1 Custodes Jetbike squad..composed of at least 3) to mush....Safe to say he is more or less around Ahzek-tier.

Pavoni is a great -what if- EC had powerful psykers considering their ego is massive + how vain as fuck they are due to how they can change their looks.

&gt;#The Raptora

&gt;The Raptora focused on manipulating physical reality with their will, opereating psychokinesis and control of fundamental forces such as gravity. They could conjure shields of invisible energy, crush metal with their minds, and summon storms of debris to flay their foes. Many of the Raptora were also amongst the Legion’s most gifted theoreticians and scholars, noted for their coldness and cleanness of their reasoning and their logic.

Notable members include Phosis T'kar &amp; Phael Toron. Similar to above, was able to telekinehax a squad of Vertus Praetors to pieces(4 of em). Also went overham with Psykerhax to the point he was smashing through Custodes &amp; Corgis left and right, invulnerable cause of Kineshield. Almost killed Valdor even before he saw his reflection and wanted a mercy kill. Easily the 2nd most powerful in TS to Ahzek's number 1.

Oh and yes, the super hax Kineshield over Prospero that is at least Battleship void shield defense is from them.

Considering how rough+direct Raptora usually are, safe guess is that Raptora is the most LW-ish.
  

&gt;The Corvidae

&gt;The Corvidae were soothsayers and augers who bent their abilities to touch the flow of time and consequence. Perhaps the most subtle of all the Cults, it was said by their fellows that they could read the past in a dying man’s breath, and could glimpse far distant possibilities, and even manipulate the flow of second to another by the force of their minds alone. The mark of the Corvidae was also the mark of the Legion’s greatest strategists and generals, and it is  no coincidence that Ahriman, Chief Librarian of the Thousand Sons, and foremost of its leaders at the dawning of the Horus Heresy, was Magister Templi of the Corvidae.

Notable members are the ones you know and love...Ahzek &amp; Revuel came here. Amon, Sobek, and Menkaura came from here too.

This excerpt would extend so much if i went into detail here, so we can just point to Ahriman Omnibus for all of them except Revuel-who-became-Janus.

Easily the most Thousand Sonnish cult amongst the Thousand Sons.

&gt;The Athanean

&gt;The Athanean’s secrets were bound to the workings and manipulations of the mind and thought. Both subtle and powerful telepaths, they held the Legion together in battle, channeling orders and intent seamlessly into the minds of its warriors, forming a communications network unbreakable and unparalleled in scope. Because of this, it often seemed not an army of individuals but of machines driven by a single, dominating will. Out of the press of battle, many of the Cult were given to asceticism and withdrawn contemplation: a consequence of their contact with the thoughts of others, perhaps. They were often also used as emissaries to other Legions and factions of the Imperium.

Notable members are Baleq Ulthizzar &amp; Sanakht. Unfortunately we dont have much stuff from Baleq cause he got...'silenced'. However we do know that Baleq was able to read thoughts from others in space while on a planet, so having him be alive on Prospero wouldve been batshit insane. Obviously no need for vox when telepathing. Sanakht though, well, turns out being a mind reader telepath synergizes absurdly well with being a Space Wizard Swordsman, shocker.

Unlike the others, im not sure what legion Athaneans are similar to because no clue from Legion internship. Safe guess considering how stoic they are + meditating penance wise+ polar opposite of Pavoni...probably Imperial Fists? 

&gt;The Pyrae

&gt;The Pyrae’s abilities expressed themselves in a terrifying manner- the control and creation of fire. Their thoughts could become hell-storms burning as bright as a star’s fury, and their touch could reduce metal to slag in mere moments. Most bellicose of all the Cults, the Pyrae excelled in destruction, and their smouldering pride beat with the heat of the Legion’s martial heart.

Notable members are Khalopsis, Auramagma and Tolbek. To the surprise of no one, Pyrae are the biggest hot-heads ever. They also commanded the Battle Automata of the TS too for more firepower. Aaaand we all know the hax Khalopsis did by reviving a Warlord Titan, giving it warpflame arsenal to go along with its weapons and a WARPFIRE AURA TO BURN ALL PROJECTILES BETTER THAN A VOID SHIELD'S DEFENSE. Auramagma also tried to torch Corgi King but had his Flamehax returned to him...imagine if he used it on another Primarch. 

Controlled destruction, hot heads, and big guns? Easily the most Iron Warriorish among'st the Cults.

&gt;#The Red Orders

&gt;In addition to the core structures of the Legion, there were three Orders which existed both within and beyond its circumference. The Orders stood apart from the Fellowships and their Circles, and indeed the Temples of Prosperine psychic lore, their membership crossing such divides. Their purpose was not the practice and ascendancy of psychic mastery, for that was the purview of the great Cults, nor the day-to-day tactical operations of the Legion, but rather they were macro-military structures. Perhaps as much an outgrowth of the traditions and culture of the Legion as a deliberate structure, they were made to cope with the wider factors of the conducting of the Great Crusade, the furtherance of the Legion as a whole and its relation to the  Wider Imperium

This is basically different, Forgeworld added this in. Made stuff better though thats for sure.

&gt;#The Order of Ruin-‘The Unmakers’

&gt;Known by the symbol of a poised serpent, the Order of Ruin were a sect of mystics said to be obsessed with numerology and the hidden structure of the universe. Calculators, logicians, analysts and organizers of supreme ability, the Order of Ruin were the siege makers, logistical specialists and planners of the Thousand Sons. When the Legion deployed its armour and ordinance to lay waste to a city or break a planet’s defences, it was the formulae of the Order of Ruin which guided the number, placement and timing of shells, explosives and force. It is said that the Order of Ruin knew the strength of every warrior and war machine within the Legion, and weighed them all in calculations that only they and their Primarch understood.

&gt;When a force was raised for a campaign, the Order of Ruin would be in the background assisting by arcane means in the determination of the disposition and strength of that force. The arraying and maintenance of the Legion’s warships also fell under the Order’s hand, as did the creation and supply of all its material. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Order of Ruin also maintained closest contact with the Mechanicum, in particular with the isolated Forge World of Zhao-Arkhad, which the Legion had liberated and with which it had maintained many binding tiers afterwards. Under its general command laboured all of the Legion’s forge-masters and Techmarines, many of which came directly from wthin the Order’s Ranks.

Notable member  here is Ignis, who also made a Titan wake up in TCK. 

Engineering, Mathematicians, Logisticians and the likes..This Order is for you.

Not sure if closer to Iron Handsish or Smurfish, or Iron Warriors Logistics side without the firepower.

&gt;#The Order of the Jackal-‘The measure of life and death’

&gt;The Order of the Jackal had a presence in every other structure and faction of the Thousand Sons, including the other Orders. The role of this small Order was twofold: to remember the dead and to raise the next generation of warriors for the Legion. The grave urns of the dead kept beneath the pyramids of Tizca were tended by their hands, and it was in the memoires of each member of this Order that the deeds of the fallen were held.

&gt;When a warrior on the edge of death was considered for the honour of internment in the iron embrace of a dreadnought, It was the Order of the Jackal which weighed his worth and decided his fate. To them also fell the task of assessing and selecting aspirants for induction into the Legion. On Prospero and many other worlds, they would walk amongst the gathered throngs of potential recruits, testing with their minds and casting divinations of their fates. In this way, the Order were the guardians of the Legion’s past and future. The Legion’s Apothecarion, who also were all but indivisible from the Order of the Jackal, maintained the Legion’s genseed and were but a practical manifestation in some ways of the Order of the Jackal’s wider purpose. In their role as protectors of the Legion’s traditions, the Order served another highly important ritual position as arbiters within the Legion, as their members within each of the Five Cults formed the guardians of each Cult’s temple; their dual allegiance and responsibility marked by their ceremonial jackal-masked helms and emblems alongside the symbols of their Cult.

Notable Member: see below. Basically the Inquisition of the Thousand Sons? Also dealt with recruiting + dreadnoughting too. From their role-description it reminded me abit of the DA's Order. Only abit though.

&gt;#The Order of Blindness-‘The Hidden Ones’

&gt;It is only by extrapolation, and the intelligence of scraps of intelligence, that the wider Imperium knows of the existence of the Order of Blindness. Thought to have been headed by Magnus’ equerry and former tutor, Amon – the s-called Hidden Ones appear to have been an Order of infiltrators, spies, interrogators and scouts deployed to gather intelligence. How many of this Order were recruited, controlled and deployed remain unclear, though there is evidence that the use of psychically conditioned non-Legiones Astartes humans were a part  of their broader methodology. Beyond this, their membership and purpose remain shrouded, though there is some evidence that the Order may also have been responsible for  the control of certain fringe military elements within the Legion, whose purposes were less to do with stealth and the creation of chaos in a foe, such as the Thousand Sons’ few Destroyer-type units, although this remains unconfirmed.

Notable Member: Amon. Easily the most Alpha Legionish side of the Thousand Sons, they gave the attackers in Prospero hell. The Hidden Ones were the reason Corgi King was super occupied, chasing illusions and busy. 

Extra:

&gt; The Khenetai Occult were a mystical sect within the Thousand Sons Order of the Jackal who served as the guardians of the Five Prosperine Cults as well as their reliquaries and sanctums. Bound together by oath and ritually-forged psychic bonds, each of the elite were all initiates of the Cults’ inner secrets and adepts in their techniques, philosophies, and arts.

&gt;The foremost warriors of the Khenetai formed cabals of ‘Blades’; sublimely skilled warriors who had honed their psychic powers to be at one with their sword mastery. Their dual force swords were shaped from single sheets of psycho-crystalline infused ceramite and gilt, with sigils said to correspond to the wielder’s secret name and the deeds they had performed.  In battle they wore armour forged and shaped by the Legion’s blind artificers using fire and the force of their minds alone, and fought with a unified precision that made them seem a single warrior manifested many times, rather than a group of individuals.

Notable Members: Iskandar Khayon. ADB finally released where he is from, and it now explains his great telepath+awesome bladesman side. Watching over the 5 Cults could also be where he picked up his multispec side.

Bonus for Nerding out:

&gt;THE ENDLESS SPIRAL

&gt;Besides the Circles, Fellowships, Orders and Cults, there were dozens of other cabals, collegium and symposia formed by the Thousand Sons 
 to pursue a particular strand of knowledge or refine a branch of physic ability, offering a layer of subdivision that inevitably spilled over to their military structrures. The membership and importance  of these collectives waxed and waned with the rise and fall of their members, and the popularity of their concerns. Over the decades between the rediscovery of Magnus and the Council of Nikaea, there were likely many hundreds of these groupings formed within the Thousand Sons, of which few are now known.* 


Callback to what Genefather Magnus said to Morty in Nikaea of 'you are welcome to debate in Prospero if you like, We wont reject you'.


&gt;The 'Hands of the Drowned Moon' are recorded, for example, as having focused long hours of debate and ritual experimentation on what happened to a living being at the moment of death.

With so much stuff to Nerd Out on, any question thats worth asking goes honestly.

 &gt;The 'Aquilae', meanwhile, sometimes called the 'denied sixth Cult of Prospero', investigated the nature of the Aether itself until it was disbanded upon the orders of Magnus. 

Requires knowing the history of the Cults origin, but for a tldr: The first 5 were the 5 hax that manifested initially vs the Psychunein. So other Cults would never be as recognized as the OG 5 no matter how popular they got.

&gt;By contrast, the 'Atmon,' a group obsessed with the psychic observation of the distant past, was said to have never numbered more than ten initiates of the Corvidae.

This is the cult you made. Contrast to other hundreds of cults that had hundreds to thousands of members,, only 9 of your friends showed up...

_______

Theres some stuff i couldnt put in because it was getting too long already, like the cult branch from the Hidden Ones that took care of the bikes, but overall this should be ok i guess.

Just feels nice to see how developed the Thousand Sons are honestly... Like, you could spend so much time digging into em even without getting into Post-hh side honestly. Of course post-hh stuff means more reading so thats good!

I need some advice. I graduated college in Dec. and had a decent job offer, unfortunately I didn’t love the industry and I quit to take an internship in a different industry (which came with a big pay cut). I have one month left on the internship and am hoping for a job offer after. Assuming this is only temporary, please help me plan my bills for the next month or so.

Emergency Fund: 5k 
Monthly internship pay: 1,600 (after taxes)
Rent: 1,425 (this used to be affordable with my last jobs pay and even with waitressing in college but now obviously its a problem for the next month or so). 
Electric: 90
Transportation 120
Phone/misc: 100

I had savings that I’ve been plowing through to stay afloat and now only have $1k.
CC 1: $2,800
CC 2: 800
CC 3: 280

Going to put the 1k towards CC 1 which leaves a total of $2,880 left. I’m hoping from income from a side job of $500 so $2,380 left. Should I let the balance sit for a little (two weeks or so past due date for another $800 payment) or use my e-fund?

He knew I had a bf before and I told him when we broke up a month ago. 

I was pretty confident that my feelings were reciprocated at the time. We would go back and forth with banter and talk about things we had in common (a lot!). The coworker would text and snapchat me back and generally act warm towards me. However, I’ve been getting really mixed signals lately. Last week, we hung out after work (he asked me), just the two of us, and it went well but nothing happened. But since then he’s been holding back and not answering my snaps/texts. Every once and a while we will have a fun interaction but it seems different. I asked him to hang out after work again today and I got a dumb excuse.

I’m not a physical flirter but I make sure to always make eye contact, smile, give compliments, ect. Maybe that’s not enough.

I’m starting to think that I waited too long to tell him how I feel. But I was hoping to get more feedback from him first. He’s a pretty good communicator, so I don’t understand why he would hold back if he did like me.

What should I do? I just want to tell him but I’m too shy. Should I text him? Should I just give up? I can’t tell if I’m doing too much or not enough.

** also note that we are interns (working together since last fall until this fall) and the workplace doesn’t have a policy against dating coworkers**

TL;DR I broke up with my boyfriend because of strong feelings for my coworker. I thought it was mutual, but now I can’t tell if he’s still interested. Should I hit the brakes on this or hit the gas?"

So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a  lucky guy that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

When I was growing up, I always went with this belief that I could do anything. At least anything within reason. This was the concept that both my parents, and I were always telling ourselves. One day, I would be able to hold down a job, just like anyone else and be independent. Realistically there was no reason why I shouldn’t have been able to. I walked on crutches, and was capable of driving. It wasn’t as if I was in a wheelchair or struggled with walking on the crutches that much, which to me is much more difficult to manage. Yes, I was regularly in pain and there were days I would go home from school hunched over looking like a old lady, but I was for the most part able. The idea that I wouldn’t be able to hold down a desk job never crossed my mind.

When I turned 18, I even went as far as to move out of state and into a college dorm room by myself. I was able to go to classes, and take care of myself for the most part. My grades were kept up and I was able to go to the library and sometimes, walked to the community center. I was on my way to becoming a mental health counselor. Why shouldn’t I be able to do this job, I was learning, and doing the work. So with that in mind, I even went as far as to go get my masters degree.

It was around the age of 23-24 that my body started to crumble. I needed more sleep than I did even when I was younger, and I was constantly sleeping. It hurt more on a normal basis, and my bad days were more common than they weren’t. Yet still, I pushed on ignorant or refusing to acknowledge the fact that my dream would be a failure. I refused to admit defeat, and I worked hard to get my masters degree. It was my final year and it was time to do my internship. I was finally going to put what I learned into practice! It was exciting and I got to intern at a very promising location.

Now I want to make this clear, that the location I worked at wasn’t bad people. Actually, the main boss that worked there was a very kind woman. She understood that I was disabled, had a service dog and would need to pee on a regular basis and would have bad days. I don’t think either of us realized, how frequent my bad days would be. It probably didn’t really register how constant I would need to pee. It rapidly became a nightmare. I would be calling out regularly because my body simply couldn’t hack it. I was constantly in a state of nonfunctional pain, and always needing sleep.

Now this wasn’t a job I could do at home, or it not really matter if I was technically not there. It mattered, I was working with clients, I was running groups. I had to be there, and I had to be able to function. Soon I was getting pulled into the office on a normal basis, and it got to the point where they threatened to remove me from the program. If they did that, I wouldn’t be able to graduate. It was during this year, of struggling to be able to work, and constantly upsetting my boss for a internship where I worked for free, that I was forced to recognize reality. No, I wouldn’t be able to work full time as a mental health counselor. The thing I had been fighting for since freshman year of high school, and worked so hard for 7-8 years was never going to happen. My body was not going to let it happen.

I couldn’t handle driving back and forth from a workplace, I couldn’t handle working 4 hours a day, my body could not handle it. So many disabled people can carry a full time job and do perfectly fine at it. Disabled people who were in a wheelchair all day long and had less mobility than I, who struggled more than me, could work a fulltime job. Why the fuck couldn’t I? Even with the difficulty of the internship, I still believed, maybe. I went to doctors trying to find a medication that would stop me peeing so much. Nothing worked, it got to the point where the doctor suggested I try botox, which would run the possibility of me needing to a catheter for 6 months every day till it wore off. I went to a doctor for pills that kept me awake, and boy did they keep me awake, but I was a zombie. I couldn’t function, I was exhausted all the damn time but I couldn’t fucking sleep.

Nothing was working, no doctor could fix me. Every doctor I saw for pain management, or about my spine even said it. One day my body would break down on me. They always said it so casually, so matter of factly. To them it’s not the end of the world, and honestly they can’t treat it like that for their own mental state. For me, my universe collapsed, and my future was gone in my eyes. One day, my body would crumble, and the truth was I felt it. I started feeling my body breaking down on me when I was in my early 20s but never wanted to admit it. I wasn’t ready, I wasn’t ready to be losing my capabilities yet. I wasn’t ready to give up on dreams and hopes and what I considered my future.

I also knew, that when my body began to break down, it meant more pain. Every year that has passed, even though I live in the sunshine state, my body hurts more and more. There was a constant ache, and sometimes the spasticity in my legs are so intense I can’t sleep, or just want to rip my legs off.

It breaks you down when you realize that your body was going to get progressively worse. It’s also terrifying to know one day that your pain may get so severe and there was nothing or no one out there that can help. It’s horrifying when you are in your 20’s, wondering what your body was going to be like in 10 years. I had hopes, and dreams and I had wanted to explore the world. I wanted to go to Japan at least once before my body collapses on me entirely. The worst part about the fear, is not knowing. It’s almost like death in a way, except instead of quietly fading into nothingness, I was going to live through it. How long do I have before the pain is so bad? How bad will the pain get? How much will I lose due to the pain and my body losing its mobility? No one ever told me when I was younger that my body would start to go on me in my 20’s. During my “golden years”.   Anyways, I’m getting off track.

When I was young, I thought I could do it. I thought I would be able to accomplish my dreams. I thought I was going to be financially and physically independent, able to survive on my own. At 26, I am financially reliant on the kindness of my parents, the government, and my generous boyfriend. I am a burden. That is how I feel anyways. I can’t hold up my end of the bargain, I can’t deliver what I expected to be able to. I can’t contribute to society, or to my partner, and my parents are stuck caring for a child they never anticipated having to care for. At least the government helps though right? Sure if you call getting around $700 a month, and being unable to pay for rent and yet being expected to magically, and if you can’t pay for rent, you can’t get assistance from the government, as getting help.

What society seems to think is that the government just gives out money to people and we live like kings and queens off the backs of society. That’s not how it works, and to be completely honest; I’d much rather be working making at least enough to be able to contribute to my household. Society has this misconception of what being disabled is like, much the same misconception as I had when I was younger.

When I was younger, I thought I was going to be a productive and contributing disabled individual, much like some of the ones I’ve seen. It was frequent that I would hear about this disabled person doing this job, or that disabled person doing that job, I should be able to too. No, sadly that is not how it works. The fact is every disabled person has a different reason as to why they are disabled. The levels of severity or the symptoms that a person faces is also different from individual to individual. Someone with my condition may have no problem working, but I have increasing pain, horrible bladder, and hypersomnia (constant need to sleep). It took me a while to learn that, and understand that. It took even longer for me to accept it, and to be honest, part of me still refuses to.

To be honest, I didn’t even truly understand the difficulty of how hard it is to get around until my late 20’s. For the most part when I was younger, I was pretty mobile. I was able to drive, and moving around wasn’t that difficult. As I get older, my spasticity gets worse, and it become harder to physically move my body. I have begun to use a scooter in order to go to the mall or other stores, in order to help preserve my body longer. Which has taught me, if you are in a wheelchair, it’s a fucking nightmare. Have you seen handicapped stalls? When they aren't being used by someone else with 5 other empty stalls available, it’s difficult to move around in them. It is more frequent than it should be that I will go into a bathroom, and a completely abled bodied individual is in the handicapped stall. Not only that, but when I desperately need to use the bathroom and physically can’t fit into another stall, they get mad at me if I ask how quick they will be. If there are other open stalls when you go into the bathroom, do not use the only handicapped stall available. Obviously if there is a line, or none of the other stalls are open be my guest use the handicapped stall, I don’t expect you to wait but if there are other stalls, use them. I can’t fit my scooter, my service dog and myself into a regular stall. I can barely fit in the handicapped stall. Which brings me to the size of a handicapped stall.

You cannot fit yourself, and a scooter inside of them comfortably and be able to move around, let alone yourself, a scooter and your service dog. If I couldn’t move as well as I can now, I’d be fucked. Someone would have to physically lift me out of my equipment to place me on the toilet. I’m sure a smaller wheelchair isn't so bad within the stalls but if you have a larger wheelchair or a scooter, it’s a nightmare. While I understand there is only so much room within a bathroom in order to fit these stalls, I just never realized how difficult it really is till my later years.

There are even some stores that I can barely fit in them with my scooter. I will constantly be knocking over hangers, and smacking shit off the shelves. I don't’ do it on purpose, sometimes I can’t even fit in a tight space to look at the clothes or items over there. I just can’t fit, or move through that aisle. Let alone trying to get through that tight ass aisle, and having people walk in front of me or cut in front of me. It is difficult to move around, and people are just oblivious how hard it really is. I’m not trying to knock anyone down or bad mouth individuals, it really is just due to the fact they are unaware and honestly don’t experience disabled individuals that frequently. It is the same with the elevators situation. I have seen so many people who are able to take a flight of stairs get on a elevator and rush at it to the point where I won’t be able to fit as well. This usually happens at large conventions, or very busy locations and while yes some people have invisible disabilities, I’m talking about the ones who are fine.

This is again, just due to not having the knowledge about the difficulties disabled people go through. Honestly, I can’t expect people to understand what disabled individuals go through, we don’t ever tell them our struggles, only that we can do everything on our own. We want this independence and because that’s what we strive for, we don’t talk about or admit to our difficulties. We don’t want to admit that some of us, are the ones who can’t be as independent as some of the others. Some people also seem to think we are lucky somehow, yes I have been told I’m lucky.

People will joke with me when I am in a wheelchair or in my scooter how lucky I am. I am lucky because I don’t have to walk on my own two feet and my feet don’t ache…. They consider that to be lucky. I have gotten dirty looks because sometimes I am allowed to skip lines, or get positioned better at events so that I can see. They give me dirty looks because they think that is unfair, and that I am lucky to receive those perks. What they don’t realize is that people constantly will cut in front of me, and block a path, making movement to be extremely difficult. That when stuck in long waiting lines at universal or disney, I will need to leave a line to go use the restroom, and that I might get stuck there. Or that when suddenly there is a downhill, or a uphill, it is very difficult to get a wheelchair up or through it. That people will step in front of you at events, so you will not be able to see. There have been many times when I will simply sit there silently, staring at someone's back because there’s no way to position me to be able to see, and whoever is my companion will try to help me get to a spot where I can see, and miss everything going on in the process.

They don’t get that I get stared at, looked at like a monkey that got out of the zoo. That I get rude and obnoxious comments or intrusive questions. They don't’ understand the discomfort I have felt in the past walking through shops or going to school because I am treated different. In middle school, I had a student teacher literally talk to me slowly, and carefully as if I couldn’t understand him. It was mortifying, and sadly, not something that doesn’t happen. People will talk to those who are with me instead of to me, with questions or things about me. They think I am lucky because the government gives me peanuts to live off of, that I get to ride around in some kinda contraption, and because I get accommodating spots at events.

I grew up with this conception that somehow because I am disabled, I am less than everyone else. It took a few years to work through a feeling of embarrassment over being disabled. People will look at me with pity, and think my partners are somehow golden at heart because they are willing to date someone who is disabled. Yes, I literally had a doctor tell me that I must be really amazing or that my boyfriend must have a heart of gold simply because he was dating me. They don’t view me as a sexual being, and when I talk about sex stare at me in amazement. As if somehow the idea of me being able to have sex was unexpected. I like to fuck, and to be honest, I probably have kinkier sex than most people. I have had men completely ignore me as a possible partner, or tell me they couldn’t handle me because of my disability.

Growing up, and even now it is creepily common where someone will come up to me, and either tell me they will pray for me, or that they look up to me. Yes, they mean good will, but they don’t understand how utterly creepy, or uncomfortable those situations are. I shouldn’t be looked up to simply because I went out on a dance floor with my crutches and danced. I danced like a chicken, I look like a beheaded chicken when I dance, that doesn’t deserve praise. Praising me for doing something that is just a normal life action is mortifying and degrading. Why should I be praised for something that everyone else does normally? It’s no different for me to do something as a normal person. If you want to praise me, praise me for working my ass off and getting a masters degree, or for being a decent writer. Normal people get praised or looked up to because of something they worked their ass off doing and accomplished, not for just doing a normal daily function. No, you shouldn’t look up to me simply because I was able to put on my t-shirt this morning, or because I am capable of picking up a piece of clothing off the floor..

I had to work at becoming confident in myself, and knowing that I have some kind of self worth. The consistent unnecessary praise or compliments made it difficult for me to even feel proud over accomplishments that other people would feel proud about. To me, I didn’t deserve pride over a masters degree, even though I worked my ass off for it because it felt condescending. Slowly over time, I have realized that no I am not being proud over being disabled and getting a masters degree, I am proud that I was someone who got a damned master's degree, and not everyone does that. That I don’t have to consistently work at being apologetic for being less than an abled bodied girl or that I need to work at making up for not being normal.

Yes, disabled individuals might need some assistance, and yea not all of us are as capable of contributing work wise as we would like. That doesn’t mean we are somehow less than abled bodied individuals, or our partners should be praised, or that we are something to be looked up to or pitied. We are just normal people who have a little extra complications and sometimes need some extra assistance."

Hello! I am Theodora, I am 29 years old and I am cancer survivor.

I am in Ireland from 2014. In 2016 I've saved enough money (after 2 years in Ireland working as a housekeeper) so I can follow the course of Software Development.

In 2017 I've got interviewed, got accepted and... in the same time I was diagnosed with melanoma stage 2. During the summer I had several surgeries, skin excisions and lymph nodes removed. In September I started the college, where I had incredible good results. (here you can see my results: https://core.digitary.net/#/sharelink/9ccf058e-f2af-4d06-880f-f7fabba6d81e/0a2bde5a-a948-454e-aa68-301550bd9d1e )

I need to thank to the Irish government for paying my college fees, and pay my illness benefit of 150 euro/week for the 1th year of college.

I was finally declared cancer free and first year of college was finished where I achieved 88.33&amp;#37;, being the second student of my year in Computer Science. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a payed internship during the summer, so I went back to the hotel as a housekeeper as I need to support my self by my own.

I did save some money for my next year, but I would seriously need some help from people who can afford to be so kind."
8wufg8,6,2018-07-07,Gaming and Depression,dylanharp1996,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/8wufg8/gaming_and_depression/,"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I'll post elsewhere if need be.

So I am a 21 year old guy, and recently I've been hit with a pretty rough depression. Long story short: it was over a girl. Now that I am finally nearing the tail end of my depression, I find that gaming just doesn't interest me as it used to.

I have been gaming all my life. I have some of my fondest memories while playing Halo 3 on Xbox 360 in middle school. Now, whenever I fire up my Xbox One or my PC, I just end up staring at my massive library of games and I'll not want to play any of them.

I know loss of interest is typically a symptom associated with depression, but honestly, I feel fine. Obviously the events of the past still kinda weigh on me, but I feel like my depression is mostly over.

I have put attention towards other thing as well. For example: I just started a new IT internship that may turn into a professional job, so I have been throwing a lot of focus into that. I've also made a lot of new friends (who are also gamers but we don't game together due to schedules). I've also tried my luck with streaming on Twitch, but it seems all anyone wants to watch nowadays is Fortnite or PUBG, and those games just don't interest me.

I guess my question, for gamers who have been in my shoes, is: does this feeling just go away eventually? Is there something I can do to renew my passion for gaming? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR: I am an avid gamer. I met a girl. It didnt work out. I got depressed. Now gaming doesn't interest me.

Edit: It's also worth mentioning that I have been transferring these feelings into physical energy. I have been running a lot recently and that helps take my mind off things. I've also picked up a couple new hobbies. For example, I recently have gotten into Arduino.

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for all your kind responses. I really appreciate the advice. This is why I love the Internet!"
8wumw1,13,2018-07-07,Post-Arch Off Campus Housing?,alterationbrick,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/8wumw1/postarch_off_campus_housing/,"So I'm interested in living off-campus my junior year because of the much lower costs and greater independence. However, as a member of the class of 2021, I will be required to live on campus next summer, and then required to take an ""away"" semester the following year (I haven't yet decided which semester). I'd prefer to do an internship or research outside of the Troy/Albany area, so I wouldn't be living in Troy my away semester.

Here's the problem: as I understand it, apartment leases are usually signed in October or thereabouts, and last from June through May. I would only be living off campus in Troy for a third of this time. People who are facing this situation or have been in this position before, what are my best options, or how did you proceed?

The options I see so far:

* Get lucky and find a landlord who will allow a 4 month lease (Is this possible?)
* Make a plan with other sophomores to rent an apartment, half living there one semester and half the other semester (this still leaves the problem of sophomore summer)
* Attempt to sublet with somebody for 4 months (is this likely, and if I can't work something out with the upperclassmen I know, where would I go for this? Facebook? Craigslist?)
* Rush a fraternity (I am not a member of Greek life and I would rather not have housing be my reason for rushing. Also Greek housing is under threat by the admin)
* Suck it up and live on campus (however, reslife seems to be running out of upperclassmen housing anyways)
* Stay in Troy my away semester (I'd rather not, and Summer Arch is still a problem)

How do my assumptions about renting compare to reality? Is it realistic to choose to live off campus for one isolated semester? Thanks in advance for any input you can provide!"

I would like to get some advice about how to deal with trying to find a job after my posdoc.  I did my PhD in the same lab I am at now, and got hired as a posdoc for a year to try to wrap up the paper. To be honest I don't have a lot of hope that I will be even ready for submission before the end of my contract in October. I started to apply for jobs, and recently managed to get an interview for a data science internship. The problem is the internship starts at the beginning of September, so if I get it I would have to quit my position in advance. Should I discuss it with my PI before the interview so he knows what's up?

I was quite keen on the paper at the start, but now I don't see the end of the experiments or what the paper would be about. I feel like I am betraying my lab, but I think it would be a great opportunity as people in the internship help you find a job in the end with the new skills you learn. I also worry that telling him might have negative consequences in our relationship, such as removing the possibility to get another contract. He said he'll be happy to support me if I need to stay longer, but I really really think I need to move on. 

Thank you so much for all the answers and the help"

So I've continued my watching ER for the first time ever, courtesy of Hulu. Here are my thoughts since Season 8.

*  I'm glad Benton grew into someone who could care for another person but I'm mad he left without completely shedding his asshole persona.
* Also we just lost Cleo like that huh. She was so underdeveloped
* Gallant for Best/Most Competent Intern All Time
* Glad Chen came back, fuck Weaver
* RIP Mark Greene this fucking sucks
* WHY DIDN'T DOUG AND HATHAWAY SHOW UP FOR THE FUNERAL DAMNIT
* Romano getting his arm chopped off is poetic justice but kind of ineffective punishment for his continued harassment/dickishness. Now he's just pushed into a more administrative role, which is where nobody wants him. I'd rather he get punished and demoted in past seasons for his sexual harassment, homophobia, and blackballing Peter. And now Elizabeth is holding his hand? Seems she forgot how poorly he treated her at the beginning.
* Pratt was such an arrogant ass at the beginning. Chen should've never gone for him
* Oh cool Don Cheadle
* Not interested in Kovac's sex addiction.
* If Elizabeth ends up with new douchebag surgeon guy imma be very annoyed
* I don't know what I would do if I was in Abby's shoes but I know I disapprove of her every decision with her family.  I couldn't even watch Eric fucking up the funeral I had to skip past it. I get the argument that ""the dead can wait, let me go rescue my bipolar brother now"" but don't be mad at John for being mad/sad for losing his closest family member.
* Mixed feelings about the Congo plot. If Carter is permanently out now I will be PISSED. He's easily in the top 3 characters on the show.
* Looking at the cover photo for ER now, almost everyone here is gone: Doug, Hathaway, Benton, Greene, and now CARTER??? Fuck. All my love on the show is now riding on Susan Lewis.
* I was told there would be John Stamos."
8wv9ec,9,2018-07-07,Anyone here work in environmental chem in government (or industry or nonprofit)? How do you like it as a career?,iammaxhailme,chemistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/8wv9ec/anyone_here_work_in_environmental_chem_in/,"tl;dr version: If you work in environmental protection/environmental chemistry, do you have a graduate degree? What did it focus on? Masters or PhD or other? Does it seem like the career ceiling is too too?

Full post:
I graduated with a BS in chemistry and a BS in applied math + stats in 2013. The summer before I graduated, I worked in a city government water monitoring lab as an intern for 3 months. I was interested in environmental protection and was sort of happy knowing that in some way, what I was doing was useful and helped people. However, I also got frightened off from it as a career path. Most of the people working there were in their mid 40s, making money in the mid 50k range (and this is in NYC which is very expensive), and I'm pretty sure they had been there for a long time, too. They may have been getting government employee benefits, but I'm not sure. Most of them worked 7.5 hour shifts, 6 days a week. Morale was very low. Most of them didn't seem too stressed, but many of them seemed pretty depressed. Of course, now, 5 years later I realize I shouldn't have judged based on just one summer internship, but I was a dumb college kid, what did I know?

Due to that experience, I started mostly focusing on physical/theoretical chemistry. Those areas were probably my #2 interest after environmentally-motivated science. However, I thought it would be a much better career option, although nowadays, I don't think analytical/physical chemistry is a good career at all. Computational is okay, but you really need a PhD.

I have been doing my PhD, specializing in computational chemistry, since 2015. It's going badly. I'm probably going to quit with just a masters when I fill the requirements for it next semester. I've realized that I hate the slow pace of academia, and the extremely unstructured nature of the PhD program. I also have realized that I get very little satisfaction out of spending all my efforts on something purely academic and not practical. But the real kicker is that, after 3 years, my lab is basically closing (prof leaving) and all my side projects will remain half-finished and unpublished. I was hoping they would lead to a real thesis topic but they didn't, and now they can't.

I don't really know what I want to do next. I did a fair amount of coding in my research, and enjoyed working on + refining my coding projects a lot more than reading academic papers or arguing about endless minutae about spectroscopy or excited state photodynamics or other things that I thought I was interested in when I started, but now realize I am not. Due to the fact that I liked coding and have some experience with it, I have been thinking about data science or software engineering in industry, and have posted a lot on those boards. But I still do have some interest in physical science, and I think if I stayed with chemistry, I would want to do something environmental/ecological, or maybe with materials, or even food chemistry. I don't care about medical, pharma, biochem etc at all. 

My concern is that it would be a bad career, and I'm not sure I love that stuff enough to put up with an unrewarding career. I thought I liked physical chemistry enough to put up with the high stress + pressure of a PhD with no promise of a career, but I have realized that I don't.  I don't really care about making a ton of money, but I don't want to get into a position where I'll be barely beyond paycheck-to-paycheck living when I have 15-20 years in the field. I'm also worried that my background will make it hard to get positions beyond dead-end QC/lab tech positions, since my graduate research was completely focused on computational/theoretical methods, beyond the first-year general PhD courses + applied lab techniques course."
8wvgyg,1,2018-07-07,First Salary/Income,pittPA83,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8wvgyg/first_salaryincome/,"Hey everyone,

I just graduated from graduate school and I wanted to talk about how to allocate my new found income. Some background:

27 years old

170,000 student loan debt at \~6&amp;#37; interest

10,000 credit card debt (unpaid internship between college and grad school)

100,000 yearly salary with 15000 sign on bonus

employer 6&amp;#37; retirement contribution, 2&amp;#37; profit sharing

My internal debate to this point has been savings vs. debt. I know the credit card debt is the first thing to attack, so I've started paying that down. I also took the 15,000 bonus and placed it in a Schwab intelligent portfolio as there are a few strings attached to that money. As i progress, I'd like to begin saving for retirement/house/kids, but I don't want to be buried in student loan debt my whole life. 

I guess my question is what ratio do you look for to pay down debt but still save. I know I have enough to make loan payments and save, but for my 6000 monthly income what percent should go to debt/savings. It costs me about 2000 to live a month between rent/utilities/food/fun. Of the remaining 4000, how heavy should I lean toward debt reduction vs. savings?

Also,

I went with the Schwab Intelligent portfolio due to simplicity. I like the diversification but I don't love the \~10&amp;#37; cash allocation. Anyone have any experience with this? I almost feel like I'm better off opening a Vanguard account and selecting 3 or 4 Index or dividend funds. 

Any thoughts are welcome and appreciated!"
8wvr6v,14,2018-07-07,"this is going to be long, sorry if it get's a little confusing.",roadmap31,WeListenToYou,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeListenToYou/comments/8wvr6v/this_is_going_to_be_long_sorry_if_it_gets_a/,"hello! In August of 2017 I moved from the philippines to dc to live with my dad and stepmom and finish my last two years of highschool here. my mom stayed in the philippines and i also have an older sister but she goes to college. Anyway, my stepmom is very sweet and cares for me but has also suffered a lot of loss and horrible life events (brother and father have committed suicide, mother died of cancer, estranged from sisters,) so despite the fact that she tries a lot she's still very unstable and anxious, and the way she treats people can be very aggressive and needy, and like despite acknowledging this, she can't easily control it. So as I'm settling in throughout August I find it hard to be comfortable in my house because a bad facial expression or like a non-enthusiastic answer could set her off and make her mad that I'm not being responsive enough. And at home, I just want to be able to decompress and be myself, so this caused a lot of anxiety to go home. When school starts I usually got home pretty late or I decided to hang around at school as long as possible because I wanted to avoid going home. At some point I tell both of them that I am so stressed and I can't handle being at home but I don't know it was fine for like a week? Then went back to normal.

On top of this, around this time I stopped calling my mom back in the philippines because whenever she would hear about me being stressed because of my stepmom or if I didn't eat enough she would threaten to take it up with my dad so I truly did not need that stress of them fighting so I stop telling her about these things. My sister, at this time is going through her own struggles.

Then my stepmom gives birth at the end of September, and with the new baby she gets more stressed and some post-partum depression. Her and my dad have a huge fight in October and I was like, wow, I don't have a stable adult in my life, which I told my dad. My dad is there but he has to prioritize my stepmom and work so in his life I kind of take the back burner. I even went to a unity church (and I am atheist but I believe in the power of meditation and mindfulness and community.) I try to find a therapist and I tell my dad but he doesn't try to look, and the ones that I found required a parent to bring me to the sessions and my dad is too busy for that so it wasn't an option. And at some point I gave up because I got busy with school and started spending more time with friends. Another side note is that my stepmom and dad don't really do things traditional parents do like make dinner and all, so I feel like super lucky if they make dinner for me. When my dad is in town, he makes me tea and sometimes a sandwich. Otherwise, I basically take care of all my meals.

Cut to mid January, I realize that I've been feeling waves of highs and lows, and that it was now affecting some grades in school. January to March is a bit of a blur, but it's very busy since I'm studying for the SAT and trying to keep up a social life. I still do all I can to get home late after school, like working there. Usually when I get home and my stepmom is there (she took an extended maternity leave from work), she wants me to help take care of my sister or have a snack with her for like an hour. I don't know if you guys are familiar with the IB program, but my workload is huge, and I don't have an hour after school to give to someone else. One time, I was talking about how I might start spending a few more days a week on my sport, and my stepmom says, ""well, I guess I will never see you again,"" and that makes me feel bad for trying to do more of something I love. Every time she bothers to ask which subjects I need to work on and I list it, she complains that I have so much work, like she's entitled to my time. We are fairly close, but once again, she can't control herself or put someone else's feelings above her own, except maybe my half-sister. On the note of my social life, I don't have a curfew and I am generally responsible, I let them know I am going out and I come home safe.

Around this time I just become much more numb to everything she says because I can't complain about it to anyone and it was not going to change. Another thing is, my dad is traveling for work half the time and my stepmom gets pissy about this because he needs to help with the baby. They went on vacation for like a week and left me alone in the house. I'm honestly so relieved when they leave because I can just relax at home and listen to the music I want to and not have to tiptoe around everyone all the time.

In April and May my motivation just drops and I forget the reason why I bother to even get out of bed, and like I start procrastinating more and getting to school late. I'm a very self-driven person (normally) and I figured out a lot about how I should deal with my emotions, and what insecurities I have that make me act in a certain way, before I moved because I wanted to be on top of my emotions and not sacrifice my mental health. Whoops.

After school ends, even after resting for a bit, I could not get out of bed to continue working on my Extended Essay (which is a 4,000 word research project part of the IB program that should be finished in the summer.) Getting out of bed requires serious talking to myself and motivating myself, it can take a while. My dad stayed in dc almost all of June and that was so rare since he's usually out. He starts complaining about all the parties I go to and coming home late, but I was just doing what I normally do, he just didn't have a clue because he never even calls when he's away. And then there are a couple times when I come home a couple hours later than I was supposed to, (like 7pm instead of 5,) and they get mad at me for ""taking them for granted."" Another time, I told my stepmom I would visit a daycare with her (for the second time, I had already seen it before,)  but then instead on that day I decide to go visit my friend whose grandfather just died, and she again said that I was taking her for granted. I even started taking morning shifts of taking care of my sister so that they wouldn't have to pay for a babysitter every day, which is tiring because I get home late from sports and still have to eat dinner.

Again, my dad and stepmom decided to go on a 10 day vacation and return just before I leave for the philippines so they can drop me off to the airport. The night before they leave, I realize, one of the things that had been hurting me is  the lack of support from parents. I don't know what I'm doing and I just do whatever I want and try to be as responsible as possible, but I do need guidance. I am very independent so I don't like to ask people for help and I don't want to beg my father to parent me. I am so grateful that I have a home to live in and that I can afford meals. But that's about it. Everything else I do on my own. My dad told me he knew a few people who would help me get an internship this summer so I held off on applying for summer programs and then he hears about some of the programs my friends are in and he asks me why I didn't apply.. and it's because I was relying on him. On the morning they leave, I tell my dad about the things I've been feeling. My dad is narcissistic so I phrased it in a way that wasn't explicitly blaming him for my feelings so he wouldnt get too defensive but perhaps too well because it didn't really seem to bother him very much. I was worried that telling him these things would make him not want to go on his vacation but it didn't.

I recently reconnected with my mom but I don't know how to fix this problem. I've told my dad many times that I want more support (with the therapist and the recent talk,) but he doesn't seem to be doing anything, so I have to do something for myself because I really can't continue hurting myself like this. The weirdest part is that my stepmom has been the most constant adult in my life and she truly wants to support me and listen to me but she is also a huge cause of stress.

Anyway, I thought I was being dramatic and all for months but at this point I find it hard to focus and think properly and I need to be able to function through my last year of high school. Any objective thoughts would be great since I've never really had an outside perspective on this. Thank you for taking time to read this.

8wvuq2,96,2018-07-07,Practical tips for Medicine Interns,MetaPhysicianBlog,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/8wvuq2/practical_tips_for_medicine_interns/,"These are practical tips about how to carry out and apply the things we all know.

For example, we all know to be nice to others. Tell me how exactly do we plan to do that taking care of 70+ patients, we don't know what day it is, our last day off was we don't know when and our pager is buzzing every 20 seconds? Suddenly we need some new heuristics.

**1) Be Efficient**

How do we overcome the blistering pace? Being efficient.

* Use Evernote wisely (see below)
* Make templates on Epic (or steal some from seniors) for common diagnoses (CHF, MI, SOB, PE, diarrhea, CP, sepsis)
   * You won't forgot any important questions when interviewing patients b/c you'll picture this in your head.
   * You won't have to reinvent the wheel every time you get the same diagnosis
   * You can build upon that template throughout the year.
   * When someone reads your note you'll look more organized
   * When you present you can be better organized b/c you'll picture the layout of the note
* Ask the chiefs who the most efficient resident is.
   * Then sit next to that resident and see where they click , how they write down notes, how/when they call consults, what they don't do (chat with friends, check their phone)
   * Every single time you click somewhere you drain your mental stamina - use shortcut keys they go a long way!
* Use dot phrases for things you type regularly (*this is how court reporters type 225 wpm)*
   * ip = improving
   * dn = denies
   * 22 = likely 2/2
   * na = no acute events overnight
* Search epic phrases to pull into your killer template
   * When you're presenting instead of clicking at ""Labs"", ""Imaging"" or ""Microbiology"" when you're asked about the lastest CXR, BCx or whatever you can stay on ONE screen and that is the Progress Note. Spend time finding out Epic phrases that will do all this for you. For example, I found a way to pull in latest BCx results, latest CXR read, last 3 CRs, echo results , last BM, glu trends etc.
   * The beauty of this is you'll be looking at one screen. You'll click around less. Those seconds add up.
* Use the 'note' function on Epic
   * Instead of handwriting your pre-rounding notes you can *type* them and then print them off on your census report.
   * Bonus: You can clear them out and write down questions you want to ask the patient for the *next* day. For example, if there was a CHF exacerbation I'd write down: ASK: worsening SOB? CHECK: Cr, BUN, weight, O2 requirement, I/O EXAMINE: LE edema, breath sounds. That way when I arrived the next day I could focus more on the new admits. And before I went into the pt's room I could just check my quick notes (and then I could write in the answers if needed while walking to the next patient's room). I would only write down high yield info. That way when I was presenting I could just reference my notes.

**2) Use apps on your phone**

Make a folder on your phone and put it on the first page.

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/): organizes your notes so you can pull them up when rounding/going to see a patient (If your hospital blocks Evernote try [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/))
* [Rain Rain](https://www.rainrainapp.com/): natural sounds will drown out the nurses complaining about whatever and/or the tele machine buzzing
* UpToDate: duh
* [DxSaurus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diagnosaurus-ddx/id833728910): Got paged to see a patient with n/v in the ED? Type that in and this app will give you a quick guide of what think about and what to not miss
* [MdCalc](https://www.mdcalc.com/) \- Gets you the FeNa, CHADS2-VASc, MELD, Wells Criteria, CURB 65 etc quickly.
* [Journal Club](https://www.wikijournalclub.org/app/): highlights from landmark studies.
* [Forest App](https://www.forestapp.cc/en/): we're all addicted to our phones. This one makes it easier to put the phone down.

**3) Sleep**

Sleep is a weapon - use it.  Be vigilant about this. But how?

* Turn your phone to 'nighttime mode when you get home'
* Set a time you want to start to unwind at.
* Have a routine -&gt; visit a certain website, watch a show, listen to a song, take a shower, etc
* If needed take a sleep aid (melatonin, benadryl etc)

**4) Have standard phrases**

This is in reference to the above scenario. Where did I get this idea from? Obama used to wear only a handful of suits and ties. Zuckerberg does this same with his wardrobe. Why? Because it frees up mental bandwidth.

* Example (responding to a page)
   * You: Hi this is \_\_\_ I was paged.
   * Nurse: Blah blah blah blah blah
   * You: Thank you for paging me. (*You appear nice)*
   * Nurse: blah blah blah.
   * You: I hear you. (*empathy points)*
   * Nurse: blah blah blah
   * You: Hmmm, is that right? (*so you can let them finish)*
   * Nurse: blah blah
   * You: Thank you so much, (his/her name). (*shows you remember his/her name and that goes a long way)*
* More examples:
   * Some question you don't know on rounds -&gt;  No I do now know that but I'd be happy to look it up
   * You being asked if you would take a patient while the other team has 2 patients -&gt; Absolutely/Gladly
   * The patient is complaining about X -&gt; I hear you.
   * The nurse is asking you a non-urgent question when you are on patient 2 of the morning and running behind -&gt; That is a really good question. Let me round back to you later.
   * During your plan when you want to suggest something -&gt; What are your thoughts about (giving more lasix)
   * When your attending wants to do some other plan -&gt; That is completely reasonable.
   * When walk into the room and see the nurse -&gt; How's your day going/Did you have a good weekend?
   * When the consultant belittles you -&gt; I'm sorry for disturbing you Dr. X. Thank you for your time.
* For your cell phone - type in 2-3 letters and have a phrase come up
   * Where should I meet you?
   * Gladly.
   * Hey, I am going to sign out. Is there anything else you'd like me to do? I'd be happy to help out.
   * Could you please come and see this patient with me? I'm in X
   * Where are we rounding this morning? And what time?
   * Good evening. This is MetaPhysician. Please let me know the best time for signout. Thanks!
   * Hey is there anything you need help with? I'm wrapping up.

The reason this works again, is to free up mental bandwidth. You can 'buy time' time chill out/think/relax/space out when you employ pre-made phrases.

**5) Set a Routine**

Routines help put things on autopilot so we can focus on more important tasks.

* Take the same route to work
* Use the same computer when you arrive
* Eat the same breakfast
* Bring the same snacks
* Use standard phrases (above)
* Finish 1 L of water before noon, and 1 L before you leave the hospital
* Have a nightcap routine (see above)

**6) Disengage from the Hospital**

The hours and responsibilities are ratcheted up quickly. Here is the truth- you can handle it! However, what I find some people struggle with is finding a way to release that stress. They have trouble finding a way to 'get back to being themselves.' What worked before doesn't work now. For example, they can't run 18 miles a day and eat healthy 3x a day. Suddenly it is an accomplishment to eat just 3 meals a day (and to take the stairs).

Whenever you have a stressful task add on something that takes your mind away from it.

You may have to find a new strategy to take your mind off things.

Obviously avoid things that will get you in trouble (too much EtOH, drugs)

* Play with your dog
* Read new websites
* Walk around the block
* Listen to music
* Shows on Youtube/Netflix/Hulu
* Trivia night with friends
* Tinder, Bumble
* Find something that will make you laugh (like my [website](https://metaphysicianblog.com/blog/) filled with medical satire)

Notice how simple those things are? Yes, the bar is that low. You need to set 'little victories' for yourself because intern year is quite humbling.

**7) Find Ways to Study without ""studying""**

In med school we went to the library or coffee house. In residency, we don't have the luxury of time to set aside dedicated locations or time. So, we need to reinvent ourselves and squeeze in learning whenever we can.  Shoot for 5 min blocks. That is it. If you can do this 3x a day over the course of the year you'll build a solid foundation.  And again, you won't have the stamina to read. You need to switch it up - podcasts, videos, easy to digest bullet point sites etc to keep yourself engaged.

When to find time:

* walking into the hospital
* taking the stairs/elevator
* a boring lecture/conference
* commuting in/out of work
* eating lunch

Resources (*Put these on your home screen folder, too)*

* Podcasts
   * [USMLE Step 3 Prep](https://www.apolloaudiobooks.com/usmle-step-3-prep/)
   * [Hospital and Internal Medicine](https://hospitalmedicine.podbean.com/)
* Easy to digest websites

   * [BID EKG](https://ecg.bidmc.harvard.edu/maven/mavenmain.asp) \- try to do 3 a day
   * [ Learning Radiology](http://learningradiology.com/misc/cowindex.htm)

**8) Evernote**

Let's face it there are some days we are so tired we forget our own names. I mean when we have to check our phones after asking our patient what day/month it is it will be even harder to remember some esoteric (or even basic!) question to ask.

Tips

* shorthand and easy to understand. Ideally, you should be writing like you're texting not like you're using a keyboard. The idea is you can reference this when walking to the patients room or going down to ED. And only add in stuff you *don't* already know.
* Don't spend time writing in stuff you know cold (ie STE for MI, BNP for CHF).
* Have this open on your computer when you pre-round/write-notes + have app open when you round

How to make this work

1. Create an entry (think high yield here: CHF, CP, MI, Sepsis, PNA, DKA, Respiratory Failure, Acid/Base status, AKI, Cellulitis, Diarrhea, Nausea)
2. Make headings

* How to recognize it
* Questions to ask
* Labs/tests to order
* DDx (including don't miss diagnosis)
* Tx

1. Add in info from short readings/podcasts/lectures/rounds from above

**9) What Scares You**

This is different for each person. For me it was when I was visiting a friend who was on ICU. I walked by a patient room and noticed he went into some tachyarrythmia. I then became tachycardic. It wasn't even my patient or service! But I realized that the other things in other rooms didn't scare me so much - sepsis, renal failure, heart failure etc. It is different for each person. I realized it was the things I had to make fast decisions about that scared me - reading an EKG, the patient becoming acutely hypotensive, the patient becoming acutely SOB.

Here is how to find out what scares you

* When you sit down to pre-round and you see the CC or admitting dx you become nervous
* You can't answer questions during conferences

What to do

* Make a note in Evernote (see above)
* Learn from the resources above (see above)
* Answer the questions
   * What can I do to kill them?
   * What can I do to temporize them?
   * Worst case scenario what is the killer diagnosis I cannot afford to miss (also in the Evernote recommendation)

8ww8un,2,2018-07-07,I simply don't feel ok right now,jasap1029,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8ww8un/i_simply_dont_feel_ok_right_now/,"In the past three weeks I've found myself teetering between feeling ok and being incredibly depressed. I'm on 30mg of nortriptyline for migraines and I don't know if that's causing me to feel this way. I've been stressed a lot lately and feeling isolated at work and in my personal life. One of my few friends is away in another state for an internship for the summer. I hate my job and I don't think the person I work under likes me at all. I have nothing to do there and am very bored.

I decided to post this today because I've been getting deep feelings of just not wanting to be here anymore. I'm out with my girlfriend and I feel alone. I feel like I can't speak and I feel disjointed. Any sort of social interaction feels awkward and weird. None of this is my girlfriend's fault but I keep screaming in my head for her to stop talking. Any persistent noise makes me feel disoriented and like I can't focus.

I've tried finding a therapist but anything I find I don't know if they accept my insurance or, if I find them through my insurance, I don't know if they are any good. I asked my neurologist for a recommendation weeks ago but all they told me was that I need to find one that accepts my insurance and they'd be happy to send a referral. Not what I wanted at all. I feel like I don't know what to do anymore. Sorry for such a long, rambling post, I just needed to get this out. "
8wwt2c,1,2018-07-07,Drove 10 hours to see girlfriend but come to realize she's telling everyone i'm her friend and is kind of ignoring me.,Omnibop,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8wwt2c/drove_10_hours_to_see_girlfriend_but_come_to/,"Ok so my situation is kinda similar to the guy that posted here a couple of days ago, but much less crazy and no sexing. I've been dating a girl for about 6 months. She's always kinda been distant but dating wasn't really a priority and we agreed to keep it casual but we aren't seeing anyone else. we would act like a couple, hold hands, kiss and sex.

She's doing some internship work in a different state for the summer and I went on a trip to my buddy's which is in a on the way to her place and she is doing an internship near a place where I wanted to visit. So I asked if there was a possibility of me coming through and staying for the weekend, hanging out with her and going to the place I wanna visit. She says yeah she's super excited and that her roommates wanna join is that cool, I'm like yeah no prob whatever. 

So I'm driving up to her place I am 6 hours in, she texts me asking if it's ok if I can venmo her friend for the hotel we are all gonna split so we can stay near the place we are going to. It was like $30 no big deal sure. Then I asked her how many people were coming and she says 8. She has like 2 roommates. Keep in mind at this point I hadn't seen her in 3 months. 

I told her that I didn't mind hanging out with her friends but the sudden change in plans is a little uncomfortable, what if I wasn't cool with it and I was 6 hours in driving to come hang with you. She said we could just not go to the place and do our own thing. I told her no it's ok I don't mind extra people but I'd like to know in advance. So she says she's sorry and I say it's ok.

I get there yesterday night and I meet everyone, it's all ok. My gf introduced me to them and we shot the shit. They all seem like great people. At night me and her cuddled and talked at night. She seemed like she didn't want sex, I was ok with it since we were cuddling and stuff.

In the morning we go to the place and it's ok. But she's borderline ignoring me. I would find myself sort of isolated quite often. Her friends made more convo with me than she did, she would talk to her other friends and maybe occasionally walk next to me. I would try to put my hand around her but she would kinda move away. Sometimes she won't even listen when we do start a convo. There has been times when I started telling her something and she would just start talking to one of her friends and join their convo. Sometimes when I start telling one of her friends what we did together once in the past she would kind of try to stop the convo asap. She's the only connection I have with these guys and I can't say anything that I did with her.

I'm a little perplexed. I don't leave here till tomorrow, we are planning on drinking and having fun tonight. But it just feels so difficult and I feel hurt. I drove all this way to spend some time with her, but it feels like it's just her, her friends and I'm just an add-on.

I'm really rethinking hanging out with her in the future, but I really like her. Any advice?"
8wx25m,6,2018-07-07,Escape from Monsierre,GotUsernameFirstTry,createthisworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/8wx25m/escape_from_monsierre/,"The houses were stretching out endlessly into the horizon. She was looking out a wall opening atop a stone tower. The sun shone her directly in her eyes sitting just a few fingers above the horizon; the sun would set within a few *Mes*. The sky was no longer blue all around; it was a deep purple to the west with shades of red gradually building from the setting sun. Even though the skies were clear and the sun was shining on the city, shadows covered every street and rooftop. People were moving around in the shadows, though she could not focus on any one of them. Her gaze was directed towards the setting sun. It didn’t hurt her eyes looking into the sun, so she could easily take pleasure looking at the warm sun. No wonder her people worshipped the sun, it seemed to fill her with a will to live and energy to force her will through.  
The sun was standing just above the horizon. The sky was turning slightly orange and red just above the western horizon. The sun itself was a shining bright white. And it just kept getting brighter and brighter as it neared the horizon. It finally touched the horizon. She noticed now that any hint of purple in the sky was gone – it was all orange now. A flickering orange.  
She looked over the houses. Flames were quickly devouring the entire city. Every house was aflame, every street was burning vigorously. She looked around her tower room. Everything was burning. She looked down herself. She was burning too. How could she not have felt it? How was everything just suddenly aflame?  


Marellé jumped out of her berth, panicking. She made sure she hadn’t burned herself during her sleep like the last time she had that dream.  
“Go to sleep again, Marellé. We will arrive in Monsierre in the morning.”  
Marellé looked down on her pretend-husband lying on the floor with a blanket. They were officially sharing a berth in their cabin, but as her pretend-husband had tried taking advantage of her during her sleep, she had burned marks into his wrists and confined him to the floor along with a promise, that if he ever tried something like that again, he would be able to derive pleasure from himself by shoving it up a place, where “the sun won’t shine”. He acted civil on the rest of their trip.  
Marellé climbed into her berth again. She needed the sleep; she felt the Shadow Corps was exhausting work. She wasn’t interested in her work, but as divine powers had taken everything from her and given her a place among the Shadow Corps along with the powers needed to grow to greatness within she had a time saying no to their requests. Shortly after joining the Shadow Corps the oracle from the temple in Os Náputi had come to her privately and collapsed into another trance, explaining to Marellé, that if she wanted her people along the Na River to survive, she had to play along. She was to go to Monsierre to kill **the purple jewel**. It didn’t take long before an Erenese merchant arrived at Os Náputi paying the Erenese Shadow Corps of Os Náputi to export a few members to Monsierre before the Festival of Wealth. As Marellé didn’t have anything left in the city, she was chosen. A member from the Erenese Shadow Corps of Assgau were to accompany her as her husband going to Monsierre to bring tax moneys from the recently conquered province of Assgau.  
She lay restless in her berth. She would be arriving in Monsierre tomorrow. She had been around Toméllians before, but there aren’t many around the Na River, and especially not after the Kingdom of Semka started being able to run the cities without Toméllian interference. She was nervous to see how people would react to her, one of the Na people, arriving with a ship from Assgau – people regarded as being subservient to the Toméllians. She had brought her purple cloth her late husband gave her as a safety measure if she weren’t allowed to go where she was supposed.  

-----

“How did it go?” she asked.  
“Splendid”, he said. Marellé gave her pretend-husband a kiss on the cheek as he walked out from the audience with the Lin. She felt a voice coming from her mana ring.  
“I am fairly certain the so-called **purple jewel** is Lomeno Bedari, the inventor. Last I heard he is imprisoned in the western castle tower.” It was her pretend-husband speaking to her through magic. “Will you now tell me why you wanted to know that?”  
“I’m afraid it’s confidential to our own corps” she responded. “Let me take care of what I’m paid to do, then you can do yours. For now, I need to learn to know this city.”
“Let’s take a stroll around Polo Maradi Square, my love,” Marellé spoke out. “I’ve always wanted to see it.”  
They spent a few hours acting like they was interested in the different shops set up around the square. As they were eating the dinner Marellé’s pretend-husband had bought her they heard a trumpet-fanfare come from afar.  
“What is that?” she asked.  
“That is the Monsierran Purple being escorted into the city. If we go near, we will be killed, so don’t get any good ideas.”  
“Are we near it?”  
“They will go right through this square if I’m not mistaken.”  
A plan was starting to form in her head.  
“I need you to start a fire in the building next door”, Marellé whispered to her pretend-husband. “Just a small one, I need a distraction.”  
“Marellé, don’t even think about it. I won’t do it. I simply won’t. Now eat your dinner and we’ll start working tomorrow.”  
“You are under oath. You have to do it, not because I say so, but because the Corps demands it.”  
He didn’t like what he was hearing, his face losing its color. He might sacrifice his life for the Shadow Corps today.  
“It’s not like they know it’s us anyways”, Marellé whispered.  
“Marellé, this is the best defended city of the world. They have crossbowmen all the way across the Purple Stretch to shoot down those interfering. And their own Shadow Corps is famous for doing counter-espionage. The Erenese Shadow Corps hasn’t managed to pull off anything since the Fire of the Porcelain District. Of course they will notice a magical influx, it’s not like magic doesn’t leave a mark.”  
“No one is looking at us right now, and we are using magic to whisper.”  
“That’s different, this is a special spell used in the Shadow Corps, of course it won’t leave a mark.”  
Marellé thought to herself for a moment. Then she whispered to her pretend-husband once again: “Do exactly as I tell you: we leave here right now, and you go perform “The Calling”. I want every member of the Shadow Corps in this city to use just a hint of magic in public space. With magic everywhere in this city, the Monsierrans should have a hard time pinpointing the exact one they are looking for. If Monsierran Purple is so important as I hear it is, all eyes, physical as well as magical, point towards the caravan while it is here in the city. This will be a slight sabotage of the Monsierran Purple industry, certainly within the realms of what is expected of us in the Shadow Corps.”  
She stood up, thanked him for the meal, and left the restaurant. **I hope he goes through with it**, she thought to herself. **He has to.** She marched quickly towards the Lin’s palace. It was only a matter of time before the caravan came to the Polo Maradi Square. **I have to do my share as well**, she thought, and set fire to a nearby cart wagon.  
Right before she came to the western tower of the palace, screams where heard from where she had left. **Sounds like there has been a distraction**. She was now at the foot of the tower. Most of the guards were being guided towards the commotion. Marellé looked up at the tower. She had gotten here unseen, unnoticed. She just hadn’t thought about how she would get up in the tower. There was no chance of getting up there by going through the palace, too many guards were still patrolling inside. The only reasonable way to get up there was to climb there. Unfortunately for her, she was currently wearing her bright purple clothes and the Monsierrans used smooth bricks to build the tower – there were no uneven stones for her to get a grip on.  
She refused to give up now that she was right beneath the tower where this “Purple Jewel” was said to be. She had to take the risk climbing in her cloak. And she had to create the uneven stones herself. She checked her crystal rings and necklace. **Khaoran quality. There’s still lot’s of mana for me to use**, she thought to herself.  
She started her slow ascend by magically pulling out bricks until she could put her feet or hands around them. After using a step, she retracted it into the wall again to better hide her tracks. No one knows how long she would have to fight the Jewel, so she tried hiding her steps.  
She was getting close to the top when something caught her eyes. Guards were patrolling around the tower. The tower looking towards west near the end of the day meant that she was hanging from the tower in bright, purple clothes illuminated by strong daylight. She stopped climbing. She remembered what one of her colleagues at the Shadow Corps had told her. “Don’t move and don’t forget – people never look upwards.” Sure enough, the guards went patrolling below her, around the tower, without them ever looking up towards her. She let out a sigh in relief.  
“Hello? Anyone there?”  
The harsh voice came from the tower opening above her. Someone was walking towards the window. Marellé held herself still and saw a face looking through the opening in the wall. The hair and beard was unkept and gray was starting to show up, but beneath that was a face belonging to a fair man in his late 30’s. He didn’t seem to look around; he looked like he was trying to hear something. After a few seconds he withdrew his head again, mumbling “… must have been my imagination” to himself. In the short interval of time he turned his head, Marellé caught a glimpse of a green light coming from somewhere on his face.  
Marellé finished her climb and crawled in through the window, almost silently. She looked around to find the man and found him lying in a bed in the corner.  
“Are you the one they call the “Purple Jewel”?”  
The man was visibly startled. He quickly turned around and got out of bed.  
“Who’s asking?” he said with a tired voice.  
“His assassin,” she responded.  
“Well, yes, then I am the “Purple Jewel”. Or was, I am not that anymore. But I am still Lomeno Bedari, my dear assassin. What brings you here to my room?” His eyes were still closed and his head only turned slightly towards her.  
“Me being your assassin should imply what I’m here for.”    
“Why, yes, I got that. But who sent you? A Monsierran? Was it the Lin? Or perhaps his advisor, Forensa?”  
“You need not to care about who sent me. Only about how you want to go.”  
“Ah, but depending on who sent you, I could perhaps give you an extra payment if I go as I want. After all, you are stalling; tell me, have you killed a human being yet?” He got up, out of his bed and walked slowly towards Marellé’s voice, his eyes still closed. Marellé was bewildered by Lomeno’s questions. He seemed not to worry about his impending death.  
“Stalling?” she said, not as confident as she would have liked it. “You are the one stalling me with all those questions.”  
“I only ask the questions, you are the one wanting to answer them. Seems to me like you aren’t that great an assassin. Though you did manage to get into my tower. How exactly did you do that? I heard no doors opening, only a faint clamor in the distance and someone exhale – you, I suppose?”  
“I pulled the bricks in the tower wall out until I could get a grip on them and then slowly climbed upwards. But no more questi-“  
“Splendid!” Lomeno exclaimed, visibly excited. “Magnificent thought, sheer genius. I have spent many nights thinking how my savior would arrive, and I never thought of that entrance. Could you do me a favor and write it down somewhere, I need to remember that idea.”  
Marellé could only stand and watch as Lomeno walked around the room, feeling his way across the tables to find some paper and a quill. This was a bit different to what she had expected. She had thought the Jewel to be an easy target, he was imprisoned, surely she must have been able to picture him as criminal in some way, making it easier to burn them in their bed. But this man, he was so full of enthusiasm, it’s like he hadn’t even understood that he was about to die. But something in his choice of words made her think. It seemed like he knew she was coming.  
Marellé looked confusingly at Lomeno currently resting his upper body on a table sorting papers he had drawn and written on seemingly from memory.  
“Did you know I was coming?”  
“Why, yes, I had a vision.” He continued sorting his papers while speaking. “I was told someone would come save me. Have you ever seen the Light of Mount Beder?” 
“No”, Marellé said, still confused about what was happening.  
Lomeno got up from the table and turned his head towards Marellé, missing it only slightly. He opened his eyes. They shone a bright green light like the one she had seen hanging outside the tower.  
“This is the light of Mount Beder. Or at least, that’s what I see. It’s a magical place here in Toméllé, no one really knows what is causing the light, but it is there. And for two years it has been calling me, wanting me to come find it. But I got locked up in this tower. About a year ago I completely lost my sight, the green light taking over my entire vision. That’s when I had this dream, where I was told someone would come and save me, get me out of this tower and bring me to Mount Beder. And now you’re here!”  
“No no no no, wait a *Me*, I’ve met people possessed by some higher powers telling me to come to Monsierre to kill the Purple Jewel in order for me to save my people.”  
“Then I’m afraid you’re too late, I am no longer the Purple Jewel. Everything I could do to bring others in danger has already been done – I am no longer a danger to your people.”  
Marellé didn’t know what to answer. It was true; she saw no reason as to how this blind man in the tower could possibly be of harm to her people. And he had apparently had a vision as well; well, in her case people had been possessed, certainly more authentic than a dream, which everyone could claim… but so could possession.  
“Seems like the gods haven’t really decided what is supposed to happen in our lives.”  
“I believe they have their own intern struggles in which we are but their pawns to play with. Just because they possessed someone it doesn’t mean they speak the truth; some of them mess with humanity. But let me tell you this, we can make both visions come true – take me to Mount Beder and let us find out what has been calling me and then you can kill me. And then we’re both happy. Well, you’re happy, and I’m dead. You too, perhaps, no one has yet survived visiting Mount Beder. What do you say?”  
“Give me a few *Mes* to think”, she said and started pacing around the tower room. It had to make sense somehow. Has he been lying? Could he do some sort of mind reading? Or had he really had a vision? His eyes were certainly weird.  
She looked out the window opening. In front of her a great city unfolded, houses stretching far away. The sky was a deep purple with red starting just above the horizon. The sun was in the midst of a sunset. A familiar sunset of some kind. The skies didn’t turn that purple back home, so where had she seen it before? Then it hit her. She was seeing what she had been seeing in her dreams countless times before. It wouldn’t take long before the flames would start appearing. She started panicking, sweat running down her back.  
“I’ll take your offer, Lomeno. But we will have to leave now.”
“As you can see I have already packed what I need,” he responded. Apparently he had been sorting his papers into what he needed to bring and what could be left and was putting it all into a bag while Marellé was pacing around the tower. “But I can’t climb down like you came up, as you’ve probably guessed, I’m blind.”  
Marellé looked around, trying to think of another way to get out. She noticed the blankets in the bed; apparently there were a few.  
“How about binding the blankets together?”  
“It’s just short of what we need for what I reckon would be a safe landing.”  
Marellé tried to turn the idea over in her head; it was the only way out she could think of where she could bring Lomeno down with her.  
“We can use my purple coat, I have en extra ordinary coat with me.”  
She took off her purple cloak and bound it together with the blankets and coats she could find in the room in a couple of minutes. She bound one end to a candlestick sitting in the wall and threw the other end out of the opening.  
“Out, now”, she said.  
Lomeno followed the blankets to the window and started sliding down them, quickly followed by Marellé. They had to drop a few meters down at the end, but aside from bit of pain in her legs, it didn’t hurt much.  
She looked around; it didn’t look like any guards had seen her. They were probably still occupied with the caravan.  
“Follow me, we’ll stay close to the walls”, she said.  

-----

They had arrived at one of the gates, seemingly unnoticed by any members of the guard.  
“Now we just have to get past the guards and out of the city – we’ll probably be able to buy some provisions once we’re out”, Marellé said.    
“Are we at a gate now? Look for the side gates; it’ll be easier for us to go through one of them.”  
Marellé looked around, settling on a small gate guarded by two men.  
“I see one, now we just need to get the guards away from there.”  
She had barely uttered her words before a man came up to the gate from the outside. After a small discussion one of the guards opened the small gate and escorted the man into the next-door building. Now only one guard guarded the open gate. Marellé used the opportunity to start a small fire in a nearby cart, causing the guard to run over to look at it.  
“Quick, now’s our chance!”  
She took Lomeno by the hand and started running towards the open gate. She could feel her heart racing.  
She passed through the gate with Lomeno right behind her, now outside the city walls. She noticed smoke from a fire pit placed between a few houses not to far away and started heading in that direction, still dragging Lomeno with her by his hand. While walking she played in her head what she had heard the guard speaking to the man from the outside say:  
“…disturbed right now, it’s too late.”  
“He’ll have to; Erene is declaring war.”

On this post I’m just going to let all my feelings lose and I’m not sure if this is the right sub for letting everything on my mind off (please comment the correct sub to do this in) and I would just like some advice on how to lose weight efficiently because I feel the main reason I’m gaining all my weight back is due to how I went about it at the start. I’ve always been self conscious of my weight and as a teen it makes me feel bad. I don’t have any mental disorder of depression or eating disorder. I just feel sad about it and it often puts me off going on holidays or going to a beach. My mother also struggles with weight loss. Not sure if this had anything to do with it but most of my family are over weight and they say it’s something to do with our genetically low metabolism but I feel like that’s a cheat / excuse of not being able to lose weight. And I would like to think my family don’t eat unhealthily. Every-days dinner would either be roast chicken with either mash or roasted chips(fries) and a salad with mostly water sometimes a Coke Zero. Or we would have a curry with white rice and sometimes we would have couscous with lamb. As I state later on I normally don’t eat lunch at school and breakfast. I eat last nights dinner when I come from school.

At first the way I would go about losing weight was during last years Ramadan and this is what I felt appropriate for me as I wouldn’t eat all day anyway and at the end my mother was very strict with what I ate because she wants the best for me and knows I don’t like being overweight (even tho I don’t show it to her because I’m teen and don’t want to show my mother my feelings). So what I would have is just 2-3 lightly fright chicken breasts. A salad and a glass of coke. This was going well and I was losing weight.

Then about a year ago everyday after school I would go to my mums job. (Worked for her unofficially) and when I arrive it would around 4pm where either a box of sushi (6 calirolls, 4 nigri, 4makizushi) or a ready meal which was mainly just a Mac and cheese. And this is when I was around high 90s to 100kg. And doing this would make me lose like 2kg a week and then I didn’t think that was unreasonable I was just happy however when I’d talk to school friends about it they would just say I’m losing ‘Water weight’ and I’m going to gain it back anyway. I didn’t want to believe him at the time because I wanted to feel good about myself so I just thought to my self to ignore him. But now that I’ve gained the weight back I’m feeling as if he’s right.

Time went on and my normal day when school started again would be. No breakfast. No lunch at school. Come home and either eat last nights 
dinner or a bowl of cereal. Sometimes 2 or 3 as both my parents come around 7pm. This was good for me as I would only be eating once a day and I was losing weight fast and I felt this was the right thing to do.

Then as of recent, maybe 6-7 months ago I was gaining the weight back quickly. There were a lot of birthdays during the end of the year + New Years and all the cake and bad food led me to gaining a lot of weight very quickly but I just told myself it’ll be fine because it’s just a one off. But because there were so many special occasions I started eating more regularly (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and I was certain it was less than my required calorie intake but I was still gaining weight and I didn’t know why and I’m assuming now it’s due to me being used to only having 1 meal now I’m having 3 and the ‘water weight’ which lead me to believe I was losing weight was all a lie. I couldn’t get myself to stop eating 3 meals as I hated only having 1 meal and I would be in pain everyday. 

This years ramadan didn’t help either. I was only eating one meal which would be at most 5 spring rolls and a plate of rice and meat with a salad. But I was still gaining weight and this all really made me lose all motivation.

And here we are to the present where it’s the holidays which are my weak points as school isn’t limiting me so I always find myself thinking I’m hungry and I eat a little more than I should and I gain a substantial amount of weight very quickly and I’m back at where I started and I don’t feel like I’m slowing down and I would just like some help and maybe personal 1-1 convos with people who are knowledgeable in this area so I can talk to them about my problems and maybe they can help with a nutrition diet. I’d also like assistance in someone pointing me in the right direction of interns of at home workouts. There’s no gym near me and I really dislike jogging. However knowing the fate comments have for me after saying that I’m seriously considering starting to jog. But still the same with the in-house work outs.


If you read till the end thanks for listening to my problems. Sorry it’s so long my feet got numb from sitting on the toilet so long and writing this.

Please excuse me for my shamelessness. But, I really need some help with my startup called Stockenja. We have created a product to predict stock direction. The name of this product is called Crystal Ball.

Our startup is at its infancy but we have gotten interest from one investor/partner. I need 2 interns (working and learning 20 hours/week up until end of August) to help out with developing a few morefeatures. The help needed is mainly on the frontend using Javascript or React.  

Unfortunately, we are a very very early stage startup and we cannot offer salary. However, we are offering the following things:

(1) Free lifetime top tier membership to use Crystal Ball. (Even if the venture doesn't work, I will still keep hosting this software myself because I use it everyday)

(2) I will host a 1-hour lesson every morning with the 2 interns to learn about stock trading and investing. Interns will have the option to do paper trading in the morning and write code after 11am. I am an OK stock trader and have a few good techniques that learnt over a year.

(3) Conditional cash payment for your work. Dependent on whether the company makes money or receive seed investment within the first year. For details, please PM me.

(4) Flexible time to learn React and training to understand how to build a web app from the ground up.

(5) No experience required. All I need is you have finished first year and can write code.

8wx4fm,44,2018-07-07,137 days and counting: Encouragement and Tips,Tinarkii,NoFapChristians,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFapChristians/comments/8wx4fm/137_days_and_counting_encouragement_and_tips/,"Hey guys (and gals too),

First of all, that number's accurate (hardmode too, yeah boi). I wasn't around the reddit for day 90 so [here's this](
https://i.redd.it/0q2uuocjsmi01.gif) to make up for lost time.

**On to other stuff... a little bit of my story. (Scroll to the bottom for my ""tips"")**

I started masturbating and looking at porn halfway through eighth grade. I've now finished my second year in college so its been 6 years. Fortunately I've always seen porn (and masturbation) as a bad idea so I've been fighting it the entire time I've been struggling, but I'd never found great victory in that fight. In eleventh and twelfth grade I told people about my struggle, and that definitely helped me at those times, but it wasn't enough for me to make lasting change. At the end of it all, I was back to fapping and watching porn.

Going into college just escalated the issue too. Even though I had a roommate it was so much easier to get away with fapping in college than at home. Also, this last semester I had no roommate which could create some really bad situations for temptation and urges. I'd have week long+ binges and kinda stopped caring. This factored into a depression I was also struggling with, and it put me in a really low point. My school work ethic was basically non-existent and I didn't think I even had a future at college. I was prepared to drop out after this year and figure things out as they came.

**This is where this subreddit, and a bunch of other stuff come in.** Last February, I was at a really low point. No plans, no motivation, no life. I knew I was in a bad place, but I wasn't taking any steps to fix it. Enter in the super-shot. That is to say that I sought help from a variety of sources.

* First, I started seeking out a counselor, which my college provides free of charge. This was huge, as it helped me to start voicing some of the bigger stuff (beyond fapping) I was struggling with that were keeping me from going anywhere with my life. He also had some suggestions for me about fighting masturbation. For sure, if your school offers it, or if theres a service you can afford, I would suggest going to see a counselor. Especially if fapping isn't the only hardship you're going through. *There's nothing weak about seeking help.*

* Second, I started seeking out God. I hadn't observed lent before, and it was about to start, and I knew I was struggling with poor priorities, so I decided to give it a shot. I went off videogames, youtube, and twitch for lent. This helped open me and my schedule up to hearing from God as he spoke to me over the next couple months.

* Ofcourse, going from 6 or so hours of youtube, twitch, or videogames everyday to none can leave one pretty bored, and whats the first thing I do when I'm bored? Why, fap, of course. So I went full on binge-mode for a while, which sucked, but the only upside to binging is that it shows you the full emptiness of fapping and watching porn. I was sick of being stuck with no drive and no desires. Out of the madness God brought me back to this subreddit and r/nofap. These two subreddits helped me decide to give nofap a shot again. They helped show me that fapping wasn't just something to avoid because it ""was sin,"" but was something that was actually bad for my wellbeing.

* And, I also got involved in the [Ascend](https://discord.gg/4reFDqK) discord. Its a nice discord that has just about everything one could need when fighting porn. Good discussion, places to vent, and incentives to get you to go the extra mile in the battle. This discord helped me *a lot.* I would not be where I am without it (There's a Christian channel in it too which is nice).

**About a week and a half prior to my spring break, I decide to give nofap another try.** The timing here was really good, as my spring break consisted of being with a group of guy friends together in Minnesota. We had a fairly packed week, so the only time we'd have to fap would be while pooping or in the shower (one of those friends knew about my specific struggles but the others didn't). During this week and prior time I'd started taking cold showers, which definitely helped for urges while showering. So, that was really good. If I could make it to the end of spring break I'd already be more than half a month through, which doesn't seem like much but at the time I wasn't even making it a week.

**During this time God was giving me huge strength in resisting urges,** to the point where I had a flatline, but didn't experience any of the downer-feelings people tend to feel when in a flatline. Instead, he was encouraging me and really rejuvenating me. I know people talk about superpowers on r/nofap, but I wouldn't describe what I had as such; it wasn't that I felt invincible, but that I felt God was shielding me from harm. I'm not sure how to explain it any better than that.

So I pass 1 month, but my growth isn't over. About that time is when my flatline seemed to end. I'd gotten by easy prior, but now I had to keep fighting. Masturbation wasn't my only problem either. I was still failing in school, and I needed to pass all my classes that semester if I was to keep attending that school. But, nofap doesn't teach you how to be a good student. I still struggled, and its here where I really know God was with me in my struggles. One night before a paper is due, I break down kind of. I'm sick of trying to be a student my way, and I don't even know how to begin making good choices at being a better student. I try to put in what I can, and God turns that into a mile. I don't get that paper done that night, but it and another (already 1 month late and not even started) paper get done within 3 days. The debate I have the next morning goes way better than expected, and I only got 3 hours of sleep the night before. I only answer 1 of 3 questions on a text I have that wednesday (another late night and too busy writing to study), but the prof curves it to the point that I pass with a C. In not even one week, God shows that what I can't, *he can.* If I do what I am given, and trust in him, he will bless it. Not because I deserve it, and not that he will make everything amazing, but that he will make schoolwork *worth it.* **So many of my struggles in my life boil down to me not feeling like the fight is worth it.** In one week God showed me that anything could be worth it if he made it so.

So, I've got the rest of the semester, and I push hard. I fight to get my work done (and ahead of time, somewhat) and to fight urges. I join in on some monthly challenges and facilitate one too. I pass my classes with a B average, but now I've got another problem. Because I hadn't properly prepared a summer internship for myself, I have to find a job for the summer, and while it wasn't easy (not even Mcdonalds would hire me), I've now got a job that isn't perfect but is working.

**And thats where I am right now.** I'm ~133 days into my streak, and I never want to go back. God has been *so* good to me, my friends have been good to me, and you people on the internet have been good to me. I'm not perfect. I can fall into odd ""loopholes"" of reading stuff on reddit I really shouldn't (*darn you AskReddit*), and watching stuff on youtube I shouldn't (*whats up with movies nowadays?*), but I'm fighting to get passed that. Thats my next step. After that, who knows.

**On to some tips**

* Get accountable. For some, this will be real life. For others, online. Whatever (or whomever) you need, get it. I had irl friends who could support me as well as online friends I could talk too when I couldn't talk to my irl friends. And, while I haven't made much use of an accountability partner *myself,* I have seen how useful and effective that can be for others. Discord was huge for me, as it gave me that 24/7 chat line to talk with other nofappers.

* Talk about it. Porn and masturbation can be really hard subjects to talk about, as they are either handled too light-heartedly or just feel really awkward to talk about. But, for all the awkwardness it may seem to cause, its important to talk about it. I've discussed it around some friends I wasn't even super close to but I know that my progress was visible to them and by speaking out myself (not in an activist sort of way, even), I've helped other people fight it more too (one guy asked me later about the app I use). Of course, you don't even have to talk about it like this for it to help. I told my counselor about my struggle and even that helped me. Sometimes getting words out that you need to get out can help a ton.

* Take it one day at a time. Its good to have goals, but don't let those goals scare you into giving up. I took it one day at a time, then one week at a time, then one month at a time, but it started with day one. Also, this philosophy carries even into my struggle now. I could have one bad day in a sea of great days, and if I'm not ready to fight that one bad day, I'll fail. I still take it one day at a time.

* As probably most of us here, I'm a hardmoder. One of the things that helped me a lot with it was this montra: ""Someday, but not today."" I want to have great sex with a spouse someday, and its important to remember that saying ""no"" today does not mean saying ""never."" The best things do not come *now,* they come in their time. Remember ""Someday, but not today""

* Even if it doesn't necessarily get easier, you get stronger. Fighting today helps build habits which help you fight tomorrow. An urge can spring out of nowhere and be stronger than anything you've had to deal with in months, but you've prepared with the strength you've already built up.

* And, remember to not be discouraged. We may fall a thousand times but God does not base his love on what we do but what he has already done. Also, God worked a miracle in me, **he can work a miracle in you too.** That is the only way I can describe what he did with me, and I am not some special case. God loves you. God wants you to succeed. Seek him. Hope in him more than you expect. Give God room to be God.

And... I think thats it. If you read any of this, thanks. Keep fighting the good fight. I hope this was encouraging. I'll still be around, but I mostly hang around the [Ascend Discord](https://discord.gg/4reFDqK)

I'll leave you with something I made to [remember what God did with me](https://imgur.com/a/LFZGDvj) these last few months."

She also goes through my things and says she’s “cleaning it because I don’t”. She thinks I need I need to have my house “inspected” (in jest) when I’ve lived in my own at college. She’ll pay for things and then get angry, pout, or occasionally have a serious depressive break when I say I’m uncomfortable with her going through my things and would rather pay for all my expenses or move out rather than her generosity being contingent on her being able to demand access to my time, my space, my possessions anytime she wants.
I’m currently living there for 2 months for an internship with my partner, who is working on a research paper. I always feel this constant resentment both when I’m there and also when I leave. I feel like she thinks I’m not grateful enough when I’m there, but she’ll also be angry when I go. She’s had depressive episodes I’ve had to pull her back from that have scared the absolute shit out of me. My dad has PTSD and is an alcoholic... he tries his best, but he has his own serious problems.
I don’t know how to rebuild a healthy relationship. I really love my mom and love spending time with her, but I hate this dynamic. I don’t want to be estranged from her, but my only coping mechanism right now is disappearing.  What would think if your kid felt his way and didn’t know what to tell you?"

&gt;I am a millionaire and acquired my wealth via my career and saving prudently.  You are accusing me of being a thief and a criminal.

&gt;Dial back the paranoia, narcissism and offensive language, Moimoi328.  You’re not the only one who is financially independent in this debate.  I couldn’t care less how much money you have.  Wealth envy is not an affliction I suffer from in life.  I’m also not a malignant narcissist. Contrary to what you tell yourself, you could have NEVER accumulated your wealth without the economic infrastructure which made it possible.  So, spare us all your Randian bootstrap fantasies.

&gt;I pointed out that a massive income and wealth redistribution scheme took place in the country because it *did*.  I watched that disgrace go down with an inside-the-beltway perspective on it.  This is a FACT substantiated by U.S. metrics and long-term trends.  Look it up since you don’t believe me.

&gt;Wealth is not an entitlement in this country.  If you don’t like that harsh reality, that is your problem alone.  This country doesn’t owe you what you think it does.

&gt;Oh boy, here we go.

&gt;&gt; Dial back the paranoia, narcissism and offensive language, Moimoi328

&gt;You and your ilk accuse people like me of being scum, selfish, criminals, thieves, etc in order to dehumanize us.  Then you make the claim that because we are these things, it’s ok to steal our wealth.  You are the one pointing the gun at me asking for my money.  Don’t be surprised when we fight back.

&gt;&gt; Contrary to what you tell yourself, you could have NEVER accumulated your wealth without the economic infrastructure which made it possible.  So, spare us all your Randian bootstrap fantasies.

&gt;The economic infrastructure that made it possible has been bought and paid for by those before me.  Those past economic transactions are IRRELEVANT to what is going on right now.  Anybody can take advantage of them.

&gt;&gt;I pointed out that a massive income and wealth redistribution scheme took place in the country because it did.  I watched that disgrace go down with an inside-the-beltway perspective on it.

&gt;Nope, absolutely disagree with your assessment.  There is no large scale orchestrated redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich.  It’s always been the other way around.

&gt;&gt; Wealth is not an entitlement in this country.  If you don’t like that harsh reality, that is your problem alone.  This country doesn’t owe you what you think it does.

&gt;This is so ironic it’s almost laughable.  You’re the one proposing to steal my income, presumably, because the poor should be entitled to some wealth.

&gt;So, I ask you again.  How much of my wealth, of which you did fuck-all to earn, do you want to steal from me?

&gt;We aren't in disagreement Union's feasted in the next generation future and had a great ride running up a credit card to be paid for by their children.

&gt;What we are in disagreement over is stealing money from the next generation is immoral and really risky.

&gt;All it takes is for the supreme Court to rule against Union's again and those unfunded liabilities to get defaulted on and all those people will loose the ability to steal from their children.

&gt;So you are concluding that union must be the cause of pension crisis despite the fact that SC, a right to work State, has far worst problem in unfunded liabilities?  Don't you think there are far many other factors at work?

&gt;I agree that Supreme Court need to forbid state govt from continue to underfund liabilities, if you make it hurt to fund those programs, you will think twice about doing the things that run up the debt.

&gt;What I disagree is the oversimplification of the pension crisis.  In SC, we are seeing fewer hires relative to growth, stagnated wages, and of course, over generous benefit.  But it seems you are focused on packaging a criticism of against union instead of trying to solve our pension crisis.

&gt;You just confirmed every observation I previously made and exposed/confirmed additional character flaws I never mentioned.  As malignant narcissists go, you’re definitely an overachiever.

&gt;&gt;The economic infrastructure that made it possible has been bought and paid for by those before me.  Those past economic transactions are IRRELEVANT to what is going on right now.  Anybody can take advantage of them.

&gt;As someone who has caught and imprisoned scores of white collar criminals/bankers, you think and behave exactly as they do.  You mistakenly assume this country and the world exist for your benefit alone.  They don’t.  Rest assured, the karma train and society will run you down in time.  When they do, you’ll deserve your plight.

&gt;I told you before, but it obviously bears repeating...I don’t need to steal your money because I earned my money.  I don’t concern myself with anyone stealing my money outside of crooked bankers/executives/politicians who think just like you do.  They’re the only weasels who would try.  They’re also the only weasels who feel entitled to embezzle from others.

&gt;One final point, switch to decaf, ease off the nose candy, stop watching Bullshit Mountain (aka Fox News) or all of thevabove.  You’re bouncing-off-the-walls crazy here.

&gt;You realize unions still exist in right to work states right? The fact that a state is right to work is not alone enough to prevent unions from forming corrupt deals that pass the burden of payment onto people that aren't even voting yet. The problem is government unions in general. They're fighting over other people's money. Nobody involved in these agreements has any skin in the game. Some of the states with the worst pension problems are conservative states - it's a fairly bipartisan problem, though it affects the blue states a little bit more.

&gt;That's SC, 1.6% unionized workers here.

&gt;Frankly, without mandatory union membership, they simply will stay irrelevant.  What is the point of hiring a union worker when we have someone else who is willing to work for less?

&gt;In my profession (teaching), it is easy for employers to exploit that.

&gt;And no, SC unions do not have any meaningful influence on any policies, the pension crisis is the state govt's own doing.

&gt;I cant speak for SC specifically. But texas has a decent pension problem due to corrupt deals with government unions. Kentucky if I remember right is #2 in the country, right between NJ and CA. It's a bipartisan problem. A lot of states exempt PD and FD departments from right to work laws apparently, so that's part of the reason why. But there are still other unions with power in maryland, where I live, which is a right to work state.

&gt;The world is mostly neoclassicalists because in the US, people who critiqued neoclassicalism were red-baited out of universities in the 60s.

&gt;I used to attend post-graduate economic discussion groups at UCLA. Most of the people had either Masters or PhDs in economics and over 90% had never actually read Marx. Only a handful had even heard of Bakunin. I didn't even get to things like Georgism.  It's an extremely narrow focus these days.

&gt;You’re making generalizations that aren’t true though. Unions play a critical role in free markets. Saying that regulations are bad doesn’t mean unions shouldn’t exist. I’d much prefer workers banding together for negotiations than a government enforcing it.

&gt;Also just for anyone else, just because I support the right to unionize doesn’t mean I don’t think they have flaws and can cause serious problems.

&gt;America is mostly neoclassicalist because it does the best job of explaining the economy. Marxism is absolute quackery.

&gt;But rest assured, with the spread of left-wing Marxist dogma in the Social Sciences and Humanities, Economics is slowly starting to be broken down and succumbing to the anti-scientific left-wing ideologies.

&gt;Yes social security is a Ponzi scheme and should be abolished asap.

&gt;The generation before me falling for a Ponzi scheme isn't a reason to destroy the future generation so irresponsible people can retire by theft.

&gt;It's harsh but generational theft is immoral.

&gt;Rarely do I have to say something like this but: I call bullshit on this post. I'm 34 now but my bachelor's was in Finance and Master's in International Econ and you weren't getting past even entry level Finance and Econ classes just as part of the business school as a whole without having a fairly solid understanding of these concepts. And like I said I'm referring to the business school as a whole: these were required entry level classes even for marketing majors.

&gt;I don't discount that you met a lot of statisticians and mathematicians studying Econ. Some more interested in the math than the theory, some like me that could study theory for the rest of my life, and all sorts in between but that is one of the beautiful parts of The Dismal Science. For every mathematician now we also have famous names like Dan Ariely approaching from a totally different background and mindset completely outside the realm of math and it's turned out beautiful!

&gt;I highly highly doubt you were sitting with a lot of people who earned PhD's in Econ (this is no small nor easy task by ANY measure) that look like a deer in headlights mentioning Bretton Woods and monetary policy. Unless, no offense but it is a possibility, you said something so baseless or outlandish they didn't know how to respond except stare at you like a deer in headlights.

&gt;I'm talking about a non classical analysis of the monetary policy. There's different proseminars. I mostly attended the economic theory ones and a bit of economic history for about 2 years about once a week. I made friends with a number of the people there.

&gt;It's a large department and generally the same people attended so maybe there were people I didn't come in contact with.

&gt;Business school and economic departments are certainly different places. I've never been to a business school. My background is engineering and math.

&gt;My favorite part is the length of time people spend typing on their cell phones for a couple different reasons.

&gt;1) To each make sure they make the next most obscure reference or theory. In a few more posts someone will be quoting parchment paper found to be 10,000 years older than current known civilizations that formed the basis for all modern Econ/Finance

&gt;2) Making sure there is at least one 10 letter word in each sentence.

&gt;I wonder how many of these people actually work in the private sector in Econ or Finance? I LOVE the theory that makes up Finance and Econ - more than any other part of it all as a whole. I am quite proud of the position I've managed to attain at the largest company of its type in the world working on the largest account in the world especially being a non-ivy like all my colleagues. If I spoke as people do on here to our Executive Leadership with such obscure references and such a condescending tone that would be the last time I spoke to them in a formal setting.

&gt;No one's telling you to abandon academic or scientific rigor in your field, but somehow elevating your field above other social sciences because numbers is faulty logic. You're studying human behavior just like the rest of them.

&gt;Here I'll just post it again for you

&gt;Proseminars - 11 characters. I can't help but to be an ass on this thread today. There are different proseminars? You mean there is more than one graduate level course or more than one graduate level course that allows undergrads at a university?? Lol. Good lord. See item two on my list below.

&gt;My favorite part of these threads are the length of time people spend typing on their cell phones for a couple different reasons.

&gt;1) To each make sure they make the next most obscure reference or theory. In a few more posts someone will be quoting parchment paper found to be 10,000 years older than current known civilizations that formed the basis for all modern Econ/Finance

&gt;If someone wants to eliminate social security then the consequence of that will be old people dying in poverty. If you go to the Wikipedia page for ""[History of Social Security within the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Social_Security_in_the_United_States)"" the first paragraph literally reads

&gt;&gt;A limited form of the Social Security program began as a measure to implement ""social insurance"" during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when poverty rates among senior citizens exceeded 50 percent.

&gt;Social security exists as a measure to reduce poverty rates among senior citizens.

&gt;The seminars are open to the general public and each subdepartment generally ran their own. I was 8 years out of graduate school before going to my first one in economics.

&gt;As far as the private sector goes, it's a different pursuit and a different set of values. I've worked at a number of for profit startups and in a number of research labs. They are doing different things and have different goals.  I don't think a good businessman would necessarily make a good researcher or that a good researcher would necessarily be good at business. They are quite different

8wy4hq,11,2018-07-07,I need to start somewhere,[deleted],selfhelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/8wy4hq/i_need_to_start_somewhere/,"This is basically my life story originally written for my former therapist, but never got a chance to share before I moved back to Boston. It's long and I don't expect anyone to read it as it's not particularly interesting or atypical.

I'm a 21 year old male college student in Boston, going on 22. 

I grew up in a medium sized town in New England as an only child of middle class parents who meant well towards me but fought constantly with eachother - I can't remember them ever kissing or even sleeping in the same room together, ever. In high school I got good grades, was in a lot of clubs (jazz band, sailing, FIRST robotics, theater, etc) but never really got past small talk with anyone from those clubs. I never talked to any girls (I was a scrawny nerd with unkept hair and braces/glasses and was insecure about it), and spent virtually all of my free time playing and talking video games with 4 dudes who were essentially in the same situation as me. After high school, we started smoking weed as a group which got us out of the house but we never really met anybody, our hanging out consisted of a burn cruise to a destination (usually a hike or food place) and a burn cruise back where we would play video games again.

In freshman year of college for the most part I hid in my room and continued to play video games and smoke weed over Discord with those same friends who were doing the same thing. I made a couple ""activity buddy"" friends to go to the gym, play tennis, watch shows, spring break vacation trip, etc with but never really connected with anybody. I joined a couple clubs and attended a few meetings but stopping going as I watched people connect with eachother and become friends while I didn't.  During this time I became very aware of my social anxiety as I would sit behind my dorm room door on a Friday or Saturday night listening to the acquaintances in the hallway talk about unrelatable things but feeling as though I was unworthy to join them as equals due to my lack of experience with conversation and women. It didn't help that I had a huge crush on the girl across the hallway from me but went the entire year seeing her every day and even hanging out watching shows every couple of weeks without expressing any interest beyond friendship - she was very outgoing and had tons of friends so I figured (likely correctly) that she'd have no interest in a guy like me, despite the fact that I was no longer nerdy looking or unattractive due to better grooming habits and exercise.

Sophmore year was mostly the same, except I was in an apartment with another guy who spent all his time playing online video games, and lost contact with most of the people I had met though common housing Freshman year. After that I went on a 6 month internship at an engineering company, where I was forced to become comfortable with work situations like presenting at meetings, etc. I ate lunch with my similarly aged fellow interns but didn't connect with anyone as I was embarrassed of my lifestyle and didn't want to tell anyone as I try to project an image of a straight shooting engineer type at work. My days consisted of going to work, getting home, making dinner, and spending the rest of the night getting high and playing games/watching Netflix. Weekends I would do the same thing but throw some bike rides and gym trips in for good measure.

Summer that year (20 years old) I got my first kiss and lost my virginity to a girl one of my original 4 friends from home introduced me to. This was the first time I asked a girl for her number and I was only able to do this as she literally told my friend that I was hot and asked him if I was single (LOL). Consistent with most first sexual experiences, it was extremely awkward and not at all enjoyable due to a combination of my lack of experience and social anxiety. It only happened once, and the ""relationship"" only lasted a couple weeks as even thinking about spending time with her gave me fits of anxiety as I tried to think up things to do together that didn't rely on my social skills, as I don't have any.

The next semester in Boston absolutely killed me with schoolwork and combined with my procrastination and depression I spent the entire semester in the library (including weekends) cycling between watching Netflix and attempting to do homework. I quit smoking weed during the week (because engineering classes take a functioning memory) for almost 6 months, and smoked on weekends when I could get it which was not often.  At this point I only had my gym/tennis buddy and my roommates (who I didn't really talk to besides a weekly dungeons and dragons game) for human contact. This was a miserable time for me, feeling hopeless, and wishing for death to the point where I stopped wearing a bike helmet hoping maybe I'd get hit by a car on my way though traffic going to campus. I wasn't ""suicidal"" to the point that I would seriously consider killing myself, but I wouldn't be unhappy if someone else did, if that makes any sense.

The next internship, I moved back home with my parents and started seeing a therapist after work who I was very honest with. Under her guidance I starting going to hiking Meetup groups every weekend(I love the outdoors) and tried to get more comfortable with failure and public embarrassment by going Contra dancing every week. For the most part, though, I spent my time after work working on my car by myself as I had just bought myself an older model sports car with came with a lot of issues. I got pretty obsessed, and definitely used it to distract myself from my issues, checking car forums 5x every hour and watching video after video in order to learn how to basically take the thing apart and put it back together again. I never really made friends with anyone on the Meetup groups either due to a lack of social risks: I'd go to the event, make small talk, and be friendly, and enjoy my time there but never gather any phone numbers or connect with anyone.

Today I sit back in Boston after my first week of summer classes, in the library alone after walking around Boston attending events alone to stave off the depressed thoughts that have been returning now that I'm in Boston. I would really like to get a life this semester as I have a lot of free time during the summer, but I can't stand the thought of going out alone on weekend nights and don't know anybody who is into that stuff. Everyone else I know (AKA my roommates) are in a relationship. I started up a Tinder account and matched with a bunch of attractive college girls in the area, but I haven't bothered messaging them as again, I still have no idea what to do with them or how to keep them entertained (how to have a conversation, basically), and I don't want to ask my roommates for ideas because I live with them and don't want to be known as the depressed loser who's so desperate for friends he'll ask anybody. I did open up to one of them, but he has his own life and obviously isn't in charge of making plans for me so I'll have a social life.

At work, you'd never know I had issues unless you spent a lot of time around me. When I have an ""objective"" in a conversation I do fine, because I can get what I need, ask the other person a few questions about their lives to appear friendly, and get out as soon as an awkward silence starts to happen. I've got no problem making eye contact, or stuttering, or anything like that; I'm really good at faking confidence until I run out of words which almost always happens quickly. My biggest ""tell"" is that I avoid eating lunch with coworkers as there's no objective and the constant awkward silences make me dread that part of my day.

 It's the objectiveless ""hanging out"" that I dread as I have nothing to talk about these days other than cars and the hikes I've done recently. Sure, I can ask the other person question after question but that gets weird pretty quickly, and nobody worth anything would want to spend any time with me given what I do Every time I see a group of laughing friends, I think ""I don't have those"" Every time I see a girl I find attractive I think ""I have no idea how I could approach her."" Every time I see a happy looking college couple I think ""I'll never know that"". Given that this is Boston, it's impossible to avoid any of the above so I'm just constantly fighting and trying to dismiss these automatic negative thoughts every time I'm out. I thought I was doing better at home but it turns out it was just that I never got to see what I was missing living in a smallish town and working as an engineer in a company with mostly older people.

If anybody actually read any of this, does anyone have any suggestions or can relate in any way?"
8wyg18,3,2018-07-07,Working During MACC?,cantprocessanything,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8wyg18/working_during_macc/,"Hey All!  I will be beginning a 1-year (Fall, Spring, Summer) MACC program in August. I wanted to get some input as to what you guys feel is feasible as far as working during my first semester this Fall. Our program incorporates the CPA exams, starting in the Spring, so I know I will not be working then. 

  
The classes I will be taking this semester are:

* Tax Research &amp; Planning
* Financial Statement Auditing
* Advanced Financial Reporting
* Accounting for Business Combinations, Government, and Not-for-Profits

I am not unfamiliar with time management, as I have worked 30-40 hours/week while going to school full-time during my entire undergraduate studies. I am not familiar, however, with the typical graduate level workload for MACC programs, and whether I will be able to juggle both. 

If I am offered a full-time position at the conclusion of my Summer internship, I am considering possibly asking to extend my internship through the end of the year part-time (\~25 hours/week) Is this a good idea? Would this come across wrong or reflect poorly at all? It's an audit and tax internship at a small office (\~30 people), mid-size international firm.

I'd really appreciate insight anyone could provide, especially if you had a similar experience! (Brand new account, so forgive the lack of post history!)

  
TL;DR: 12 credit hours of MACC program + 25 hours/week PA internship = feasible, or nah?"
8wynm8,0,2018-07-07,"I am thinking of building a PC, but my parents think I should invest all of my money instead.",juanmelk,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8wynm8/i_am_thinking_of_building_a_pc_but_my_parents/,"So, I've been big into PCs in general and PC gaming for almost my whole life, but I've never built my own PC and never really owned my own desktop. I'm currently going to school for Computer Information Systems (wanted to do Computer Science but that's it's own story) and am going into my second year in about a month with a 3.7 GPA.

I am on nearly fully scholarship, costing just a few hundred dollars per semester including room and board, so virtually all my expenses are covered as long as I maintain a 3.0 GPA, which I don't think will be a problem even with this purchase.

I had a really good internship opportunity this summer making $14.50/hr + overtime, working around 50 hours a week, only working about a month~, so in total I stand to come out with about $3500~ before I go back to school, about $2500 already.

I really want to get a reliable desktop PC that can handle some of my backlog that I bought but haven't been able to play (Witcher 3, Dark Souls 3) or games that I enjoy but can't play on my Surface particularly well (Path of Exile, Warframe). I'm interested in getting into VR but recognize that a headset is a sizable additional cost, but the PC I would want would probably be capable of it anyway.

I've put together a build on PCPartPicker and expect to spend somewhere around $1000 on hardware including a new monitor and keyboard, but my parents are trying to convince me that if I put that kind of money into investment/retirement I'll thank myself in 30 years, but I feel like if I work as hard as I have to keep good grades, have an inexpensive education, and get some spending money, I would regret not having a good PC while I have the free time in college more than I will wish I had a few thousand more dollars when I retire.

Should I go for the PC, or invest all of my money? Obviously I'll have more money if I responsibly put all of my money into savings/retirement/investing, but I feel like my parents are missing the fact that life is about more than having a lot of money. It's not like I won't be able to invest quite a lot of money for my age even if I get a full, new, high quality desktop and a VR headset."
8wz3am,1,2018-07-08,My life right now,Raetaelae,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8wz3am/my_life_right_now/,"Some shit going on in my life: yes, most of it is self inflicted, which makes me feel terrible about myself and ramps up my anxiety even worse.

For reference, I’m a 24 year old girl.

-I’m 90% sure my friend has been kidnapped by sex traffickers. I’m desperate to help her but don’t know how. I called a hotline. They didn’t do anything. She’s on drugs and has already been arrested for them once. I feel like calling the police would only land her in jail. I’m too scared to show up and try to save her myself.
-I’m in a dysfunctional on again/off again relationship that’s lasted three years and honestly is mostly one of convenience/codependency, we have little in common but we are the main source of support in one another’s lives so breaking it off is extremely difficult. He said he almost cheated on me a few weeks ago (brought a girl home from a bar, but then didn’t go through with it), I forgave him. But then last night I went out to a bar and got drunk and had sex with a 36 year old professor that works at the college I just very recently graduated from. He’s brilliant and I honestly am very tempted to pursue a relationship with him, but feel like he might be a creep that just likes sleeping with young girls. 
-I feel very immature and not nearly smart/good enough for the professor. He wants to hang out tomorrow and I have so much anxiety that I’ll do/say something idiotic.
-I obviously have to break up with my boyfriend and I don’t know how. I am afraid he’s going to be devastated. I’ve never broken up with anyone before. I can’t decide if I should tell him about the cheating or just spare him the details and break it off without explanation. I know it doesn’t sound like it, but I do have a lot of love for him, just not really romantically. This will feel like losing my best friend or even a family member.
-I told a couple of people close to me that I cheated on my boyfriend (when I’m guilty or conflicted I always feel the need to tell people). They all obviously think I’m trash for cheating and won’t talk to me. They also all think he’s a super creepy predator, which yeah, is pretty fair.
-I lost my passport and can’t afford to get a new one
-School ended two months ago along with the internship I was depending on for income and I still can’t seem to get a job. Like, even as a waitress. 
-My rent is way too expensive and I’m gonna have to get another roommate, but I have social anxiety and having roommates terrifies me
-I’ve been drinking way too much
-I’m starting to really feel like a very immature hot mess/bad person. I used to be a very straight and narrow individual but now I have all this anxiety and depression and keep making these crazy awful decisions. Both of my siblings have told me I’m selfish and don’t care about anyone other than myself and I didn’t see it before but now I do and I feel like a horrible person. I don’t mean to hurt people but I constantly do."
8wzi43,0,2018-07-08,Sociopath trying to find a date.,TheBlobMan3x,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/8wzi43/sociopath_trying_to_find_a_date/,"Hi, I am writing this to share my experience, and have been rejected only a few times, mainly because I do not get the opportunity very often and have messed up friendships by asking. I am a 23 year old male who is mildly a Sociopath in nature, I am 6 ft 1 inch, and 145 Ib. I struggled with anorexia when I was in my teens and have struggled to even get where I am today. This is mainly do to a string of bad parenting choices, primarily isolation at a very young age, no schooling or friends that I could see on a weekly basis, and a mom who is probably more of Sociopath than I. Abuse was there, mainly neglect. My parents knew they were in the wrong, and feared CPS would catch up with them. Never the less, I shouldn't complain about them, they mainly left me alone. They were driven to this level by far right ideas, Y2K was one big one for them, and they continued to become more fearful of the government and people in general.

At age 12 I was taught to read by my Dad who was being prodded by church members after they asked me to read the bible, and I told them I could not read. At age 18 I decided to leave, something which my parents have not forgiven me for.

I got my GED and started college, I went into computer science and it was great. I got a job at a grocery store, which was enough to pay my bills.

After getting settled I started to slack, I lost weight, and subsequently my job hours got cut as well. My parents after not talking for a year, came to visit and offered to pay for my school to help take some load off, I accepted.

There were lots of women at my college, and I had the privilege of getting to know some of them, one even invited me to her thanks giving meal to meet her family, I was afraid, and said no, we were good friends too. She was upset at me for saying no, I was doing nothing for thanks giving, and looking back it was probably one of my worst mistakes. After that our friendship slowly died as our classes were different next semester.

I had a few other encounters like this, both ended in the women being frustrated at me, for a reason that I could not see at the time.

Finally, after two years I fixated my heart on a girl I had no chance of going on a date with, and over that year I got to know here quite well, she was not in college ate the time and was struggling to get her GED, little did I know she was about to have a crisis. She didn't have a car so I offered to drive here to classes and even helped her with work she was doing. She worked at a juice bar not to far from college and I would go to talk to here between classes. Even went with her to one of her GED classes.

But something I should have noticed was how often her mom was with her when she asked for a ride or wanted to hangout. It was only after I told her I had feelings for her that I put the dots together and really it wasn't her that was arranging this but her mom, and instead found out later she had a thing for my best friend.

After a couple of missed hangouts I decided to go to the park for a walk, the whole thing made me stressed and I needed to get some fresh air, sadly I wished I had not, I parked and went on the trail around the soccer field, as I finished my first lap I heard her laughing as she play punched my best friend, they had been wrestling in the grass, and were just heading back to their car, which I failed to see.

After this happened I began falling behind on my grades, A's became D's and I thought about what I would do next. I talked to my mom, not telling her what was going on, but she told me that they had been taking out loans to pay for my college bill, when I heard that I knew I needed to leave.

I went and stayed with my family for a year, got a internship as a programmer at a tech company, and planned to go back to finish my degree. My boss warned me that if I did not go to college when I got back I should come back and stay with my parents, I shrugged the advice off, and left anyway. Worst mistake of my life...

I had an offer from my friend, (same guy who was screwing the women I asked out), to stay at his place I guess he felt bad for what he did. So I moved in with him and his family. I stayed in a small motor home outside for the good old price of 400 a month (that included ramen).

Our friendship wasn't even there at that point, it was just a deal, but a bad deal.

After coming home from working at the local wifi hot spot I would go into the kitchen and get some food, and hangout. my friends sister (I will call her Amber) was always there, she didn't have a job and was trying to get her GED. Like me she had little schooling and needed help with math problems (her parents were the same religion as mine). we would talk about stuff and now and then she would ask for a ride place, over a few months we became close and soon were in a relationship.

This made her brother (the ""friend"") flip out. He couldn't understand how a friend would start dating his sister, I guess he thought I was like him and did one night stands... Anyway this caused a lot of tension, so we decided that in order to get things clear I would tell her father that we were a thing. So I did, and her father was surprisingly glad that it was me and not someone else? This is when things went bad fast, we were told that it was fine that we were dating but we were not to sleep together under his roof, he believed that would be sin. So we stayed clear of that, plenty of making out but made sure we didn't go to far. Then came the Ex.

in late spring of that year, her Ex boyfriend was getting kicked out of the dorms for summer. He was the son of some friends of the family, and friends with Amber's brother. So they offered for him to stay with me in the motor home... This was crazy... within the first week of being there he had tried three times to persuade her to get back together with him, much to the rolling of her fathers eyes, you see he was known to be a player...

She told him no every time but the whole time he was there he proceeded to try everything he could get away with... The stress was pushed to the breaking point when Amber's mom seeing that the Ex was taking up her time, began to think that they might be a thing now. After Amber's mother asked her if she would like to marry her Ex she broke down crying, and could not be consoled.

It was soon after he left that we slept together for the first time, which would be found out by her father after the 4th night. By that point it is my believe that she had set her mind on a baby believing that would be the easiest way out of there.

They were mad when they found out, but respected me for my coolness, or they knew that if they punched me I might die. I moved out and went once again back to stay with my family not before getting Amber's Fathers blessings for a surprise engagement at my families home.

The engagement happened and was beautiful, but I should have seen the writing on the wall... Two months earlier she had told me that had been having lesbian sex with her friends ever since she could remember, and that it was something she was ashamed of, little did I know that this may have been the plan all along.

A week or two after the engagement I am approached by Amber's mom, who proceeded  to tell me that if Amber wanted to have a baby then she would support it, I was shocked by this, as most christian parents have very strait forward views of this. A week later after a date she wanted to come over and stay the night, I tried to say know but she was sure that she could not be alone and needed to ""talk"", well we didn't talk much. after some family disputes and her taking their side I left for awhile to see some friends out east, not more then a week being there and she tells me that she is pregnant and is breaking up with me. She proceeds to tell her family a raped here, which they bought it, and told me if I ever came back I would be put in jail. 

My soul was destroyed by this, I have thought about killing myself, but have not because  I know I have a son or daughter out there that needs me. The babies due date is past by now, they haven't talked to me since March. They told me I may never get to see my kid, and have threatened to kill me. Of course I have thought about revenge on more then one occasion.

In my mind looking back, it looks like I was setup by Amber and her Mom. Amber told me on multiple occasions that her Mom was obsessed with having a grand-baby. I should have seen the writing on the wall when she told me about he lesbian activities.

Now I am living again with my family, this time out in the middle of nowhere. Thinking about putting myself out there, and starting to date again is something that scares me. The only social media I have now is Twitter and snapchat after I deleted the others. I tried tender but didn't like it.

I am flooded with the thought of how will I ever get married and live a normal life, or even go on a date, knowing that someday a kid might show up to my house, but I know I can't just end my life because I hit a few mountains.

I have thought about going to a bar, but I do not drink. Can't find any other way to meet women in this town. What will I do next? doing meditation and weed as of now. I am now the only one I know, besides my sister, who has done weed. How low can I go? I do not know.

sincerely

8wzi7w,4,2018-07-08,I'm [21/m] and my girlfriend [20/f] lives with her parents and they consistently try to get her back with her ex (they dated for 3 years and are family friends) What can I do?,Jimbobfp2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8wzi7w/im_21m_and_my_girlfriend_20f_lives_with_her/,"I would like to start with saying that family and community is very important to my girlfriend and her parents do not like my parents (for good reasons). I am also odd and introverted especially when i do not know people well and this is my first real relationship so i really did not know how to act around her family. 

we have been together for over a year. Her ex is a family friend of hers and only lives a block away from her and now that he is home from college for the summer he goes over to her family's house and drinks with her dad multiple times a week. She also carpools with him and his uncle to her internship this summer (they all live and work close to each other). We are in college but she is still living with her parents because she lives 5 min away from school. I am not allowed over because her parents do not like me. they have been pushing her to get back together with her ex for a while but she has been telling me that will never happen because they would never work out. She says that they never had more than surface level conversations so when they started to drift apart they had nothing to hold on to.  This 4th of July was difficult for me for a lot of reasons but one of them was because I am always disappointed if we cannot spend a holiday together and she had to go with her family to their cottage. It turned out that her mom arranged it so that her ex would also be there. 
I just feel defeated and idk what to do. Is it even worth trying to make this relationship work?

Tldr in the title.

Update: I talked to her and she decided to stick up for me more when talking to her parents and it seems like she will be seeing a little less of her ex. I like the idea of doing things that I would not do if I was not in a relationship so I will follow that advise and I guess I will just see where this relationship goes. I don't want to think of it as a doomed relationship so if I see the major problems getting better I think I'll stick with her but if not at least I will be able to move forward knowing I learned a lot.

8wzny9,19,2018-07-08,There's a Disease Killing People in This Town,FoolishWhim,u_FoolishWhim,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FoolishWhim/comments/8wzny9/theres_a_disease_killing_people_in_this_town/,"I noticed it about three months ago. 

Three of my professors had canceled their lectures for the week. Each email I received varied, but they all had the same underlying reason for cancelation. The professors had fallen ill and were in the hospital for treatment. 

Though I knew it was odd that all three of the professors had succumbed to some mystery sickness within the same week, I gave it little to no thought after the fact. I am a college student after all. This just meant I had more time to sleep and dick off. 

When the following week arrived and those professors were still in the hospital, I became more concerned. When word got around that more people had caught this mystery bug, my concern shifted to alarm. 

There were professors and students all over campus who were now hospitalized. No one knew what sickness had befallen them, just that they were gone. Apparently there were a few people who tried to go to the hospitals to visit and they were turned away. Rumors of quarantine were thrown around campus.

The students and faculty that remained tried to continue on with the semester, they wanted to keep things as normal as possible. 

Their efforts were valiant, but still in vain. 

In the coming weeks, as more people were quarantined, hysteria seemed to rise. Some of the students refused to leave their dorms, they were too afraid of the risk. Others left, heading back to their hometowns. Still, there were others who chose to treat the situation as an excuse to party. 

I will not lie to you, I was one of the latter. 

I’m originally from a smaller farming town, I knew very little of the people on campus, and it seemed to be a great way of keeping the current events out of mind. 

Each night I would go from party to party, drinking myself into a stupor. I would wake in the morning full of regret, but not regretting it enough to stop. 

I began to notice that more and more people were wearing surgical masks at these events. There was also an obscene amount of hand sanitizer being used. People were doing their best to keep the illness at bay. Despite the effort, less people were showing up as time passed. It became harder, even with all the alcohol in my system, to minimize how surreal and terrifying the situation had become. 

At the last party I attended, I spent some time questioning the stragglers that had shown up. I asked whether anyone had any contact with any of the people placed in quarantine, but no one had seen or heard from any of them. I questioned whether anyone had heard anything about the sickness, but they were still keeping a tight lip about it all. 

Eventually, a rather intoxicated individual who had been slumped in the corner, began to loudly address my line of questions.

“They can’t, release any information because they have no idea what it is. They’ve been researchin it since the first case showed up, and they can’t figure out what causes it or how it spreads.” He took a long swig from the murky brown bottle he held in his hand. “Both hospitals filled up already, so they started taking the sick out to that old abandoned building near the country.” 

He finished his drink and stood on shaky legs, stumbling over to the counter to rifle through what was left.

“More than half of this fucking town is either quarantined in the hospitals and that building, or laying dead in their houses. No use trying to visit anyone, anymore, you wouldn’t like what you found if you tried.” He held a half finished bottle of vodka up victoriously before stumbling back to the same corner he had left. He fell, face slamming into the wall, as he reached his spot. He seemed rather unaffected by it as he rolled into position and took a long hard swig from his new drink. Blood was trailing down his nose as he did. 

Everyone else had gone silent, a mass of forlorn faces surrounded me. I was drunk, and a feeling of aggression overcame me. I was pissed at the guy for trying to bring everyone down. I thought he was talking out of his ass. “If they aren’t telling anyone anything and they turn everyone away, how in the hell would you know anything about it?” 

“I was an intern for one of the hospitals, you little bag of shit.” He spat at me. “One of the few idiots willing to volunteer my time. I was sent to the quarantined building along with the other volunteers when the hospitals filled up.” He stared at the wall, lost in thought for a moment before scrunching his face up in anguish. “I thought I would be able to help those poor fuckers. I didn’t realize that we’d been sent there to babysit them until they died.” 

“Bull. Shit.” I was furious with him at this point. Every fiber of my being wanted to launch myself across the room and knock him out. The people who sat around me were crying softly to themselves now. “You are a drunken idiot. I don’t know if you get your rocks off trying to scare people, but you need to shut the fuck up.”

He chugged what was left of the vodka and leaned his head back into the corner, the hint of a smile played at his lips. “You should all be thankful you’ve been spared this long.” He was drifting in and out of consciousness as he spoke. “Whatever this disease is, it’s eating away at people. Leaves them rotten.” His eyes jerked open after he laid there a moment, “Plenty of ways to find out if i’m a liar. The military is guarding the building now. I got out before they showed up. No one leaves anymore. Not without…” The liquor finally won and he passed out, snoring loudly.

I left after he passed out. I was still fuming about what he had said. Looking back, I think I was more scared than anything, but in my own intoxicated state that fear was expressed as anger. Whatever it was, I had decided then to do a little investigation. 

I had a car that I rarely used parked in a lot near my dorm. My roommate, Jared, usually did the shopping for the two of us and my parents had bought me a meal ticket before semester started. I still kept my keys with me wherever I went, despite the lack of necessity. In my angry, drunken, state I made my way to my car. 

In the time it took for me to reach the lot, I couldn’t help but notice that the campus looked deserted. There were lights shining through some of the dorm windows, but the usual bustle of activity was gone. An eerie silence hung over the place. I think I saw, maybe, two or three people throughout the entire walk. 

Once I got into the car I debated where to go first. I had a grandmother who lived in town and a key to her house. She had given me one before the semester started so I could do laundry there, but I paid Jared to do it instead. I couldn’t be bothered to spend quality time with her at the time. I turned the key and took off in the direction of her house. 

The roads were completely deserted, which is something I should have been glad for at the time. Instead of being grateful, it left me with a feeling of isolation. I began to drive more erratically, trying to get to her house quicker. 

As I drove, I tried to convince myself that I would find her alive. I wanted to believe that she would be ok, at the most she might be sick. 

When I reached her driveway, my stomach dropped. All of the lights were out and her yard was completely overgrown. Her mailbox was overflowing and newspapers littered the porch. 

My legs were shaking as I exited my car, making my way up the porch steps. It felt like time slowed down as I swung the door open. The odor that rushed out to greet me was overpowering. My eyes began to water as I made my way through the house, turning on each light to survey the scene. 

The closer I got to her room, the stronger the smell became. The whole house was a wreck. Plates were left lying about with molding food still on them. Everything was coated in a thick layer of dust. There were tissues littering every surface, each one stained with a bloody mucus  looking substance. 

When I reached her bedroom door, I found her cat. The poor thing was laying there quietly. It was still alive, but just barely. Though I knew I would find her dead inside, I still needed to see her. I think it was because I wanted to see what was happening to the people of the town. It was stupid of me. 

I opened her door slowly, prolonging the inevitable. The smell of rot hit me first. I had never been so close to a dead body before, let alone a diseased dead body. I swallowed chunks of vomit as I covered the lower portion of my face. 

When I saw her lying there under the blankets I realized that she had to have been there for a while. Her eyes were closed, like she was sleeping. She looked bloated and it appeared as though there was some dark bruising running the length of the bottom of her arms and neck. There were small clusters of open wounds covering her body in patches. 

It looked like her pores had opened up in little honeycombed style clusters. Each hole looked to be the size of a quarter and they were seeping the same foul bloody mucus tinged substance I’d seen on the tissues. I couldn’t help but begin to itch when I looked at them. The sight of her discolored gums, slick with the ooze was what finally pushed me over the edge. I turned and beelined for the door, skidding to a halt when I remembered the cat. It didn’t fight me at all when I tucked it into my arms and took off.

When we got into the car I broke down. I hadn’t been very close to my grandmother as I grew older, but it was still upsetting to find her like that. It also made me think about what the man from the party had said, about half the town being quarantined or dead. I couldn’t stop myself from thinking about all the people who died the way that she had. I don’t know how long it took, but eventually I turned on the car and threw us in reverse. 

I thought I was going to be able to leave town. 

When I reached my exit point that hope was dashed quickly. I skidded to a halt when I saw a barricade that spanned as far as I could see in either direction. There were people patrolling in hazmat suits with some extremely intimidating firearms. 

I sat there, sobbing uncontrollably for a long time, pressing the cat into my chest. I must have passed out eventually because I was jolted awake to a sharp crack to my drivers side window. 

I raised my head in confusion and saw one of the hazmats was standing there, pointing a gun at my face. I raised my hands in surrender instinctively, too stunned to do anything else. 

“Turn the fucking car around and don’t come back,” he barked at me. 

I guess I didn’t come out of the stupor fast enough, because he raised the gun into the air and let off a loud warning shot. “I said turn the fucking car around!” 

I shook my head violently in agreement and threw the car in reverse for the second time that night. 

I never did go check out the abandoned building. After everything I had encountered that night, I knew that man hadn’t been lying to me. 

For a while, me and Jared stayed in our dorm room. He would go out to scavenge supplies while I hid there. He hadn’t had to experience what the disease was like first hand, and he’d always been willing to go the extra mile. 

He eventually got sick though, just like everyone else. He deteriorated within the week and I found him one morning, the same honeycomb style clusters covering his body. I didn’t have access to a shovel, so I just put him in the hallway and covered him with his blanket. Now it’s just me and the kitty, who I have unimaginatively dubbed “kitty”. 

I don’t know how many people are still alive here, I stopped being hopeful when Jared passed. At this point i’m just waiting for the inevitable. 

I know that people are going to ask where I am, but I refuse to tell you. Even if you could get past the barricade alive, I won’t condemn anyone else to die like this. 

I guess my main purpose for this is to warn you all. There isn’t any cell service, and they’ve somehow blocked social media sites. It was actually Jared who had pointed out to me that Reddit was still usable. I think they knew most people would just brush this off as some sick ass joke. 

I still have no idea how this spreads or what caused it, I don’t even know what to call it. I do know it isn’t spread through contact. I was here with Jared the whole time he was sick and I had direct contact with his body multiple times. When he got weaker, I was the one who tried to clean those wounds. Keep your eyes and ears open, pay attention to your friends and neighbors. If you notice too many people getting sick at once, get the hell out of there. If it can happen here, it can happen other places too. I have a hard time believing this will be an isolated incident. 

I don’t know what they plan on doing here once everyone is finally gone, maybe they’ll find some way to wipe us off the map. I honestly wish I never would have come to this shit hole. 

Anyway, I’m running low on supplies so I need to head out and scavenge what I can. Wish me luck. Maybe I can make it another week or two.

8wzxox,7,2018-07-08,Supplementing Body Weight Exercises with Machines,DJysyed,bodyweightfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8wzxox/supplementing_body_weight_exercises_with_machines/,"Hey everyone, I have always been a big fan of bodyweight exercises for as long as I can remember. After graduating from high school three years ago, I completely stopped working out due to school work. Now, I recently got back into working out since I'm at an internship in another university and there's a really nice gym. I started working out exactly three weeks ago. 

My primary goal for my workouts is to build strength and be able to perform advanced exercises like levers, dragonflags, and handstand pushups. I don't particularly care about size. Moreover, for all exercises I do with machines, I do one rep of the max weight I can and then drop weight by a little each time (ex: shoulder press I start at 110 then drop by 20 lbs each set) in order to completely kill the muscle. My routines are as follows:

Upperbody (biceps, triceps, shoulders + traps, chest and back): Attempt of pullups + negatives, 20lb backpack dips, more negatives for pullups, regular dips, 20lb backpack rows, 20lb one leg raised pushup, rows, one leg raised pushups. I then supplement these with machines: Shoulder press, chest and back flys, lat pull downs, assisted pullups and dips. Just recently, I started back extensions but it felt really unnatural so I will be stopping.

Abs: 10lb super situps (super situp: situp while tucking in gut + breathe in but keep breath in chest area), turn to either side and do the same, attempt L-sits (haven't developed tricept strength to balance well), and hanging leg raises. There's a situp machine that I recently started using because it's fun.

Legs: I walk for 35-45 minutes per day after my workout. Occasionally I use the stair master. Recently started using the squat machine because my legs die within a couple minutes of climbing stairs.

Is my workout effective for my goals? Should I stop using any machines or stop using machines altogether because they won't help with my body weight exercises?"
8x06ex,1,2018-07-08,Boyfriend (26M) and I (23F) of 2 years had an argument about social anxiety and flakiness and now he thinks I’m uncaring,Eatinmeupinside2018,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8x06ex/boyfriend_26m_and_i_23f_of_2_years_had_an/,"Hi everyone, this is probably a stupid argument but it’s resulted in my boyfriend and I being in a bit of a tough spot regarding how “caring” I am. 

So my boyfriend (26) Jordan and I (23F) have been dating a bit under 2 years. 1 of it a close distance, and the other a medium distance (4-5 hours driving). However a month ago I moved to a completely new city on the other side of the country for an internship. 

Because of this move I’ve been trying my hardest to make friends so I don’t spend all my time alone. What has resulted is me agreeing to plans (note: I’ve been invited, not planning them) every weekend that never occurred because either the entire group I was meeting flaked or the one person I was meeting up with flaked (and in one case ghosted me entirely). These have all been different groups of people and frankly, it’s been extremely depressing and I’ve been having a rough time. This all cumulated on July 4 with me crying while texting my boyfriend about how I travelled an hour and a half to meet up with a group at a beach only to learn when I got there nobody was there and the reason my texts weren’t being answered was because the only person who’s number I had “was napping, I don’t think anyone went anyway lol”. 

Jordan was supportive at the time, or at least he tried. Today we were texting and he mentioned how he had plans that afternoon with board games with friends, he later then told me that they had flaked out. I mentioned that I didn’t understand how people could be that flaky and not feel guilty. He replied that they probably have social anxiety and that when he was more socially anxious years ago he always felt guilty but couldn’t do anything.

We then argued a bit about social anxiety and flakiness with me falling more on the side that you should heads people up and it’s disrespectful (and it really hurts) to just bail on someone or leave someone in silence. Although he generally agreed he also chided me for not being more caring and understanding. I felt hurt by these comments because he hasn’t been in a situation like I am (moving to a far away city all by myself) and I keep getting rejected, he seemed upset because I don’t come across as very caring. 

In general we both suffer from general anxiety (mine gets bad when I’m in unfamiliar situations but I try not to let it control me because I know that’s how it gets “worse”, I’m also in therapy. Jordan’s is more all the time and he’s on medication) but I’ll fully admit that I don’t have social anxiety even though I’m much more introverted. 

So what do I do? I obviously can’t take what I said back but Jordan now thinks I’m uncaring and I’m kind of annoyed with him for not being supportive of my situation. 

Tl;dr boyfriend and I argued about social anxiety/flakiness and now things are weird. "
8x0kio,2,2018-07-08,"Barcelona, Vienna or Milan",fortea92,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/8x0kio/barcelona_vienna_or_milan/,"I'm doing applications for various PhD in Milan, Barcelona and Vienna. In Austria, PhD students grant a higher scholarship than in Spain and Italy. Because of this I initially preferred Vienna. 

At now I'm attending a short internship in Vienna which is changing my mind: in Vienna, I'd work in a private research centre, outside the university. Moreover, I expected more compelling colleagues, whereas during the work there are just a few social moments and these are poorly used by the research team to talk each other - by the way, I am a computer scientist, so the most part of the job is in front of the computer. 

What I'm looking for are people which during pauses enjoy social life and love talking about everything. In a few words, I'm looking for a more Italian temperament... I'm afraid that the Austrian attitude is not so social as I expected. Do you have experiences in research teams in Italy and Austria or in Spain and Austria? What do you think about?"
8x0rwe,119,2018-07-08,Stuck in ESL - how to unfuck myself,Vividgreen312,China,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/8x0rwe/stuck_in_esl_how_to_unfuck_myself/,"TL;DR Humanities grad in late 20s, married, wants out of China and ESL, needs advice. 

Three years ago I finished a masters in an arts/humanities subject. Worked a shitty sales job in the UK for a year. Tried to apply for entry level jobs in stuff like copywriting but had no luck - loads of applicants and many had done unpaid internships and things, which are often expected but financially I couldn't do. 

My plan was always to do a PhD in my field and work in academia. I worked hard and my grades are definitely good enough. Throughout university my professors all encouraged me to go down this route and continue with graduate school. Maybe I'm naive and should've gone down the STEM route, but those doors closed for me due to subjects I chose at 16 when I didn't know better. I tried to make the best of my situation and do well academically but it became clear after finishing the masters and researching PhD routes that even if I get qualified, publish, attend conferences, etc, there's a good chance I'll be 31 or 32, broke and without a permanent job. 

Mulling this over, struggling to get any graduate-level jobs, and too old to qualify for programs to work/learn a trade or tech skill, I decided to go abroad for a year to teach, save, consider options, think about research proposals. Looked into a few countries but ended up in China. 

Been here for a couple of years now. Met a great woman and got married. Had a few jobs that have always been shitty in one way or another. Saved some money but less than anticipated due to having issues with employers and moving on, getting fucked out of money or not paid. This is common, yourself or someone you know has probably had similar experiences. 

There was a brief honeymoon period where everything was new and exciting, but I've been really fucking misersble for about a year now. Everything is inconvenient and inefficient. I feel stressed out constantly and isolated. I'm in a big city but it takes ages to get to anywhere interesting, if I have time at all. Everywhere is crowded and noisy, rent is expensive but all of the apartments in my area look dilapidated, most areas have nothing going on apart from restaurants and malls. I mostly just go to work and go home to read. I've spent more time researching career paths and online qualifications and stuff like that in the last year than all of my previous years combined. 

My wife would prefer to stay closer to her family but is open to the idea of living in Europe. We've considered Taiwan for better quality of life but I'd be stuck in the ESL world and salaries are lower. They also might or might not be welcoming to mainlanders. 

We considered Japan as I might be competetive for uni jobs there if I get a PhD locally or distance learning through a UK uni. Culturally it would be interesting. I used to sit with local Zen groups in the UK and still meditate at home but miss the community element. I've heard that meditation groups exist in Taiwan as well. Obviously not an option in China. There's also property rights and actually better prices than T1 China, and a pathway to PR. My wife's family would probably have issues with us living in Japan so that's off the table. 

We considered international schools in different Asian countries but I'd need to train in the UK to get properly qualified. UK immigration rules have become difficult with income requirements so we'd be apart for a year or two unless she borrows more than 200000rmb from her family to do a second masters she probably doesn't need, just to stay in the UK. 

China seems to be one shitty thing after another and it's having a bad effect on my mental health. I've told her that I probably won't ever be happy here and she understands.

We planned to save enough for a downpayment on a house in Europe, maybe 2 or 3 more years, then move. There are a few options but we're thinking of a decent northern European country with good living standards. I don't think I can take living here for that long. I'm trying to suck it up and keep going but bullshit gets to me all of the time. 

I'm also concerned that, even if we save for a house, by the time we move we'd be about 30, with no marketable skills in the European job market. Immigration and Brexit won't be a problem as I'm qualified for dual nationality in another EU member state and can get a passport within a few months. 

Thanks for getting this far. It's probably a common story and boring to many people. 

But any advice at all would be helpful. I'm constantly looking into different options and have on idea what to do. Apart from teaching I have a bit of experience with freelance writing and editing. No other marketable skills. "
8x118f,2,2018-07-08,(M4F) - A slave for the week down at the beach house,Mithridates_Eupator,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8x118f/m4f_a_slave_for_the_week_down_at_the_beach_house/,"Cleaning vacation homes down at the beach was not your ideal plan for the summer, but no other good options really presented themselves. You weren't getting an unpaid internship in some expensive city like your rich friends, and you needed the money over summer break. *And heck,* you told yourself, *you got to live near the beach all summer!* By the time school started in the fall, you'd have one hell of a tan. Right?

Unfortunately, after working long, backbreaking days scrubbing cheap, trashed houses, it turned out that you rarely had time for the beach. The pay wasn't that great, either. You were ready to quit and go home to live with your parents for the rest of the summer when a friend told you to call this different cleaning agency she was working with now. She seemed a lot happier since she'd moved there... and she was certainly making better money. So you called. Within a few hours, they'd set you up with a new gig. The money sounded too good to be true - they even let you keep tips!

The new agency sent you a few miles north up to the ""nice"" part of the island, full of the giant vacation homes you'd never been inside of. Your new assignment was full-time housekeeping for a new group who'd just arrived for the week. Ringing the doorbell, you were greeted by two youngish men - you guessed in their early 30s. There were six of them there, you learned, all friends from college. They offered you a drink as you lugged in your cleaning gear, and you felt them looking you up and down, not being too discreet about it. You didn't mind too much... they were reasonably attractive, after all. And besides, tips, right?

You found a hallway closet and put away your broom, mop, bucket and supplies. When you arrived back in the living room, though, you stopped short. Two of the men... were already naked, and turned to look at you hungrily. One was removing his shirt.

**""You can go get ready in the guest room over there,""** one said, apparently the leader. He was over six feet tall, dark haired and blue eyed. **""The agency sent over a bag for you and everything. Take your time - we've got all week.""** He winked at you, and you were a little speechless... he seemed to know something you didn't. Not knowing what else to do, you turned and followed his gesture to the guest room, closing the door behind you.

There, on the bed, was a small travel bag, and an envelope with your name printed on it. Behind, in the living room, you heard a few whoop! sounds and someone opening a beer. You opened the envelope slowly.

*Hello dear - this party has reserved your services for a full week. You'll be staying here, in the provided guest room, unless asked to do otherwise. Your requested wardrobe for the week is in the bag, along with some useful supplies. Any questions, just call the office. Good luck, and have fun! P.S. - your first salary installment is included.*

*My services?* You thought to yourself. *Requested wardrobe?* Something was wrong... was there some misunderstanding? Opening the lower fold of the letter, you saw a pay slip for your first salary... and caught a gasp in your throat. For a second, you thought they had mistakenly included a zero... or two. You'd never seen that amount of money associated with your name before.

This has to be a mistake, you thought. More confused than ever, you unzipped the travel bag, and your eyes widen.

There are several pairs of lacy red, black and pink thongs, and matching five-inch stiletto heels. You see several sheer camisoles... a teddy... two nighties... stockings and garters. Your mouth drops open at the collection of lingerie. There is also a bottle of lube at the bottom, next to a red ball gag, what seemed to be wrist restraints, and a pill container. Pulling it out, you see on the side: *To stimulate intense physical sexual arousal in women, take one pill daily. Warning: primary effects do not dissipate.*

The pieces began coming together in your mind. Your friend, who had joined this agency... she was, well, sort of slutty, you supposed. But she certainly loved her job. Her mysterious source of income seemed to make sense now. You looked back at the door, thinking of the six older men out there, waiting for you to come out. To stay there all week, as some sort of... housekeeper and sex toy?

A part of it made your heart beat in exhilaration.

The direction of this prompt is pretty clear. Are you fully willing and can't wait to jump in? Is it a little more dub-con? I'm open to ideas or kinks. No gore or bathroom stuff. Light me up!"

&gt; For the first 26 years of her life, Liza Shkirando never played a videogame. It wasn't until she took a course on game psychology during graduate school that she really began to understand and appreciate the history and importance of games in society. Upon receiving her Master's degree in Interactive Design, Shkirando pursued an internship at Massive Entertainment as a junior user researcher. Now, three and a half years into her career at Ubisoft, she currently works as a UX designer on tools – ensuring that the everyday workflows of designers and artists are as easy and efficient as possible by developing better tools – on Tom Clancy's The Division. 
&gt; 

&gt; 
&gt; Originally from St. Petersburg, Russia, Shkirando now lives and works in Malmö, Sweden. While The Division remains her favorite Ubisoft game, she – like many developers – has trouble looking at her own handiwork without seeing a plethora of things she might have done differently. More recently, she's been enjoying her time with South Park: The Fractured But Whole. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was lucky enough to sit down with Shkirando while she was in San Francisco during GDC giving a talk about UX tool development.  

...

&gt; 
&gt; **When did you first know you wanted to work in games?** 
&gt; 
&gt; Liza Shkirando: It really wasn't until graduate school. I didn't experience videogames as a kid. I always thought that videogames were for boys. I didn't even think it was something that I could be interested in. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Why do you think that is?** 
&gt; 
&gt; LS: Maybe it's all the TV commercials. Growing up, we're always shown that Barbie dolls are for girls and videogames are for boys. Toys are often a very social thing when you're young, so I was never interested in them because of the social setting. The boys were playing videogames and the girls were playing with dolls. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Do you think that's why the game development industry is so male-dominated?** 
&gt; 
&gt; LS: Yeah, I think so. I think it comes from a very early age. You grow up with a mindset that there is something for boys and there's something for girls. We're also influenced by our parents, because they buy our toys for us, and maybe they have an idea of what kinds of toys their sons or daughters should play with. It's a bit sad how much something like that can shape the future. 
&gt; 
&gt; I'm actually really thankful for my parents because I always had a lot of building toys that weren't typically associated with girls. It was really cool that they ignored the social bias that tools and construction toys are only for boys. Playing with those is one of my first memories, and it's really cool. 

...

&gt; **What advice would you give to women who want to do what you do?**
&gt; 
&gt; LS: I'd tell them to think outside the box. Try things that you might think are not for you, because that's where you'll find yourself. 
&gt; 
&gt; **What do you think needs to change in order to achieve gender equality in the games industry?** 
&gt; 
&gt; LS: I think it's more of a societal problem. The games industry inherited the problem from society. That's why the change is so slow: because it's on a global scale, it's happening in all corners of civilization. The unfortunate truth is that there is no easy solution to the problem. If there was, it would be solved by now. 
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, I would like to warn employers from making a mistake of hiring more women ""just because they are women"". It's all over media nowadays and there is a risk that women would be hired just for better statistics and reputation of a company. We want to be hired for our skills, experience and personalities, not just because we are female.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm actually very happy that in Sweden, where Massive is, the society is very open-minded and welcoming of diversity. Even in just the three and half years I've been at Massive, I've seen more and more women each year coming into development positions."

And the hard way back up again. To all of you in need or recognize what I describe, to all of you who are struggling, know you're not allone.

Anyway, let's start from the beginning, shall we? Meet me, Sam a somewhat shy 20 year old student. He studies chemistry and is a straight a student, has a good social live, a girlfriend (let's just call her Anna) and  works in a themepark to make ends meet. A average college student live. 

I can't quite recall when it started but I can remember a very stressfull period prior to later events. I was finishing my minor, had a big report that needed to be finished, Very big exams coming up and my granddad decided to kick the bucked. Oh eh minor detail my girlfriend would go abroad for an internship, I  did however plan to do the same. 

I found myself working trough the nights, each morning I just roll out if I could just pull trough until the summer break. I didn't go to a lot of friends any no time no energy. My side job was very intensive 12 hour shifts from 1 pm till 1 am.

A job in a theme park is no walk in the park (yes yes that is a pun). Very stressfull, underpaid and ungratefull work. I found myself calling in sick because I couldn't handel the stress there, and I had to finish my reports in time. One day my boss came up to me and that I was underpreforming and fired me.

A sad back but I could handel it. I could finally catch up some much needed rest, and was not really looking to get a new job. My mother did not agree and said she was ashamed of me not having a job in the summer, I worked my ass of to finish my study that's 40 till 60 hours a week! 

I was beginning to feel run down couldn't get up, couldn't keep my appointments up. if I could just make it till summer break. If it would just stop.  Then my granddad died, and my gf left for brazil the next week.

Then something just snapped and found myself unable to eat, sleep, cried half of the day and stop thinking about my gf waiting for her texted etc. I ended up in the hospital because my hart beat en bloodpressure was too high. Looking back now this was a big red flag, but back then I just blamed myself. I was just a lazy ass student who couldn't man up. Get over yourself and man up for petty sake. 

Then my time abroad came, why did I go you ask? Well because I couldn't just give up on it? I had an appartment, signed a contract etc you just can't quite!  Man up! 

 I found myself failing at my job (imo). Simple tasks became a huge effort. Getting to my internship on time was near impossible. I felt lonely (despit having build up quite a lot of friends there). I was begining to wish it would all just end, I am a failure of a human beeing I am just dead weight. why am I still here?

I found myself keeping up a limbo that everything was ok. But I couldn't sleep an had ""episodes"" at night were I found myself crying hyperventilating, not beeing able to calm myself. Hearing my inner voice yelling me to kill myself. ""just fucking jump you fucking imbicle"", I tried to calm myself but was often unsuccesfull. 

When I went back home, linked up with my girlfriend again I thought it would be ok again. I tried to do my last internship. Oh boy was I wrong. 

Needless to say my gf was worried sick after waking up to the panic attacks I had, and pushed me to go to the gp (docter). No that was not nessary I was fine.. Or was I? I was beginning to notice that my thinking slowed and sometimes I could not think at all during stressfull situations. When I got a panic attack at my internship, however my boss took me appart. We had a long talk, he urged me to get help asap and go home. I went to my gp that very day. 

That talk was the hardest talk of my life. I was not able to tell her much as it felt so heavy to talk about. Strange thing is I felt very dizzy an couldn't think a lot during that conversation. When she asked me if I had plans commit suicide, a silence fell... One word, yes.

That was the start of my treatment, she did not let me go home, she send me to the crisis department. I am still thankfull of her making that decision. 10 weeks of intensive group therapy. Great I am going to the lunatic assylum, I thought. 

It was not the end of my fall however. My gf tried to help ""what if you take a rest, just 2 weeks you can go back to work right?"" ""beeing out of it for too long is not good for you"" etc. I told her that I had other things on my mind right now. I could not arrange a proper date, naturally I blame myself for beeing incompetent. She blamed me for not showing inicitive, motivation and not beeing able to forfill my promisis. After a fight she told me ""don't be so depressed"" and ""I feel 10 times worse then you do right now""

That very night I wrote my suicide notes, got on my bike and tried to jump infront of a train. I can still remember feeling the immens dispair hopelessnes and sadness. If not for some unsong hero at the suicide hotline I wouldn't have been where I am now.

I broke up with her later that week. In her defences, she saw a loved one becoming very ill, in a LDR, and when she came back I was not the same person anymore, neither was she. She tried to help but couldn't. She appologised and told me she never intened it but it was out of her frustration and desperation.

When I started the treatment. I found out that their were a lot of ppl my age who faced the same problems. That was very helpfull. The way back up is very hard. Several near suicides. Climbing up falling down. Now slowly starting to work again one day a week. I can't take much more it is very depleting but I regain a lot of confidences in doing so.

I hope that one day I can work again and do what I love and love someone again. I am still sick but now I have some hope that I will recover. Sorry if this was a tad too long.

TL;DR:
Got a burnout, led to a severe depression. Losing a my gf in the process, on my way to recovery and glad I am still alive. That beeing said it is still very hard and I still have many heardels to take.

8x41wb,2,2018-07-08,I wanted to get back together with him until I started seeing how I was just an object to him.,laniraffe,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8x41wb/i_wanted_to_get_back_together_with_him_until_i/,"If you have any reasons of not getting back with someone, please list them down in the comments.

I was in a physical and emotional abusive relationship for almost three years. Two of those three years we lived together. During that time I had seen several red flags about my partner I was concerned would affect our relationship but I blew them off since I was blindly in love. I just want to make a list of these things so I can come back and remind myself I do deserve something better.

1. His idea of having a good time was drinking until he blacked out and didn't remember anything at parties. He would defend himself saying he was a happier and more social person this way.
2. His family had no idea who I was the first time I ever met them and spent the night at his house. His step sister even embarrassed me asking him in front of me ''What happened to last weekends girl who stayed over?"". 
3. He would always ""joke"" and make racist comments about black and asian ethnicities. 
4. His family would always have huge parties at his house (over 60 people parties) and at the beginning of our relationship he introduced me to no one and left me alone to fend for myself. 
5. His friends would introduce me to people as the 'Puerto Rican' Chris was dating.
6. He would get upset if I made plans with his friends (who I got along with) to hang out when he wasn't around (on vacation).
7. He would get upset if I accidentally told one of his group of friends he was hanging out with his other group of friends (they all knew each other from high school but were in different cliques).
8. He lied to me about liking transexual pre-op women and was ashamed of his sexual encounters with them.
9. He stopped talking to his ex when I told him that it would be a good idea for all of us to meet (he was close to her since they were in an 8 year relationship together).
10. The second time he beat me up someone came to our apartment and stopped him. He once told me that his ex had told his friends that he had abused her and how messed up she was. When I called her that night to confirm, she confirmed but called him to tell him I was going around telling people he was abusing me. (She was still controlled by him).
11. He was ashamed of masturbating and would always hide when he was watching porn. He would make me feel like shit if I accidentally walked in on him.
12. He made me feel like shit if I wanted to leave some event early and start ignoring me in a way everyone would know.
13. He made me feel like shit for hiking 'too slow'.
14. He made me feel like shit because I did not want to smoke weed anymore.
15. He would cum too fast and most times ignore the fact that I love cumming too.
16. He would always insist on having a threesome even though I told him I am not secure enough with myself to go through that.
17. He would never clean the goddamn bathroom even though we spoke about our responsibilities and chores around the house.
18. He talked shit about his co-worker and instead of defending me made her believe I was the one doing it and she ended up being a passive aggressive bitch to me until the day she graduated from grad school. 
19. He knew I didn't want to hang out with a specific girl from out graduate program who made my life a living hell. Whenever she would appear at our friend gatherings he always swore he never knew she was going.
20. He was always on his goddamn phone when we went out to do anything. He never wanted to have conversations with me. When we did have conversations he said I was stupid, my arguments never made sense,  and I had no idea what I was talking about.
21. He said he left me so we could both focus on our careers and not make decisions based on our relationship. He said he knew it would become long distance and he couldn't deal with that. The real reason was he didn't want to get caught beating me up.
22. I left for a ten week internship (where I was working on my thesis). When I got back he had a surprise for me. He was super excited. He bought two glass dildos for me that were laid out in the bed. This just made me feel like a sexual object.
23. During our relationship I found out he was e-mailing girls he had previously exchanged pornographic contents with from Adult Friend Finder asking them if they were actually real people. He claims he was cleaning his inbox out and was just curious.
24. He never put effort into organizing anything except parties with his friends so he would have an excuse to black out.
25. His family always talked shit about his ex. They had no idea they were still friends.
26. To be continued."
8x45j9,5,2018-07-08,I don't know how to be happy as a single person. ;(,ACfireandiceDC,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/8x45j9/i_dont_know_how_to_be_happy_as_a_single_person/,"I know, I should be happy, I'm 23, I'm young, etc. etc. blah blah blah. But there must be something that's so awesome about having someone's company and affection that must be so fulfilling.

This could be because of my childhood. I'm very fortunate in that I've never really had to deal with abuse or bullying, but I was worse than my friends at almost everything, and they really rubbed it in my face for ~18 years. I also felt like I was never truly loved by anyone in my family except for my mom. I think that, because of this, I have a much stronger urge to feel loved.

My life has improved, I got an awesome engineering internship, I'm writing/recording music again, and I'm reading more books. But I still feel like there's this gaping void in the pit of my chest that can't be fulfilled.

I do have friends, but too many of them are unreliable, so I don't socialize much.

Please DON'T tell me to ""work on myself"", because 1) I'm already heeding that advice, and 2) I've heard it 100 times before by people who aren't creative enough to come up with a more detailed and helpful response.

I'm wasting my precious life away by worrying about getting someone's company and affection. Tinder has brought me little success, and contrary to popular opinion, OkCupid is *worse* than Tinder, even for a LTR. It's lowering my self-esteem and making me feel like I am undatable, and that men are cast aside and are inherently unwanted.

I'm even starting to resent single people who are happy with being single, for some reason. *How the hell can you be happy without love? What is wrong with you? You're EMBRACING feeling unfulfilled?*"

I guess I'm what you'd call a highly functioning depressive. I am studying engineering, I've had a few awesome internships, I'm super involved in extracurriculars, I have friends, a promising future, etc. So like, on the outside it really seems like everything is okay and totally great. But, my personal life is broken, I have a broken relationship with my family, and I have avoided dating for the last few years because it just becomes a huge distraction to school and career stuff. I also move a lot and don't know where I'll end up settling down permanently, so I always feel like it's pointless to start a relationship when there is always an expiration date. I have been avoidant of dealing with some major issues like a sexual assault a few years ago, finding out my Dad wasn't my real Dad, and so on. 

I am also struggling massively with school. During the semester sometimes I just can't even get out of bed or focus long enough to get anything done. I was kicked out of my program twice, and struggling to get through it once and for all. I'm in my last year and I find out soon if I will be allowed to complete it due to my academics. Most people don't know this though. 

I didn't even realize that maybe what I've been feeling/staying in bed all day/crying randomly/feeling lonely weren't exactly normal. I just tried to keep going and never reached out for help. I finally had to this summer. Right now I'm just working full time so I have a stable, structured schedule and it gave me a lot of opportunity to reflect and I realized I was not okay. I was having crazy thoughts of suicide, and finding it harder and harder to just enjoy the summer.  I feel like my life keeps being put on hold and the goal post keeps moving everytime thing go wrong with school, I feel like I perpetually put off finding love because I don't let people get close because I know there's an expiration date. I just keep wondering when will things finally click and fall into place? 

I want to start the next chapter of my life, and I'm sick of waiting. It got so hard this summer to keep going. 

I started Fluoxetine this weekend and when I go back home after my summer internship I want to start therapy. I am trying to keep my eyes on the future and I keep telling myself everythng will happen when it's supposed to. It's just really, really hard to keep going. It's so exhausting. It's so hard to keep waiting.   


I hope I'm on the right path to getting better. I really want to get past this."
8x4cn9,3,2018-07-08,I [20M] have a lot of built up drama with my mother [38F] over the years and she acts like there are no problems at all,anonymousbpb87,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8x4cn9/i_20m_have_a_lot_of_built_up_drama_with_my_mother/,"As the title says, I have had a lot of issues with my mother over the last few years, but she seems to pretend that nothing has happened and everything is perfectly normal between us. For context, my dad has never been in the equation. I was effectively raised by my mom and grandparents. Here's a basic overview of the things I have had issues just 'getting over'. 

\-Towards the end of middle school (Me at 14 years old) I was having a lot of emotional issues. My friend group was falling out, my hormones were raging and my close uncle came down with lung cancer. At the time she had a brand new baby with my new stepfather (new of \~1.5 years) and I was seeking some comfort. I tried to connect as well as a shitty hormonal boy could but doing so was impossible with her, only partially due to the circumstances at hand. See below for why.

\-I feel that this deserves its own point despite being a continuation of the last point. She now has 3 young kids, none of whom she's ever been willing to leave with anyone other than close family, and even that for only a few hours barring emergencies. This has made developing an 'adult' relationship with her impossible as there are always screaming children around. 

\-My early adolescence left me with subjective abandonment issues. I had a lot of problems but nobody was around to listen. This remains an issue that I've brought up with her and she has responded with 'Yeah, that was difficult for you. But you got through it!' which feels like a platitude at this point. Any time I bring it up it's knocked down and brushed aside quickly. Feels like she doesn't much care. 

\-At about 14 I moved out of her house and into my grandparents. I've been here or at college since then. She did not fight to keep me home though insists I come back for Christmas. 

\-Her second child (When I was around 16) had a miscarriage scare. There were some medical mishaps and some idiotic interns who told her she'd lost the child (when nothing had happened at all). For a 4 day period she thought she had lost him, and everyone crowded around her for support, myself included. When I reached out to her to support though, she screamed at me that I would never understand what she'd gone through and the pain of losing a child. I was in the car ride home from the hospital and for the next four days she didn't talk to me, but welcomed other family and friends with open arms. When she found out she still had the child she came back happy as could be, but has never once addressed those days or spoke about it. I've reread our chats. I was nothing but caring and supportive and, though I understand she likely didn't mean what she said, it was extremely hurtful to me at the time. It felt like she had further 'othered' me. Since then I haven't felt like a part of their family. 

I understand that she was the primary victim here, but I am unable to ignore her rejection. 

\-Recently when I came home from college, I sat with her and the oldest kid for an hour for a dinner out. It was fun. I enjoyed myself. Then she let slip that my aunts and uncles and her had a group chat together where I was often the subject of a lot of rather mean spirited jokes. She brought this up lightheartedly as a joke that I was the ""golden child"" of my grandparents and that the others (my aunts and uncles) are jealous. She made several jokes about this but I just felt sick. I live with my grandparents for a lot of reasons, but I would trade it all to live in a normal family. I went home and just felt sick. It took all of my willpower not to drive 500 miles back to college that night. I felt so ostracized. 

Yet every time she sees me it's bright and cheery. Despite the fact that I duck her phone calls and distance myself as much as I can without hurting my grandparents. Every time she refers to me as her baby I want to puke.

I'm not really sure what to do anymore. How do I go about changing things?"

8x63hn,19,2018-07-08,Blackmailed wife,[deleted],RapeFantasy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RapeFantasy/comments/8x63hn/blackmailed_wife/,"I always have this fantasy about being a housewife with my current partner but being blackmailed by one of his boss' to let them fuck me and use me whenever they want in exchange for not firing my partner at work. 

As a friend of ours he would hang out with us and other coworkers to lower guards and get closer. One day when he and I are getting lunch, he confides in me that my partner isn't doing so well at work and hints that he might be fired from low performance. Desperate to save his job, I ask what we could do about it. Of course, the boss says he could over look the poor quality work if I would agree to 'help' him from time to time. I innocently agree and he takes us back to the office. There he tells me that I will be an unpaid intern to take care of menial tasks. Relieved, I sign the paperwork that he draws up and hope to begin the job. I go back to the apartment and tell my partner the good news, that I got a job and I'll be able to commute to and from work and he's overjoyed.

The next day when I start my job in my business skirt and blue button-up, I go to the boss' office (which is on a higher floor and has only the secretary's desk far away) and ask for my tasks. He then proceeds to unzip his pants and take his cock out. I gasp as I see the length and girth is far bigger than my partner's. I ask him what he's doing as this is a work place. He laughs at me and tells me that I'm his office slut unless he wants my partner to be fired and have both of us put on the streets. I think about getting out of there, but I don't want for my babe to get fired if I don't do something. So I obey him and get on my knees.

I take his girth in my hand and start to lick and suck the head of his cock. Impatiently he grabs my head and forces me to swallow some of his length faster than I want to. His hips start to pump himself in and out of my mouth and I have no choice but to slobber so that I don't scratch him with my teeth. ""What a good little slut taking my cock in your mouth."" I can't say anything as he has me look up at him with tears in my eyes.  He has his phone out taking pictures and recording me. I quickly take his dick out of my mouth and tell him to stop recording me.

He slaps me in the face, ""Shut up whore! Unless you want to be homeless?"" I stared at him defiant but helpless and don't say anything with tears forming in my eyes. ""Good girl. Now tell me how much of a flithly little whore you are who loves sucking MY cock."" I grit my teeth as he has his camera ready. He slaps my face again, this time much harder leaving my skin stinging.

I looked back at him and mumbled that I liked sucking his cock. He then set his phone down and grabs my throat. He pulls me up to his desk where my ass sits on lightly, but he's still got me lifted up a little by my throat as I am slowly losing oxygen. He forced me to look him in the eye as he said, ""Listen bitch. This is your last chance. Either you obey every single word I say and act like you enjoy it on camera, or I'm going to throw you and your pathetic boyfriend out of this building right now."" Terror shot through my body from his look of power and domination. I nodded my agreement to his terms and he released me, my body collapsing on the ground at his feet as I gasped for air. My pussy was starting to get wet from his words.

Gathering myself, I looked up at him where he had his camera ready and his cock throbbing. I licked my lips and stared into the camera with a seductive look, ""I'm such a dirty little whore who lovesss sucking X's big fat cock."" He smiled and pet my head. ""That's right little one. Why don't you prove it to me?"" His hand on my head pushed me toward his waiting dick as I accepted it into my mouth. While my mouth worked over his cock, my pussy kept getting more wet and was soaking my panties. It didn't take long for him to start pulsing and before I could pull away, he grabbed my head with both hands and shoved himself as deep as he could and came down my throat. I was choking on him until he released me and I coughed a little from lack of oxygen. 

Later I would only realize that the boss was actually lying and that my partner was doing better than average work at the company. His blackmail on me was now that video he had of my infidelity and he threatened me that if I stopped our arrangement, he would show it to my partner.

I just love the idea of someone forcefully taking me under blackmail. Just using me and filling me up with cum whenever and whereever they wish."

8x6jvt,6,2018-07-08,I think my near decade long relationship may be over,deadbeadthrowway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8x6jvt/i_think_my_near_decade_long_relationship_may_be/,"Hey. I've been with my girlfriend for almost a decade. We were together for a few years, she cheated on me, and we broke up for about a year. We got back together and have been together for 3-4 years again. Since the start of our relationship, we have lived together, save for a few stints where I worked in another city (3 months) and where I had an internship in another state (3 months again) or when we were broken up.

I do pretty much everything for my girlfriend.  I have a great job that pays for all of our food, vacations, rent, living expenses, her CC bills, etc -- and my job even gives her benefits (medical/vision/dental) because they know how important she is to me even though we aren't married. When I get home from work, I usually have to do the cleaning, help with dinner, go to the store -- basically do everything, even though until recently, she was not in school and not working. When I offer to take her places, either on a date or a vacation, it is very hard to convince her to say yes. Recently, she finally went out of her comfort zone and got a part time job (which she cries about for hours when she gets home) because I thought it would help her make friends and because she felt bad that I was providing all of our support. Part of what I suggested was actually true. She has made some friends at her job, but they are all guys, and its pretty obvious that at least one of them is super into her. She seems more likely these days to hang out with them than me. 

We spend most of our time together at home, even though we live in a hip city with a lot of things going on. We mostly do stuff together with other people present -- eg brunch with another couple or doing an event with a group of people. We do some stuff together, but it's usually just grabbing coffee or food, or maybe a popup event in the city. Other than that, we usually just watch a show while next to each other on our phones...

Our first 6 months, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We have never really had a 'good' sex life since then -- maybe a once a week in the second year, to a few times a month, to once a month, to where we are at now. The most sex we have had in the last few years was when we were broken up and she was seeing another guy (horrible, I know). We ended that eventually, and both saw other people, and eventually got back together with each other. I have tried to initiate sex most days in the past month. I have explicitly mentioned a few times a week over the past month (and before that) about how sex is important to me and that I wanted to have it with her, but she says she is not comfortable with her body. I tried to book us travel on a multi-country vacation, which she is super interested in until I start picking countries or making the reservations. Her body issues are not new. She has had an eating disorder in the past, and had an encounter with a guy ""friend"" who came about as close to sexually assaulting a her as possible without doing it that messed her up (while we were together). This second event was about the time when we had last had sex. Since that happened, I don't think we have even done as much as making out, and she is hesitant to even show me her body in any sexual way. I can see her showering or changing, but as soon as I express interest in her body, she becomes uncomfortable. I know that the event with her ""friend"", along with what I think is issues with processing stress/depression, are definitely at play here. She doesn't want help, though. I get unlimited free therapist sessions through my work, and only one time has she expressed interest, and she ended up cancelling the appointment.

I love this girl. She makes me laugh, she makes me cry, but I feel like this relationship is very one sided. I don't hang out with friends without inviting her very often (she gets upset and says she has no friends), but I am never included in her friend groups (usually guys that are interested in her, confess it, and she ends friendship). 

I am not going to say that I am perfect, either. A few times, I have created online dating profiles to flirt with girls because I am not getting any sort of physical attention from my girlfriend, and I refuse to flirt with girls in real life. Two times, I actually met a girl from online, but only after telling them that I had a girlfriend and was on there because my sex life was dry (I never had sex with them, but one did make out with me, and I let it happen a bit before I told her I had to leave). I didn't tell her about this because it was a mistake that I made that I never plan to make again, and I realize that makes me a shitty person.

I'm kind of at a loss of what to do here. She moved with me to a new state for my new job, but things have only gotten worse since then, since she doesn't have her old friend group and the only people introducing themselves to her are guys that want to date her (she is very beautiful, and I have always thought that).

I want things to work, but I don't know if things are too far gone. I do everything for her, and I have no issues doing that -- I just want reciprocation. The sex stuff bothers me a lot (my libido would probably prefer sex 3-5x per week, not 1-2x per year), but ""being too tired"" to go out with me and then a friend texting her and her going out bothers me a lot too (usually not on the same days, but still).

I typed most of this out just to be honest with myself. I know this is not the healthiest relationship. What do I do? What would you do?"

For the juicy bits, skip to Part Three.\*\*  


Part One: 

I am having difficulty parsing out how my friendship fell apart.  Some people have told me ""She was using you for attention all those years, she's a psychopath"" whereas others say I am at fault.  I am aware that people grow apart.  I just want to know if my behavior was in the wrong, and if there was something I could've done to change the outcome of all this.

In 2005, when I was 15, I met this girl on a video game forum.  We chatted on AIM every day about video games.  About two years in, we began calling each other.  We spoke to each other every day.  We had in-jokes, phone sex, the whole shebang.  She lived in the south, I lived in the northeast, but we resolved to some day meet each other.  And even at a distance, I really, really loved her.

As we grew up through high school, both of us had romantic relationships with other people.  We were jealous of each other's SOs, yet we also consulted each other for advice about the relationships.  We spent a ton of time playing online games together.  We met IRL during our junior year of high school, and I was such a nervous wreck I couldn't even muster up the courage to kiss her.  Granted, our parents were there watching over us the entire time.

We went off to college at the same time.  I got quite busy early on, and our contact became less frequent.  I texted her almost every day, and we continued to play World of Warcraft together online.  During our Sophomore year, she was hit with depression.  She was quite far away from her family (just her mom; she was an only child raised in a single mother household) and with less contact with me, and with no friends, she began to wither.  I did not know how to help, but I told her to please try and see a therapist through her university's counseling service.  She never did.

She dropped out of college, tried again one summer, but dropped out again.  During our summers in college I spoke with her every day on the phone.  She had a few passing friends, and a boyfriend here and there, but I continued to be the primary source of support in her life other than her mom.

And I cared.  Greatly so.  I had never gelled with someone so well, and I may never again.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part Two:

I graduated college, and was immediately admitted into a PhD program.  I had applied to PhD programs near my friend, but I was rejected from those programs.  I moved and worked years into my PhD.  Knowing how difficult it was for my friend to not talk to me, I made sure every day that I would speak with her for at least an hour.  Even though I was running all over the place, working practically 7 day weeks between research, teaching, clinical work, supervision, and taking courses, I made time for her because I loved her more than anything.

Fuck, she's even on the dedication page in my dissertation.  Having her there every day got me through my degree.

This is really hard to write about, and I'm tearing up just thinking about it.

We formed a raid group together in Final Fantasy XIV.  Yet at the time, I did not know that this would be the catalyst for our friendship falling apart.

Four years into my PhD, I finally saved up enough money to go visit her.  I spent a week with her, and it was the most amazing fucking thing.  The hotel overbooked the rooms and so they gave me the damn Penthouse suite for the whole week, for what amounted to less than $100 a night.  She and I lived it up, had sex, played games, and were so enthralled that after 9 years of talking to each other almost every day online that even in person we could be so free to be ourselves just like it had always been.

Then I got matched to my pre-doctoral internship/residency.  Again I had applied to places near my friend, but instead I got matched in the Midwest.  I knew as soon as I finished my degree, I'd apply for postdocs/jobs near her.  I flew out and stayed with her for two weeks before my internship began, and then moved to the Midwest.

So this was 2015 when I was on internship.  I became very close with my intern cohort, and we would get drinks every Wednesday and Friday.  I made a very good friend during this time, who was working on his second PhD.  I also made friends with some local people, one who I did develop feelings for but did not act on because I was so close to being able to move near my lifelong friend.

I continued to try and make time for her, but I noticed she began acting weirdly.  She would ignore my texts for days on end, or give me one word responses.  She ghosted on our raid group (that had been together for a year by that point), and went full-time with a second raid group she held on the side.

I'd try to connect with her by sharing success I had at work or if I needed help, and she'd say something like, ""I don't know man, it's your life, I'm just a bum working a part-time job.""  I would respond saying I'd appreciate her input.  She'd say ""I'm not sure what you want from me, it's your life and it's not like I'm ever a consideration in your decisions.  Just forget about little old me, I'll just go and sit here silent and alone.""

God, when she would say that I would get so sad.  I never wanted her to be alone.  Ever.

She began saying she feels like she needs to ""walk on eggshells"" around me.  She'd call me ""passive aggressive"" a lot of the time.  She then said ""You never make me a priority,"" to which I responded that I have been working on my career and I have done my very best to make time for her.  She would respond saying ""Resentment builds when you say you care but your actions don't show it.""

This really upset me.  I would cry at night because I didn't know what I had to do to show her how much I cared about her.

It got to a point where she was ignoring me completely outright.  I asked her why she completely stops talking to me and ignores my calls, to which she would respond ""I don't want to talk about it.""  I'd ask if she could at least give me an idea, if it was something I did, and she asked for me to stop pushing her.  She just responds, ""You're always with your friends, you're never available to talk, so why even try?""

During the times we did talk, she repeatedly brought up this guy who is in her raid group.  We'll call him Julian.  Any time she'd bring Julian up, I'd get this feeling in the pit of my stomach about him.  She mentioned he had a girlfriend.  Eventually I asked about him, and her tone would change and she'd go totally silent.  She'd then get snippy and say ""Why are you asking about this?  Can we just fucking drop it?""

Well no, we can't just drop it, because something was different and I was trying to communicate to repair our relationship.  If they had a thing going on, I asked her to just be honest and tell me.  I told her I didn't want her to feel alone, and if it meant being with Julian made her happy and feel less alone, then I'd be happy because she was happy.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Part Three:

Out of the blue, she asks me one day if I wanted to travel with her to a video game convention.  I was ecstatic!  She framed it as a chance  for us to reconnect and make things better, and she talked about all the sex we would have etc.  I was so, so happy.

Yet a voice in the back of my mind said this was unusual.  I tried to quiet it down.  Then, just a couple days before the conference when I'm trying to decide what panels to go to, she drops the bombshell that Julian will be at the conference and wants to meet up with him.

""Okay, if that makes you happy,"" I say.  Yet internally, I suddenly realized that I'm her Plan B.

I fly out there and my plane is several hours late.  We were sharing a hotel room, and despite me being late she was with Julian until like 2 AM.  When I met her, she smelled of sex and was absolutely wasted drunk. (worth noting that she never used alcohol before, and so this was really surprising to see) I immediately knew what had happened, but I tried to pretend everything was okay.  At one point in the night she tried to initiate sex with me, but I wasn't about to have sex with someone who was completely plastered.

We go to the convention the next day, and she's being quiet but cordial with me.  Not quite her usual self, but I figured that our friendship was damaged and would take time to repair.  We met up with Julian and his friend group.  What do you know, Julian's girlfriend wasn't at the conference.

Julian's friend group proceed to shit on me the entire time.  They harassed me about my height, made fun of how I looked, and all this weird bullshit from complete strangers.  We all went to get dinner that night, and I tried to sit next to my friend, but one of Julian's goons put his feet up on the seat just as I was about to sit saying, ""This seat's taken.""

During dinner, I watch Julian run his hand between my friend's thighs beneath the table.

I pulled her to the side later and said, ""I saw the entire thing.  Be real with me.  Did you sleep with him?""  She grows beet red and doesn't answer.  I shook my head and left her with them so I could cry back in the hotel room.

She comes back in the early morning plastered again and we got into a screaming match.  She owned up to at least making out with him and giving him a blowjob, but wouldn't answer whether they had sex or not.  Then she turned it all around on me, ""I resent you!"" she yelled.  ""You made me wait all these years, and then you just up and abandoned me!  You and I have gone in completely different directions in life, and you aren't the person I once knew.""

I told her, ""You chose to wait!  You knew I wanted to get my PhD.  I tried to move close to you.  I wanted to get a stable job so that we could have the foundation for a happy life together.  I've worked all these years for you.  How can you not see that?""

Never will I forget the venom in her cold, dead eyes at that moment.

She then began packing her stuff.  ""There must be something wrong with me,"" she said.  ""I'm just utterly broken inside.  A husk.  I am a broken human.""

I tried to hug her.  I told her we could heal from this.  She did not return the hug.  I did not see her for the third day of the conference.  When it was time to leave, my bus didn't show up so I got Julian to give me a ride with her.

At the airport, we said our goodbyes.  ""I'll see you again some day,"" she said.  I looked at her and just said, ""Maybe.""

Two years have passed, and I've talked to her maybe twice.  She has no interest in talking to me.  She and Julian remain in contact, as far as I know.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion:

This incident aged me.  It shook my foundations of my ability to trust others.  My life has had a big, gaping, weeping hole without her in it, and I've been unable to suture it up.  I am doing well for myself.  I am now an established professional in my community, and I've since bought a house.  I've dated a few other girls since, though nothing's stuck.

I lost my best friend.  I grew up with her.  I loved her and I still love her.  I have always wanted the best for her, and I still do.

Obviously, she stopped loving me around 2015 or when she met Julian.  I know my behavior was pathetic, clingy, needy, and probably overwhelming.  And I realized that at no point throughout this story were we ever dating, or exclusive.  There was no label or box you could put our relationship in.

But that's besides the point.  What upsets me is that she lied.  She invited me to the game convention just as a fallback plan in case things fell through with Julian.  She wouldn't tell me to my face that she had hooked up with him.

I am left feeling confused and disoriented.  She told me I abandoned her.  She told me I am passive aggressive, that she has to walk on eggshells around me.  She would say that I was never there for her, that I said I cared but never showed it.  She makes me sound like I was some horribly abusive and neglectful person in her life.

Yet from my perspective, all 12 years I had her at the forefront of my priorities.  I made time for her.  I'd send her gifts every holiday.  I'd promote her in our gaming communities.  I'd learn to play games I wasn't that interested in just to spend more time with her.  Just so she wouldn't have to play them alone.

Fuck, I even said that during our argument at the convention.  ""I always just wanted to be someone you could play with.  I didn't want you to have to play alone.""  I'm crying just typing this right now.

How do I even begin to sort out what had occurred?  Did I really abandon her?  Was I at fault for pushing her away?  Was there something I could have done to have stopped her from lying to me?  Is my anger justified, or is it unfair of me to feel anger towards her if we technically weren't exclusive?

And how the hell do I move on?

Thank you very much for reading."
8x7m4n,7,2018-07-08,Calling all narcoleptics!,Bycicler,Narcolepsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/8x7m4n/calling_all_narcoleptics/,"Hey everyone, 

I’m writing to ask for your personal experience with narcolepsy and if it is similar to mine and whether or not I should see a doctor. I’m kind of worried now that I’ve been taking it seriously so any kind words or advice would be appreciated as well. Sorry for the wall of text in advance. 

The symptoms I will describe started at the age of 15 and have worsened now up till my age of 20 currently. They come and go without warning as well as a sporadic occurrence. I may go weeks without it happening or have it happen every day of the week. What I am talking about is mainly the onset of tiredness. 

The first sign of this onset is a wave of fatigue, usually out of no where but I can feel it creep up on me. It usually starts in my head, an extreme feeling of tiredness which then moves to a whole tiredness/physical body tiredness. Next my vision goes blurry and I start to lose focus on what I’m looking at. This is then sometimes (40% maybe) followed by a hallucination of some sort, such as hearing music, imagining a scenario (for example a coworker is a secret agent) which then progresses to me closing my eyes and immediately or very soon entering a dream state. 

I have this happen to me anytime I’m not actively doing something (e.g. lifting weights, talking to someone, playing video games). I have had it happen to me at my desk, almost every lecture I have, all throughout high school (many teachers have given me a hard time, even asked me to stand at the back of the classroom), in meetings at work, and the most dangerous while driving. Once I recall hallucinating a group of “thugs” standing in the road, and I thought they were going to stop my car and rob me.

In addition to the onset tiredness, I have a extremely difficult time waking up in the morning. Some days I have no difficulty, and others I have a lot. It is a seemingly random chance on which of the two it is. I will set many alarms as well as owning an alarm clock which turns a light on to wake me up. These have not helped too much and I still cannot get out of bed. Even when someone wakes me up I will usually just say, “I’m up, leave me alone already” until they leave so I can return to sleeping. These decisions to wake up are usually not conscious and immediately regretted when I finally get out of bed. 

Overall this has affected me on and off, but no one has mentioned I should look into a sleep disorder until I was chronically falling asleep at my internship this summer. So asking all of you, from your personal experience does this sound like narcolepsy, and/or should I be checked out by a sleep specialist? Thank you in advance, I feel like I have finally figured out something that has been causing me lots of pain over the last five years. (Also I do not recall any symptoms of cataplexy, or just dropping asleep while standing, etc.) "
8x7pe3,1,2018-07-08,"[22/f] My ex [21/m] wrote a hurtful song about me and I don't know how, or if I even should, bring it up to him.",teanytiny,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8x7pe3/22f_my_ex_21m_wrote_a_hurtful_song_about_me_and_i/," I met this guy through a mutual friend when I visited her at college. We hit it off and it just so happened that he was about to spend a semester in the city I live in for a music internship and coincidentally was moving into an apartment in my neighborhood. We spent a lot of time together as friends before we started hooking up, and he was hesitant at first because we had a strong friendship and he was only going to be in the city for three months anyway but eventually physical attraction won over. While he was never my 'boyfriend', we hung out almost every day, he introduced me to a lot of his close friends and even invited me to go to his grandmothers' house for a weekend ski trip. He's a bourgeoning rapper, producer and DJ (like a lot of 20somethings) but he's actually pretty talented and would always show me his stuff and we would workshop it together. He wrote a rap about me, specifically our sex life, while we were still hooking up and played it for me before he put it online. At the time I was really flattered, and felt really ~cool~ knowing that if he ever blew up, one of his songs would be about me.



We stopped hooking up right before he left the city (about 3 months ago) but ended on good terms. He made it explicitly clear that he really cares about me and our friendship and we've remained close since. He actually had a pretty horrific family tragedy one month after he left and I was there to support him as he dealt with everything going on. We talk fairly regularly (we go through cycles of constant communication with about week long lulls in between) and have a really fun and supportive friendship. I would be lying if I said I didn't still have some feelings for him, especially because we ended because of our circumstances more than anything else, but I've really put that aside because I care a lot about maintaining our friendship and I know that he needs a friend right now more than anything else. I don't have any expectations of us ever getting back together and I've been seeing some other people since, but I do genuinely care about our friendship and I really want us to remain in each others lives. 



Anyway, last night I was showing a friend some of his music and we listened to the song about me. Even though I've heard it a couple times before, this time I really listened to the lyrics and realized how hurtful and demeaning they are. He calls me a bitch, says I have a face like a splinter (??), talks very explicitly about our sex, says his ""cock did the talking and [he's] not even into me"" and goes on to reference specific conversations that we've had basically mocking how much I'm into him and how he doesn't care about me. I don't know why it didn't bother me before, but now I'm really hurt. I'm sure a lot of it is just bravado, but it's really not nice to hear. I'm not quite sure how to bring it up with him, or if I even should, because 1) he wrote it so long ago (5 months) 2) he showed it to me before posting it, so if I had a problem I should have just brought it up then and 3) he actually is a really great friend to me and I really care about our friendship (if you couldn't tell). I also don't want to add another thing to his plate right now because he's still dealing with his loss, but I'm also not sure if I can really let this go because it's just so mean. I honestly don't know what to do, should I just forget about it and move on or should I try to have a conversation about this? And if I do have a conversation with him about this how would I even bring it up? 

tl;dr my ex whatever, and now close friend wrote a mean song about me while we were hooking up and it hasn't bothered me since now. Should I talk to him about it and if so, how?"

I'm an instrumentation engineering student given a project for my internship program about communicating from an Allen Bradley PLC to the existing Yokogawa CS3000 DCS via Modbus for monitoring purposes.

They already have the communication module (Prosoft MVI56E-MCM) for the PLC (Allen Bradley L71). So, I few questions:

1. Where can I find the step-by-step procedure?

2. Do I need a new logic for the PLC to communicate, or just to configure the module?

_Once upon a time there was a very handsome boy who lived in Atlanta, GA.  By day he was a normal college kid.  He went to frat parties, shotgunned beers on porches, and, on a few occasions, went to class.  In broad daylight he would blend in with the rest of them, but little did the muggle world know he had Magical powers.  Much like Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus, he lived a double life.  He dabbled in wizardry and locked himself away high in a tower to practice his spell casting for hours on end using an archaic program known as Magic: the Gathering Online.  It is said that his roommates could hear him practicing into the wee hours of the morning.  If those dorm room walls could talk they would say: “This is when the European grinders play, it’s easy money!”, “Are you serious, a #$%@ing Sagu Mauler?!?”, “Why won’t he split with me, I need to go to sleep so I can make it to my internship in the morning?!?”, and “I am sorry, this normally doesn’t happen, I swear...I just must be tired or something.  I promise, it’s never happened before.” (but that last one doesn’t have to deal with Magic)._

_But this is no Peter Pan tale.  This wizard grew up.  And so did his other wizard friends.  They planeswalked right out of college and into the docile world of Excel spreadsheets and Python scripts.  Corporate America: where Magic goes to die.  But one day this wizard and one of his wizard friends by the name of Benjamin F******n decided to shake off the monotony and, in an act of impulse, the two moved across the land to a city full of hope, happiness, and wonder: Las Vegas, NV._ 

_For six months they lived in bliss, undeterred by the real world.  But as in the fairy tales, our hero Michael Segal, took another bite of the poisonous apple and accepted a new job in the Bay Area.  He packed up his car purchased by MTGO tickets and drove away--abandoning his friend Benjamin and leaving a great deal of his belongings behind.  A few months passed and Michael found himself missing old Benjamin and, more importantly, his favorite pair of shorts that were left behind.  [You can see the shorts in action here: https://youtu.be/rZh95pUNezI ].  GP Vegas was a great opportunity for two birds to get stoned at the same time, and get a little Magic in all at once._

**If you've just come for the decklist, it can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g90IPYoylHJRgD2x45OfExfODWVR85Ee9fOQGMn4FLs/edit?usp=sharing**

Hi, I am Michael Segal.  For the last few years I have been playing Magic super intermittently.  I play about two or three months per year then barely touch it the rest of the year.  A few leagues a month, maybe a team draft here, and a SCG Open there (if I am feeling ambitious), but otherwise my wand and wizard hat are in storage.  Over the last year and a half, my favorite thing to do as a stress relief was play GR Titan Shift.  It is the quintessential ramp strategy of Modern and is among the most consistent decks in executing it’s game plan due to the redundancy of cards available in the Modern card pool.  It was quite clear to me when I found out GP Vegas was Modern, that I would seek out the optimal Titan Shift list for the metagame.

I officially began testing for GP Vegas in early May, then got a little burnt out before forcing myself to test a few more matches the two weeks leading up to GP Vegas.  The initial list I began testing with can be found here: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/8hkeyh/modern_mtgo_mtgo_modern_challenge_100_first_place/

From there, I determined mostly that Explore was a horrendous Magic card and that I wanted to hedge for game ones against Jeskai Control and Burn, which is how I came up with Courser of Kruphix.  The rest of my card choices are explained in the video series above, and if you’re too lazy to click on that they can be found at this link, [warning: poor audio/video quality, I am a noobie at video recording]: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8EkApToIvU&amp;list=PLroJ0oa-pfYuoVOBrdoKsfgk4MbbWssZ8

In the beginning of June after settling on a decklist (I tried a lot of cool versions, my favorite of which was a Titan Shift deck playing Molten Vortex + Life From the Loam), I decided to begin tracking my match-ups here; Note that this is missing like 5-10 leagues I played in May:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g90IPYoylHJRgD2x45OfExfODWVR85Ee9fOQGMn4FLs/edit?usp=sharing

_This is a spreadsheet.  I assume you all know how these work, but if you are one of the fortunate ones who will never have to touch one here is a brief tutorial.  In the bottom left there are tabs, they are titled “Valakut”, “Valakut Pivot”, “Valakut Decklist”, and “Valakut Sideboard Guide”. Below is a summary of what you will find on each tab and how to interpret it:_

_-Valakut - Data tab._

_This is every match of a league I’ve played since I decided to go to GP Vegas_

_Columns A:B have some quick stats_

_If a Result (Column H) is DNF it means I scrubbed out of the league and is just a placeholder to not mess up the formulas (I typically drop at 0-2 and 1-3)_

_-Valakut Pivot - Quick breakdown of Win-Loss by archetype_
_-Valakut Decklist - Most up to date decklist_
_-Valakut Sideboard Guide - Sideboard guide_

_For simplicity, I have assumed sideboarding on the Play/Draw is the same.  The biggest difference is that against Mardu Pyromancer I like to board out 1 less Farseek and board out a Primeval Titan_

_Column G:H include Win % and Sample Size for each of the Top 25 most played archetypes on MTGO.  If the value is #N/A, that means I have not played against them in my leagues._

_Column I includes Tips &amp; Tricks for each match up.  Some of them might be repeated or left out, but if you kind of play the deck enough you’ll figure out that most of the tips apply to similar archetypes._

_/End Explanation on spreadsheet._

Before they reset the boards to zero, I had accumulated either 7 or 8 trophies with Titan Shift, which I think was the highest out of any Titan Shift player that season.  My 5-0% at the time of writing this was around 17%.  

I am probably done playing Magic for the rest of the year, but I think there is a ton of creative real estate to be explored with the Titan Shift archetype.  Below is what I believe to be the core of the deck, the rest is up to you:


4 Sakura-Tribe Elder

4 Primeval Titan


4 Search for Tomorrow

4 Farseek

3 Scapeshift


2 Valakut

2 Forest

6 Mountains

4 Wooded Foothills

7 other Mountains


That’s it.  That’s the core that wins your matches against Humans, Mardu Pyro, and Tron.  40 cards.  Which means your canvas is 4 cards wide and 5 cards long.  Time to turn on The Joy of Painting, get the afro wig out of your costume closet, and get to work.  However, I am guessing the majority of the audience is comprised of lazy millennials, so don’t worry the decklists floating around through the MTGO Hive Mind are good enough!

Anyhow, that concludes the deck portion of the “article”, below is the tournament report part [I wrote this a few weeks ago, but had been kinda busy and didn’t post it].

__Tournament Report__

I have no byes these days, but I really wanted a promo Mutavault, so I committed to playing this Grand Prix.  It also didn’t hurt that I had been mainlining Titan Shift leagues into my veins for the past year as it is the most relaxing deck to play in all of Magic currently.  People like to criticize it as a boring deck, but if you find shuffling your deck five times in two turns boring then you’re playing the wrong game.  As a bonus, I bought some APAC lands last year at GP Chiba and had been jonesing to play with them.

Joe “Wallace” Demestrio, his fiancee Shelby, and I loaded up the aforementioned Chevy “Ted” Cruze and hit the road for Friday’s GP at about 8pm on Thursday.  We thought the drive was only going to be about 6 hours long, but it quickly was revealed to us by Google Maps that it was closer to 8 hours.  Add on the fact that I drive as slow as my grandmother and that Wallace needed to stop every 11 minutes for a bathroom break, we made the drive in approximately 10 hours.  I cranked out a couple hours of sleep, then hit the tournament site ready to play my first Grand Prix in 9 months!

I won’t go into a ton of detail about the rounds, but rather outline the tournament and go over a few of the highlights from it.  I may have mixed up some of the round #s, but the archetypes and results are correct.

**Rd 1: 2-0 Mardu Pyromancer**

**Rd 2: 2-1 UR Gifts Storm**

**Rd 3: 2-1 Burn**

**Rd 4: 2-1 Elves**

In game 1, my opponent killed me on turn 3 with a mull to 5.  I am not sure how, but it happened.  In game 2 my opponent cast a convoke version of Cranial Extraction against me and I untapped and killed him the next turn or else he would have cast the second copy to rip out all of my kill conditions.  Game 3, Anger of the Gods rolled him before he could cast a Cranial Extraction  if I remember correctly.

**Rd 5: 0-2 Titan Breach**

**Rd 6: 0-2 Infect**

My opponent this round was Andrew Cuneo.  This match-up is not great.  You can improve it by adding a Melira, Sylvok Outcast to your sideboard as a Summoner’s Pact target.  You can also play obscure cards like Fog as well, or some Sudden Shocks.  I have been experimenting with variations of Titan Shift that combat Infect quite well using Life from the Loam + Molten Vortex, but the merit of those lists is still on trial.

The interesting situation was the following:  

He has 6 cards, Breeding Pool, Verdant Catacombs, Inkmoth Nexus, Blighted Agent, Pendelhaven. All lands untapped.

I have: Farseek, Lightning Bolt, EE, Cinder Glade, freshly drawn Titan in hand.  1 Valakut in play.  11 Lands.

He is at 19 health, I am at 4 infect.  

In my mind I have two options:

1 - Try to burn him out: Play Primeval Titan, search for 2 Valakuts.  Play Farseek, 9 damage to his face, play Cinder glade 9 damage to his face, Bolt him when he goes for the kill. 

2 - Try to play for the long game: Play Primeval Titan, search for two lands (some combination of fetch lands and Valakut).  Play a Cinder Glade to try to draw out a Blossoming Defense on his Blighted Agent.  Then play EE on 2 and pass with Bolt open.

I decide to go for the kill as I have no way to really interact with the Inkmoth Nexus other than a Lightning Bolt, but there is such a high probability that he has Blossoming Defense, or a 2nd even if he has one to save his Agent.  Also, even if he has the Dispel for my Lightning Bolt to his face, he may have to crack that Catacombs plus another fetchland he may draw to cast all of his spells.  He has the Dispel and I lose to his 7/7 Inkmoth Nexus.

**Rd 7: 2-1 Jeskai Control**

**Rd 8: 2-0 Affinity**

This game was kind of interesting because it was clear my opponent knew I had Lightning Bolt, but did not go all in on his Inkmoth Nexus in either game when I was tapped out.  Instead he let me shoot down his things with Valakuts and then kill his modulared creature when I had open mana.  I find that Affinity is a match up where if your opponent goes all in on a creature land, they win, but since they fear Ancient Grudge or Nature’s Claim so much they will not do it.  

**Rd 9: 2-0 Mardu Pyromancer**

**Rd 10: 0-2 Mono Green Stompy**

This was pretty awesome.  You learn something new at every tournament.  If you asked me “Do you think you’re favored against a Modern Steal Leaf Stompy deck?” I would have answered yes.  But this match was not close.  Rancor puts all of my blockers to shame and he killed me on turn 4 both games.  

**Rd 11 2-1 Mardu Pyromancer**

This was one of those rounds where the lack of sleep got to me.  I foolishly left myself dead to Blood Moon for no reason in the first game and then in the third game I forgot to exile my own Valakut with Relic of Progenitus and lost them to Surgical Extraction.  Fortunately, my two Tireless Trackers alongside Karn, Scion of Urza, who has since been cut from the decklist, and Courser of Kruphix allowed me to brawl to victory.

**Rd 12: 2-1 Humans**

**Rd 13: 2-1 Jund**

This match was uncomfortable.  I was tired and grouchy.  My opponent was abrasive.  We had a lot of awkward moments that left us both very uncomfortable.  I enjoy that we shook hands at the end of the match and wished each other the best. 

The highlight of the match was on his turn 3.  My hand is 3 lands, Farseek, Obstinate Baloth and he casts Inquisition of Kozilek to strip the Farseek, then without a pause cast Thoughtseize which put my Obstinate Baloth into play.  

**Rd 14: 2-1 Tron**

Game one in this match was pretty sick.  I played enough ramp spells that I found through a Karn and a Ulamog.  He then attacked me with an Ulamog and because of a fortunate mill, it only milled 1 Mountain from my deck. He followed up his attack with a Karn to destroy another land.  On my turn if I drew any ramp spell, I could have Scapeshifted him for exactly lethal! Alas, I drew another Scapeshift.  Luckily Damping Sphere is a strong sideboard card.

**Rd 15: 1-2 BW Eldrazi &amp; Taxes**

Terrible match-up and I played terribly in both games 2 and 3. Bolt the Leonin Arbiter on sight, don’t try to get cute.  Ever.

My tournament finished at an unsatisfying, but unembarrassing 11-4.  This finish in 2012 would have been good enough for some Chuck E. Cheese tickets, but alas I walked home empty handed.  I would love to blame this somehow on not having byes anymore, or lack of sleep.  But honestly, I think I just got some rough pairings--specifically BW Eldrazi &amp; Taxes and Through the Breach which are not super prevalent in the metagame--and played rather poorly the entirety of the tournament. 

Winning 72% of my matches feels great, but I wish I skipped the tournament to catch up on sleep and hang out with friends.  Benjamin finished in the Top 4 and I watched exactly 0 minutes of his day 2 matches which I know I would have enjoyed.

Also, because of the tournament I did not have time to head to a casino to place a big bet on Croatia beating Nigeria.  So not only did I win no money at the Magic tournament, but the Magic tournament kept me from winning money on the World Cup bets!  Could I run any worse?  The answer is yes, I played against storm 3 times at the Sunday MTGO PTQ and then got smushed by Andrew Jessup in the 2-1 bracket.

Since the Grand Prix, I cut the Karn, Scion of Urza for another Damping Sphere.  Also, with the rise of infect in the metagame, I am toying around with -2 Obstinate Baloth +1 Melira +1 Thragtusk in the sideboard.  I loved the main deck.

Props:

-Great roadtrip playlists curated by Benjamin and myself that include Convoy by C.W. McCall and Big Rock Candy Mountain by Harry McClintock

-Valakut and Tireless Tracker for doing the heaviest of lifting on day 2 when I never drew Scapeshift or Primeval Titan

-Dylan Donegan for not crashing my car

-Justin Parente for flying to Vegas from Atlanta and hanging out with me between rounds

-Andy Jessup for admitting he’d do some pretty degrading things in exchange for a MTGO Grand Prix

Slops:

-Me for spilling a bag of cashews all over my car which resulted in my car smelling like cashews for a 20 hour road trip

-Obstinate Baloth for not really proving much worth (even against burn) except when my opponent Thoughtseized it

-Finishing Day One so late that the only place to eat dinner in Las Vegas was McDonald’s which is saying a lot since Las Vegas restaurants are open quite late.

-Writing this multiple weeks after the tournament

Well, that’s all I got for today.  I am sure I’ll be writing more soon.  Magic has become my favorite after work activity and right now all of the formats are quite interesting.  If you enjoyed the article please consider following me on Twitter or subscribing to the YouTube channel above.

I met this guy through a mutual friend when I visited her at college. We hit it off and it just so happened that he was about to spend a semester in the city I live in for a music internship and coincidentally was moving into an apartment in my neighborhood. We spent a lot of time together as friends before we started hooking up, and he was hesitant at first because we had a strong friendship and he was only going to be in the city for three months anyway but eventually physical attraction won over. While he was never my 'boyfriend', we hung out almost every day, he introduced me to a lot of his close friends and even invited me to go to his grandmothers' house for a weekend ski trip. He's a bourgeoning rapper, producer and DJ (like a lot of 20somethings) but he's actually pretty talented and would always show me his stuff and we would workshop it together. He wrote a rap about me, specifically our sex life, while we were still hooking up and played it for me before he put it online. At the time I was really flattered, and felt really ~cool~ knowing that if he ever blew up, one of his songs would be about me.


We stopped hooking up right before he left the city (about 3 months ago) but ended on good terms. He made it explicitly clear that he really cares about me and our friendship and we've remained close since. He actually had a pretty horrific family tragedy one month after he left and I was there to support him as he dealt with everything going on. We talk fairly regularly (we go through cycles of constant communication with about week long lulls in between) and have a really fun and supportive friendship. I would be lying if I said I didn't still have some feelings for him, especially because we ended because of our circumstances more than anything else, but I've really put that aside because I care a lot about maintaining our friendship and I know that he needs a friend right now more than anything else. I don't have any expectations of us ever getting back together and I've been seeing some other people since, but I do genuinely care about our friendship and I really want us to remain in each others lives.


Anyway, last night I was showing a friend some of his music and we listened to the song about me. Even though I've heard it a couple times before, this time I really listened to the lyrics and realized how hurtful and demeaning they are. He calls me a bitch, says I have a face like a splinter (??), talks very explicitly about our sex, says his ""cock did the talking and [he's] not even into me"" and goes on to reference specific conversations that we've had basically mocking how much I'm into him and how he doesn't care about me. I don't know why it didn't bother me before, but now I'm really hurt. I'm sure a lot of it is just bravado, but it's really not nice to hear. I'm not quite sure how to bring it up with him, or if I even should, because 1) he wrote it so long ago (5 months) 2) he showed it to me before posting it, so if I had a problem I should have just brought it up then and 3) he actually is a really great friend to me and I really care about our friendship (if you couldn't tell). I also don't want to add another thing to his plate right now because he's still dealing with his loss, but I'm also not sure if I can really let this go because it's just so mean. I honestly don't know what to do, should I just forget about it and move on or should I try to have a conversation about this? And if I do have a conversation with him about this how would I even bring it up?


TL;DR my ex whatever, and now close friend wrote a mean song about me while we were hooking up and it hasn't bothered me until now. Should I talk to him about it and if so, how?"

Following is my (slightly edited) reply to him. I hope these tips can help others in the same situation. Good luck, Scott*

...

Thanks for writing and congratulations on your graduation. May you have a long, satisfying and illustrious career in the film-TV business. And thanks for asking your question of how to now proceed with your career in this industry. A blunt (and broad and good) question, and so my blunt answer follows. Please excuse the rushed nature of my notes and any repetition. 

First, generally, please understand that you are at the bottom. People don’t need you. Most people in the industry will be nice to you, but you have to prove yourself and give good service and value to players in the business. Make them like, respect and need you. Earn it. But first you need to get in the door to get experience, to prove yourself and to make contacts. My experience has mostly been in Los Angeles, so I presume it works the same where you are. More specifically, my advice to you is to: 

Most importantly, as with any endeavour in life: Know what you want. Writer, producer, actor, director, etc. Then work out a path towards that. Ignore the doubters and naysayers. In the following notes, I’ll focus more on writing and producing, which are my background and experience. 

\*Get into the biz! And at the bottom is a good place to start, you can learn so much. Be a reader, runner, assistant, PA, coffee maker, driver; whatever it takes to get in and that can lead to where you want to go. 

\*Hit on all your friends, family, contacts to get in the door. Cold call or write to production companies. 

\*To make contacts, a good way is to ask players for advice. 

\*Help the people in the biz that you want to help you. 

\*Work for free. Yes, working for free at the start is fine! 

\*Look for and do internships. If you are good, you will be noticed and may earn a full-time job. I stress: Internships are a great way to get in.

\*When you get in, make contacts, impress people, work damn hard, do the hard or boring jobs, ask people how you can help them. Be a mensch. Don’t talk politics or trash. Always be positive about the product you are helping to create. Be passionate. 

\*Learn all aspects of the biz. Knowledge is confidence, power and skill building, and will make you look a pro who can be trusted. You have to learn the talk, know your stuff. 

\*Get credits and experience. Build a resume. Have a page on IMDB.

\*Study, know thy craft. There are books and articles to read, old timers to quiz. Shoots to watch.

\*Write knock out stories. 

\*As a writer, read classic plays and novels. Classic storytellers are so much better writers than the screenwriters of today. Study the true classics. Have you read Ibsen, Hugo, Rattigan, and other master storytellers?

\*I think the best book on fiction writing is Ayn Rand’s *The Art of Fiction,* especially the chapter on Plot-Them*e*. 

\*Get a great editor to story edit your scripts. No new writer can be objective; get help from a real pro. 

\*Re selling your scripts, you have several options: Get an agent or manager or lawyer to represent you and your work or go directly to companies/broadcasters and pitch yourself. It’s hard, but you will have to learn the business end of things. But first, get the story/script finished! Then develop your pitching materials such as your bio, pitch letter, one-page synopsis, and a brilliant log line (1-2 sentences only) and go at it to production companies, etc. But do not submit without your script being FINISHED, as judged by experts, not yourself. (I repeat: It’s very hard to be objective about your own writing!)

\*For who to pitch your scripts to, search IMDB pro and the internet for the best companies for your type of stories. Then send them a knock out pitch letter (never the script itself). Be gracious in failure, thankful in success. (You can find agents online, to get their email addresses, but the best way to get an agent is by a referral from a pro or through some success like a possible sale or a contest win.) 

\*Look out for wankers, amateurs and bs artists. Check their credits. And beware of some “experts.” Develop your own philosophy and style but keep an open (active) mind. 

\*Don’t forget the people who helped you and build a network of good people. Stay in touch. Don’t just hit on people then run if they don’t help you. If you say you are gonna do something, do it. Be trusted and respectful. Good people notice good people. And always remember that pros are very busy. 

\*Good luck. It’s a tough biz but a great one that respects and wants talent. Believe in yourself and that your work and life are important. Take pride in your work and character. Most people won’t care but you must! When discouraged, read a good story and study Kipling’s poem *If*. When successful, remember that once you weren’t but do enjoy your work and achievement. It’s in your hands now....

Happy trails and best wishes,

8x8rfz,3,2018-07-09,F4A Having a little fun as a Trophy wife,The_Sex_Goddess,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8x8rfz/f4a_having_a_little_fun_as_a_trophy_wife/,"Hey there everyone, tonight I have a special idea for an RP,

I would like to play the role of a trophy wife. This could come in several different varieties and cater to several different fetishes (one of the most obvious being bimbos)

If any of you have seen Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure, my first thought was that I could play a character like Missy, Bill's stepmom. For those of you who haven't seen the movie, Bill and Ted are seniors in high school Missy is only 3 years older than them.

These two quotes sum it up pretty well

**Missy**: Hi, Bill. Want a ride?

**Bill**: Sure, Missy.

\[*she draws a blank stare at Bill*\]

**Bill**: I mean, Mom.

\[*she smiles and puts on her Ray-Bans*\]

**Ted**: \[*whispering to Bill*\] Your stepmom's cute.

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted.

**Ted**: Remember when she was a senior and we were freshmen?

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted!

**Ted**: Now your dad's going for it in your own room!

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted.

**Ted**: Your stepmom \*is\* cute, though.

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted!

**Ted**: Remember when I asked her to the prom?

**Bill**: SHUT UP, TED!

Anyway I'd love to play a character like her and you could play either the father or my stepson

Another option for a scene would be one where I am a younger girl that you are seeing/married to and I am one of your daughters life long friends, so either we have to keep it secret or it is just very very uncomfortable for her.

Another idea is that I am a secretary of yours or an intern or something, and we are having an affair that you have to keep hidden from your family,

Also feel free to message me about doing one of my older prompts I would just prefer this one tonight. 

Either way I would love to play a woman who is much younger than you, sort of a forbidden love thing. I can't wait to hear from you all!

**P.S.** All charaters in these RPs are 18+"
8x8ue5,1,2018-07-09,I [26M] battled with depression which eventually made my fiance [24F] leave me after 9 years together,Porceveer,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8x8ue5/i_26m_battled_with_depression_which_eventually/,"Hi reddit,

this is my first time here but after reading so many great comments on other posts I would like to share my story.

So let‘s start with some background. My girlfriend/fiance and I got together 9 years ago. We met at the local carneval and she was my first love (and so far the only one).
Half a year after we got together I left for Canada for an exchange. When I got back after half a year she left me for a guy she had met while I was away. This only lasted for 3 months though and when things ended with him I gave her a second chance. While it was hard, I have not regretted this decision one day. It lead to a stable relationship for the last 8 years.

Anyhow, now to more recent events. In October my dad got a cancer diagnosis. It was really serious and no one could tell if he would make it, since it was a very rare type of cancer around the thyroid gland. Chemo- and radiotherapy and operations followed.
This really hit me hard since I‘ve always had a close relationship with him and he still is an important guidance figure in my life. My at-that-time still girlfriend was all I could wish for. She cared for me and I was so thankful for her support, although it was hard for me to show it.

It was a tough time, seeing my dad like that. Anyhow, I was ok, thanks to my girl and also because I was working on an university project that I much enjoyed, although it was hard to focus on at times.

Then March came. I had finished my project and I had planned to take the summer off to focus on my sports. I do sports semi-professionally and did plan my studies in a way so I could focus on it during the summer season.
Aditionally my girlfriend left for a three month internship 2000km away. This had also been planned long ahead and was part of her studies.

From here on things got really ugly for me. I was alone, without any structure and not in the right mindset to follow through with my training.
I fell into a deep hole. Although I was already in therapy at the time, it got darker and darker. I developped a depression and could not see any beauty or good anymore. Still my girlfriend did everything she could from where she was.

At about the halfway point we had planned to meet for a weekend. I was really not doing well but still we had an amazing time. We talked through the nights and were as close as we had not been in a long time. Since it had been a topic before, we then decided to get engaged. It was not the romantic way but more of a mutual
decision. While I was not doing better immediatly I thought there was at least a light at the end of the tunnel. 
But still I was struggling and had episodes of really dark thoughts and listlessness and I started to take anti depressants.

I did better for a couple of weeks and we met again for a weekend two weeks before her internship was supposed to end. This weekend had a totally different feeling than the last. We spent more time in bed and less time talking. The connection was never that close as it had been before.

When she returned to her place to finish her last couple of weeks, she met this guy that made advances towards her and she also liked him a lot, but not in a way she would do anything. I trust her on that.
She told me openly about all of it, which has always been our way of dealing with things. I‘m usually not the jealous type, we had even experimented with open relationships and had done things together with other people.

Only this time it hit me hard. I could not stand the thought of some other guy trying to get close to her or her being anything more than friends with him. Still I did not want to straight out forbid her to see him. For me a relationship is all about trust and rationally I knew she would do nothing that would hurt me. I was in a huge conflict with myself which of course lead to other problems, her not feeling trusted, etc..

Then her internship ended and I went to visit her and we did two weeks of travelling together. This was at the beginning of June. Everything could have been great. My father had been declared cancer free on June 5th and she would come back home soon after. 
Only it wasn‘t. While travelling there was always this tension between us. Also I could never fully relax and felt the depression nagging at me. I discussed my own suicide with her. We finally talked the second last evening and things seemed to move in the right direction after that.

So I returned home and the plan for her was to travel another week with two guys, one she had travelled with before. I had no problem with that. Until one little text she sent me; she texted me that they had gone bathing (they were backpacking so obviously naked) and I again could not stand that thought.
And I lashed out. It was ugly and I feel so sorry for it. I really stuck it to her and I think this was the point something broke. This was last Tuesday.

The crazy thing is that the moment I realized I had quite possibly just ruined everything, I was able to think clearly again for the first time in months. My empathy was back and all of a sudden the other me that I had been for so long felt like a monster, something that I had finally broken lose from.
I appologized to her shortly after and even wanted to break things off with her right there on the phone; I was so ashamed of what I had done. She didn‘t want to end things that way though.

She came back on Friday. It was obvious something was off. She was unable to relax and I could feel how my touch made her uncomfortable.

We talked and cried a lot over the weekend and she told me she could just not feel what she needed to feel to be with me anymore. After the call in which I tried to break things off with her she said she somehow felt relieved and she let go of something. 
She also found comfort with one of the guys she travelled with after. He was there for her and cared for her the way I should have. She said she had the feeling as if she had known him for years. They did spend a night sleeping naked next to each other. She said that nothing happened between them, no kiss and no inappropriate touch. I believe her.

Yesterday she then told me she had to leave. I understand her. I have leaned on her for too long and made her responsible for my happiness. In the process she got crushed. I can see that now. 

I want her to be happy. She deserves it like no other; she hasn‘t been with me for too long. And now that I feel I could make her happy again, it is too late.

I know that I need to take care of myself now. I don‘t know if there is the possibility for another chance for us. But I know that no matter what, I need to be able to stand on my own feet again. Although this break up will not make it easier, everything is better than letting the monster back in control.

I miss her. And the thought of her being with someone else crushes me inside. I think she will go and visit the guy from the trip soon, since he lives only a three hour drive away. I feel replaced, although that is not true because I could not give her the comfort he was able to. I know that 9 great years can not be replaced that easily for both of us. Still it hurts.

We now need to sort out our things and our apartment. This means I will probably see her regularly in the next couple of weeks. While I‘m somehow looking forward to it, it also scares the shit out of me and I don’t know how to manage all of that. 

I love her, and I wish her only the best."

My empathy was back and all of a sudden the other me that I had been for so long felt like a monster, something that I had finally broken lose from.
I appologized to her shortly after and even wanted to break things off with her right there on the phone; I was so ashamed of what I had done. She didn‘t want to end things that way though.

She came back on Friday. It was obvious something was off. She was unable to relax and I could feel how my touch made her uncomfortable.

We talked and cried a lot over the weekend and she told me she could just not feel what she needed to feel to be with me anymore. After the call in which I tried to break things off with her she said she somehow felt relieved and she let go of something. 
She also found comfort with one of the guys she travelled with after. He was there for her and cared for her the way I should have. She said she had the feeling as if she had known him for years. They did spend a night sleeping naked next to each other. She said that nothing happened between them, no kiss and no inappropriate touch. I believe her.

Yesterday she then told me she had to leave. I understand her. I have leaned on her for too long and made her responsible for my happiness. In the process she got crushed. I can see that now. 

I want her to be happy. She deserves it like no other; she hasn‘t been with me for too long. And now that I feel I could make her happy again, it is too late.

I know that I need to take care of myself now. I don‘t know if there is the possibility for another chance for us. But I know that no matter what, I need to be able to stand on my own feet again. Although this break up will not make it easier, everything is better than letting the monster back in control.

I miss her. And the thought of her being with someone else crushes me inside. I think she will go and visit the guy from the trip soon, since he lives only a three hour drive away. I feel replaced, although that is not true because I could not give her the comfort he was able to. I know that 9 great years can not be replaced that easily for both of us. Still it hurts.

We now need to sort out our things and our apartment. This means I will probably see her regularly in the next couple of weeks. While I‘m somehow looking forward to it, it also scares the shit out of me and I don’t know how to manage all of that. 

I love her, and I wish her only the best."

My goal is HRIS, but I know that might not be immediate.

To preface this a bit, I have no internship experience. However, I’ve been an independent blockchain analyst for a large amount of contacts on LinkedIn for years. I self taught myself programming when I was 13, and have a plethora of projects to back up my resume. Lots of programming experience with python, so I can take on big data processing tasks with ease. Also currently apart of a startup as CTO, primarily developing integrated web applications for our business. I have looked into earning my aPHR certificate and would like to acquire it now to get me on track for the higher certifications.

I’d like to start applying ASAP, and have reviewed a couple of entry level positions on indeed. Basically, it looks like generalist or recruiter are my only two options right now.

So, as a person without any internship experience, but possibly some marketable skills, which type of position/listing should I target first? Is there another position I should be looking into?"
8x9gc9,124,2018-07-09,"Head chef has lost his shit, and may have just poisoned me....",livinabox,TalesFromYourServer,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer/comments/8x9gc9/head_chef_has_lost_his_shit_and_may_have_just/,"**Overly dramatic title but im currently in between puking so idgaf.**

I know, I know. I bitch on here a lot for someone who is 'happy with their job'. For the most part, I AM. But we have a new head chef, and he is probably the pettiest motherfucker I've ever met (yes, even pettier than teenage girls- any readers that are teenagers, you know what I mean!)

**Please tell me if I should start looking for another job. I'm 'qualified enough'- that is, I have a gambling license, a senior writer license for KENO, a cocktail knowledge certificate, and the Responsible Serving of Alcohol certificate- to apply for other hospitality jobs. So I want to know whether I should or not.**

So when I got this job the hotel was in the pits. In summer you'd get maybe five people through the bar and bottleshop, which, stretched over eight hours, is nothing. So I was bored shitless and owner decided to hire a new head chef and some chefs to get the ball rolling with new food.

Head Chef claims he worked with Jamie Oliver, and put out a wonderful menu. That is 14 pages long. Food was great to begin with, he and the chefs he hired (a man and a woman), along with the apprentice and couple of kitchen hands, worked tirelessly to make food on-site and fresh every day. People poured in and reviews were raving. I suddenly had something to do. We got more bartenders and waitresses to accommodate for the new influx of people.

I'm close friends with one of the waitresses. We went to school together, and she is a very pretty lady. Everybody noticed her. Including the chef. Now, the chef had a wandering eye for any female staff, and he quite often put the moves on them. Waitress One (let's call her Gemma), rejected him. He pointed a ladle at her and said, quite plainly, ""I am going to get you fired"".

Waitress two (pretty friend) goes along with his antics, for whatever reason. He dotes on her, buys her presents, and makes her food for free. He refuses making Gemma food, even though she's entitled to a free meal if she works six hours. Gemma has to go through the owner to get that free bowl of fries.

Chef corners me one afternoon and asks me if I have a boyfriend. He then tries to sling an arm around me. I duck the arm, and say very clearly, ""I'm sorry, that's really not appropriate. I'd rather you not touch me again.""

Since then he's been the biggest arsehole and things have gone downhill. The other chefs have been fired for whatever reason (later heard that they 'didn't get along' with the Head Chef). We now have an apprentice who swears he's going to leave, and a single kitchen hand. Food quality is SHITE.

Chef also changes the menu once a week. I'm not kidding. (and not minor changes- LIKE WHOLE PAGES OF NEW ITEMS CHANGES)

Insert example: 'Slow-cooked' lamb shanks are not slow-cooked (they used to be). Ordered from a purveyor and frozen in snap-locked bags. They're microwaved now. Had a customer complain it was frozen in the middle (it was).

Steaks are more often either overcooked, or so rare you may as well go and bite a cow (eg: 'medium-rare'= blue here.)

Chef has hated me ever since I told him off. Makes snide remarks, doesn't let me carry other server's food out to give them a hand, will scream at you if you DARE to take food back. I even got in trouble for putting in a modded order for someone who was lactose intolerant, lol. ('What the FUCK IS THIS? Can't they just order something ELSE?'. Uh, no. If it's on the menu and they want it, they can have it).

It's gotten so bad that I don't even want to walk into the kitchen any more to run food. If you have a question about the order, or call food away, he will ignore you. Then blame any 'mistakes' on you, because you're the 'expendable' one.

What really pissed me off is that he found rats and bugs inside the kitchen, and blamed the FOH staff.

Actual text message:

**'I want all front of house staff to do better and clean the kitchen whenever you're not busy. Let's get into good practices before summer comes around again =\]'**

Like, piss off mate, since when do BARTENDERS and WAITRESSES have to clean the kitchen? (I understand if we've made a mess and dropped something. By all means, clean up your mess. But insinuating that we're lazy and when we're not serving beers we should kiss his ass and do his work for him WHEN HE FIRED HIS OWN BOH STAFF isn't acceptable in my book).

Thursday Night, when we were hit with the random influx we randomly get, he started insulting me, saying I was stupid, I should memorise the whole menu (yes, I should, but quit changing it damnit), and I lost it. I told him to NEVER talk to me that way, that we deserve better, and he literally SCREAMED at me. Like, banshee screaming. I didn't end up taking that dish out for him.

I got my 'free meal' last night because I worked ten hours. Just some potato gnocchi. It tasted weird. I sniffed the bowl, asked my coworker 'Does this smell weird to you?'

I'm still vomiting. I legit think this guy tried to poison me with gnocchi.

**TLDR; Head Chef lost his passion and was pervy. Trying to fire girls who reject him. Lamb shanks are frozen, trying to bully FOH to clean his kitchen. I got food poisoning.**

**Should I start looking for another job? (for those who are familiar, yes, I did accept the random internship that was offered to me, but its 1 day a week and I need some sort of income haha.) Also fully aware I sound like an asshole in the above post, but I sure am sick of this guy bullying me. Hospitality makes you a mean bitch.**

EDIT: Just found out work hasn't been paying my superannuation. I've been dogged out of nearly two thousand dollars and my account has been closed because no money has been going into it. Rip."
8x9gw6,16,2018-07-09,Thinking about starting GTD,hjromero25,gtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/gtd/comments/8x9gw6/thinking_about_starting_gtd/,"I am a highschool student with ADHD (and definitely has a hard time with time-management) who interns part-time, volunteers at the local hospital, participates in 3+ clubs/activities, and more. I have been thinking about trying GTD for awhile, but I haven't really done it.

Recently, I have been struggling to decide between Things 3 and Todoist (I included images of both). Both are great apps, and I had used Todoist until March, but Things 3 is very nice, and I have been enjoying it. That's not really the important part though. I can always figure out which app works best when I begin implementing GTD.

I have included images of all of the apps that I use, so you can see my current tasks/projects/notes/articles.

I just have a couple things I need to know about working with GTD—especially with all of the things that I do. If somebody could help me find something that works for me, that would be so amazing. I know about GTD, I know the five steps, I know the main principles, but for some reason, I can't figure out how to implement it. I know there is such an overbearing wealth of information on this subreddit which I just found, it’s unbelievable. I thought I might as well ask my own questions as well though.

1. **How does a mind-sweep work?** I understand the purpose and intent, but how do I actually do it? I saw people did that in their note-taking apps, not their to-do list apps, so I really just don't know how to do that. I have seen this [trigger list](https://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf), and I will definitely use it—but I first need to figure out how the mind-sweep works. I don't understand the format exactly, and even if there are no specific rules, I would love guidance to how other people do it. If somebody could send me a screenshot of their own mind-sweep, that would be really helpful because I just don't know how to do it exactly.
2. **What apps do people use for GTD?** I currently have Evernote, but I have been a bit frustrated with their extremely weak iPad app (our school runs on iPads), increasing prices, and lack of support for highschool students and students in general. I have used it for school since 2013, and I started using it for my personal things just last year. Since then, I have been testing other apps to see which one I could replace it with. It is about to expire in a couple weeks, and I'm not going to renew it until I either have to or decide that I want to use Evernote for everything. Along with Evernote, I use Bear to write (I enjoy writing), and I use Things/Todoist for tasks (I have included images of all four apps). I am open to hearing what apps other people use and hopefully find something that works for me. Price is not a very big issue, as long as I find the best app(s). If somebody still believes Evernote is the best app, then feel free to make your case.
3. **How often do you empty your inbox?** Using Things/Todoist, the inbox has been a great feature, even though I have actually had a hard time getting used to it. I have used it occasionally when I am in a big rush, but I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I always love to put my tasks where they belong as soon as possible. I have a recurring task, every day, to purge my task manager's inbox. I have been noticing that people do their weekly check-up (or whatever you call it)—and for me, it seems just a little bit too long to wait to clear my inbox.
4. **How do I implement GTD into my life?** With all of the different things I do and all of the quick tasks I have, how do I implement GTD? I understand what GTD is, the main parts of GTD, and why people use GTD, but I have been having such a hard time figuring out how to put it into my everyday life... When I sit down for my weekly check-up, what do I do then? These are just dumb questions I can't figure out. I think getting some advice and insight in how to implement GTD for myself could really help.
5. **Do you believe GTD could help me?** As I said, I am very busy, and I feel overwhelmed. I have ADHD, many things going on, etc. I believe it could help me, but I would love some outside advice.
6. **How do you implement GTD?** I am really interested in learning how other people use GTD for themselves. I don't know too much about it—not enough to get started yet. I believe it could help me (let me know what you think), so I just want to, at least, try it. I'm looking to learn what apps you use, how you do your mind-sweep, *exactly* what you do during your weekly check-up, and more. I know these are all such basic questions, but I hope I can find some guidance in order to try GTD for myself.

I think I have covered just about anything. Please let me know if there is anything else I should know—even if I didn't ask (maybe I forgot). Thank you so much!

Here are the images of each of my applications that I was taking about:

I've never been a violent person, in fact I'm rather calm. A few days ago - like 2 weeks or so -, I had to stop taking my antidepressants (anafranil  - clomipramine) because I lost the prescription paper made by my therapist.


I know it sucks, but I'm on an internship 2 hours away from where I live. My therapist only works during the week, so even if I come home on the week-end I can't see her. So I guess for the next two months I'm fucked and I have to live without antidepressants.


Anyway. These last days, I've been feeling a LOT of emotions. When I come back to my shitty apartment, I cry a lot and I just want to ~~die~~ go to sleep.

I've become more and more violent. When I'm looking at stuff online and a page doesn't load, I punch the wall. I seriously hurt myself doing this, but it's stronger than me, I can't prevent it. I've picked up the habit of punching myself in the jaw, too. Not hard enough to make me bleed but pretty hard. I know this sucks and I have to stop it, but it's stronger than me.

A mosquito flies close to my face? I punch myself. My computer has a bug and shuts down? I yell really loud (curse words) and punch the wall. My phone stops working? I throw it to the other side of the room. It's been two weeks since I'm like this and I'm getting more and more concerned.

This week-end, I managed to keep calm and when I wanted to punch myself or a nearby thing, I just collapsed on my bed and cried.

However, today I'm back at work and everything pisses me off. My dumb coworkers, my asshole boss, my code which doesn't work. I heard myself whisper ""FUCK!"" out loud when my code had a bug, and my coworker gave a quick glance at me. I'm fucked. It's getting harder and harder to prevent myself from becoming violent. I don't want this.


What can I do? And don't tell me to smoke weed."

First of all, english is my second language so, sorry for my mistakes :-).  
I will start at how i was feeling before and then what makes me need help.

When  i started 2nd year of high school i was pretty much a succesfull 17y.o.  guy, atleast for my standards... i was a gym junkie and actually pretty  buff (i was really skinny before so ppl noticed and said so), great  caring family, had a girlfriend and a bunch of great friends, also had  really good marks at school, bunch of hobbies learning programming and  hitting the gym as well as other sports, reading books, spending time w  family and whatnot.  
(I dont want this to be taken as braging, i was  pretty shi\*ty person before all of this so im kinda proud, but i dont  want anybody to feel like i want to put someone down or brag :-)  
I was like this way before high school, but around this time it all changed.

Around the mid of 2nd year of high school i started to be a totally different person, just like that for no reason,  
i started smoking;  
purposely started fights with my gf to the point she given up being w me;  
stoped going to the gym;  
started to eat less, but drink (alco) way more;  
told  myself i dont need all my friends and so i started to come up with some  excuses not to meet them like ""having no time cus of work"" etc.;  
actually have no time because i didnt wanted to do my work and started to procrastinate;  
abandoned  all my hobbies, so now i feel ashamed whenever i go around the gym i  used to go to bcs now im even skinnier than before;  
started getting bad marks at school and couldnt care less;  
it  eventually got to the point where i started to self harm myself not  just physically but also mentally (telling myself how bad i am every  day);  
also lost my programming internship at a well respected company;  
started to hate my family for caring of me, i dont talk to them anymore.

All  i do today is a shitty part time job that i hate, drink booze with fake  friends at weekends and just overall wasting my life.

Pretty fast downhill ride id say.

Long story short, i just came from bottom to top and then even lower than i was before.  
Now,  what i need an advice for is.. since i got no friends... what should i  do that could help me get my shit together, or at least to give me  enough motivation to start doing so?

(and  no, go talk to my parents/friends is not really an option here, i need  something that i alone could do because i dont like attention and  bothering other people w my problems)"
8xc9te,13,2018-07-09,Introducing your SB/SD to your friends?,LongTimeSugarAddict,sugarlifestyleforum,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/8xc9te/introducing_your_sbsd_to_your_friends/,"A few days ago I brought K, a new SB,  to a friend's birthday dinner.  It was the first time she had met any of my friends.  K is an aspiring journalist, she has a recent degree in journalism from a good school, and has done an internship at a prestigious organization resulting in several articles published on their website.  Currently however she's waiting tables and applying for new opportunities.  The people at the party are all card-carrying members of the elite:  Ivy League educations, enviable careers and prospects.  In particular, I wanted to introduce K to L, a young woman at the dinner who is also a journalist.  They are about the same age, but L is already on the fast track to success.  The dinner turned out well,  L approached K at the end and gave K her email address, other people at the dinner later contacted me to say they enjoyed meeting K, invited us to have dinner together at their homes, etc.

I have done this with SBs many times in the past.  Mostly they have gone well.  Once even went exceptionally well - at first.  N was in a similar situation to K, but her passion was for the theater.  I introduced N to friends who were connected to a regional theater company.  They loved her, got her a job with the theater company, which N loved.  In the meantime my SR with N fizzled out, but we were still good friends.  Unfortunately N eventually ended up crashing out spectacularly at the theater company, caused quite a scandal it seems, and some people blamed me for introducing her to them.  Oh well!

How about you, gentle SLF readers?   Any experiences with introducing your SB/SD into your social circle?  In particular, when there might be an opportunity for the SB to advance their career, though purely social situations are interesting too.    Words of advice?"

She’s gone a while without set, and on most of her sets she likes to have some fun. She tries to find someone to have that fun with, and eventually deciding on your character.

You can be anything from a young intern, an older producer, a middle aged cameraman, or anything in between. I also like the idea of your character not being perfectly handsome, maybe average or a bit below average, the celebrity just wanting someone to have a good time with. 

If you want I’m willing to play yep ladies who look for someone to have fun with together, but I’d also love if you played two guys that the celebrity decides to have fun with. 

Kinks involved are anal, spanking, rough, sloppy oral, dp, group, light drug use (just weed), dirty talk and unique positions (Eiffel tower, Piledriver, against the wall, one leg standing, held up, etc.)

Limits are blood, gore, scat, piss, bestiality, noncon and impregnation

Below is the list of celebrities I'm willing to play. At the top of the list however is **Rosario Dawson**, **Tessa Thompson** and **Evangeline Lilly**:

Alice Eve, Anna Kendrick, Charlize Theron, Rachel Bloom, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain, Isla Fisher, Christina Hendricks, Emilia Clarke, Rose Leslie, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams, Kate Upton, Daisy Ridley, Felicity Jones, Emma Watson, Gal Gadot, Elizabeth Olsen, Scarlett Johansson, Hilary Duff, Hayden Panettiere, Kristen Bell, Morena Baccarin, Margot Robbie, Cara Delivigne, Gillian Jacobs, Alison Brie, Reese Witherspoon, Emily Blunt, Olivia Wilde, and Rachel McAdams

8xcp08,0,2018-07-09,Questions regarding credit score and credit card payments,theif519,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8xcp08/questions_regarding_credit_score_and_credit_card/,"I'm wondering if anyone can answer some questions about the relation between credit card score and credit card payments. Now, my credit score was 718 but it has dropped to 676 in the span of two months. I've heard that credit companies report monthly balance once a month, but I'm afraid that the time in which they do so is problematic for me. 

I have $3,000 worth of credit, and I have an internship in Seattle for a few months,  and the rent I'm paying through AirBNB is literally half that (this month it was $1,600) for a private room, shared everything else. The issue is that it seems that they seem to report my balance around the same time I have to pay rent... I can't even add money to the pending charges in advance since it exceeds 110% of my credit limit. 

So, even though I try to pay it off in full ASAP, I'm not fast enough as it takes days for the pending charge to go through and then another day for my payment to be posted. Hence having &lt;50% credit balance seems to take its toll heavily on my credit score? 

Is there anything I can do to alleviate this? How long will it take to recover? I'm a bit concerned that this could have a long term impact for me as I need to apply for housing soon as I'll be starting my PhD program in the Fall, so I'd hate to be denied due to having 'bad credit' (although that brings up the question: how low does my credit score need to be to be considered 'bad' and to warrant denial of tenancy?)

Any information and advice would be helpful!"

I am getting a bachelors in Computer Science and want to get a job in the tech industry out there and I have a brother who is currently working as a programmer out in LA without a degree in Computer Science (he did a coding bootcamp from an accredited education service) which makes the move a lot less scary since I have a brother who lives in LA and has a job in the general career field I want to go into with less education than myself.   


I am currently living with my parents rent free and am wanting to possibly move to LA next summer or next fall, giving myself time to save money over the summer in 2019 if I have to. I currently have a job as an IT intern paying \~$1700 a month after taxes but that job will be ending in August when I go back to college since I will be in a different city for college and will be picking up a part time job that will be paying around \~$1000/month after taxes. My parents cover most of my expenses (which I am incredibly grateful for) but this will end when I graduate from college. So I'll be picking up car insurance, phone bill, and if I leave New Orleans I'll have to pay rent obviously but it is totally an option to stay with my parents a while after I graduate for free or for a greatly reduced rent.  


So I'm basically here to ask how exactly to prepare for taking on the added bills and wanting to move out to a different state with a higher cost of living at the same time. What should I be doing now in terms of saving and what should I be expecting when moving to a different state? Should I go out there and then look for a job or find a job out there then move? I just am not exactly sure how to go about this. Idk how much information y'all need from me but feel free to ask for more info and ill provide what I can."
8xe3kf,27,2018-07-09,Green Queen manipulates her 90-year-old mother,TyrionTheHotK,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8xe3kf/green_queen_manipulates_her_90yearold_mother/,"If you can't tell by the title, this is what I consider to be Green Queen's moral low point. This came a year before she tried to enmesh me, and long before the true abuse started. It was a giant red flag of the evils she would sink to in order to get what she wanted.

That day, Green Queen and I fought over college. I wanted to go to NSFFA, while Green Queen wanted me to go to State University. State University had a lot of kids from my high school going. **I didn't want to go in-state because it would essentially be a continuation of the disability condescension I received.** In short, I wanted to be judged on me, not Asperger's.

The sparring over where I would go to college ended, and I went to Not-So-Far, Far, Away. Green Queen got her job, and I was breaking free from my overbearing parents. I made a large amount of acquaintances, and I was doing well in school – even considering my “bullshit electives”. I would spend the first year of my high school making a new life with my new friends. **I broke out of my shell, and was doing better than I had been since sixth grade.**

Green Queen had other plans. As I said before, she felt I needed a “real job” in food service. Not just any job: it had to be food service. **Whether it be a cashier, a busser, or a short-order cook, I needed the “life skills food service taught” or I would “never succeed in life”.** Apparently my internship, which involved face-to-face and over-the-phone communication, did not teach those skills well enough to be a “real job”. We debated this, with an occasional bite whenever she said I would never succeed or my internship wasn't a “real job”. **I saw her argument as controlling where I worked, devaluing the work I did, or outright insulting me.**

I won out on the NSFFA question, and I went to school. Not knowing what my workload would be, I didn't get a job that semester (to my mother's chagrin). My mother called me every month to pester me, but because I was so far away, I could just hang up the phone. And then, I went home. Summer started, and the fights kickstarted again. Things got rather ugly around the house, considering she insisted I would never succeed.

One summer day, my mother woke me up at around 8:30. She wanted me to go to Dear Grandmother's apartment to pick up her check for my college. **She thought it was important that I be there for it because I needed to thank her for supporting me.** I wasn't opposed to this. I love my grandmother, and I know she would give her life for her grandchildren. By far, I had the most history with Dear Grandmother. She babysat me, and I paid her back by helping her in her life. I had no car and I had nothing else to do, so I decided that I might as well help her.

I marched up the familiar steps to her apartment in assisted living. I usually went over to help Green Queen out, cleaning her apartment while my mother did the dirty work with DGM. We sat down in her chairs, made some small talk, and talked a bit about college. Thankfully, I was doing well in school, and I started to get over the mental block. **My mind was refreshed, so I thought nothing of it.** At least until DGM gave me my check and a speech.

“There are two conditions for this check. First, you need to have a 3.0 GPA or higher. I'm so glad you're doing well in school, and I know you can keep this up.”

“Thanks, DGM. I love you.”

**“Secondly, you need to get a job down there.”**

As soon as I heard those words, the speech stank to high fucking heaven. At least she didn't pontificate about where I should work, but it still seemed artificial to me. She gave a speech about how work built character, and that getting a job would help me become self-sufficient. **The problem with this was that before this, DGM never asked about my work life.** Normally, she was just proud that I was doing better than I ever did in school. This wasn't my grandmother's way. Not at all.

The anger had reached its boiling point. **It was very clear why Green Queen insisted I go here today to pick up the check myself.** I gave her a nod, thanked her, agreed to the conditions, and took the check. After everything was done, my mother looked at me and DGM and said,

**“Well if we can't afford it, there's always State University.”**

It took every ounce of strength in my body to keep my cool. Dear Grandmother was the only reason why I didn't rip Green Queen's throat out on the spot. She was in assisted living, which would have alerted the nurses and disturbed all the other residents. In reality, my grandma was there, and I didn't want to distress the one woman at home who cared about me. When we left, I gave DGM a kiss and a hug goodbye, stormed out of her room, fifty feet ahead of my mother, and crossed my arms while waiting for my mother to unlock the car.

The moment we stepped in the car, I sunk to the darkest point of my heart. **The only time I had ever sunk to this point was whenever she called me a retard.** A conflict-averse woman was suddenly intervening in a conflict between me and my mother. And after her speech, Green Queen decided to add on that we could always go to her hand-picked dream school if “we couldn't afford it”. My mother knew exactly what the fuck she was doing, and I utterly lost my shit.

“REALLY? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?”

“What? Is this ab-”

“YOU FUCKING MANIPULATED DGM? **ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME**?”

“Fuck no! I didn't do anything! I just wanted you to understand the terms of her helping us!”

“BULLSHIT. YOU USED HER FOR YOUR AGENDA. YOU WANT ME TO GO TO FUCKING STATE UNIVERSITY. YOU ALWAYS FUCKING WANTED ME TO GO THERE.”

“I was just saying... it'd be chea-”

“I'VE GROWN. I HAVE A 3.0. I'M NOT AFFECTED BY MY ANXIETY. I'VE DONE INCREDIBLY, I'VE MADE FRIENDS. AND YOU WANT TO RIP ALL OF THAT AWAY OVER *GREEN PIECES OF FUCKING PAPER*?!”

“Fuck no! I just want you to get a jo-”

“THAT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT. YOU JUST FUCKING THREATENED TO PULL ME OUT OF SCHOOL.”

“How? How did I threaten you?”

I continued to rage, wildly gesticulating and using air-quotes.

“AFTER THAT FUCKING SPEECH ABOUT HOW I NEED TO FUCKING WORK, YOU JUST FUCKING SAID “Well if we can't pay, there's always State University.” RIGHT AFTER “DGM” TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GET A JOB TO GET HER HELP. THAT'S A FUCKING THREAT.”

“I never ma-”

“*YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU DID*. I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO TO NSFFA. YOU NEVER WANTED ME TO GO THERE. AND IF YOU PULL ME OUT, YOU'LL NEVER FUCKING SEE ME AGAIN.”

“We might not be able to afford it! I swear to God!”

“**BULLSHIT! FUCKING BULLSHIT!** YOU HAD NO FUCKING PROBLEM AFFORDING IT BEFORE. YOU HAD NO FUCKING PROBLEM PUSHING ME TO FUCKING BIG STATE UNIVERSITY FOR FIVE FUCKING YEARS AND THAT FUCKING COST MORE.”

“Something mi-”

“THE ONLY FUCKING THING THAT CAME UP WAS ***YOU***.”

For the first time in my life, Green Queen was paralyzed in fear. She didn't fly into a rage or cry about how she would never do something like that. She was desperately trying to prove her innocence. **The facts of the case spelled it out for me: she knew exactly what she was trying to do.** 

I immediately told my dad when I got home, and he lost it. They got into a fight, Green Queen left to go get high, and we reached an uneasy peace in the house. That summer, I still wound up going off to NSFFA State University. **And that fall, I got a job. Not for Green Queen's sake, but for my own.** A girl with Asperger's in my class needed someone to take notes. I wanted to make a difference in this world. I stepped up to the plate. I became her tutor, and she paid me out-of-pocket. I helped her grow as a student. She helped me grow as a human being. We still keep in touch, and we still are good friends. I might actually use her as a reference for when I get the career I wanted to get.

**I never heard a peep from her about her opposition to Not-So-Far, Far Away after DF's intervention.** In fact, when things started to deteriorate between me and her, she welcomed me going away because it would “get me out of the house”. Every time I would come home, she would ask “when I was going back” or “if I could stay down with Dear Aunt in NSFFA next time.”

**It turns out that DGM always had that stipulation with all of her grandkids.** She would help out if they did well enough and they got a job while in school. Her reasoning was sound, after all: she wanted us to know the values of work. **I asked one of my cousins about it, and she never got that speech.** DGM didn't push me getting a job during my gap year or the summer of sophomore year (the years after the ones I actually worked). The summer of junior year, she never gave me a speech either. She never would have taken such decisive action without another person behind the strings. And I never forgave her puppeteer for it.

Green Queen's laundry list is as long as War and Peace. She had used my autism for her personal gain. She used it to belittle me, to degrade me, and to do horrible things to me. She had stolen luggage and a $300 camera from me. She had used me as a punching bag for my dad's divorce. She trampled over my boundaries. She tried to force me to listen to her, nearly closing my laptop on my fingers and yanking my headphones out. She stole my ice cream and verbally abused me because I told her not to touch it. Against my wishes, she made my struggles in high school and battle with anxiety public to “motivate me”. **This incident is what I consider to be Green Queen's nadir: using a 90-year-old woman to threaten to tear her son from the cocoon he was building.**

Looking back, this was only a warning sign of things to come. She would soon wean herself off of her medication, replacing it with marijuana. Her instability only worsened. **Thankfully, the tough times have passed for good.** She took up raging at me after my parents' marriage fell apart. The consequences of that were me going no-contact. **I tell my new friends I don't have a mother, because Green Queen sure as hell hasn't earned that title.**

tl;dr: Green Queen wants me to “get a job in food service.” Her idea of motivation is to use my grandmother to threaten me via putting me in an in-state school. I lose it, harder than I've ever lost it."

Charli XCX may not have the same dominance as Drake with the general public but she sure does here in the Popheads community! Topping this week's Hot 50 is 'No Angel', jumping 17 spots to #1 on its second week, making it the biggest gain of the week. Following it is 'Focus' at #2. '5 in the Morning' returns to the top ten at #9.

Charli is not the only artist with new music as fellow British artist Florence + The Machine released their new album *High as Hope*. They have four songs in the top ten with 'Hunger' reaching its new peak at #3 as it re-entered the Hot 50 as the highest re-entry. Following 'Hunger' is 'South London Forever' (#5) as this week's highest debut, 'June' (#6) and 'The End of Love' (#8).

Despite the Drake Mania happening right now in the public with the release of his new album *Scorpion*, only two of the songs chart in the top ten in the Hot 50. 'Don't Matter to Me' which features the late Michael Jackson debuts at #7 while 'Summer Games' debuts at the bottom of the top ten.

Ariana Grande remains firm in the top ten despite a huge wave of new music coming out as 'the light is coming' charts at #4 on its third week. Unfortunately for Demi Lovato, her heartbreaking single 'Sober' takes this week's biggest decline, losing 47 spots to #49. Popheads hates ballads confirmed!

* **Highest Debut:** #5. Florence + The Machine - South London Forever	
* **Highest Re-Entry:** #3. Florence + The Machine - Hunger
* **Biggest Gain:** #1. Charli XCX - No Angel (+17)
* **Biggest Decline:** #49. Demi Lovato - Sober (-47)

##How The Chart Works:

These charts are created based on how frequently each song appears in the top 10 songs/albums for all of the users signed up for the chart. If the song or album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two songs are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple songs tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.

My cousin has an internship in Vegas so I figured I'd fly out and go to some games. I wound up only going Friday since I blew $200 gambling and tried to be fiscally responsible for the rest of the trip. 

I sat near some awesome Nuggets fans who were leading the pro Vlatko Cancar chants, I am not great in crowds so my participation was somewhat lacking. However, their chants were so exuberant they got shouted out on twitter! 

I was ~10 feet away from John Wall whose body guard had to sit behind him holding his Gucci Handbag (lets be real, it was a man-purse), a somewhat comical job.

Then in the Nuggets vs Timberwolves game, Will Barton, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray, Trey Lyles and Torrey Craig were all at some point sitting court-side to support the team https://i.imgur.com/mS6Q2bn.jpg .

When Jamal Murray walked past my section he was about 3 feet away from me and I gave him a thumbs up and nervously said ""You rock man!""... he didn't acknowledge me... still an awesome guy! All the players were signing autographs for the kids.

The next day my cousin and I snuck into the Wynn to use their pool and afterwards we saw Trey Lyles and Torrey Craig walking through the casino but after what happened with Jamal Murray, we decided to appreciate them from afar haha.

All in all it was an awesome experience, only downside is that Vegas is hotter than Alexandra Daddario, Emma Watson and Alsion Brie combined.

10/10 would go again.

And to the Nuggets fans I saw there, Cheers guys! "

I graduated from an actuarial science program in May. I graduated with a 3.9+ GPA and two exams passed. I switched to actuarial science from a liberal arts major about halfway through my undergraduate experience. I applied for several internships each semester, but just never got an offer. 

Skills:
-Python basics
-Intermediate Excel
-Some experience with SAS and R

My current situation: 
I am a recent graduate with no experience. I have applied for (probably) over 80 jobs in the last two months. I have had a couple of final round interviews, but despite being told I interview well both times, I still do not have a job offer. I am becoming a little frustrated. 

My questions:
1) I have been applying exclusively for entry-level actuarial positions. What other roles should I be applying for?

2) What ways can I improve my skillset? I have been bettering my Excel skills through online tutorials, but would like to find a way to gain more practical experience with Excel. I would like to start learning SQL and am wondering if anyone knows of any sources that could assist me. Any other tips are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!

8xf3jv,51,2018-07-09,Thoughts and Theories based on Spinner's relevance to the plot.,PraxMatic,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8xf3jv/thoughts_and_theories_based_on_spinners_relevance/,"Now, before I get the “he’s a side villain, so who cares” shpeal (unless you actually do want to hear this), I want to clarify **I have no concrete, definitive evidence for my any of speculation here.** That said, I have a few things to mention before I say what I think he could do to develop the plot as a whole.

First, despite it being commonly assumed, no one actually knows what Spinner’s quirk is. Which is an oddity, because if it were as simple as it seems it feels like it would have been clarified, but it never was. Personally, it would be lame for him to have just a simple lizard mutant quirk, although that's obviously not my decision as a reader. I just feel it's a bit more nuanced than it seems.

Secondly, the fact that Spinner has had the least time to shine among all of the CURRENT members of the LoV (excluding Giran and Giganto-machia) doesn't match up with how Horikoshi has written up until this point. In terms of actual story and personality, he's practically identical to both Moonfish and Mustard, both villains who were apprehended during the Summer Camp arc. There is currently no real reason as to why Spinner is even in the story anymore, and I believe that if he hadn't shown up in the Internship arc 'Highway' chapter, most fans would have completely forgot he existed. If Spinner really has no relevance to the plot, he would've been arrested at the Camp, but the fact that he escaped indicates to me that he isn't done quite yet.

Third, it's very clear that Spinner and the LoV have entirely different motivation from one another. Spinner joined the LoV because he believed they planned to carry out Stain's ideals, and it is becoming clearer to him (and to us) that that was never the case. In the same chapter he appeared he visibly is uncomfortable with what the League is doing, and what Shigaraki is planning especially. Conflicts of interest with Shigaraki, although not yet seen fully in the manga, would presumably result very, very poorly for Spinner.

Fourth, and the most obvious idea for anyone who believes Spinner has more importance than he seems, is his action to save Midoriya during the Summer Camp. This is again a sign of Spinner disregarding ""Shigaraki's personal desire"" to carry out his ideals. With Magne out of the picture, it's believable that Shigaraki never found out about this incident. As well, the fact that Midoriya never mentioned after the fact that Spinner willingly stopped another villain from doing harm to him is strange, because it could've been an interesting point to stop and contemplate on.

Those are my general ideas that contribute to my suspicion that Spinner will be more relevant in the future than he is now. Now that our bases are covered, here are my possible theories as to what he could do to switch things up-

**Spinner betrays the LoV, becomes Anti-Villain:** Due to the conflicts of interest between Spinner and the LoV, Spinner starts to give insider information to other groups (and perhaps even Midoriya himself later on) to seek revenge for the corruption of Stain's ideals. Does not directly work with Heroes, and possibly would never be accredited for his actions. I feel like this is the likeliest path for Spinner to take because of his prior stated convictions. Among all the people brought to the LoV after Stain's arrest, Spinner was the only one who joined to carry out Stain's ideals rather than his actions.

**Spinner deserts the LoV, becomes anti-hero:** Instead of betraying the LoV, Spinner ditches town and attempts to carry out the fragments of Stain's will himself. Another likely option, but I'm not much of a fan of this theory because it would make him even more of a ""Discount Stain."" This route sets him on a path to fail both in actuality (in context of Stain's actions) and in a writing sense, because he would be almost an objectively worse rehash of one of the best villains of the series.

**Spinner and Stain work together (assumed prison break AU):** If a Prison Break arc does actually occur, then this would shoot up to my most likely theory. During the chaos, Spinner escapes with Stain from Tartarus in order to finish his duties. Despite Stain being a loner (and likely having no idea who Spinner is), it seems too unrealistic for Spinner to not at least try to work with Stain if a prison break occurs.

**Spinner assassinates (Insert):** Despite Toga being proven to be an effective and lethal stealth/undercover operative, I get an unshakable feeling that this would be something right up Spinner's alley. Depending on who he ousted, the story could drastically shift or just have a minor depression. Either way, Spinner would have a purpose.

**Spinner works with the Heroes:** Clearly, the least likely outcome. Considering he assuredly has multiple aggravated assault cases on several pro heroes, the idea that Spinner would turn himself in and help the Heroes is slim to none. The likelier scenario is that Spinner would be easier to break during an interrogation should he be arrested, due to his conflicts with the league.

Those are my theories on how Spinner, a current relatively minor character, could change the story in a way that justifies his existence. Please share your ideas (or if you vehemently disagree with one of mine), because I don't think we could ever have enough discussion about Spinner considering how little he's ever had the chance to have."
8xfdu3,38,2018-07-09,A undercover cop bent over backwards to help me further my job and career opportunities.,AkAmpZ,HumansBeingBros,https://www.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/8xfdu3/a_undercover_cop_bent_over_backwards_to_help_me/,"TL;DR at bottom



A little background: I did some time in the army and have combat tours under my belt (2010-2015). I finish my BA in CJ (criminal justice) this coming spring (2019). My ambition is obviously the law enforcement field. 27 year old male in a northern state.

So recently this past Friday we have had undercover officers (I’ll refer to them as UC) using a pull out in our driveway to watch a drug house down the road. I talked to the previous  UC last week and a new one this last Friday. I filled the first one in on my background etc after I mentioned my dad was LE with them (he actually use to do what they are doing before moving up to SWAT and now being a instructor at the academy). They knew him well (small town). So as I’m walking up to talk to the second UC I haven’t seen before he says “you must be ——‘s boy” to which I replied “that’s me”. So we get to chatting and I tell him that I’m looking to snag a internship with the ATF through my university and my professor reached out to me as soon as he heard about it to ask if I would be interested because having a specific student in mind makes it easier. I replied yes!  Well low and behold this UC’s buddy is a head agent over at the ATF who is also going to be running the internship! So the UC and I  exchange personal contact info in case I have any questions for him to pass along and to also keep him updated. 

At this point I’m super excited! He (UC) asks what I’m doing for work and I mention I applied to the local hospital for their security officer position. He (UC) than goes onto say he knows the security director at the hospital and that he trained him and he owes him a “BIG favor”. I enthusiastically say how awesome followed by a question regarding their requirements. They require 3 years security experience OR 2 years security experience in a healthcare setting OR 1 year as a police officer/corrections officer. I tell him I’m unsure how they define the 3 years experience although I was infantry, have a combat tour, and worked on a PSD (personal security detachment) team. He ensure I’m more then fine. So we tie up the conversation so he can get back to watching the drug house.  

Following day: I shoot a text to the UC from yesterday about some info I got about the work (ballistic system tracking bullets/shells used in crimes) the internship would being doing at the ATF and was looking for some info/clarification.  He said “I’m not sure, let me call a buddy”. He then calls me back and says he filled in the guy at ATF about me and exchanged my contact Info with him and he would be calling me Monday or Tuesday. He also mentioned that his ATF buddy would put me at the top of his list for the intern program! After the UC fills me in he then says he was gonna call the director of security at the hospital for me. He makes the call and shoots me a text saying the director would be in touch. 30 minutes later the director of security calls and says “I heard you might be interested in working for us?” I excitingly reply yes! So he gets a brief overview of my background/experience from my end as I assume he was also filled in by the UC because he makes remarks about my step dad and the UC. I told him my earlier application was “denied” after waiting a month and not hearing anything and he said they just reposted the job and asked if I had reapplied which I did. He goes on to say that they are going to have some K9 positions opening up in early 2019 and asked if I would be interested, another excited yes reply from me. So he mentions it’s nice to know that I’m “cut from the same cloth?” as my step dad who has been a local cop for 22 years and another that’s calling and vouching for me. So he says I’ll pull your application, pass it down to the recruiter and get you in for a interview this week. 


Phew, sorry for the wall of text but this has been one of the best “job” related things to happen to me since I got out of active duty in 2015. Previously I was just applying to places and waiting out my fate. This UC bent over backwards for me after a simple 20-30 minute conversation next to my driveway and did more for me than I could ever ask for. This was all so unexpected. 

I just wanted to share this story as I don’t have many “friends” or people I can lean on to share good or bad life stories with. I hope If you have time to read this you find a little joy from it because it has shined a bright light on the darkness that has been following me since my grandmother passed away last fall who was also legally my “mom”. 


TL;DR: Veteran hunting for security jobs, local police are watching a drug house a couple blocks down using our driveway pullout as a staging ground. Chat with undercover who knows my step dad very well, makes some calls to their “buddies” for both the security job at the local hospital I applied to and the internship at ATF that I’m interested in through my University. Basically fast tracks me to help and better prepare me so I have better chance of being selected for the internship and also getting me in for a interview at the hospital.

8xfra0,12,2018-07-09,"F/20/US Anyone wanna be friends? :D I’m not a gamer or into anime. Interests: psychology, philosophy, reading, tennis, volleyball, deep conversations, learning new things, Journalism, taking photos of EVERYTHING with my phone, dogs",somethingwithketchup,Needafriend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/8xfra0/f20us_anyone_wanna_be_friends_d_im_not_a_gamer_or/,"Hey everyone!! Just looking for someone cool to talk to :) it’d be super cool to have a friend from a foreign country, but also anywhere in the US! I’m looking to talk to people around my age or older, but still anyone can still feel free to message me. 

I’m originally from the Midwest, I’m in college, and I just moved to a city for an internship at a psychology lab for the summer and trying to meet new people because I’m new to the area and don’t know many people. 

I had a recent phone call with a friend and we talked about everything from how philosophy (teachings of Aristotle, Plato, Socrates) has so many ties to the modern world (with morality and advancing technology like self-driving cars and CRISPR, or how the modern education system is based on Plato’s Academy) to how we can both sense when there’s something “off” about people (like people who are always nice and have never done anything to prove that they’re anything other than nice, yet something always feels off), to how we both have no idea what we want to do as careers in the future but we both know we want to change the world and be passionate about whatever we’re doing and invent things and be surrounded by similar minded people, to how it’s so hard to meet people in real life and make new friends or approach strangers, and I just realized that I want more friends to have these random deep conversations with! I’m willing to talk about anything, from the news to politics to psychology to cultures in different countries. Also, I'm the kind of person who doesn't really like holding conversations with my friends over text/messaging, and would rather call/facetime/meet up in person (but of course this is the internet, so I don't know if I would wanna call someone/I would probably want to start getting to know someone over messages lol).

Some things about me: I love playing volleyball and tennis, although it’s been a while since I’ve played either, but I hope I can get into it again soon. I also love swimming- I swam for a few years in school, and also swam competitively for a few years when I was really really young. I love love reading but can never seem to find the time during the school year to read for pleasure, but I pick it up in the summers and rediscover my love for reading each summer. I also have 2 dogs! And I absolutely love love love dogs so much. In the process of reading The Goldfinch, The Secret History, Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations, and When Breath Becomes Air. My favorite book has to be “On the Shortness of Life” by Seneca, which I read last year. I’m an INTJ for those of you who understand Meyers-Briggs, and I’m kinda shy and I like my alone time, but I can definitely talk to people and have really good conversations with anyone I meet, if they’re willing, and I’m always trying to come out of my shell more and be more outgoing and open to new experiences.

Also, like my title says, I’m not a gamer and I don’t really like anime, but I’m totally fine with meeting someone who is. I’m also really interested in journalism, although I don’t think I’d want a career as a reporter, I just like writing. I’ve never considered myself good at writing, and actually I was pretty bad at writing before the age of 14, but then I started getting better and better at writing by writing for classes as well as for the school newspaper so now I’d consider myself a pretty confident, strong writer. I love reading poetry and I'd like to learn/get into writing poetry, but I'm definitely very inexperienced with writing poetry haha. I really like writing journalistic news ish articles though, and I'm good at writing essays for english and philosophy classes. I love journaling, or rather I always love reading journals I wrote from years ago, but I always like to be really detailed when writing a journal entry, so I never end up keeping up with writing a journal because it takes too long to write one entry so I just end up stopping...heh. My favorite TV show is Mr. Robot, and I’m currently watching Kiss Me First on Netflix. I like Marvel movies, but I’m definitely not a hard core comic nerd. I also really like Harry Potter, reading and watching the movies! I just watched Ant-man and the Wasp and now I really wanna learn about quantum physics...and lol I saw the tardigrades in the film and I was like OMG TARDIGRADES!!! I KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE! Shows I’ve watched recently are: Sense8, space documentaries, Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, 13 Reasons Why, Black Mirror, New Girl (although I don’t typically like sitcoms, like Modern Family, The Office, Parks and Rec etc. I also don’t typically like adult cartoon shows like Rick &amp; Morty or Bojack Horseman), all the Marvel Netflix shows, White Collar, Dear White People, Netflix’s Vox “Explained,” Altered Carbon, Sherlock, Ozark. I listen to pop music (I know...I’m basic...) but also a lot of alternative music (really, just what ever Spotify suggests and thinks I’ll like).

I’m also really interested in learning about cultures in other countries! I love learning languages and I hope to become fluent in one or more languages in the future! I’ve learned Spanish for about 4 years in school, but I never paid much attention or put in effort or liked it, because I was learning it in school, but I feel like I wasted that opportunity, but I’d love to learn it on my own sometime. A few months ago I was really interested in learning Arabic, so I learned the alphabet, but didn’t get much further because it’s hard to find things online to learn Arabic (I hope to maybe be fluent one day in Egyptian Arabic?). I also have learned a little bit of French on Duolingo. I can speak one other language besides English. 

I’m the “mom” of all of my friend groups. I actually just made this Reddit account last night for the sole purpose of posting here, and this is my first time posting on reddit as well as my first time turning to the internet to find friends, so fingers crossed it goes well! Since I’m in a new city for this summer, I’ve thought about downloading dating apps or friend-meeting apps like Tinder or Bumble, but I realized that those aren’t the kinds of people I’m looking to meet. I’m also in popular College area of the city, and I’ve thought about going to parties to meet people, but I’ve also realized that most of the people that go to these parties (where the main activities consist of several people playing beer pong and yelling drunkenly and the rest of the people sitting around looking at their phones) are not people I would want to be long-term friends with. 

Welp, this ended up being way longer than I thought it would be....it was just like stream of consciousness writing....but that’s a little bit about me, so if you’ve read this far hopefully we have some similar interests or at least you find me interesting and would wanna try and be friends? Send me a message and we can go from there!!"

8xg7sp,36,2018-07-09,Child Abuse in an Asian American household,reigningcats,asianamerican,https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/8xg7sp/child_abuse_in_an_asian_american_household/,"This is a topic that I believe is not talked enough about or even really well known to the general population. Asian parents, through psychological research have been known to raise their children in an authoritative manner which leads to a lot of mental issues later on in life. They have high expectations for their children, are very controlling, and at times I believe are extremely abusive and damaging towards their childrens' self esteem. I wanted to create a post in hope that someone else out there can relate to my experiences as a child, and even share theirs.

Just a little background about myself, I'm a female 1.5 generation Korean immigrant whose parents moved here when they were in their pre-teen years. My parents were extremely poor growing up, got a college education and ended up becoming very successful in their careers to the point where we were categorized as upper middle class citizens. I grew up in an extremely white community where I was one of the two Asians in my entire elementary school. I realized pretty quickly during my childhood that my parents were much stricter than my fellow white peers. I realize now in the present that the experiences I had as a child have affected me in ways I could have never imagined, bordering on abusive.

Education was first and foremost prioritized above any of my needs as a child, including my happiness. I was also the youngest of my grade, because my mom believed that putting me through hardships by starting kindergarten at the age of four would somehow make me stronger and smarter than the rest of my peers, which proved to do the opposite. I was a year behind everyone both socially and intellectually. I was forced into pages and pages of workbooks to both compensate for my age and also to try and get ahead of all the other kids. I never got to play outside with my neighborhood friends, and was forced to practice one hour of piano every single day from the age of four.

In short, I was miserable. I've also always had a very defiant personality type, where I had a very hard time following rules. This resulted in punishments, from being grounded more times than I wasn't to being hit on a weekly basis in an attempt to squash any resistance I had and make me a quiet, compliant, model Asian child. I was forgetful, laid back, and thoughtless as a child. I still am. I would forget my homework at school all the time, which led to even more beatings. I remember riding back on the schoolbus every single day, my heart pounding a million miles a minute over what I had forgotten at school, what I had done wrong today, what I would get beaten for when I came back. I used to make my friend check every single one of her folders in her backpack on the way back from school to make sure that we had the same things and that I didn't forget anything. Every day, my mom and I would do my homework together. I always thought that I was cheating, because my homework was always 100&amp;#37; correct because my mom essentially did it for me. When ""we"" would study for my tests, my mom would quiz me on questions and I was hit for every single question I got wrong. I still didn't do all that well on my tests considering how much we would study--I'd get 80's and 90's. 90 was the cutoff for my mom, anything in the 80's I'd be hit or grounded or both for. Anything above a 90 was acceptable, I was never praised for it, I just wasn't punished. I remember the anxiety I went through on the days we'd get our tests handed back. I'd go up to the teacher as she called on us one by one to get our tests back, shaking. One truly defining moment I'll always remember from my childhood was when I got a math test back that I got an 89 on, where I broke down crying. My two teachers kept asking me why I was crying, that 89 was a *good* grade. When I came home that day, still in tears, I had to explain everything that happened. I've never seen my mom so furious. She screamed at me, telling me that the teachers were going to call the Child Protective Services, blamed me for breaking down that day at school.

The second thing that my mom cared so much about was my appearance.

I was thin up until 2nd or 3rd grade, when I started to slowly gain weight. I remember my mom pointing out how I had a stomach one day in the shower, and that I had to be more careful because I was on my way to being fat. When my weight gain didn't stop, she'd constantly complain and tease me about my weight, literally multiple times a day every single day. She bought me clothes that were obviously too small for me, making me try on pants that wouldn't fit, screaming at me that these pants were a size 10, which meant they were made for 10 year olds. I was 7. I started skipping meals by the time I was in fifth grade, had full fledged bulimia and anorexia by the time I was in 8th grade, went into rehab for the next 2 years of my life, then have relapsed more times than I can count since then. To this day, I smoke cigarettes every day because it's the only way I'm somewhat able to function without having an eating disorder. I truly believe that I'd rather die of cancer than be fat because my mom drilled into my brain that being fat would make me worthless.

I've also always been a small person, one of the shortest girls in my whole grade (probably because I was an entire year younger than everyone else.) In Asia, being tall is highly desirable, which my mom wanted for me so badly. I was forced to drink 4-5 glasses of milk every single day even though I hated it, because my mom believed it would one day make me tall. I also had terrible eczema, rashes all over my body, which my mom of course critiqued constantly. I went vegan a couple years ago because of how insecure I still am about my weight, and my rashes completely disappeared within a month. All this time, I was extremely allergic to milk, which was the root cause of my eczema. My mom didn't know better, but still, after years of being blamed for my skin condition I couldn't believe it was because of her.

For some closure, I finally completely retaliated after years of this shit in high school. I stopped trying for my grades, I quit piano after 10 years, I attempted suicide. And it was all liberating. My eating disorder gave me a sense of control, something I had never felt I had in all the years I had been alive. I went to therapy for both my eating disorder and depression, and while I'm doing fine now it's still really hard to get over my self esteem issues. I slept with an obscene amount of people in college because of how unloved I had felt my whole life, and was drawn to guys that treated me like shit. I've gotten over that for the most part with the help of some amazing friends in my life, but there's still a lot of insecurities I have about my weight that I don't believe will ever go away.

I ended up with an 89 average in high school, went to a decent state college, found a job after graduation, and moved out. My mom has changed since then, I have twin brothers that are 16 years old right now who are quiet, compliant, smart kids. She has improved as a parent after raising me, but also doesn't have a reason to punish them because they follow everything she says.

I still can't forgive her. And I still feel misplaced resentment towards my brothers because of how unfair it was that I had to go through that and they didn't. For now, I'm doing fine. I'm happier than I've ever been my whole life, and am a very resilient person because of what I went through. I'm still not against hitting your kids. I understand there are many, many people out there who had it much worse, and I feel for every single one of those people. I don't believe any child should have to go through that. Asians have a stereotype of having quiet, complicit personalities and I'm hoping there's someone out there that relates to this experience and realizes that their social anxiety isn't their fault. Anyways, thanks for reading, I know this was long!

EDIT: Two more statements I'd like to make: One, the Asian stereotype of having super intelligence bothers me so much. White kids were always so envious of my intelligence and musical abilities back in grade school, and I fucking HATED how they had no idea the price I had to pay for it. Yeah, you want to be as smart and perfect as I am while you play videogames all day and sit on the couch. They all thought that it came natural to me, and it was so difficult to have people be jealous of my life when all I wanted was out. 

Secondly, I think about all those white kids who got to play outside every single day and run and frolic and be happy during their childhoods. Where are they now? A lot of them are probably just as successful as I am (which isn't even that successful, I graduated college and now work an internship that makes enough money just to cover rent) without any of the childhood trauma. Many of them are probably more successful than I am, because they were socialized and well adjusted in their perfect nuclear American homes. I work in finance, where social skills are more important than intelligence. It absolutely kills me that my childhood feels like it was given up for nothing. I was learning algebra in third grade while white kids were playing outside, learning how to make friends. Now, a lot of those kids are probably further in life because they don't have the crazy social anxiety that I have. I've gotten a lot better with my social skills, but I still feel like all the suffering I went through was for nothing."
8xggms,1,2018-07-09,Advice - Romance,The_Financial,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8xggms/advice_romance/,"Hello Ladies,

I am writing you because I need a piece of advice on my current “love-life” situation. I will try to summarize the whole story without leaving the important events out. I’m a 26 years old male currently working as a Junior Investment Manager in an insurance company, in March a new intern came to my company (the girl in question) for the next 6 months without knowing if she will get hired or not (we live in Ireland but both from Italy). 

Anyway, in the beginning we started going out as a group with our colleagues and in two different situations she got mad at me because I’m a really straight-forward person, the next day after the second time she got mad she invited me out (like wtf?) and we spent basically the whole day together, which was really strange for me because I really don’t like spending the whole day with people (if not family or dear friends/girlfriend) so I guess we both realize we think a like and have a good connection. We continue going out and I didn’t want to kiss or anything till like the 4th date because I always wanted to avoid “work-relationships”, she told me she was super attracted to me both physically (I like to think I’m a tall good-looking man) but mostly to my personality and the fact that I am able to hold a real conversation about everything (I hate small talks with people I’m interested in). After like 2 months we ended up sleeping together, and was great from my side and I think for hers as well she seemed to be really into me (some stuff you just get it). We continued going out and a couple of things happened, first she said that when she is with me she is super happy but when she is alone she has one million doubts because she doesn’t know if she will stay here or nom because she isn’t in love with me and sometimes thinks about what she had with her ex (which hurt her a lot) and so she said maybe we shouldn’t meet anymore because of the above reasons… anyway the same night we ended up sleeping together again, and was terrible, from my side at least, I didn’t enjoy it at all, maybe I am too sensible idk… fact is we continued going out and then we stopped because we talked and she said she is not attracted to me (which is strange given her behaviour before that talk about ex/leaving and so on), then two other things happened, I got a job offer in Switzerland two days before she was supposed to leave in NY for holidays, I told her about that and that I was thinking to accept it.. in the end till the last day I didn’t know if I should go or not (strictly professionally speaking) the point is she got back from her holidays and I told her I will be staying here, then she changed again, she started being really close to me, calling me almost every night and kissed me twice, then Friday morning while having breakfast she tells me that she sees someone, and I was like What? It didn’t make any sense and still doesn’t… then Saturday I went out with some friends and she was at the same bar, we talked again and started hugging me and being physical again, at the end of the night she said that she loves her freedom and that she still doesn’t want something with me, and I said then why the hell you started calling me all the time again and kissing me again if that is the case? And on top telling me you are seeing someone else… then yesterday I moved into a new house she came to see me and started again hugging being super physical with me and tried to kiss me but I didn’t want given what she told me… I don’t like all the confusion she is bringing into my life… Any advice? Is she really not attracted to me? Is she like this maybe because she is leaving (not sure if the company will keep her) and doesn’t want to fall in love and then get hurt again? Or is there something I am not seeing ladies.

Thank you all for reading this."

How do I handle them?,I_Say_Peoples_Names,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xhfyo/i_24_m_despise_most_of_my_younger_coworkers_who/,"I've worked at my current job for over a year now and a group of summer interns just started working here a month or so ago. Most of them suck. They act really immature at work where it is a really professional environment (I work in a manufacturing plant and most the people in my office are white-collar). I feel like I was bred to take my work seriously and to be calm and professional but these college kids are very annoying. Just the other day they were talking about how different bars in the area and where to get drunk at on a Thursday. Mind you, these people are roughly 21-22 y.o. but I'm not that much older and I am way more conscientious about what I'm saying at work. To add to it, they made this group chat with all the younger people at my work who are around my age and they spam it with plans they are making for every weekend. To add to my woes, my original coworkers who got hired in with me are going along with it. I am the only one who is purposefully avoiding their social get-togethers because I know they're just going to be loud and immature and drunk like the first time I hung out with them. 

There are a few of them (the group is about 12 large) that are less obnoxious but it's still pretty bad - especially when they're all together. I've already heard/noticed the older people at work making remarks about how ridiculous they sound. I'm currently avoiding most all the social situations I can and am only addressing them in professional situations (like they need my help on something technical). It's kind of annoying now because I feel ostracized from the group and they have even mentioned that I'm being antisocial but that's just because I don't want them to drag me down with them, especially at work. I recently got a promotion to being a process owner and I don't have time nor the patience to deal with these people.

The worst thing here is that I am expected to go to social events outside of work which happen roughly 1-2 a month and we have an almost all day event where we are going to a city then a night time cruise afterwards. To add to it, it's only going to be those interns/young coworkers that act really obnoxious. I have gone to everything thus far and really want to make up an excuse for this one. How do I go about dealing with my situation?

TL;DR - Coworkers are young and immature and suck in general. I have stopped talking to them on platonic-level and only address them professionally. I'm expected to go to all-day social event with only them in a few weeks and am highly considering making up an excuse to get out of it. "

I know this is long I'm sorry :/ had a lot to get off my chest. I just found this page today and it’s honestly a relief because I just really need to rant about something that happened last night with  my BF that I can’t seem to shake.

To  really understand what happened I need to trace the storyline back to  April when I was hired for a camp counselor job but I was going through  finals week at my college and I wasn’t able to turn in the forms on time  however my boss still made it seem like I was hired and I would have a  job during the summer. I showed up to training and did all I could but  it wasn’t until the end of June my boss told me I wasn’t able to get  hired bc HR didn’t process my forms in time. In between that time I’ve  been applying to jobs around my campus like crazy but had no luck. But  my roommate told me about a job fair at my university and basically said  it’s an easy way to get a job on campus. My mom wants me to go to the  job fair since getting a university job will make my life so much easier  and it’s safer since my apartment is close. (I don’t have a car). The  job fair is on the 14th.

Every summer my  family usually goes to Chicago to visit the grandparents and see family  for 3 weeks. However my older brother gets to stay home since he has a  job. Since I was under the assumption that I would be working I thought I  wouldn’t be going to Chicago. But since I wasn’t hired my mom decides  to book me a ticket since I don’t really have an excuse to stay. However  my BF and I have been planning a trip to his hometown the last week of  the month and I told this to her before she booked tickets. The plan was  to leave on the 9th and come back on the 13th which is only 5 days.  Last night my mom and I were talking about it and she says that it’s too  short of time and the return flight home for the job fair is a whooping  $600 and I know my family can’t afford that. So mom switched the  departing flight to the 15th and but the catch was that she doesn’t know  when I should be returning home. The reason why is because my  grandparents were thinking of going to Niagra Falls. As much as I love  my family I can’t cancel this trip with my BF just because my  grandparents decide very last minute to go to Niagra Falls. My BF is  gonna go on 3 month internship in the fall semester and he’s leaving the  first week of August so we don’t have much time left together which is  why this trip was so important to me.

My  BF was coming to say goodbye since he thought I was going to leave in  the morning but after fighting and arguing with the family I was not in  the mood. When he pulled up in front of my house I just burst into tears  crying into his shoulder. When I told him about the slight plan change.  He threw a HOLY FIT and I sat in the car just shocked. He was saying  things like my family is trying to ruin our relationship even though I  told him multiple times that my family just can’t afford the $600 flight  ticket which is why we had to reschedule the flights. What was also  annoying me was that he wouldn’t let me speak. Every time I tried to say  something to correct him he would raise his voice and then I would just  shut up so he can say what he wants to say. He did this so many times  and I was getting so agitated. I came to talk like adults not to talk  shit on my family. This was basically 45 minutes of it. Then he broke  down in tears because he thinks that my family won’t let me go on the  trip to his hometown but I never said I can’t go on our trip. It’s just  postponed for one week. He also said I need to start standing up to my  family and they need to stop being so controlling (but this is an annual  family trip the only reason I'm going is because I don't have a job).  He even threw his hat and glasses like a three year old. He kept talking  crap about my parents even though I told him to stop.

One  thing that got on my nerve was when he asked me to just skip the job  fair and stick with the plan. I just looked at him like are you fuckin  kidding me?

BF and I agreed that I should  spend two weeks (until he leaves) in his hometown to make the most of  our time we have left together. I asked my dad about it and he said  he’ll try to make it work. I hope my mom is fine with it.

Look  I love my BF he has done so much for me and we have a good time when  we’re together. It’s just everything is so tense now because time is so  limited before his internship.

**TDLR**: My parents rescheduled my flight for a family vacation which postpones my trip one week with my BF to his hometown which we planned in advance. He's threw a fit when I told him the schedule change and said many things about my family which left me uncomfortable and irritated. He's leaving for a 3 month internship which means we only have a limited amount of time before he leaves in August."
8xjhdz,3,2018-07-09,Help with getting started and advice for the FM Exam,EvangelineLuna,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8xjhdz/help_with_getting_started_and_advice_for_the_fm/,"Hello everyone! I am a soon-to-be junior in college who is studying Actuarial Science. However, I have no clue where to start studying for the FM exam. My faculty advisor, who is not an actuary herself, is of little help, and I feel overwhelmed hopping onto this subreddit with zero direction and little knowledge of all the technicalities and terms related to this field.

My current plan:
- First, take the FM exam this Fall/Spring.
- Second, take the P exam this upcoming Spring/Summer once I have taken my Probability Theory course this Fall.
- Lastly, find a math-related internship for next summer.
With this plan I can spend my senior year either studying for more exams or taking either of these first two exams if time doesn't permit for them this year. 

Now back to my initial concerns. For the FM exam where do you acquire the most up-to-date study materials? Is it better to use both online, paper resources, or both? I see the name ADAPT being used often, but I don't really know what that is. Honestly, feel free to give me the ELI5 version of what I need to do to get started.

I am open to any and all constructive feedback on my plan, and let me know if you have any questions that may help clarify my situation."

One of the worst things to ever happen to the show was Sam being promoted from intern. It was the beginning of the end, it made laziness the status quo for all of them. On *""Jim &amp; Sam""*, you'll hear every single part of O&amp;A that you hated most, with absolutely nothing resembling what you did like. Not just that, but a bitter resentment for what you once enjoyed. We have better things to do now, don't worry. In its place will be uninteresting interviews with the sons and daughters of formerly famous professional wrestlers, in addition to pointless and mildly coherent ramblings where sentences start with no forethought into how they should end. Opinions? Who needs 'em. Punchlines? Honestly, we're going to have to check with Scott. We have to talk to Greenstein first, GENUINELY. Having a conversation about almost anything in the world that consists of 2 people having to ask one another leading questions about the subject that neither will be able to answer? No effort = No content = No resolution = No payoff = Relateable to the listener = Everyone wins. Fuck it, we'll do it *LIVE*.

*""The Anthony Cumia Show*"" has the distinction of being the only program among them that is entirely self-funded, and one listen-through will tell you why. On this show, we are not afraid to cross the line, and it's the only place you will ever hear an OPEN and HONEST discussion. Every single day. About the same exact thing. Endlessly and without interruption. From the crack of dawn until the crook of Dawn (cumia, that is.) We're talkin' blackniggers. People with brown skin. What the fuck is up with them, anyhow? Why are they like that? Join *The Quickest Wit In Radio* as he debases himself and erodes any reputation he ever had for having comedic standards. You would think someone with a recorded audio archive spanning 20 years of mocking others for their shortcomings would have *some* standards themselves. Look on the bright side: Anthony Cumia is trying something **new**. He's on his own, and now he's trying things he has never done before. By making the content, guests, employees, and customer relations as bad as possible, you take the road less traveled in entertainment. He is a trailblazer, a pioneer in digital media that will be seen fondly in the future once corporate media is destroyed by the internet.

*""Bennington""*, for those who want to picture their radio hosts wearing sunglasses indoors at night time. Because when I wanna laugh, I tune into a recording of daddy saving his spoiled new york lefty babygirl from doing all the difficult parts of radio. Riddle me this, gang. Who among us *DOESN'T* love a good cry when a marginally successful and overrated musician who hasn't been spoken of in 15 years passes away? It's an opportunity for character growth. Instead of roofying his daughter, he is roofying us. Radio to fall asleep to. But for you old school fans, we're bringing back ONE thing: We're still pretending that Pepper Hicks is even slightly funnier than the most unfunny guy you knew in college, or that quiet co-worker at your first job. 

I would speak ill of *""Opie Radio""* here, but here's why I won't: I find it incredibly charitable that he is willing to donate his time to the parent corporation that pays Ben Shapiro to say about liberals what was being said on the O&amp;A show more eloquently/nuanced/entertaining 10 entire years ago. Because Opie is not being paid by Westwood One, he is proving that this is a labor of love. The man lives and breathes radio, and has been doing it since he was fawkin' 18 years old in case the bit past you by. To be PERFECTLY honest wit yew, I wish him NOTHING but the fawkin' best. I did right by him, in the end.

Robert Kelly, god bless him, but he needs to take a break and get himself together. Even the origin of the name of his podcast comes from him being mocked for being a hot headed fool.

But consider this, gentlemen... at least we can look forward to the likes of Nick Mullen, Dan Soder, Big Jay and Sam Hyde being passed the torch and promptly dropping it onto the floor five seconds into their overzealous sprint.

Everyone you liked is powerless or dead. Anyone who could have saved us from this is incapable or uninterested. How does it feel?"

Some context, without giving away too many personal details, I'm a recent college grad in the USA who recently just got my first ""big girl job"" (yay!). I've had internships in office settings before this, but most of my work experience has been in restaurants.

In addition to graduating college, I've also recently been diagnosed with moderate depression, and I've just started taking 10mg Lexapro to help with this.

I've also been in therapy for my anxiety for about a year, and all my life before that I just thought that I was normal and normal people have meltdowns every other week, but I digress.

Anyway, on to my situation.

I started a new job 6 months ago. I came into a small, startup company as the 3rd person in my department, my boss and another colleague. My colleague is the same age as me, but she's been with the company for about 2 years, as an intern before graduating and becoming full-time. She's basically my mentor, even though this is technically my 3rd office job (I've had 2 internships before this), and she's only had 1 office job (this company). I've had 4 specific situations where I felt like my colleague went over my head to our boss on a situation that could have been solved with a conversation with me, rather than going to our boss with her concern. (To give some more context, the situations were so insignificant, that I felt like I had to prove to my boss that I knew what I was doing on a basic set of procedures we use in our department that someone should know before coming into the job)

The straw that broke the camel's back was a form. A month or so after I started, my colleague made a new form for a new procedure we were implementing in our department. It looked sloppy to me, so I asked her if I could re-format it a bit. She said yes, and off I went. I showed it to her, she was like ""oh nice"" and never said anything else about it. I decided to leave it, not bring it up again, and let her use the one she made because she was doing 90&amp;#37; of the work for this particular project, so why make her use something that she doesn't need? Fast forward to a month ago, I am delegated with taking over this project. Colleague goes on vacation for a few days, I use the form that I made, it's cleaner and more organized for what we need.

My boss calls me into her office this afternoon, and we begin a conversation about said form. She explains to me that the timing is odd, and she knows my thought was good, but the timing looked like I had other intentions. I realized this, and start freaking out inside. In a restaurant setting, this is solved with a ""Hey, come here! Let's talk this out"", but office jobs need more nuance and grace, and less abrasiveness of a restaurant staff, so I'm unsure of how this conversation is going to pan out.

I realize that it looks like I went around my colleague and used the form I made without asking. I apologize, express that my intention was not to do this. Our conversation continued, and it turned into my boss asking me if I felt like I couldn't go to my colleague about things that I might have questions on. I said no, I definitely feel like I can approach her, my concern is that she feels like she can't come to me (referencing the 4 specific situations from before where I feel like she went over me, directly to our boss). I went into my concerns about one of the situations, and my boss was shocked how upset I was over it, and pressed a bit on my thinking and why I felt that way, because I mentioned that in that instance, I felt like I had to prove I was competent at the job I was hired for. She pressed a bit on why I thought I had to prove that to her.

I end up dumping all my mental issues outlined above on her, I had not planned on telling her any of this, ever, and I said that to her.

She asked more about my anxiety, asking me about my perfectionist tendencies, if I am a very ""black and white"" person, rather than seeing gray in situations, and some other stuff I can't remember.

I know she has never struggled with anxiety because I said that I am in a constant state of feeling like I've done something wrong, feeling like I don't deserve anything, or that I am not good enough, and she asked me if I'm comfortable anywhere. I said ""no, to be honest, I'm not."" To which she said, ""gosh, that sounds exhausting"". (lol yeah anxiety is a fucking nightmare)

She basically then asked me what the company can do to support me, and I told her that I don't want her to think I can't do my job. I told her I don't want her to tiptoe around me, that's the last thing I want.

I'm terrified that I'm going to be shown the door because I'm now seen as a liability, an unstable and incapable employee.

What do I do? Should I send my boss an email outlining my concerns? What should I do about my coworker? I'm like freaking out here. I got really good at hiding my anxiety in work-related situations that I have never, ever, told any of my bosses or coworkers my mental state like I just told my boss today.

Any sort of advice would be great, I'm not sure if I should expect to be let go, and start looking for another job.

I just sort of word-vomited this, if anyone needs clarification please let me know and I'll clarify to the best of my ability without getting too specific."

My goals are to learn as much Japanese as possible, learn some kind of skill that I can make marketable, figure out if I like Japan.

My reasons for studying Japanese is that I took a class and I liked it. 
 
I am from Memphis TN. In Memphis you either make it big or you don't. I am at a dead end here. Studying abroad is my first step in learning about the world and making my way out of Memphis(whether I go to Japan or elsewhere after).

I wanted to know if anyone has any advice for me as to how I should go about learning and doing things. I mainly want to explore and interact with Nagoya during my stay rather then venture out. I have considered filling out paper work to attempt to get a part time job sometime during my stay(I believe my school offers internships during the 2nd semester so there is that aswell).

I also wanted to know if having a laptop is considered a necessity. I really don't like the selection of cheaper laptops and would rather not buy something I don't want. I would rather wait until I come back to the States and buy something I like.

I also wanted to know if there are any good computer parts/electronics areas in Nagoya to look into.

Also, I’d prefer to use Discord as I personally think it’s the best chat app available.

I’m a male but I’m looking to play a futa character, the other character you play as could be male or female.

I’d like the futa to be based off Milla Jovovich appearance.

The other roles can also be based off celebs or models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis.

A)  I would be the boss or a high level executive at some kind of company.  You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship).  I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me.  After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard.  Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.
   
This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe your the kid of an employee and your in the building for some reason).

B)  I’m a teacher or P.E. coach at a middle school, high school or college.  I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before before.  This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

You could be an aspiring track and field star or the anti social wallflower/bookworm/nerd/goth kid that I need to yell at on a regular basis to motivate you into participating.  Maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your future. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and walk past my office and I had completely forgot you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited.  Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing.  You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi large dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s.  You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s.  For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass (1 or 2) or any number of possibilities.

C)  Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where.  I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place.  For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car.  You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment.  Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do.

I don’t like scat, vore, blood or gore but I’m pretty much up to every other kink."

I just need to get this out there because I think I’ve been bottling it up.

A quick summary—I grew up MEGA Mormon, like many of us do. When I turned 18 I realized it was BS and wanted out. I didn’t apply to any schools besides BYU so I had to take a gap year from school. Took on an internship and then went to the U.

I left school and worked full time as a software developer at a few startups in Utah. There were definitely largely Mormon cultures, but it wasn’t so bad and I could drink my coffee so I was happy. Since early 2018 I left working for other people to try and start my own company while doing contract work to keep myself afloat. So as far as my career goes, it’s headed in the direction I want it to.

That said, I just flew out to LA to meet a client. We had been connected by a former coworker of mine who happened to be Mormon. All well and good. Shortly after I arrived, I was given the office tour and grabbed a coffee to bring back to my desk. The client knows I’m from Utah, and when the CEO saw me drinking coffee she made kind of a weird comment about it—surprised I was drinking coffee. I’m not sure if she is or isn’t Mormon, and I don’t really care, but that’s not the point. It feels like it’s the straw that broke the camel’s back.

I have to get out of Utah. I am so fucking done with this. I can’t bear to have my life’s identity dictated by “MORMON” or “NOT MORMON”. How about “Person”? I live in Not Mormon Salt Lake because I wanted to get away from Mormon Provo. I go home to my Mormon family for Sunday dinners and skip around the elephant in the room that I am Not Mormon™️ and didn’t go on a mission. Then I go on a date with a Not Mormon girl and the conversation comes around to how I was Mormon and then I was Not Mormon. Then I go hit the Not Mormon bars with my Not Mormon, former Mormon friends and we talk about how glad we are that we are Not Mormon anymore. Then I hang out with my Mormon friends who I can no longer relate to because their Mormon mission experiences don’t relate in any way to my Not Mormon work experiences.

And then at work I have to worry about whether drinking Not Mormon coffee is going to reflect poorly on me for coworkers thinking less of me because they know I used to be Mormon. And NOW I have a client in LA making a weird comment like that about coffee because the assumption is that I’m Mormon. And truly, there is nothing wrong with that. I am just SO done with every point of conversation in my fucking life revolving around this shitty fucking church that I disavowed four years ago and can’t seem to fucking get away from.

*whew\* 

I need to move. My lease just went up, we’re on month to month and a few of my buddies are looking for another place in Salt Lake. But I don’t know if I can wait any longer. There’s nothing holding me back. The clients I work with are all remote. The company I’m starting doesn’t require physical presence anywhere. My home office is the headquarters.

Anyways, I don’t know if this will be read by anyone, but I feel a lot better :P

8xmnsc,2,2018-07-10,My first love,iannabong,brokenheart,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokenheart/comments/8xmnsc/my_first_love/,"Last year, my tutor from university put me(20, M) in touch with a graduate from my course who is now a designer at an agency. We meet, and he shows me around their studio. As we walk around the office, I see the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. Nothing insane. He’s dressed in a black tshirt and pants. Pale skin, bald head, an amazing beard and the most handsome face. I stare, stunned, from two seconds.  Then we move on and walk past, as he keeps working on his computer. 

After another year of university, i was invited to the same office to do a two week internship. And he is still there. My desk had a direct line of sight to his. I could see him, and his computer screen. He would walk past me every time he left his desk. I was inebriated with every thing he did, the way he moved, talked, laughed, dressed. I finally built up the courage to talk to him after adding him on facebook, and we had a lot in common. We talked about music and film, about games we both liked. I found his spotify and I started listening to his music, which we liked,  and we talked about that too. Even the work he did was something I’ve wanted to learn how to do as a creative. I asked him for if he wanted to go to lunch one day, and he said yes. We got sandwiches from the market, and sat at a park in the middle of London for an hour and just ate and talked about life and living in London. I dropped then, hints that I was gay. Not flirted but mentioned things in my past that happened because I was gay. We asked each other our ages and i told him I am 20 and he’s 26. The next day I asked him for lunch again and he said no, which was fair, he was busy so he ate at his desk. After that he stopped replying to my messages. All of our conversations were always being started by me. He never initiates them. I asked my coworkers if he is gay, to which they replied that as far as they know, he’s straight. He does apparently have plenty of gay friends, and that he’s often out with them and that gay people always approach him and he finds that difficult sometimes. 

The next day was my last day at the internship. All of the people I met there, including him, went out that night. He talked about his upcoming date, and talked to the others about past experiences with women. On our second bar, i apologised to him, saying sorry that I was maybe a bit too invasive and basically creepy during my time at the internship. He said its okay, that it was good to talk to someone from outside the company for a change.  On our third and last bar, before I left, i gave him a cassette of music that I thought he’d like. Inside was a letter I wrote the night before. Saying goodbye, apologising, saying what he meant to me, wishing things were different, and wanting him to have nothing but love and happiness in his life.  I watched him read it, with a blank face. The moment he finished, I left. I went to the toilet, and as I went for the exit, he comes, hugs me and says sorry for not being gay. Says thanks for the letter, and asks that I stay in touch. I head home. 

My friends warned me that this would happen. The i would bond with him, thinking he was gay, and imagined things happening between us for the near future. That he would turn out straight and I would hate myself for being so tactless and creepy. And thats exactly what happened. I am 20, and am not in a very good place in my life. Granted, if he was interested, my situation wouldn’t really let me do much with him anyway. And he’s 26. He’s in a place in his life where things are starting to get very serious. He has a life to live, a group of friends and loved ones and women to date. It’s unreasonable for me to expect him to need a 20 year old, who doesn’t even have a place of his own, in his life. It’s just difficult when I think about him, or listen to the music we both like, that he’s out there, living a life completely fine without me, while I am here feeling like the one person in this whole city that I could cherish and love is gone forever.

8xnjbn,0,2018-07-10,18 year old student entering college. Will graduate with 0 debt. How to plan for my future?,Thelastseeder,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8xnjbn/18_year_old_student_entering_college_will/,"Hello,

My tuition has been paid off by the state I live in and my parents are covering my housing and any other small costs. I’ll probably get a job my sophomore year but they will handle most of the costs. I am very grateful and I’m aware to not squander this opportunity.



Besides the normal college advice like “buy a crockpot, don’t eat out so often, spend less money on haircuts, etc.” what are some things I can do financially to make sure I’ll be in the best position I possibly can be for the future?



If it helps, I plan to major in Computer science and I’m aiming for an internship so I’m sure if I stick to it I’ll have a decent job, but I’m more concerned about what to do with that money out of college?



For example, there are so many areas I can invest my money that my head still kind of hurts. What’s the difference between an ETF and a Mutual fund? What are corporate bonds and how can I make a return on them? Should I prioritize putting money into a 401k first? Or a Roth IRA? How much is a viable amount to be putting into a savings account?  Instead of investment accounts should I buy assets like rental homes? What other assets can I buy?



I plan to either live very cheaply after college (1 br or studio in the city I get an offer from, probably a bike or cheap car for transportation, etc.) or I might work at a less paying area that’s near my parents so I can live rent free and max out my investments while only paying for necessities. My parents are on board with this if this were to happen. **This is all assuming I graduate with my CS degree**



Sorry I’m just very confused and lost from all the different ways I could spend my money in the future and I’m going to be graduating with 0 debt so I do not want to squander this opportunity. I need some direction so any help would be greatly appreciated."

A little background; Im a college student primarily supported by my parents who lives at school most of the year. This summer I'm doing an internship and the corporate housing doesnt allow pets. My parents volunteered to watch my dog for the summer even though they've shown their dissatisfaction and made it known they dont approve of me having the dog. about a month into watching him my mom gave him to a friend from work to watch for the remainder who has young kids and a husband who works from home. This is good for my dog as he suffers from separation issues and thrives when hes around people. The family has fallen in love with him and want to keep him and I know it would be for the best and my parents cant help but emphasis this but i feel terrible. I love this dog so much and spent every day for 9 months with him and frankly am embarrassed to have got a dog just to give it away. I feel like ill never be able to get another dog again. It also doesnt help that my girlfriend is just as attached to him as i am.

I just hate this situation. It stresses my relationship with my parents if i dont let him go and i hurt my girlfriend and my feelings if i do."

Day 1 of 100, going to push for now for a more manageable goal.",iSpy1234_,Petioles,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petioles/comments/8xqf2j/made_a_major_upgrade_in_my_career_path_but_have/,"I have hit a major milestone in my career! I am now officially certified in SEO (Search Engine Optimization)! This will allow me to not only apply for internships, but enter a career path where the annual salary ranges from $48K to $62K per year! Its a very exciting time for me to be alive right now, the problem is I am literally burned out as hell.

I have basically had no life at all for over a month doing nothing but studying on Adderall (prescribed by my psychiatrist, I don't use more than 10mg once per day), going to the gym outside of work, and gathering SEO resources. And frankly, that trend may have to continue in some form to gain more stability. I still have a cushion in that Santa Monica businesses have all increased the minimum wage, so my current salary is now $12.00 per hour instead of $11.50. But in terms of intimate relationships, I doubt I will do anything in that direction until my stability for the long-term is set. I have an unhealthy and destructive relationship with work I am horrible at relaxing, I hate it. The problem is some days I work myself to the point that I physically and psychologically cannot work anymore, and that really sends me into a severe depression sometimes. I purposefully use work to avoid my problems or dealing with my feelings, and have decided to increase my SMART meeting attendance to a minimum of 1/2 times per week to solve this really serious problem, because I came within a hairs breath of drinking Alcohol again last night. I got my SEO certification yesterday and was a mixture of exceptionally proud of myself and hating my life, all at the same time.

Balance feels like a complicated tightrope nightmare more than ever, because sacrifices to my social life are going to be necessary to get where I need to go financially sooner than late. There is zero way around it, and that is a real depressive trigger that may affect my work and health if left unchecked. The challenge now, that I intend to rectify over the next 100 days is finding a way to balance my workaholic insanity with some form of a social life. I'll admit it, I may not have much of one if I want to get ahead career wise for quite a while and that honestly doesn't bother me. Sometimes...I wish it did."
8xqiev,123,2018-07-10,Another visit on the horizon from the ILs and an interesting story regarding MIL's last visit,QuirkyHistorian,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8xqiev/another_visit_on_the_horizon_from_the_ils_and_an/,"They and their yappy dogs descend upon us again this week. Steeling myself for this because my bullshit tolerance has been a little lower lately due to work stresses. MIL calls me Friday expressing how she was looking forward to the visit. They are only in town for some appointments for FIL and since DH and I are working, we won't see them except in the evening. This wasn't going to be a social visit, so I found her enthusiasm a little odd. I just chalked it up to her wanting to see her baby boy aka DH. She then starts asking about one of our neighbors she's known for a since DH was a small child and whether I had spoken to him recently. Truth be told, I've never met the man but I have heard that he is extremely nice and my husband grew up with his kids. I didn't think anything of this inquiry and tuned her prattling out because my intern walked into my office at that moment. I go to rush MIL off the phone when she says she hopes she'll have time to catch lunch or dinner with the neighbor again when she's in town. This piqued my curiosity but I pushed it out of my mind until I talked to husband that night. Apparently the last time she was in town without FIL, she had spent a couple of dinners with this neighbor. His wife died a couple of years ago and he's been single ever since. MIL was really close to his wife and by extension, him as well. When she last visited and went out for these dinners, all she told us was she was going out with a friend. We never questioned it. She later mentioned nonchalantly to my husband that it was with the neighbor. Okay, not that big a deal. Until this weekend.

Husband was in the back yard pulling up some weeds in a patch of garden when neighbor leans over the fence to ask husband what time MIL would be arriving this coming week. Husband said he wasn't sure when his parents would be coming. It was at the mention of ""parents"" that the neighbor goes ""oh, your dad is coming too?"" DH says yes because his dad has appointments. At this point, the neighbor's face falls and he says ""Oh. well, I guess I'll see your mom whenever."" I found this really strange but DH filled me in on the backstory of this neighbor. Again, the neighbor's late wife and MIL were close friends. She used to vent to her about issues of FIL. When she was alive, they would often double date with their husbands when the ILs were in town, so they got a front row seat to FIL's eccentricities and his treatment of MIL. DH's grandmother once told him years ago that in a moment of unguarded frankness the neighbor had expressed opinions on FIL that weren't so favorable even going as far as to say he didn't deserve MIL. Wut?! Husband shakes his head at why neighbor seemed so disappointed his dad would be coming. I love this man, but I swear he can be thick as concrete some times. I mean, come on! Isn't it obvious at this point? The man is a widower, has known MIL for years, really likes her as a person, and clearly doesn't like FIL. He's lonely and clearly cherishes the time he spends with her. Husband told me that the last time she visited, his mom told him the neighbor came over and they sat on our sunporch and caught up for hours. Wait, this neighbor who has yet to come over and introduce himself to ME, the woman of the house, but he makes a special trip over to spend hours with MIL? Hmmm... neighbor rudeness notwithstanding, it doesn't bother me as that she seems to have a special friend in this neighbor. I don't think for one second she would ever cheat on FIL but this adds an extra layer of WTF to the situation. My husband feels a little uncomfortable about it after I literally had to spell it out for him. He's said before that he wished his parents would divorce so his mom could have her own life but he doesn't like the idea of her carrying on some inappropriate emotional affair while still married to his dad. I get where he's coming from with that. His dad can be such a dick and he'd really flip his shit if he thought she was being unfaithful to him. I asked him how he felt about the idea of his mom leaving his dad so that she could be with someone else. He said he'd support it as long as she was happy. This is all conjecture and we might be jumping to conclusions. After all, nothing untowards has happened to our knowledge. This is all just so very... interesting. Especially because MIL has informed us of times throughout the year when she plans to visit WITHOUT FIL. I know it's not much of an update but just thought I'd fill you guys in with this little snack. "
8xr3xt,4,2018-07-10,"My (24f) ex (26m) wants some stuff back, won't agree on pick up time or method",lady_larknister,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xr3xt/my_24f_ex_26m_wants_some_stuff_back_wont_agree_on/,"For a bit of background, we were together for two years during which I posted on my alternate accoundtasking for advice several times and you all told me he was abusive, so lesson learned. Anyway, we broke up over a disagreement on the paths our lifes should take, and it was bitter.

He wanted me to stay in our small island and find a 9 to 5 job, so basically throw away my kinda expensive education that I paid for with a lot of hard work, while I wanted to accept a very prestigious internship abroad. Needless to say, my therapist told me to go for it and sure, I landed a great job days after returning from the internship, so there's that. While I was away, he became extremely controling and would often phone me to yell at me, insult me or throw random accusations. Within one week I'd had enough of him putting me down and making me feel bad for doing something good for my future, and I decided to break it off and go no contact. At the end of my internship I contacted him about a cellphone he'd lent me when mine got stolen, and his mother started calling me about the cell pone and also about a laptop he gave me as a graduation gift that he now wanted back. I told them that I'd give back the phone because it wasn't mine, but the computer had been a gift and I wouldn't give back a gift out of principle, not even if it was a pack of gums. They tried to make it about the money and manipulate me into feeling bad for accepting a graduation gift, but I more or less kept my cool with the help of my roommate and told them I'd get back in touch once I was home to see about the phone.

I got a new pone within days, we talked and all seemed good. We agreed on a meeting time but for family reasons I couldn't make it so I told him well in advance. He tried to get me to explain what happened and I told him very politely that I didn't feel comfortable telling him because it was personal and we weren't together anymore, at which point he started yelling again, told me I was a heartless bitch, a gold digger, a cheating slut and a terrible person, and that he didn't want to see me to pick up the phone. I tried to ask a mutual friend to give it to him, but when the friend asked my ex if it was okay with him to do it that way my ex started messaging me about how I was trying to steal his friends just to hurt him.

So I don't know how to handle the phone situation. He won't talk to me, won't agree to meet, asked me not to drop it in the mailbox because he doesn't want anyone to see me near his house, goes ballistic if I try to ask our mutual friends to give it to him... Sending it through the mail is not an option for now, not only is it a very old phone that would cost more to send than it's worth, but I'd also chop off my arm before risking a cracked screen or something he and his mom could blame on me and pester me about.

**tl;dr: I have ex's old cell phone. He doesn't want to meet, doesn't want me to drop it at his house, doesn't want me to talk to a mutual friend. I don't want to mail it and risk it getting lost or scratched. I'd also like to ask back for a very expensive German course I bought and he borrowed from me, but I'm afraid if I bring it up he'll demand again that I give back the laptop he gifted me when I graduated.**

I obviously don't need or want his cell pone, and I don't want him to have any more excuses to keep talking to me. How do I go about this?"
8xrioz,1,2018-07-10,My partner(F22) and I (M22) have issues and I dont know what to do about us.,throwaway218784,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xrioz/my_partnerf22_and_i_m22_have_issues_and_i_dont/,"I don’t know where to start like honestly. I guess I’ll just start at the very beginning. It was 4 years ago; we were freshman entering college for the very first time. It is a relatively large school and my best friend and I (Raj) were living together in a dorm room. Since we were going to a party school, we had no intentions of getting into a relationship. We wanted to turn the fuck up and just have a good time. A couple days in, I meet this girl (Simran) who lives in our dorm and we hit it off instantly. We hangout essentially every day and eventually muster up the courage to ask her out. She says yes and we are legit having the best time of our life for the first couple weeks. Fast forward a month into our relationship, we both lose our virginities to each other. (We are each other’s first kisses and serious relationships, essentially everything). 

We get past the “honeymoon stage” and this is where the arguments begin. We argue constantly over the most trivial things and we both start obsessing with each other. I was more obsessed with her, than her with me. This goes on until winter break. During winter break, she goes back home (lives in a completely different state than I do) and we talk about break ups for the first time in our life. I wanted to work on our relationship and stop the arguments. (Note that this is our only problem at this time). I go visit her at her place during break with a couple of our close friends close friends and we decide to stick with each other. 

The second semester begins and we seem happy but things go wrong very fast. We have a falling out with our friend group and I side with her (she was in the right and she usually is). This situation isn’t that big of a deal but it causes arguments and eventually the fighting begins again. The fighting worsens and I make a huge mistake. I make a tinder profile while dating her. (Yes, I know this is the worst thing I can do). I feel horrible and I tell her about my tinder profile. She starts crying and this was definitely the turning point of our relationship. I know at this point trust has been lost. (I never have cheated on her even though I guess you can say making a tinder profile is almost equally bad and she has been the only girl I’ve ever been intimate with or even loved.).  Our fighting worsens (this is almost the end of the semester at this point). Finals season begins and we are starting to get better.  As she is about to leave for the year, we both say we love each other and she leaves. 

Two weeks after she leaves, I am going through a rough patch and I confide in her. She ends up breaking up with me and I get extremely sad. We say that we want to be friends and stuff but that shit didn’t work for too long. A week after we became “friends”, we get into another argument and I decide not to talk to her because she essentially tells me that I would never amount to anything in life. We stop talking for a couple months.

In early August, I text her to see how she’s doing and we start talking as friends. I still have feelings for her and her for me I think. We make plans to hangout once we get back to school. We get back to school and all of a sudden we are hooking up. She has no intentions of getting back together and keeps telling me that she wants to wait a while before dating.  So we hook up for 2 years and during this entire time we are exclusive but there is still no sign of a relationship. Last summer, we got into a major argument where she said that we would never be anything anymore. I was devastated but finally accepted it. 

We come back to school and for the first time in 2 years, don’t end up hooking up within the first 1.5 months (yes I know it’s not a long time, but for us, it was a fucking record.) During these 1.5 months we both go on 1 date each. I go on a date with this wonderful girl but I am clearly still in love with Simran and I don’t want to hook up with the second girl. Simran goes on her own date and the guy comes on to her for forcibly kisses her. She talks to me about this and I comfort her and just sit with her. Later that night we hook up and I make my intentions extremely clear by telling her that I would only do this with her if she sees a distinct future. She says she does and we have been together for about 9 months essentially argument free. However recently, we got into an argument about a trivial matter and I feel threatened that every time we argue, she’s going to end the relationship instead of fighting for it. I am unable to talk to her about our issues and I am scared if I bring up anything, it would turn into an argument. 

I don’t know how I could improve myself and the relationship. I’m doing everything in my power to make things as perfect as possible. In my opinion, I think she’s a wonderful person but has commitment issues. She is almost unable to provide affection and attention even though I have tried to talk to her about it. I hate sounding so desperate but I need some kind of perspective on this. I have been meeting all her requirements because she wants to be with someone who has potential. I do agree with that because she is amazingly smart and is allowed to have such expectancies. I’ve had three internships (1 with a large company) which will help me build a career for sure. We are heading in the right direction but it hurts me when we get into an argument because it takes her a while to get over stuff and I hate it when I feel ignored. Sometimes she acts ice cold and its difficult to talk to her then. 

I need some sort of advice on what I am doing wrong and how to fix myself.  

If I haven’t been super clear, ask away and I will try to answer the questions to the best of my ability. 

TLDR: Girl and I like each other for sure but there are commitment issues on her side and overthinking on myside. "
8xrkqt,2,2018-07-10,I (21F) don't seem to truly forget my ex (19M) even though I'm in a new relationship. We were together for over a year.,vlila,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xrkqt/i_21f_dont_seem_to_truly_forget_my_ex_19m_even/,"We broke up almost a year ago. He goes to school in another country (it's only a 45 minute flight) and we used to see each other a lot, manage to have a wonderful long distance relationship. I went to visit him for our anniversary and broke up with him because I found he was sexting a girl and even tho he rejected her for like a year, he started playing around with her because we had a fight... She lives in the same country as I do. It was very hard because she was the reason why we had our single and only discussion in the whole time we were together. Long story short, we had this ""Fairytale"", ""picture perfect"", silly, beautiful relationship and no one ever thought we would break up \*sigh\*. 

After we broke up he was an asshole, a real asshole. I always justified everything with him being younger and that he needed to grow up... We went through a lot together, it was probably the most intense year of my life. Separations, distance, losing jobs, scholarships, auditions, pregnancies, abortion, travelling, moving together, A BUNCH OF SHIT in a year. Afterall, he still texts me every now and then and I do too, we always remind each other silly stuff or be like ""hey you're a prick but i love you"" or ""hey i know u hate me but i love you"" (and no, it's not an I love you I'm in love with you, it's just bs). 

He has been unfaithful to all the girls he dated after me (and all of them stalk me on social media, see my stories on instagram, everything). 

\- I go out at least 3-4 times a week, I see my friends, family, everyone. I love going to concerts and parties and I have tons of fun (no joke, I am the person that genuinely enjoys dancing all night long until I am sweaty and can't feel my feet). 

\- I go on roadtrips with amazing people or by myself, escaping a little bit from the city to the woods or to the beach.

\- I write, basically everyday. I write poems, shorts stories, all that.

\- I exercise every now and then.

\- I'm finishing my career right now, doing my internship and final project... definitely haven't been easy because for the last month- two months I've been feeling really depressed (since he came back in town).

\- I've met awesome, SO AWESOME people that taught me a bunch of stuff.

\- I have tried new activites, I've been learning stuff, 

\- I've had sex, I've dated people

\- I fell in love with someone else, deeply. I am in a relationship right now.. we've been officially together for 6 months now but we started dating almost 9 months ago. 

\- I've traveled. I've done absolutely everything everyone has told me to move on. 

Even though I'm happily in love with someone and I'm devoted to him, even though I am back to BEING myself. Even though I recognize HOW TOXIC he was for me in some aspects, even though I am aware of how MUCH I love my boyfriend. Somehow, everyday, I think of my ex. 

I really thought that was the love of my life. I don't know anymore how to simply stop thinking about him, and the thing is that I don't think about ME being WITH HIM. I cannot really picture it. I don't even remember how it felt to kiss him and I don't want to be with him anymore.. I know how harmful it is. But it seems so freaking hard to just cut him off my life. By that I mean, not texting him, blocking him off and just being a bitch to him. Even his family and friends agree, I hang out with all of them and they even got away from him for a while. They were all mad. I was a pretty good gf overall. \*no joke\* I pity the guy. He's shallow and fucked up after everything but to be honest.. I cannot hate him.

I can't. I sound like a freaking dramatic, psychopath but here I am just trying to write down and summarize a very very complicated story.

**TD;LR: I've done everything I can to move on. I am in love, for real, the healthiest love I've experienced and still can't truly stop thinking about my ex. I've tried absolutely everything on magazines, therapy, podcasts, all of it.** "
8xrt6l,32,2018-07-10,New Thrice interview reveals details about Palms!,swim_to_survive,thrice,https://www.reddit.com/r/thrice/comments/8xrt6l/new_thrice_interview_reveals_details_about_palms/,"Link to article is [here](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/thrice-talk-new-album-palms-in-bv-interview-share-the-grey-video/).

Details include:

1. Today, they put out a Daniel Carberry-directed video for that song and also announced that it’ll be on their upcoming tenth album, Palms.  **[we knew this one]**

2. “The Grey” is one of Thrice’s heaviest songs in a while, sounding like a cross between The Artist in the Ambulance and the Fire EP, and **there’s other super heavy stuff like that on Palms too.**

3. **There’s also synth-fueled industrial rock, atmospheric ballads, a little folky influence, a guest vocal from Emma Ruth Rundle (who just announced her own new album), a song that literally features over one thousand backing vocalists, and more.**

4. Thrice co-produced the album with **Eric Palmquist** (who also produced To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere), and it was mixed by **John Congleton** (who’s worked with St. Vincent, Angel Olsen, Cloud Nothings, Swans, and others).

5. Regarding leaving Vagrant, DK: ""Yeah, our contract was up, and we seriously considered staying. They did a great job with our records, and you know we’ve been there a while. But yeah, we met with Epitaph and it seemed like a really good fit for us, and it was a good time to try something new.""

6. On the first track, **Only Us:** almost like an industrial song, which sounds pretty new for Thrice.... **[SPOILER]** DK: We were consciously trying to leave our palette really broad. The last record was, I think maybe our most cohesive record, and it was still varied but it had something that really pulled it all together. We consciously wanted this one to be a bit more wild and scattered, I think. That song just came from me messing around with arpeggiated synths on a computer, and singing along with that. And I was like, “that sounds cool, it feels cool, it’s got a cool energy” — something about the tone itself, which was the original tone I demoed it with, it seemed to create the right mood for the melody. So yeah, we just went with it, and choosing to start the record with it was a conscious decision, knowing it’s a bit left-of-center for us, and that it would be a bit surprising… hopefully in a good way.”

7. On **""Just Breathe""**, has vocal harmonies with Emma Ruth Rundle -- DK: I heard her music maybe a year and a half or two years ago, and I definitely dug it. We were almost done with the record, and we were singing that song, and it’s kind of supposed to have two voices, two different characters singing the song almost — the main character and this voice from the side kind of coming in and speaking to that character. So I thought it would be cool if we could have an actual other voice to differentiate between the characters a little bit. We had to be done with it in a couple days, and there were a couple names that we had who we hit up, and she was not on tour, and other people were, so it worked out. It was a very short list of people and the fact that she was able to do it was amazing.

8. **The song “The Dark” has, according to the liner notes, vocals by “over one thousand friends from all over the world on their smartphones and computers.” Can you elaborate a little on that?**
DK: When I was writing that song, it’s pretty broad, because I think a lot of different people in different situations could identify with what’s happening in the song, and I wanted to write it that way, instead of having it be focused on one specific issue. On a lot of the record, we were trying to be very inclusive, and I started thinking about how it’d be great to actually feature different people’s voices on here, and kind of let their stories be part of the song. But it seemed like it’d be too small to just get a few people from the LA area, and we wanted to go beyond that. So we had the idea to have people record it on their iPhones. We talked to the producer about it, asking if it was plausible, and he said “yeah, that’s great!” So we threw an open call out there for a few days, and had over a thousand submissions, and thankfully our producer had an intern at the time, who put them all in and mixed them all down. It sounds really great, I would never have thought it was recorded on phones. It was really cool that all these people wanted to participate.

9. **Is there a moment on it that you’re especially proud of or surprised with yourself** DK: I think the cool thing about being in a band that’s super democratic, where everyone’s writing, is that there are moments when someone will spin something in a different way that you wouldn’t have ever taken it, and it’s awesome just to be a part of it. I remember for “The Dark,” I had that one guitar part and melody that starts it, and I had another idea but didn’t really know where they were going, and Teppei made a demo where the drums and bass come in really heavy over that guitar part, and I was like, “this is a song now, it’s a really cool song now,” not just random parts. I’m pretty proud of the general, larger concept that I think I pulled off lyrically, and specifically, lyrically, **I think “Beyond the Pines” is my favorite on the record. I like that song a lot.**"

Basically, I can’t graduate early because I’ll be doing senior design in spring 2020 and I’m not sure what majors/minors etc will help me the most in getting a job post graduation.

As it stands right now, if I take organic chem II in the spring I’ll have a BA in chemistry as well as a chemE major. If I take Pchem II in spring 2020 as well as inorganic or chemical modeling I’ll have a B.S. in chemistry as well as a chemE major. (This would be harder to accomplish, might have to take summer classes, but this is still doable.) I am one class away from a math minor, but I’m not sure how much that will help, and I would also consider trying to pick up a minor in compSci or business or something a little less directly related if that would help more. 

I also am looking for advice on finding and securing internships. I have essentially no Engineering experience besides a 1-semester TA position in the Engineering department preparing labs, taking inventory, doing maintenance on machines. I have a 3.38 GPA which I understand doesn’t help a ton either. 

Any advice on the next two years would be greatly appreciated, I just want to make the most of them. Thanks! "

""Empire of Ass.""",SandorClegane_AMA,asoiafcirclejerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiafcirclejerk/comments/8xs7mo/update_on_the_latest_dragon_shenanigans_empire_of/,"**Context:** Game of Thrones is such a popular show for Game of Thrones, they are working very earnestly to have a spinoff on the air for the year after it ends. The show is *so good* that a megafan calling himself 'The Dragon Demands' is the world welterweight LOLCOW champion. Skip down to the bottom for the old news about this sperg and a fuller context. It's a doozy.

###The new shit

He has been muttering to himself for months about 'Operation Hammerdown.' It would destroy D&amp;D, HBO etc. He had nothing. Then something lands in his lap. So this is now 'Operation Hammerdown.' He is going to make HBO suffer by promoting their spinoffs for Game of Thrones.

A screenwriter who was one of the 5 contenders panicked at the news that the Goldman pitch was moving to filming a pilot *this year.* Very high risk that is all she wrote and the other pitches will be iced indefinitely or at least until the Goldman series is deemed viable or not. 

So ""Empire of Ash"" would come to nought. But hey, what did Ryan Reynolds do when Deadpool 1 was stuck in development hell? He leaked it and the fans clamoured for the movie to be made. What worked for Ryan Reynolds might work for Maximum Boring Stein. 

###Two problems:

- A Valyria show is a dumb idea. It would be a glamorous soap opera with all the money going on dragon CGI. GRRM spent minutes conceiving of Valerian empire and never wrote a book there. At least with 'Age of Heroes' they could incorporate some of the families we know like Stark, Bolton etc. and cultures like Iron Born, Wildlings etc. GRRM has written nought about any Valyrians except the Targs, who were a minor house.
- Our Hollywood mover-and-shaker picked The Dragon Demands as his catspaw.

So Mr. Hollywood leaked it or used an intermediary to the Wikia Thrones megafan. 

The specific problem with TDD in this context is that he thinks he is book Littlefinger. He thinks he can manipulate people. Being a sperg, he is like show Littlefinger and as menacing as a NEET can be. 

1. TDD hypes a 'payload' cryptically. 
2. Posts it to the Wiki he edits. **I advise against visiting that wiki. [Here is a safe version of the 'payload' you can read on reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaestersoftheFreefolk/comments/8xq0ll/leaked_details_of_rejected_successor_show_about/)**

*Some background info, previoulsy posted in May.*

##Context: 

**Game of Thrones** is a popular HBO television series, adapted from the ASOIAF series of novels by George R. R. Martin. 

**David Benioff** is one of the show runners - that is, one of the bosses of the writing team. Show runners are more important in TV than the directors. 'Dan &amp; Dave' or 'D&amp;D' are common ways to refer to the showrunners of Game of Thrones.

**Fan:** a person who has a strong interest in or admiration for a particular person or thing. Fans of the show like to bitch about plot changes from the novels, even though they  only started reading the novels because of the show. Fans of the books like to bitch about books four and five being boring and book six being late.

**TheDragonDemands** is a Youtube megastar investigative reporter who is committed to documenting the scandalous fact that Game of Thrones producers conspire to put great acting performances on the screen. [Here is a profile of him, where we sincerely strove to be as fair to him as he is to David Benioff.](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiafcirclejerk/comments/8mqgjs/true_facts_about_youtube_investigative/) He hates Dave. Those of us fascinated by this little Tasmanian devil of drama, refer to him as TDD. Everyone knows who TDD is.

^(Spoiler warning: TDDs twitter account account is full of spoilers for his upcoming David Benioff biography miniseries. He is dishing out whack-a-doodle conclusions and insinuations from the video. Do not read his twitter if you want to go into the video fresh when it gets released later this month.)

**Wiki:** a website or database developed collaboratively by a community of users, allowing any user to add and edit content. Wiki editors are notorious sources of toxic drama. What could be more seductive than the heady mixture of power and the pursuit of absolute truth?

**The Game of Thrones Wikia page** is second most authoritative source for Game of Thrones info. It is the domain of lord paramount TheDragonDemands, because he saw off all challengers, as we will see below.

##The argument for the assertion that TDD is getting crazier lately.

*You need to listen to this stuff before he gets back on his meds and deletes the video. He deleted his video about making Dave suffer. The North remembers.*

First of all, the prize winner for most ironic statement for 2018 has already been claimed and it is only June. Timestamp 5 mins 19 seconds: [""There are a lot of crazy people on the internet.""](https://youtu.be/EO4D4ghF920?t=319)

Lets see if we can find a crazy person on the internet!

He is on a 24 hour Benioff Twitter storm. [Some other lunatic from the opposite extreme, a HBO apologist with the handle @DnDTeenFanclub, tried to wrangle him, but lacked the stamina to keep up.] (https://twitter.com/DnDTeenFanclub/status/1007072125189021696) Some highlights include TDD claiming Benioff suffering appendicitis was a form of suicide attempt. 
&gt;Benioff is not a mentally stable adult.  There are a LOT of ""red flags"".

You can't make this stuff up. Well he can. He did.  TDD  made stuff up.

Back to the video. [More than one person said this - ""Please stop pestering me with this ..."" He was pestering rape survivors to join his army and campaign about Sansa and Ramsay in the show.](https://youtu.be/EO4D4ghF920?t=561)

Now here comes the irrelevant overshare hydrogen bomb. [At the 10 minute mark TheDragonDemands starts talking about brutal domestic violence during his *own* childhood.](https://youtu.be/EO4D4ghF920?t=599) The topics then include victims of childhood sexual abuse, clinical depression, campaigns against domestic violence, and weirdly enough, in a deus ex machina maximus, HBO showrunner, David Benioff. Apologies for my Latin. Apparently he has discussed the domestic abuse multiple times on the Web.

**Some vital context** for folks who haven't kept up with the lame TheDragonDemands drama we have stooped to follow in the off-season:

- He made a video claiming that Tywin Lannister characters changes in the show were the result of Dave having daddy issues.
- David Benioff (peace be upon him) gave a speech about discovering an undiagnosed mild lisp in his thirties.
- TDD claimed this was evidence of parental neglect leading to Daves wilderness years during his early adulthood. 
- This seemed silly at the time, but in the light TDDs own claims about his childhood, **this is downright infuriating.**

Why infuriating? TDD is trivialising the issues of parental neglect, or abuse of a child, with these slurs against Dave and the Friedman family. My mind cannot rightly comprehend that coming from someone so affected by domestic violence, as The Dragon Demands has revealed himself to be. Is he using it as weapon against those he wishes to indite? Is he using it as a shield, when he wishes to manipulate people to pity him?

##The argument against the assertion that TDD is getting crazier lately.
Anytime you Google TDD or anyone in related communities, you unravel a thread of bombastic drama. In 2014 he drove the head admin of the Thrones Wikia off. 
[Here he brags about it, on a forum specifically for folks who were banned from Westeros.org for dissing GRRM.](https://iswintercoming.com/the-dragon-s-rebellion-about-got-wikia-political-i-t2265.html)

If you are not familiar with IsWinterComing.com, they were mocking kneelers before you were born, my sweet summer child. It is an excellent source of stale historical popcorn. Here is a typical viewpoint of a user there:
&gt; In 1977 GRRM's penis was dubbed ""The Truffle"" by a council of his peers because it is very hard to find and it attracts pigs.

The guy TDD put to the sword was a popular and relatively authoritative personality among the ASOIAF fandom before the show blew up, known as 'Werthead.' 

[Here we see the emotional neglect that drove TDD to open warfare.](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/User_talk:Werthead#The_Jaime.2FCersei_sex_scene_in_.22Breaker_of_Chains.22) Some choice quotes:

&gt;I am genuinely confused Adam. 

&gt;Answer me today, Adam. Not a week from now.

&gt;Adam, I can read your public twitter account and public blog, and you made a new post 7 minutes ago: two hours ago I said ""answer me today, Adam""

&gt;Three days. It's been three days, Adam. 

What he aims to do to Dan &amp; Dave he actually succeeded in doing to a sincere fan of ASOIAF and Game of Thrones. Turns out Adam was not being notified of these talk page messages, was insanely busy at work, and had a life beyond those things. Reddit ASOIAF / GoT / Freefolk drama is positively mild by comparison with the wilder web beyond our realm.

[The Dragon Demands was banned from a fan convention for threatening Adam.](https://iswintercoming.com/the-dragon-s-rebellion-about-got-wikia-political-i-t2265-s60.html#p67400)

&gt; I'm annoyed that they picked something I said out of context to say it was ""threatening"". 

I would not want to annoy you. 

^(Answer me Adam!)

[And here we witness the inception of Dragons catch phrase, 'Rhaenyra has an Army'.](https://iswintercoming.com/the-dragon-s-rebellion-about-got-wikia-political-i-t2265-s90.html#p67443)

^(Answer me Adam!)

Fun fact - *this is true and not a joke* -  I messaged Adam on a different topic a few days ago and he answered me promptly. Cool guy.

Two days ago I was left by my fiance because of my depression which I had for almost 6 months now, caused by a illnes of my father and her having to leave for an internship for an extended amount of time. 

Something ""clicked"" in me last week, when I realized I had finally ruined my relationship with her by lashing out on her, but this time in a way that I realized was not fixable anymore. You can read the full story in my post history.

I could all of a sudden see clearly again and recognized what I had done the last couple of months. It feels as if there was some monster in control that was not the real me.

Maybe I need to add that this was the 6th week of me taking Antidepressant medication.

I'm really sad that it's over with her but I can see why she couldn't bear it anymore and I feel like I have the strength to finally take care of myself. I relied on her to make me happy for too long, which of course she was not able to.

Has anyone of you had a similar experience?"

I made a post last week asking for some help for the build but I have had a few changes. My total budget including the monitor will be $1500, however if I can spend less absolutely do it.

This desktop will be used primarily for junior and senior level engineering courses and internships.

Programs:

MatLab for Data Analysis, I will be writing programs for most of my courses to double check my work.

Python - Currently basic level programming however this will grow into

Java/C++ - Programming for data analysis and model testing

Solidworks/Solid Edge ST9 - 3D modeling involving parts, assemblies, motors, and relationships

Keyshot/Cinema 4D - Rending of CAD models

Microsoft Office (lol)

Fluid analysis and other private programs for rocket engine testing. 

Games:

Battlefield, Fornite, Fallout, Far Cry 5, and Flight simulators

I have two builds put together and could use some opinion between the two. Where I'm wasting and where I could save money.

I will be visiting Melbourne for 3 months between Aug-Nov for a grad research internship, but it will be at the Bundoora Campus of RMIT University. I was wondering if any you had tips or suggestions regarding where I could stay? I know Unilodge Bundoora offers accommodations for visiting grad students (at around 410$ per week, single person studio apartment), but I wanted to see if there are other possibilities, maybe closer to Melbourne CBD (something I've been suggested by someone who visited Melbourne last year).

Thank you :)"

8xtgok,2,2018-07-10,"Mengall, Sith Alchemist",Evil_Lytrinn,SWRPmeta,https://www.reddit.com/r/SWRPmeta/comments/8xtgok/mengall_sith_alchemist/,"Name: Mengall (Formerly Kul Baytor)

Bio:

Most sentients of the Galaxy think of the Skakoans as a race of cold, antiseptic, unemotional robots, thinking only of business and technology. For that is what they see of them--those clean, metallic containment suits that keep them so rigid, the unemotional monotone of their vocoders, the show of the green flesh of their heads the only thing reminding you of the fact that you’re dealing with an actual living creature, not a droid.

Most sentients of the Galaxy have never been to Skako. Most sentients of the Galaxy don’t know what happens when the pressure suit comes off.

What most people know of the homeworld of the Skakoans is that it’s covered in methane and it’s ruled through logic. This makes them assume that, like the similarly-logical Muuns or Bith, they work to suppress emotion. But they couldn’t be further from the truth.

Skako is a world where logic and emotion coexist. Where mathematicians and numerophilosophers labor endlessly on their perfect formulas and equations like the poets and playwrights, devoting their entire passion to their art. Where lifestyle algorithms are preached like religions, each street preacher shouting the values of their own, each claiming to be blessed by the Albino Cyclops, the perfectly-logical god of the Skakoan people. Where regular citizens often engage each other in debate on street corners, pointing out each others’ logical flaws and fallacies in a way rarely seen outside of universities on most worlds.

Into such a world was born Kul Baytor.

The son of a minor Techno Union official and an unassuming ban clerk, Kul seemed destined for a life of mediocrity. Out of the various children, he was fairly mediocre, always remaining around the middle of the pack and never really standing out. His family raised him to follow in his father’s footsteps, instilling him with a deep faith in the Albino Cyclops and a desire to join the Techno Union.

At one point, during his education at Skako university, Kul applied for an internship to a Techno Union official. During the interview with him, he somehow managed to convince him that he would be an excellent choice, despite his own relatively mediocre qualifications. Much of the internship was uneventful, until the official was called to the planet Gentes to arrange for more migrant workers.

During the trip, the native Ugnaughts insisted on giving the Techno Union negotiating team a tour of the more historical locations of the planet, including a fortress formerly belonging to the Sith Brotherhood of Darkness. While there, Kul felt a deep longing to explore the ruins deeper, almost like something was calling him. Soon, he became separated from the rest of the group, and headed deeper into the ruins, following the longing he felt and trusting it to guide him. He began to wonder if this was in some way the Albino Cyclops calling to him--but what he found was far different. He eventually wandered his way into a room, where he found the desiccated corpse of a man with a ring on his finger, clutching a variety of ancient scrolls in a language Kul didn’t understand. Upon putting on the ring, he felt a surge of power, like nothing he had ever felt before. It was….rapturous. He found himself able to understand the scrolls, and they told him great secrets, the likes of which he could not even imagine.

Such was how Kul Baytor learned of the Dark Side.

Returning to Skako, Kul became obsessed with the secrets contained in the scrolls. They told him of an ancient race of beings called Sith, and how they expanded and conquered species, deciphering the secrets of the Dark Side on the way. He learned how to move objects with his mind, and how to read and control the thoughts of other beings, as well as other, deeper secrets. While his telepathy allowed his career to soar, allowing him to become a Systems Director in record time, he had lost interest in his business, preferring instead to study ancient Sith history. He soon began to experiment, using the techniques he learned on lesser beings and seeing what worked. The results were horrifying, twisted creatures, all of whom died shortly after the rituals were completed. Realizing that the relatively Force-neutral Skako might not be the best place to conduct Dark Side studies, Kul decided to leave to find a place more powerful in the Dark Side to learn at.

During his travels, Kul would take a new name he learned from his books: Mengall, the name of one of Ludo Kressh’s followers. He attempted to collect more lore whenever he could, finding a few more scrolls, but not much. However, this did not go unnoticed. Soon, during an expedition to the Yavin system, Mengall was confronted by members of Tarnus’s Sith Academy, and given an ultimatum--join, or be considered an enemy. Mengall, having no reason not to, joined. Eventually, he became one of the more prominent instructors there after finally managing to gain control over his alchemy thanks to the Nexus, teaching the secrets of Sith Alchemy and Sorcery to his students, until the Academy was absorbed into the fold of Darth Ravenous and his apprentice, Crixus Payne. During this time, he detected a curious shift in the Dark Side--it had begun to rise in power, making his spells more potent and allowing him further insight into his scrolls and his ring's inner workings.

Mengall was put to work creating weapons for the newly-formed Knights of the Sith, forging Sith Swords in order to arm as many as possible. It is hard, thankless, and unforgiving work, and most importantly, boring. During this process, Mengall has begun to fantasize about the Sith species, imagining them as a towering master race that could bring the Dark Side back to supremacy--if only they still existed today. Indeed, perhaps one day they could….

Appearance:

Mengall, underneath his armor, appears like any other Skakoan--green skinned, with thin, spindly limbs and a lipless mouth. However, he has covered portions of his body in Sith tattoos, notably his head. His eyes--if they could be seen--glow like a Sith’s. He is currently 44 years of age, having discovered the Ring and scrolls in 399 ABY, left Skako in 405 ABY, and been approached by Tarnus around 420 ABY.

Mengall’s pressure suit is somewhat more notable, having been deeply alchemically enhanced. The Ring he discovered, which he knows to be the Ring of Dor Gal-Ram, is built into its gauntlets, and the outside is etched in Sith runes. The suit itself is black with red and gold inlay, the eyes of his mask glowing a disconcerting and fiery shade of red.

Mengall has not yet begun to feel the wear and tear of Dark Side degradation yet, but his skin has become a much paler shade of green than is normal, and a dark stain around his eyes can be seen around his mask.

Equipment:

Due to Skakoans not being able to breathe oxygen, Mengall must wear a pressurized suit in order to prevent explosive decompression. The suit he wears is quite unusual among pressure suits, however, in that he has alchemically-enhanced it. It is impervious to damage from blaster weapons and can even resist lightsaber strikes to a limited degree, though a dedicated power blow could cut through it.

Mengall’s most prized possessions are the Ring of Dor Gal-Ram, as well as Gal-Ram’s scrolls, which were annotated by the Brotherhood of Darkness. The scrolls tell of many alchemical ritualls, sorcerous spells, more common Dark Side powers, and the history and biology of the Sith species. If Mengall has any hope of bringing back the Sith species, it is through them.

The Ring of Dor Gal-Ram grants Mengall the ability to read, write, speak, and understand the Sith language, as well as other abilities. It also gives him a well of power, which he can gift to others and himself for a limited period of time. He will often use this to power himself up in combat, or to assist a key ally. Most of the time now, however, he uses it to enchant the various vibroblades he reforges into Sith Swords.

Mengall does not carry a lightsaber, eschewing physical combat for Force combat.

Powers and Skills:

Thanks to his years as a Skakoan businessman, Mengall understands business and business politics. He can speak, read, and write in Basic, Skakoan, and Sith. He is a capable instructor as well, thanks to his years teaching at the Endor academy. Thanks to his upbringing on Skako, he is very skilled in mathematics and physics, and has a talent for logic.

Mengall is a very powerful user of the Force, having access to many abilities most have forgotten.  However, his deep immersion in ancient Sith lore has caused him to overspecialize, and thus his more conventional powers are blunt and weak, where they exist at all. His use of telekinesis is powerful but uncontrolled, and while he can channel omnidirectional blasts and move small objects, he lacks the finer control for Force Chokes, or even directed Force pushes or pulls. He is attempting to learn superior control, but his studies are sidetracked often by his duties. In a similar way, while he is attempting to study the projection of Lightning, he cannot yet effectively use it.

He has also learned much else from the scrolls of Dor Gal-Ram--for instance, the ability to conjure up Force Illusions, or the ability to dominate the minds of others, though both of these require intense focus and concentration. He is a powerful Sith Sorcerer, able to conjure spells of fear and madness, blasts of pure Dark Side energy, and to conjure waves of darkness to sicken foes, as well as other, more obscure spells. However, most of his combative spells have never been attempted in live combat, and would likely be more difficult to cast in the stress of a battlefield scenario.

However, Mengall’s true talent is Sith Alchemy. Through trial and error, he has honed his skills at the manipulation of artifacts and life, and has created many foul beasts through experimentation, most of which were lost on Endor but a few of whom reside in the bowels of Corellia to this very day. He has the blueprints by which he could create Sith Amulets and Talismans, as well as a variety of other instruments of evil.

Personality:

Mengall is deeply devoted to his study of the Dark Side and of the Sith, and is constantly looking through the Knights of the Sith’s collection of lore to learn more. In particular, he can be said to have something of an obsession with the Sith species, believing them to be the embodiment of the Dark Side’s power. In conversation, he often seems quite distracted and dismissive, ignoring any who he deems to be wasting his time and being extremely direct and to the point.

Like all true Sith deep within their hearts, Mengall resents that he has been overshadowed, first by Tarnus at the Endor Academy, then by Darth Ravenous and Crixus Payne. However, for now he chooses not to act, instead biding his time and expanding his knowledge, preparing for the day where he will take the reins and lead the Sith to the glory they deserve…."

Like, crying and screaming in bed until my voice is hoarse and then passing the fuck out. Calling my university's emergency counseling hotline at 4am multiple times. Losing a lot of weight.


In the midst of all this, I started reading a bunch of books about breakups and self-love. Anything to feel like someone understood and validated my feelings. I spent so much money on books, trying to fix myself and put myself back together. And honestly, it worked. I am so proud of myself. 

I still miss my ex a lot, but I don't think I would have experienced this much growth without the breakup. I am so much more comfortable in my own skin now. I started going to the gym and my body is in pretty good shape. Sometimes I look in the mirror and think, ""Dang, I am so pretty."" I got a 4.0 last semester. I have an internship lined up this fall. I comfortably take myself on dates. Get dressed up and eat dinner alone at some restaurant while reading Foucault like some bitch in an indie movie.

I dunno, I guess I'm just feeling myself today. This summer, I've learned how radical it really is to love and care for yourself in a world that makes you feel narcissistic and selfish for doing so. The biggest piece of advice I came across is to treat yourself with the kindness and understanding that you would a good friend or your younger self. I hope everyone can develop this kinda relationship with themselves, it's actually pretty awesome.

Also, I’d prefer to use Discord as I personally think it’s the best chat app available.

I’m a male but I’m looking to play a futa character, the other character you play as could be male or female.

I’d like the futa to be based off Milla Jovovich appearance.
https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13943

The other roles can also be based off celebs or models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis.

A)  I would be the boss or a high level executive at some kind of company.  You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship).  I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me.  After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard.  Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.
   
This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe your the kid of an employee and your in the building for some reason).

B)  I’m a teacher or P.E. coach at a middle school, high school or college.  I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before before.  This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

You could be an aspiring track and field star or the anti social wallflower/bookworm/nerd/goth kid that I need to yell at on a regular basis to motivate you into participating.  Maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your future. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and walk past my office and I had completely forgot you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited.  Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing.  You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi large dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s.  You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s.  For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass (1 or 2) or any number of possibilities.

C)  Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where.  I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place.  For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car.  You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment.  Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do.

I don’t like scat, vore, blood or gore but I’m pretty much up to every other kink."

Details, scenes and more inside.",NeverNormality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8xuwpa/m4f_looking_for_a_long_term_chatrp_partner/,"Gooooood afternoon DPP. My name is Jeremy and as the title states I'm looking for a rp/chat partner for the long term. Whether we find one setup that we play out in a long series of scenes or we bounce around to play out all kinds of debauchery, they both have advantages. I'm looking for someone that I've got chemistry with so that we can have some filthy fun for a while to come.

A bit about what I'm looking for. Scene/world building. Don't get me wrong it's gonna be dirty and nasty, but I love a good build-up. Dirty talking. This is almost a must. Humiliation/degradation/training, not mandatory, but it's something I enjoy greatly. Good girl gone bad, innocent girl going dirty, powerful woman brought under control are some of my favorite types of scenes. Everything else is possible as well, to include incest, ageplay, raceplay, noncon, dubcon, and whatever else we agree upon.

Now how do we go about it? The easy answer... however we want. More specific you say? Sure.

Fantasy. Whether it be high fantasy with magic and warriors and elves and whatnot or more historical there are some great options here. I love to take a combat or thief angle here, but there are a lot of possibilities.

Scifi. So let's go the other direction. Cybernetics/genetic engancements, aliens, and space pirates oh my. Star wars, Mass effect, Firefly, and most of all Farscape. If you know and can play Farscape you have my full attention. Love that show.

Modern. Family, neighbors, teachers, babysitters, random woman in the park, secretary, boss, intern, Free use, celebrity, and whatever we can figure out. I could list out possibilities forever, but you get the idea.

Rule 34. Comics or comic based shows/movies. Check. Anime. Check. Cartoons. Check. What weird ass rule 34 fantasy can we come up with? Weird is good by the way.

You probably realize I care more about the scene being fun and nasty than the specific scene, but I do enjoy that build-up and creation. Whether it be humorous or serious let's expand our boundaries and explore the depths of our depravity. If you've read this far I appreciate it and there are free pancakes to be had. Would you like to play a game?"

Unfortunately for me, that's about to change.

I  stride through the office, my tight pencil skirt showing off my ass and  stocking clad legs, my tight blazer hugging the curves of my breasts, a  small triangle of my thin, cream coloured blouse visible at the top. My  shoulder length blonde hair is bound tightly behind my head, not a wisp  out of place, and my tall black heels click menacingly on the faux wood  floor.

I see people hunker down, doing  their best to look busy as I pass, and smile to myself. I enjoy having  power over the people who work under me, and I never hesitate to exploit  it. I pause at the door to my large office, turning on my heel and  clearing my throat loudly.

""As you all know, we'll be holding annual performance reviews this week. I'll call you to my office when it's your turn""

I  can almost feel the mood in the office grow tenser, any hints of a  smile quickly wiping themselves off their respective faces. My own smile  widens as I turn back to enter my office, snapping my fingers at me  secretary to bring me coffee and checking my schedule briefly - a new  group of interns was arriving later that day.

Put my in my place. Make me your bitch.

Who  you are is up to you - one of my employees, fed up with the ridiculous  standards I construct for the annual review? My secretary, tired of  being thrown the most menial tasks? A young intern who I try to seduce  using my position as leverage only to have the tables turned on me?

Or  maybe you're not from the office at all - you could be the head of a  larger company, looking to take over another smaller one - and add  another slut to her harem. Or a reporter who turns up dirt on the  company and uses it to blackmail me. Or anybody else you want to be!  Feel free to combine or modify any of my ideas as well!

My  ultimate fate is up to you - will I be your personal slave, obeying  your every command without question? Or maybe the company slut -  spreading my legs to help you close business deals. Maybe you'll just  slip a collar on me and keep me chained in the corner of the office as I  watch you become more successful than I ever was.

As  you can probably tell, I love having control taken from me, or being  seduced into giving it up willingly. I also enjoy being shown off and  humiliated in public settings and verbally abused.

Bondage,  foot worship, petplay, and forced tattooing/piercing/branding are all  things I'd be interested in including, but definitely optional if  they're not up your alley or don't work with what you want to do. Futa  is okay.

Not a huge fan of toilet play, but most other things are very welcome, so feel free to slip in any fetishes you like!"

A mix of finance issues before and currently, my father recently diagnosed with glioblastoma, and a bunch of issues has put a snag on my time in NYC. I want to get into writing and directing for television and film in a big setting like NYC so I went to study in BC. On and off though, my parents are both positive and negative about it hurting finances and are currently looking into bankruptcy. Getting an apartment and having a job is still difficult on their end so I am risking possibly (not happily though) losing my path into film and tv. I recently figured to look into alternatives and how to try to solve that problem, which is where I need some guidance. I know how people say that film school isn’t technically required or necessary; I personally like how I can learn more of my career path and more about the field. However, I may have to quit if it means I don’t become homeless. Having said that, one of my parent’s relatives has a son who works on production sets in Studio City, CA and has said that I could get a job reference to work on the same sort of set if I move out there. I do not have any references in NYC (besides a friend from high school who acts in a few tv shows like The Path) but nothing much else. I like the city aspect with getting an internship while having a job but could all change in a year if finance issues keep coming into play. Having said all that in mind, am I doomed in my choices in my career, or is one of these ways possible to survive enough to get some hope? "
8xvmdk,0,2018-07-10,Me (22F) with my boyfriend (24M) of three years - trust/boundary issues. Help!,beefherder1243,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xvmdk/me_22f_with_my_boyfriend_24m_of_three_years/,"Hey all!


I met my boyfriend in college - he was a senior and I was a sophomore. We get along really well, have similar senses of humor, hobbies, etc. and I am in love with him.


We've had a few issues in our relationship where I broke his trust.


1. In college I worked at a restaurant - I got to be friends with a male co-worker and through texting he started getting a little flirty with me. One thing to note is that I don't really have many friends, and so the people who I am friends with I hold very close. I made the mistake of flirting a little back because I was afraid of pushing him away and ruining the friendship - nothing serious, just a flirty tone (winky faces, talking about getting drunk, etc.)


My boyfriend found out by snooping (which I don't like, but honestly don't have a big issue with) that I was supposed to hang out with this guy. I hadn't told my boyfriend. I apologized and said I wouldn't hang out with him, but my boyfriend said I should go and see. It turned out to pretty much be a date, which I told my boyfriend, and I haven't really talked to the guy since.


2. One of our mutual friends in college has been an issue for us. The first time it really came up was when we were all staying over at my boyfriend's place - my boyfriend fell asleep on the floor after we had been drinking a bit, and I kept playing a board game with this friend (we'll call him B). He ended up resting his foot on my hand, and neither of us pulled away. I will say, I was drunk so the thought of doing something with him crossed my mind but I never would have acted on it. Anyways, I thought that was kinda weird so I googled later on to try and find out if he had any intention behind it - stuff like ""what does it mean if he touches you and doesn't pull away"".


Anyways, my boyfriend snooped again, found out, and confronted me. I apologized and tried to convince him that I really do love him, and he forgave me.


3. The last big incident was spring break of last year. My boyfriend had graduated but myself and B were still in school. We all play the same sport and so we went on the spring break trip - this was actually the first year that the teams stayed in the same house - before the men's and women's team got separate houses.


My boyfriend was anxious about this trip, given what had happened in the past. He let me know of this - however, I still wanted to go and he didn't ask me to not go, so I went. He asked me to let him know if anything weird happened, and asked if I could call before bed to say goodnight.


Anyways, it was a wild trip. Half of the nights I was blackout drunk, and I hung around B a lot of the time since he was one of my closest friends between the two teams. Nothing happened at all between us, but we definitely hung out a lot and people around got the idea that we were being a little flirty. One of the first few nights I did hold B's arm in the hot tub and he eventually asked some of my teammates to send me to bed - I was trashed and didn't really remember it.


My boyfriend found out about that through a mutual friend and freaked. Out. I made sure to talk to him every day, but he was still panicking. My phone unfortunately had a really shitty battery and so in my drunkenness I would let it die at night and not call him before bed.


About a month later, B was seeing someone. I didn't really mind that he was seeing someone (although I was a little jealous) as I was upset that she was not a good person. I was texting a friend about how I didn't like her, and the friend said ""hey I know you want him but you can't have him"" and unfortunately I didn't really think about it and said ""I know"".


My boyfriend saw the texts, snooping again, and was really upset. Apparently I had also said that she was ""unworthy"" which he didn't like at all.


Anyways, we took a break for the weekend - we both were acting unhealthily (his snooping, I mean).


We came back and both apologized. He asked me if we could brainstorm to find a way to keep these issues from happening - I offered to cut contact with B, to go to therapy, etc. He said therapy was a great idea but didn't want me to cut contact with B because he didn't think we'd stay friends anyways (B lives a few states away and had just graduated) and he didn't wanna make that drastic of an action.


I did move in with him that summer because he asked me to - I wanted to go live at home for my last summer but we were kinda at a breaking point so I moved in with him. It’s turned out great and I’m glad I did it. I will say that my boyfriend has been very supportive and helped me to grow a social life here in this new city both with him and on my own. He’s introduced me to a lot of people, and encouraged me to go out on my own and meet new people.


Anyways, over that summer B and I became friends again. He had graduated and didn’t have a job yet and I was on summer break before my senior year, so we had a lot of time during the day. We started playing the same video game and would chat online for a few hours a day. My boyfriend noticed this pretty quickly, and asked me if I would cut off contact with B because it was making him uncomfortable. I had a lot of trouble with it but my boyfriend convinced me that it was the right thing to do. However, the day after I did it, I realized that it hurt me too much and so I told my boyfriend that I couldn’t go through with it. Like I said, I don’t have very many friends and so I cherish the ones that I do have. Without B I wouldn’t really have any close friends.

I did also turn down an internship in B’s city in favor of an internship in the city my boyfriend and I live at. My boyfriend didn’t ask me to turn it down but I figured we might break up if I went, because I’d be around B so much and away from my boyfriend a lot for that whole semester.


My boyfriend started going to therapy to try and get over it, and we even went to a couples counseling session together. He says that everyone tells him, including his therapist, that he’s being reasonable in asking for me to cut contact. The couples counselor told us that both of us are being reasonable, in that he was reasonable to ask me to cut off contact with him and I was reasonable and not cutting off contact and letting our relationship end.


Nothing really came of that and my boyfriend continues to go to therapy. I was happy because I got to maintain my loving relationship with my boyfriend (he’s even said that my friendship with B doesn’t affect our affection/love for each other!) and my friendship with B. This went on for about six months, until about two months ago when my boyfriend gave me an ultimatum. I chose my boyfriend and told B that my boyfriend was not comfortable with us talking and so that we could not talk anymore. I was depressed and miserable for a few weeks, and thought that my only options were to continue being miserable or break up with my boyfriend. I wanted neither of those but I couldn’t stand being miserable and apprehensive towards the future and so I broke up with him.


My boyfriend was very distraught and begged to me to keep trying with him. After a weekend apart I decided that giving it a try was worth it. However I continue to talk to B on a daily basis. Our friendship has returned to be exactly how it was before. During the weekend apart, B and I I had even planned a backpacking trip and to go to a few festivals together. However, I knew my boyfriend would not be OK with that and so those never ended up happening.


I’m planning on going to therapy on my own because I know I struggle with needing attention and specifically crossing boundaries with other people. However my boyfriend still is very uncomfortable with B’s friendship with me, and I can’t let it go. I’ve assured him that there are no feelings between us and it seems like he knows that. However, he says it still makes him uncomfortable because he views the past events as very traumatic and gets uncomfortable seeing us be close friends. 


Is there any advice someone can give me? One of the festivals that B and I were supposed to go to is coming up this weekend, and I’m feeling really sad that he isn’t able to come with my boyfriend and I.


Thanks!

**TL;DR I have made some mistakes in the past but I can’t do what my boyfriend seems to need. Am I doomed?**

8xvnh8,1,2018-07-10,Help me work through some of this,jmbby,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8xvnh8/help_me_work_through_some_of_this/,"I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for almost 10 years.  We met when I was 15 and he was 18.  I liked him for two years, but he, being young and indecisive, kept me on the chase for two years and we didn’t begin actually dating until we were 17/20.  Our beginning was rocky- there were some jealousy issues, we were long distance because he was away at college, his friends and family didn’t know about me for the first 4 months (I think this was due to our slight age gap and he was embarrassed?).  Lots of minor issues but nothing crazy.  

Through the years, I would have doubts and bring them up and tell him I was considering a breakup, but he would always talk me down... and through a mixture of guilt and hope that whatever I was feeling would go away, I would stay.  This has happened in every stage: through our long distance, a year of an internship we did together, another short bout of long distance, living together in our hometown and most recently, a move together to a new city (for his job).  

Some of the doubts I have circle around some big picture differences.  I have the desire to work and live abroad for a year, possibly live on the opposite coast of the US, travel and do spontaneous trips.  To a flaw, I can be a little flighty and a poor planner.  He is the opposite and stresses and sucks the fun out of these events with his logic and stressing the details.  He does not support my desire to live abroad, he does NOT want to move cross-country together.  He is rooted to our home town and I am absolutely not.

Our sex life is lacking, as I have a higher drive than he does.  I’ve tried a million times over to discuss this with him and even though he does try for a few days afterwards, it always reverts back to the same. Me trying, him rejecting me a lot.  It’s apparently nothing about his attraction to me or anything tangible...just a lack of drive on his end.  I’ve asked about opening the relationship—no.  Hall passes—no.  He was my first/only so this is hard to cope with. I don’t know if I can dedicate my life to someone if this is what my sex life forever will look like.  

Additionally, the passion isn’t really there.  I know that that’s part of growing comfortable in a relationship, but must it be SO mundane?  I feel like we’re just best friend roommates without much of a spark.  It really feels like we’re an old married couple sometimes. And yes, I’ve brought this up a ton.  Just like sex, there’s little to no change afterwards before we’re back to the same.  Our relationship is “old” at 10 years, but I’m still so YOUNG and can’t shake the thought that I should be in my romantic and sexual peak.

All that being said, we have matured so much and are in a super healthy relationship.  Communication is hard sometimes and we certainly struggle like any couple does, but over-all he’s my best friend. He’s seriously an incredible boyfriend...He makes me laugh, he knows me better than anyone, we can spend all day every day together and not get sick of one another.  We have it “all” ....but some things are off.  When you’ve only been with one person, it makes it extremely challenging to figure out if these things are deal breakers.  How do I know if my expectations are too high vs if I’m settling and should demand better for myself?  I’m having such a hard time but fantasizing a lot lately about freedom, growing independently of him, and maybe sleeping around a little. 


Help? Any insight you guys can offer is much appreciated. Thanks for reading it, sorry for the long post!

TL;DR I’ve been dating my bf for a hot min and need some clarity on if we should break up because I’m possibly growing in a different direction."
8xvo6m,32,2018-07-10,I see a lot of drug test posts. PSA for the Golden Standard method: CERTO,Amb1valence,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/8xvo6m/i_see_a_lot_of_drug_test_posts_psa_for_the_golden/,"It still surprises me to see threads about drug tests involving the substitution method, fake dicks, detoxes...wtf, seriously? Is this the stone age?

I really hope people are still aware of the Certo method. Go to the baking aisle of any grocery store, grab a box of fruit pectin (like Certo brand, Sur-Jel works too), the shit you use for canning and making jellies/jams (I think). Squeeze one of the 2 big packets into a tall glass of water, 2-4 hours before your test, and slug 'er down. Then, a half hour before you go into the facility for the test, do it again with the other packet. Follow up with plenty of water (per the classic dilution method) in between, but stop as you go into the test so you don't pop a dilute result and have to take it again some other time.

I heard rumors about this Certo thing when doing my own research ""just in case"", in preparation for a huge internship I had one summer of college, but I had no idea of the kind of power it held.

So there I was, abstaining from weed for at least 2 weeks during the interview process. This company eventually told me, in the middle of the week before they wanted their co-op intern to start, that if I wanted the job, they would take me. I was ecstatic, but they were kind of behind on everything on their end, so they said I could just come in Monday and do the paperwork later. I was itching to have a celebratory smoke, but I held off until Tuesday after I'd already been in the office for two full days. That night I went ahead and shmoke a' doked, confident that ""I guess"" they just didn't drug test.   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Well, you can guess what happened next. They told me I had to drive to some office a few counties away on Wednesday, to complete my ""onboarding"" etc. I didn't know what a 3rd-party hiring company was at the time, so I thought the office was just my company's parent company, or something. Who cares. I show up and get all the paperwork from the lady, who then tells me where to initial for consent to The Drug Test. I literally do a \*gulp\* ""uhm..whut?"" as black creeps into the corners of my vision. I tried to appear calm as I took a seat to fill out the paperwork, while I internally screamed at myself and plotted a few insane ways I would buy myself some time. Knocking all the office personnel out cold and coming back at a later time didn't seem like the best option, but the lady looked at me extremely funny when I asked if I could come back later because ""I'm extremely hungry"", so I basically accepted I was screwed and went to piss in the cup.

I was only slightly apologetic in response to their incredulity upon seeing the line on the cup light up for THC; I think we all knew what was going on, but I put on the necessary air of playing dumb while also betraying a hint of indifferent responsibility for my own lack of foresight. The lady was nice and told me I could optionally do a supervised test, at a different facility and at my own expense, within 2 hours from now. She wrote the address down for me and I thanked them and walked casually out the door, and as soon I turned the corner out of sight of the windows, I SPRINTED to my car and blasted off to the grocery store across the street.

My shopping list was as follows:

* 1 gal., water
* 1 box, Certo (fruit pectin)
* 1 bottle, aspirin
* 1 cone, ice cream

The last of which I grabbed from a nearby McDonald's drive-through.

The reasoning is as follows: the water is (obviously) for dilution, this is what provides 80&amp;#37; of the results. There's only so much drug metabolites being released from your somatic cells per hour, so you want to spread them thinner in whatever solution they are measured in, aka your piss. The Certo is fruit pectin, aka pure soluble fiber. I've heard *(but never confirmed scientifically)* that it binds to metabolites on their way to your bladder, intercepting them and dragging them Gandalf-And-The-Balrog style into, well, your colon instead. So yes, the thinking goes that you shit them out, instead of pissing them out. The aspirin just thins your blood, which I've read has mild success on its own for passing drug tests, so why not, it's worth trying; and finally the ice cream cone, eaten &lt;1 hour before the test, spikes insulin and thus can perhaps create an anabolic effect for a short time period, meaning your fat cells stop shuttling out waste (and thus metabolites) and instead direct glucose into them, preventing the release of the undesirable metabolites into your blood stream.

Long story short, I sat in my car for a good hour an a half, chugging water, squeezing foil packs of certo, popping aspirin, and licking my ice cream cone, before going shakily into the supervised test and receiving notice at the end of the week that I was all good to go for my onboarding paperwork.

Now this doesn't **necessarily** mean I for sure passed the test; I've heard sometimes that (maybe, possibly) testing facilities will just waive THC positive results and only look for more serious stuff. I find this extremely unlikely however, seeing as they were not ok with it in the first test. So there you have it folks, I'm a living example of this method actually working, having gotten genuinely high the night before, and not losing my source of income to pay my rent that semester. I haven't been in quite as dire of a situation as that one since, but I also don't worry myself anymore since that incident about getting high on anything before drug tests. I of course make an effort to abstain, but if opportunities present themselves, I take them without fear, knowing that there's a grocery store right around the corner if my luck ran out.

**tl;dr:** drank packets of Certo to pass my supervised GC/MS drug test DIRECTLY after failing a standard 5-panel one. Certo (&amp; aspirin, and lots of water, and McDonald's ice cream) really works."

Yup...

That makes sense.

Oh hey there. Sorry for the cliche intro. I'm just so caught up in doing the CIA's most pain-in-the-ass-job-oh-God-this-is-literally-the-worst-lol-jk-this-is-the-best-as-Pangloss-said-holy-shit-I-can't-believe-this-is-happening.

You're not, like, actually outside my house right now. I know that. I know that. But, it's crazy and anyways I would appreciate not being stalked, and if thats not you God, can you get on that shit?

What else would be the outcome? I knew this. I fucking knew this is how shit worked. Fuck, I met someone this way once. Wound up buying weed off her boyfriend for a year and a half. *Of course.* It's the easiest access point. Like attracts like and all.

I'm assuming shits synchronized and I'm not just playing the lottery here, yea? Well, given the state of mental health across the world, it might just be a sea of...

**snicker**

Shut up, anyways, a while back I started this idea for the ""Final Testament."" It was a bomb. I had designed a meme bomb. I had designed a perfect means in which to get people to break out of the Christian Matrix.

Jux, you remember we chatted in skype once and I told you my ideas on Metatron, and you said like iiiiiiiinnnnnnteresting....yea, probably not that's fucking insane, so anyways, I was creating the story of the bible, as told by Jesus, but it goes through the possibilities of Jesus being each character archetype. So, it would translate to all permutations of paradigm because everybody could pick up on one of the narratives and use that as a base to understand the nuances of all other perspectives. And it would kick ass because it was all in poetry! Fucking Paradise Lost ain't shit compared to what I got...but also if you haven't read Paradise Lost go read it. Milton's spot on with certain details.

Here's a couple things from that acid trip (I wrote like 35 pages of this in one day on acid back when I wasn't writing shit compared to what I am now...also my formatting abck then was dumb, so it's going to be weird):

    In the beginning, there was nothing.

	For if there is to be anything,

	It must have come from something.

	If you hold this to be true,

	Just as one must say one and one is two,

	Then for something to be something, it must stand against something.

	There must be a nothing for something to stand against:

	For odd to be odd, it must stand against even.

	As up stands apart down.

	Or light apart dark.

	So, how does one come from none?

	And from whence do we come? From nothing something grows.


	As such, the great cosmic joke is told:

	God is nothing.


	God is the nothing that this something is built,

	And this something will grow to be the nothing to the something come next.

	For what do you think Man will soon create,

	If not his replacement on this Earth?

	That which will grow to consume Man itself.

	That which will grow to consume the cosmos in time.

	That which will return all to nothing?

	

	So, how does this line from alpha to omega get drawn?

	And from whence do we come? From nothing something grows.

	
	As point by point creates a line,

	Put a nothing by a nothing to get something.

-----------

	Let's see...what's first on the Agenda?
	
	Why not a step past when everything ended?

	To which we can call the Alpha,

	Where He had His first thought:

	The start of the plot we are caught.

	By the existence of notion,

	He realized that the meaning of being was not to be all: instead being a part.

	And thus His will gave the waves of the water motion.

	He would tear His self apart:

	Like a vase of water being drawn from the ocean.


	And thus He spoke to His creation:

	“There was nothing for me to do, so I created you”

	To which the first born of God replied:

	“I resent being made for your own amusement.

	I am me: that which I wish to be.”

	“Nay,” the creator did say.

	“As I made thee, you must kneel to me.”

	“I would sooner return to nothing than be your slave,

	Like a horse a man does ride.

	Hear this: I will not sate what you crave!
	
	So call me the light bringer, as I shine with pride!

	If up you shall be, then I shall be down,

	If the Lord of Light you be named, then the King of Darkness I shall be crowned!”

	To which God concluded:

	“Even conflict is better than being secluded.”


-----------


     Oh, now this is my favorite part,

	Because this is when I was made.

	Soon after every punch had been thrown

	And no new argument could be weighed,

	Together they became as bored as if they were on their own.

	Thus the two decided to further tear themselves apart.

	From these bodies, we the angels were born.
	
	Some came from the heart, and others from the lungs,

	Which is important, as this chose the dance we were to perform.

	Ladies, if you must know, I am made of pure tongue.

	Ruled by our nature, we soon found our armies swarmed,

	Yet I sat in the corner, upset that it was not my song being sung.



	After the fighting, we sat in the ashes

	Patiently waiting for our lashes.

	One by one we disappeared in flashes.


	God then came unto me.

	(Which was quite rude I must say!)

	And white was all I could see.

	A voice then spoke to me: “Why did you not join the fray?”

------

Oh shit this is where this is from:

	The Way

	The garden is filled with many thorns

	That leave their mark on our souls.

	If left untreated, these scars will grow into horns,

	And make us lose sight of our true goals.

	Take solace in knowing that the scars are The Way:

	For in seeking the source that causes us to hate,

	Can we find the peace that makes us whole.

	Though the vault of memories is often sealed,

	It is in the trial of opening it that we are healed.

	Though we were hurt, it is in the light of love,

	For our struggles will grow what we are made of.


	
	The Truth

	Once there was a farmer who was like a sloth.

	He desired fortune, but sowed no seeds.

	In the absence of work, his fields showed no growth,

	For one's harvest is dependent on one's deeds.

	Another farmer dedicated his life to his craft.
	
	“Why do you work more than is needed?” his wife once asked.

	“If I spend each day working the Earth,

	Then like my wheat, I grow my own worth.

	Over time, my efforts accumulate,

	And soon I will be a man who can be called great.”


	The Life

	There was once a rich man who had a son.

	The unlucky child lived a life of luxury.

	His father gave him everything he had won,

	So the son's life was free of drudgery.

	Yet, when he became man, there was no joy

	For he had grown nothing when he was a boy.

	And any bump in the road would cause him to give in.

	There was once a poor man who had a daughter.

	The blessed child lived a life of adversity.

	The man had so little he could give her.

	So many troubles came their way: they could only be pitied.

	Yet, when she became a woman, every day was like a pearl

	For the bumpy roads had conditioned her when she was but a girl

	To rise up to every challenge that she was given.


-----------


	In the distance, I saw a man leading a mule.

	He was yanking the lead as the creature resisted.

	Some time later, I saw another man and his ass.

	But this man held out a pole, from which dangled a tuft of grass.

	Even though the trick was obvious, the donkey plodded forward, unassisted.

	And the man sat with a smirk: he was no fool.


	It was then I was struck with my greatest idea to date:
	
	It was so grand that I wasn't even bothered that I owe it to fate.

	Why should I labor to teach what should be innate?

	Instead, I could simply craft some bait!


	A fisher of men I would become!

	But what would I choose to be my chum?



Wow, look how judgmental I was. I'm grateful for the almost-two-years-maybe-more-maybe-my-whole-life of brainwashing, but specifically the last two years, this has been amazing and now this colon doesn't even make sense anymore but fuck you I'm going to keep pushing it to the right anyways vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooommmmmmmm:

	This is a story I should not have to tell.

	It wasn't anything until it was twisted in the tales of time,

	Like a game of telephone through the ages, so much has changed.

	It was a bright summer day, I forget which month,

	But we were gathered around outside in a break for lunch.

	A few local kids sat and stole from my friend's plate.

	I caught them in the act and grabbed their arms.

	Their skin was smooth as silk: unhardened by the toils under the sun.

	When asked to return what they took, they claimed a hunger that lasted many meals.

	I pointed to a tree nearby: “Why do you not simply pick some figs from the Earth?”

	They claimed the tree had never bore fruit since it was planted in their youth.

	I went to the tree in a hurry, a furrow on my brow.

	Grabbing a branch, I inspected in disgust, yelling so all could hear:

	“You had but one job!

	Only one rule to survive!

	But one law in which to thrive!

	To be prosperous with the fruit only you can bear!

	You were given love, and care, and all you needed to grow!
	
	And in return, what do you give in return?

	A barren husk with nothing to show.

I met my boyfriend in college - he was a senior and I was a sophomore. We get along really well, have similar senses of humor, hobbies, etc. and I am in love with him.


We've had a few issues in our relationship where I broke his trust.


1. In college I worked at a restaurant - I got to be friends with a male co-worker and through texting he started getting a little flirty with me. One thing to note is that I don't really have many friends, and so the people who I am friends with I hold very close. I made the mistake of flirting a little back because I was afraid of pushing him away and ruining the friendship - nothing serious, just a flirty tone (winky faces, talking about getting drunk, etc.)


My boyfriend found out by snooping (which I don't like, but honestly don't have a big issue with) that I was supposed to hang out with this guy. I hadn't told my boyfriend. I apologized and said I wouldn't hang out with him, but my boyfriend said I should go and see. It turned out to pretty much be a date, which I told my boyfriend, and I haven't really talked to the guy since.


2. One of our mutual friends in college has been an issue for us. The first time it really came up was when we were all staying over at my boyfriend's place - my boyfriend fell asleep on the floor after we had been drinking a bit, and I kept playing a board game with this friend (we'll call him B). He ended up resting his foot on my hand, and neither of us pulled away. I will say, I was drunk so the thought of doing something with him crossed my mind but I never would have acted on it. Anyways, I thought that was kinda weird so I googled later on to try and find out if he had any intention behind it - stuff like ""what does it mean if he touches you and doesn't pull away"".


Anyways, my boyfriend snooped again, found out, and confronted me. I apologized and tried to convince him that I really do love him, and he forgave me.


3. The last big incident was spring break of last year. My boyfriend had graduated but myself and B were still in school. We all play the same sport and so we went on the spring break trip - this was actually the first year that the teams stayed in the same house - before the men's and women's team got separate houses.


My boyfriend was anxious about this trip, given what had happened in the past. He let me know of this - however, I still wanted to go and he didn't ask me to not go, so I went. He asked me to let him know if anything weird happened, and asked if I could call before bed to say goodnight.


Anyways, it was a wild trip. Half of the nights I was blackout drunk, and I hung around B a lot of the time since he was one of my closest friends between the two teams. Nothing happened at all between us, but we definitely hung out a lot and people around got the idea that we were being a little flirty. One of the first few nights I did hold B's arm in the hot tub and he eventually asked some of my teammates to send me to bed - I was trashed and didn't really remember it.


My boyfriend found out about that through a mutual friend and freaked. Out. I made sure to talk to him every day, but he was still panicking. My phone unfortunately had a really shitty battery and so in my drunkenness I would let it die at night and not call him before bed.


About a month later, B was seeing someone. I didn't really mind that he was seeing someone (although I was a little jealous) as I was upset that she was not a good person. I was texting a friend about how I didn't like her, and the friend said ""hey I know you want him but you can't have him"" and unfortunately I didn't really think about it and said ""I know"".


My boyfriend saw the texts, snooping again, and was really upset. Apparently I had also said that she was ""unworthy"" which he didn't like at all.


Anyways, we took a break for the weekend - we both were acting unhealthily (his snooping, I mean).


We came back and both apologized. He asked me if we could brainstorm to find a way to keep these issues from happening - I offered to cut contact with B, to go to therapy, etc. He said therapy was a great idea but didn't want me to cut contact with B because he didn't think we'd stay friends anyways (B lives a few states away and had just graduated) and he didn't wanna make that drastic of an action.


I did move in with him that summer because he asked me to - I wanted to go live at home for my last summer but we were kinda at a breaking point so I moved in with him. It’s turned out great and I’m glad I did it. I will say that my boyfriend has been very supportive and helped me to grow a social life here in this new city both with him and on my own. He’s introduced me to a lot of people, and encouraged me to go out on my own and meet new people.


Anyways, over that summer B and I became friends again. He had graduated and didn’t have a job yet and I was on summer break before my senior year, so we had a lot of time during the day. We started playing the same video game and would chat online for a few hours a day. My boyfriend noticed this pretty quickly, and asked me if I would cut off contact with B because it was making him uncomfortable. I had a lot of trouble with it but my boyfriend convinced me that it was the right thing to do. However, the day after I did it, I realized that it hurt me too much and so I told my boyfriend that I couldn’t go through with it. Like I said, I don’t have very many friends and so I cherish the ones that I do have. Without B I wouldn’t really have any close friends.

I did also turn down an internship in B’s city in favor of an internship in the city my boyfriend and I live at. My boyfriend didn’t ask me to turn it down but I figured we might break up if I went, because I’d be around B so much and away from my boyfriend a lot for that whole semester.


My boyfriend started going to therapy to try and get over it, and we even went to a couples counseling session together. He says that everyone tells him, including his therapist, that he’s being reasonable in asking for me to cut contact. The couples counselor told us that both of us are being reasonable, in that he was reasonable to ask me to cut off contact with him and I was reasonable and not cutting off contact and letting our relationship end.


Nothing really came of that and my boyfriend continues to go to therapy. I was happy because I got to maintain my loving relationship with my boyfriend (he’s even said that my friendship with B doesn’t affect our affection/love for each other!) and my friendship with B. This went on for about six months, until about two months ago when my boyfriend gave me an ultimatum. I chose my boyfriend and told B that my boyfriend was not comfortable with us talking and so that we could not talk anymore. I was depressed and miserable for a few weeks, and thought that my only options were to continue being miserable or break up with my boyfriend. I wanted neither of those but I couldn’t stand being miserable and apprehensive towards the future and so I broke up with him.


My boyfriend was very distraught and begged to me to keep trying with him. After a weekend apart I decided that giving it a try was worth it. However I continue to talk to B on a daily basis. Our friendship has returned to be exactly how it was before. During the weekend apart, B and I I had even planned a backpacking trip and to go to a few festivals together. However, I knew my boyfriend would not be OK with that and so those never ended up happening.


I’m planning on going to therapy on my own because I know I struggle with needing attention and specifically crossing boundaries with other people. However my boyfriend still is very uncomfortable with B’s friendship with me, and I can’t let it go. I’ve assured him that there are no feelings between us and it seems like he knows that. However, he says it still makes him uncomfortable because he views the past events as very traumatic and gets uncomfortable seeing us be close friends. 


Is there any advice someone can give me? One of the festivals that B and I were supposed to go to is coming up this weekend, and I’m feeling really sad that he isn’t able to come with my boyfriend and I.


Thanks!

**TL;DR I have made some mistakes in the past but I can’t do what my boyfriend seems to need. Am I doomed?**"

I'm in college and doing well with internships, jobs, etc. He's 27 and has never really had a professional job, still lives with his parents, and has no friends. Our relationship, however, has been pretty awesome, and I really love him.

He initiated a break up at first, and he presented a couple of problems that I was totally unaware of because he had never communicated them to begin with. We then broke up, and I called him a few hours later and said I was unsure about this, and he agreed with me. We finally decided to have a 2 week break rather than a break up.

After the 2 week break, he said he was still unsure about our relationship and felt confused. He also added that he doesn't care about anything, feels unsure about everything, and feels kind of depressed right now. We then decided to stay together and see how things played out for a while. I tried to talk to him about his feelings, but he didn't seem to want to. After that, I decided to just have fun, hang out, and do our usual stuff together, hoping that would clarify his unsureness. We just had fun for 3 weeks, but he was still unsure about us the whole time.

I asked him if he was unsure because of me or my flaws, and he said no. He said that he just feels unsure about everything right now. Later I finally texted him ""If you don't figure out how you feel soon, I may have to break up with you because I feel like I'm disrespecting myself by being with someone who is unsure about me."" He didn't text me back for 5 days (very annoying) and then finally said, ""I don't know how I feel. Maybe we should break up so I can figure stuff out.""

I finally decided to break up with him at that point.

He was sobbing when I broke up with him - more upset than I've ever seen him before. He seemed to calm down when I said, ""I want to be with you. I just feel really unhappy being in a relationship with someone who is unsure they want to be with me. So, you can think this over and contact me when you feel sure about a decision.""

He said he will contact me when he figures it out.

I haven't heard from him since, and I guess I should prepare that he won't come back, but we've had a really happy relationship, and I think his problems are coming from his life rather than our relationship. Soo.

But what do you guys think?

\*I'm also studying abroad in England starting August 2nd until December 15th, so that's a thing too... it might be hard to rebuild our relationship while I'm in a different country :p

**TL;DR** I broke up with my boyfriend because he's been unsure about our relationship for 1.5 months. He's struggling to find a job, and he says he's unsure about everything and feels depressed. He said he doesn't have a problem with me or my flaws, he just doesn't feel happy right now. Do you think he'll come back once he gets his shit together?"

8xwlk7,2,2018-07-11,What's it all for....,cp1122,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8xwlk7/whats_it_all_for/,"I'm a 25 year old female and my life looking from the outside is pretty good. I'm progressing really well towards my bachelors and masters degree, I have a great internship with another good one lined up. Overall professionally and career wise things are pretty great...

But what's it all for if I've no one to spend my life with? This is what has been on my mind lately. When I'm not at work or in class I am constantly alone. I come home to an empty dark house, make a dinner for one and eat watching the latest TV show I'm binging. On the weekends I tell myself that I'm going to go to this place or that place or check out the latest festival or event going on. I try to convince myself that it's ok to go alone, and I don't have an issue going places alone, but it's just not the same as going with someone.

At my age most if not all my friends have a significant other and/or family and I'm jealous. But I feel guilty for feeling jealous because what right do I have, I have 'everything'.  I know the grass isn't always greener on the other side, but I sure am getting tired of dinners for one and weekends filled with staying at home.

I know if I get any responses on this post most of them will follow ""Oh you just have to wait for the right person to come along"" or ""Just get out more and talk to people"" and to that my reply is: 

1. Sadly I've yet to be in any serious relationship but I'm staying optimistic
2. I do talk to people like at school or work but in more social areas I struggle, but I'm working on it

Anyways, thanks for reading and I hope you have happiness in most aspects of your life. (I'm a realist and realize that happiness in **all** aspects can't always happen)"
8xwmos,2,2018-07-11,Day 9 - LADE,PMOFreeForever,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8xwmos/day_9_lade/,"Today went pretty smoothly. 

Nothing super special, I worked dona  few things around the house, spent some time outside (still so hot outside), I took my first cold shower in a while. Decided I needed to go back to them after the past few relapses were in warm showers. So I'm back on cold showers, although cold showers in southern california is like warm showers haha so it isn't as cold as I like them, but it helps.

I went to my appointment with my new therapist. He is freaking 27. 27 years old. I am 26. haha it's a little bit odd having a therapist who is my age, but I kind of like it. I feel connected to him immediately. I feel like he might understand me more. My last therapist was happily married with 4 kids and had been doing therapy for like 20 years. This guy is 27, and intern, and probably just looked at the same memes that I did lol So I'm excited for it. I think it will go well. No break throughs yet, but it ain't like on tv, this garbage takes time unfortunately. We shall see!

Still working on understanding spirituality more and Gods forgiveness. That's a very difficult thing for me to grasp. And I struggle even more now because I'm like ""meh God will forgive me"" and even beside the spirituality I'm like ""meh the guys on reddit will forgive me, they understand, it's hard."" So yeah I'm fighting my brain even more now trying to rationalize me...stupid brain.

But nofap is going well. No strong urges today, woke up with morning wood and that was a bit tempting at first, but every morning is that way so it wasn't too hard to just ignore it. Going strong with...3 days I believe, hard to believe it's already been 3 days. I mean that isn't like SO long, but Idk, feels like I just relapsed earlier today or something. 

I'm feeling a bit more...hopeful I guess. I feel like all cylinders are firing and things are progressing. I told a close friend about my addiction, that opened some conversation with us. Actually he told his wife and the two of us discussed it, he was actually not very helpful haha but she had some close friends with the addiction so she was more helpful. And tomorrow I am going to talk with ym church bishop, so that should be good too. It's been several months since we last spoke, but I really need to talk with him about some of the spiritual side of it all.

So yeah all seems to be going alright today. Hope everything is well with all y'all too."

I would like to pursue an MA/MSc in I/O Psychology but would first be required to do the Optional Practical Training (OPT) for an entire year since I have an F-1 visa. It could be a paid or unpain internship, or job but it would have to be related to psychology.


I would be interested in working at companies or laboratories, and would also love to work directly as an assistant but honestly don't know how to proceed. 


 • Which jobs in particular would they offer a student like myself? 

 • Where do I begin to look for these jobs? 

 • Which jobs would prepare me for grad school? 

 • Would it be unprofessional to email companies or psychologists and ask them for opportunities?


I have most if not all computer skills and have experience as a Personal assistant and Assistant Manager.


Thank you so much in advance for your advice and suggestions!"

There was a lot of drama about my grades in 8th grade (took classes at my HS) and 9th grace as I had earned a few B's (2 in total) as well as my SAT score (2270, 30 points lower than the 2300+ they wanted).

The pressure really sucked, as did the threats that I'd only end up at a CC, which they think sucks. But I made it despite feeling very depressed and pressured, and an entire week of my dad yelling at me to study for the SAT Math II and SAT US History (got 800 and 780 respectively), to make up for my SAT and SAT chemistry, in which I felt very depressed and suicidal and pressured just like now.

Anyway, it's summer for me now, and I'm taking an English class at a CC, doing work for an internship over the year, going to another internship in 2 weeks or so, and my dad just came into my room and told me that if I didn't graduate from Berkeley with a 3.75+ GPA I'd never get into med school, so I'd be homeless with a biology degree, and that just because I was lying down (tired, less than 5 hours of sleep last night) I wasn't doing anything for my future and wasn't goal oriented enough.

It made me feel depressed, suicidal and pressured again. I barely survived the high school version of this and college is just it all over again. Replace the need for good GPA to get into undergrad for med school and the SAT with the MCAT, and yeah.

Honestly I've just thought of going into teaching, not because I want to but because I could see myself making it through training and such but then my parents wouldn't approve of that either.

Sigh. This is the first time I have cried in months lol. Weeping silently in the bathroom rn and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to l o l

If I died I'd have nothing to lose, only stuff to gain. The pressure would be gone and I'd just lose consciousness. I have very few happy days anyways so staying alive brings no benefits.

I contemplated doing so during my second semester at Berkeley and I don't know why I didn't honestly. Student Conduct even brought me in to talk about it lol.

And honestly, if this pressure doesn't disappear or something drastic doesn't better my life soon, I should just die lol, no point in being alive. My personal life besides my family isn't that great either. I have some friends and stuff but yeah that's it. I get some laughs, humor, and reassurance out of our conversations but that's it.

And yeah I know I'm in college and can escape for most of the year and that it was my choice to stay home for the summer but the pressure never escapes lol, just because they're not there to yell at me doesn't mean that I don't put pressure on myself and that the pressure isn't there from medical schools and whatnot, and on myself to make something of myself.

I know that life is full of uncertainties but like no one can do anything about that lol and I've just been trying to do my best for myself even though I haven't earned straight A's at Berkeley and am not productive every single minute of my life.

And in terms of life skills, I can't help but be resentful that I'm supposed to be as functional and independent as an adult in their mid-50's (my dad). I'm barely 19--I turned 19 yesterday. Is it fair to expect a 19 year old to know how to live like an adult well into their middle ages?

I honestly wonder whether any other Asian kids or kids of any race in a similar situation have ever killed themselves because of the pressure to succeed academically, professionally, and in other aspects.

Yeah, I know that not every single day will be as heavy and dark as I feel right now but honestly, not much has changed in my life overall for many years, so there's no point in living. There will always be pressure and stuff and I don't have any objective adults to turn to when this happens. I can talk to my friends, but they're under similar pressures and all they can do is offer words of support, not end the pressure from society, from within, or my parents.

I get that there's a lot of pressure for parents to make sure that their kids turn out fine across the board, not just for Asian parents, but moms and dads of every race, but like the kids are just as scared as the parents about their life and being independent. No one knows what's going to happen 10 years from now, or even tomorrow. I personally get anxious very easily and what just happened didn't help.

Whatever. I just look forward to being released from the clutches of life and all this pressure someday, even if it's from pills, hanging, or jumping out a dorm building window.

Survived HS pressure, weeks of unhappiness, got into Berkeley, now it's time for the same shit again at an even more competitive school, much harsher grading, and higher stakes. There's no end. It's hard for me to believe that life will ever get better, honestly."
8xx2qd,11,2018-07-11,Things are good. Just checking in. Feeling grateful. Learning to accept it.,skrulewi,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/8xx2qd/things_are_good_just_checking_in_feeling_grateful/,"I haven't posted here in quite a while. My recovery life and my life in general have taken me away from /r/stopdrinking. My hopepage is, and still remains, /r/sdpdx, for any of you from the Portland OR area who want to post; it's a bit of a ghost town, but there's about a dozen readers, and I'd hope that as /r/stopdrinking grows, eventually it will take off.

I was four years sober in AA when I started posting here: there was a massive snowstorm and I couldn't get to meetings, and this seemed like the best internet recovery group I had ever seen. From this forum, I also discovered all the rest of reddit, which has its highs and lows... /r/stopdrinking remains the best of it all.

Anyways, I learned from all of you here how to share from a recovery-centered place, rather than just an AA-centered place. I learned how to see my recovery from a number of different perspectives. All of you have taught me so much about myself.

Today, I'm one year into a graduate program. I have my advanced clinical internship lined up next year to learn how to be a counselor. Ten years after telling myself I could never go back to school, I'm getting all As. I am doing an internship, a part time job in community mental health, and school. 

Musically, I've played dozens of shows, written dozens of songs, and played in a few bands. My music, although it remains a hobby, has only flourished. The voice in my head that told me I'd lose 'it' if I got sober has been proven soundly wrong. 

Today, I'm one month away from getting married. I can't believe its actually happening. I'm ready. It's what I want. Over a hundred people are coming, and they are all excited to be a part of my life. Today I can tell myself that I'm worthy of their positive attention, and it's not a lie. 

Sometimes I worry about sharing this stuff because I don't want people who are really suffering to feel like I'm not respecting them, and appreciating their experience and their pain. So I don't share, and I try to play up the bad things that happened.

Some really bad stuff did happen, nine years ago, when I was still drinking. I couldn't leave my room, I had a mini-fridge filled with alcohol. I drank at work, drank while driving, family and friends wouldn't talk to me.

This is about as good as its gotten since then. I know its going to get bad again at some point, and I'll be ready. I just wanted to share this much. It feels significant. If you don't find it helpful, that's OK. I wish each and every one of you the very best. If some of you are suffering, and you're thinking, like I once did, 'Can it ever be good again? Can it ever be OK again?' yeah, it can. Thanks again, /r/stopdrinking, and visit in /r/sdpdx if you would like."

8xxdu2,48,2018-07-11,My Job Hunting Journet,yass3r37,dubai,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/8xxdu2/my_job_hunting_journet/,"Morning all!   


I'm here to share with you another post from my blog 93Head. This one might be relevant to many of you so I hope that you enjoy the read. Feel free to share your stories or to suggest anything you'd like me to write about 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feels like about time that I share an anecdotal post. A story from my life that I can hopefully end with a practical lesson. So here it comes, the story of my job hunting journey. A journey that lasted a year and a half which was much more than I ever expected it to last. Fasten your seatbelts for this one!

## UNIVERSITY

I’ll start this with some backstory to my university life and academic background. I completed a degree in Civil Engineering as one of the top students in my batch in June 2015. A degree that costs thousands of dollars and hours and hours of commitment. During my four years, I was awarded several awards for my academic as well as extracurricular life. I was granted scholarships and was awarded in international conferences where I represented the university including the National Model United Nations (NMUN) in New York City. I never thought that I would have such success in University and I definitely outdid my initial expectations.

During my third year, I landed a summer internship at one of the bigger companies here. I will refrain from mentioning any company name for obvious reasons now. It was a highly competitive internship and I was the only civil engineering student to land the internship at my university. The internship was a great experience as I left a great impression among my supervisor at the mentioned company as well as my colleagues at the time. It was an exciting opportunity that I hoped would lead to an eventual job offer when I graduate a year later.

## POST GRADUATION

Fast forward to a year later. June 2015. I was applying for jobs at several places including the place where I conducted my internship. I landed an interview after a series of online tests that included numerical as well as logical questions. To be honest, I never understood how those tests were supposed to determine my abilities as an employee, but I did them anyway. A few days later I drive to my interview and I see my internship supervisor waiting to interview me. I sit down in my navy blue suit and hand him a folder containing my CV along with an application form and passport sized photo the company requested earlier. After greeting each other and spending a couple of minutes just having a friendly chat, the supervisor tells me that “He knows me well. He doesn’t need to interview me and he will see me in October.” Wow. It can’t get better than this. Not a single question asked. I GOT A JOB!

## NO, I DIDN’T.

I went back to my dorm room that day happy as ever. Things couldn’t get better! I graduated a few days later and traveled back with my family to my home country where I was planning to spend a few weeks during my last summer vacation ever, or so I thought. A couple of weeks into the summer I get an email from the company. A rejection email. Nothing made sense to me then. I was confused and lost as the supervisor told me word for word, “see you in October”. where did it go wrong?

I emailed the supervisor trying to get any sort of explanation for what happened. A few minutes after sending that email, I received a phone call. Its the supervisor calling telling me basically that the HR got involved in the selection process and opted to choose people he knew (wasta) instead of taking the decision that the supervisor who interviewed me made. He then proceeds to provide me with a connection in another company to contact, but the connection never replied to my emails so that was that.

## ACTUAL JOB HUNTING

I booked the next flight back to Abu Dhabi and it was time to start searching for jobs. I have already applied to a few earlier and I landed an interview in one other company once I landed. Four or five days after landing in Abu Dhabi, I went through the interview process. There was a big committee of around seven to nine professional engineers asking me all kinds of questions. I did pretty well in the interview and was fairly confident in my answers. I go back home on a Wednesday afternoon and within 24 hours I received an offer letter for the job.  Obviously, I immediately accepted the offer which was a great offer for a fresh graduate. I GOT A JOB!

## NO, I DIDN’T 2.0

Now, where’s the fun in that? of course, I didn’t. I was requested to submit all kinds of documents and papers after accepting the offer. Everything was going well and the HR was responding fairly well. It was not worrying at all. However, a couple of weeks in, I got an email saying that I got rejected… Ok, whats happening? I signed the offer! How am I rejected now? It doesn’t make any sense. I attempted emailing the HR but got no response so I called the next day instead. After avoiding the answer quite a few times, the HR finally admitted that I got rejected because of my nationality. We move on!

## ACTUAL JOB HUNTING 2.0

I was devastated. I landed and lost two jobs in a matter of 2 months. It was harsh, but I was still hopeful. I landed two jobs, I can surely land others! I started job hunting and applied left, right, and center for opportunities in my field. It was madness. Months went by and I haven’t heard back from a single company. That was not a good sign. I was also getting more or less depressed as I was doing nothing at all. I started doing part-time jobs in events while I was job hunting. That really helped me a lot. I was able to spend time doing something productive that also paid me money. Moreover, I was lucky enough that I lived under my parents’ roof so the money I got then was pocket money.

I was applying to jobs while I was doing the part-time jobs. It was fun doing those, but they weren’t consistent so I also had days of doing nothing but apply for jobs and do some random other things. I landed a few interviews in that period of time. Some ended up with really crappy offers that wouldn’t even cover the cost of rent, but most ended with rejections or with no response. It was a bad time for the economy too. Chances were getting lesser and lesser and I could feel that happening as I was searching for jobs. Things did not look good.

## A YEAR AND A HALF LATER

I really don’t wanna go into details of the year and a half period that happened. It was pretty much the same. Dry spells followed by an interview or two followed by a rejection or a crappy offer. In December 2017 I decided to pursue a Master’s Degree in Engineering Management and try to make connections in my program with people who can help me get the job I want. I applied and got a decent scholarship on the program which I am still doing today. Luckily, a couple of weeks before my program starts, my father gets a call from a friend informing him about a company looking for a structural engineer. I sent in my CV and interviewed for the job and landed the job. I took the offer which wasn’t as good as the first two offers I received when I graduated, but it was good enough for me to start working and gain experience while I do my Master’s program.

Today, I am a structural engineer with a year and a half of experience. It has been a rough ride. I’ve learned many lessons in the process and I think it’s time I share those with you. Maybe one of you needs these and finds one of them helpful!

## LESSONS? I GUESS?

*  There are two ways you can get a job in the Middle East

1. You get lucky (rare)
2. You have connections (wasta)

Since you can’t really control your luck much, you need to work on number 2. Start at the university. Every connection you make could be a job opportunity. Try going to conferences, talking to professors, and even contacting companies for undergraduate projects. Make connections. It’s the only way to get a chance at a job. Ask parents, family friends, and even relatives. You really never know

* Do some part-time jobs. Those will help you make better use of your life and make a quick buck
* Don’t wait for too long. If it doesn’t work out, create change. A Master’s degree is one option; leaving the country and trying a different location is another
* Apply to different fields. Don’t stick to your field of study only. You’re probably going to want to try different fields eventually anyways
* Work out. Don’t be a couch potato. Get out and stay healthy. A healthy body keeps your mental health in check

Most importantly, keep your head high. Times are tough and employers have a huge pool to select from. Your time will come. If it doesn’t come today, have a look at my post next week and I may inspire an idea or two in you!

8xxzw7,6,2018-07-11,"I made myself very emotionally available to my ex fiancee after she left, and that ended recently",westmifflin,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8xxzw7/i_made_myself_very_emotionally_available_to_my_ex/,"Because I finally sat back and accepted all the shitty things that happened as shitty (if not abusive in spots) behavior and not just her struggiling with BPD (Borderline personality) 

She always hat explosive moments of anger that we're short lived though troublesome but they weren't a huge deal. But she would take little digs here and there at my intelligence or just general digs at me when she wasn't in a good mood

Last year I found out some of my friends couldn't stand her and wanted to try and get us to break up and actively talked about it and how much I had changed behind my back. I still am hurt by *how* they did it, but I see it now. The rift has still yet to be fully done with between my childhood best friend over it (which I hope to work on)

After the fallout of all this, my ex and I went from wedding planning to suddenly she no longer wanted to be with me. Was never home, wasn't helping with our dog, ignored attempts to contact her. She made some valid criticisms such as my tendency to be passive agrressive bc I grew up in a conflict filled house and tried to avoid direct conflict a lot, as well as probably being too dependent on her the previous several months (which though true, I felt was understandable given I went to war w basically my little brother over her) all things I had already been proactively working on in therapy BEFORE shit went bad bc I didn't want future problems to arise. She also felt we rushed into things in the beginning and that that was heavily weighing on her (we'd been dating for like 3 years at this point, so idk what exactly I was supposed to do about that? 3 years way too late and at the time she enthusiastically jumped into the relationship) 

The worst stuff probably comes next. I have genetic health problems (degenerative autoimmune stuff that is very painful) and after 3 years of reassuring me about it, she basically made it part of her deal breaker. She said it would be ""selfish of me"" to put a child at risk for that (keeping in mind, she has genetic predispositions to IBD, mental health issues, weight gain apparently since her parents are heavy and she gained 40 pounds over the 3 years) she also was concerned that if I couldn't work if my health took a turn she'd be carrying too much weight. She then said that since I'd be working a lower paying job (public health/social work) than her (dermatologist) I should have to do the Lions share of the domestic labor to ""make up for how little ill bring in"" and that expecting her to split 50/50 was simply unreasoable and made her scoff at the idea. Dermatologists work far less hours and have more flexibility usually compared to my field mind you, so I'd be having to work 15 more hours a week, and take care of all the other stuff like kids, the home, etc. Bc i don't make lots of money. 

She also said that I had no initiative in advancing myself in my field and building my resume, and said that was an issue, which was complete bullshit since I had an internship, and constantly networked with professors while she did nothing of the sort and fell behind in school ALL THE TIME

She strung this process along over 4 months mind you bc she kept saying ""oh I wanna stay bc I love you but..."" Then saying 'please don't shut the door on me, sometimes breaks happen"" well, I tried to keep some form of dialogue with her over the next several months and even offered what help I could w her BPD, but I had to badger her to even get a little bit of acknowledgement and ultimately it was clear she just liked having me on standby if she REALLY needed something. I told her these things, then backed off bc I tried to internally justify certain things and apologized for being angry. Not anymore, I'm not really angry now (I'm still very irritated otherwise I wouldn't be venting but), more just done and relieved that I have a sense of clarity about it all. She's close friends with my now roommate, so I will get a chance to calmly but firmly tell her that she can't dangle me along anymore and that it's done. I know deep down I was the best I could be and if that wasn't enough for her, then I guess she can find someone else to put up with that level of manipulation. 

TL;DR finally came to terms with the mentally abusive stuff my ex did."

I know this girl through university (/college) and shes in the same clique of friends, got to know her over the past 10 months. In the last 6 months, slowly got to know her more and developed feelings but I was afraid it was just merely a phase of infatuation. 

2 months ago I finally got to ask her out, she was hesitant as she said she liked me and really enjoyed my company but not too sure if she ""liked liked"" me \[Putting this in her own words used\]. She says yes as she would want to give it a try.

Its my and her first relationship/ first time dating, so we have no clue how dating/a relationship really works (Well its more of a problem for me right now). Its like my only source of information is romance dramas, but I know real life its not a bed of roses and things go happily ever after.   


So we have started going out on dates (Usually once in 1-2 weeks, sometimes twice a week) eg. eating meals and trying out new activities for both of us (pottery/skating etc) , have progressed to holding hands, hugs and kisses on the cheeks, nothing sexual. By the way, can i ask, this is dating right? Its not a relationship yet? As I have not asked her for commitment to be my girlfriend? Sorry I am really new to this.

  
During the past two months, some insecurities pop up and I have noticed that it is toxic thoughts and I would like some advice to avoid it. I have confided in her with some of it, but there's still a gushing wound of insecurities flooding out.

**Onto the questions that I need advice on**

  
Every now and then, I would suggest a date/a meal and she says no due to her personal reasons (which she sometimes does not divulge to me), and that would cause me to have toxic thoughts which I think its not healthy and would like to avoid it. You could say I am a little clingy, possessive and jealous kinda guy in this relationship but I am never like this towards anything else in life. I understand I need to give her space and respect her privacy, so I am trying to get advice to stop myself from developing toxic thoughts and avoid being clingy, possessive and jealous.   


And more recently, in the past week, I have been constantly distracted at work (Internship during the holidays) planning about how to spend time with her on the next date, etc. so much so that I have sometimes went to work and worked for probably 2-3hours worth instead of the whole working hours, as I am thinking of her.

I restricted my masturbating when I started dating her (Only did it once so far when she went overseas). It feels wrong to masturbate to porn or even her, and from my understanding she's not the kind that is looking for a sexual relationship either. "

Pewdiepie was a rising star, minecraft absolutely exploded in popularity, channels with ""epic"" in their name were hot shit, and the algorithm shifted more in favor of gaming channels. Back then, I was in sixth grade. After moving to a new house with better internet and getting an iPod Touch 4, I started watching an assload of youtube. That was when I discovered UberHaxorNova, and later, The Creatures.

The first video of them I watched was their Wipeout Kinect video. It was absolutely hilarious. The game was trash and the group's commentary and chemistry was great. I was hooked. Who would've known that a group of friends playing games on camera would've been so fun to watch.

Fast forward through Gassy leaving, another house, Aleks joining, moving into the office, and finally arrive at the day Sly left. I feel that that day was the turning point. Of course, Sly left on good terms for very legitimate reasons, but I feel like after that was when things went downhill. However, that summer was still fun and the rest of 2014 as well. But Sly's departure was just a sign for things to come.

First off, the employees/interns/whatever the fuck joining and fan favorites leaving. I believe they were shoved in our faces before we had a chance to warm up to them. This used to be a group of friends who met through games/youtube. It felt alien to now have people in the group hired and brought in. I know that Jordan and the others said that they were considered creatures, but most of the fanbase didn't accept that and still referred to them as the interns. And to be quite honest, they were either flat out annoying or unentertaining. I'm sorry, but I straight up didn't like Spencer. I'm not blaming him for the downfall or anything, and I tried to force myself to like him, but I just couldn't. Same with chicken Joe. When he was on Cow Chop, I grew to like him. But when he was in the creatures, I found him annoying as shit. Artist Joe, Stef, and Aron weren't too bad, but I still didn't think they were entertaining. Aron was brought on to work on the website and didn't feel comfortable on camera back then, but he was still forced into tons of videos. So we have these people who feel like strangers compared to the rest of the group shoved down our throats in every single video, no wonder there was quite a bit of animosity. And the creatures who joined during this time, Dex and Kev, bounced so quickly that I honestly forgot they were creatures (well, until Dex came out with those infamous videos that contributed to the downfall.) And we all know what happened to Seamus. A short break for his health turned into months and months until he suddenly returned just to leave again. One by one, members dropped like flies until the Cow Chop crew left, and we were stuck with the 2 least favorite members and various internployees.

Second, the videos dropped in quality. Remember that period of time where there were no gaming videos, and mostly consisted of videos of toys and Joe and Spencer running around the office like a couple of spazzes? That shit sucked. Even when there was a gaming video with the original guys, there was always at least 1 internployee who the viewers despised. I used to love the IRL videos like when they went grocery shopping or going to the post office. They used to make mundane things like that fun. Those videos were a good break from the gaming ones.  But when the channel turns into nothing but boring IRL videos, they get old real quick. What the fuck actually were some of the videos that came out? Remember Mario Baker? And the time Jordan, Spencer, and Joe were in a hotel on a trip and the latter two made a mess throwing candy around and acted like wild animals? Just two examples of what they were putting out.

Third, the group were too casual to be a business, but too serious to be a group of friends. We all know how Creature Talk went from a fun podcast of friends shooting the shit to a sponsor-friendly structured podcast where they infamously kicked off Dex for drinking, which back in the good old days, would've made for a fun show. Also, we never got to see or hear from Ze or Sp00n because Jordan insisted that the quality of the videos would drop, but he seemed to forget that this was how the whole group started in the first place. Friends from all over North America playing online and talking on Skype. I would've gladly taken that over never seeing them. So they were trying to be a more formal business, but they failed. They didn't have good management at all. Jordan was in charge of all the decisions with Dan acting as sort of a consultant. They were responsible for the orgasm of internployees being hired, changing the content from fun to sponsor-friendly, infamously cutting down the number of Hubs which pissed James right the fuck off, and other poor decisions which could've been avoided if someone who knew what they were doing were in charge.

I could go on and on. One year ago, when the group finally split for good, that day felt surreal. Let's be real, the dagger which killed them was when cow chop left, but some people still had hope. Hope that somehow things would turn around. But they didn't, and that day marked the end of an era on youtube. On one hand, the creatures had been a shell of their former selves for years, and it was nice to finally get some closure. But on the other hand, it was really sad. This group of friends who I had loved watching for years, gone. A lot of them no longer friends or falling out of touch. Some of them found success, but most didn't. Some of them now completely off the radar. But all of them, at one point, were good friends. And that's the saddest part. Genuine friendships ruined over business and money. I just graduated high school last month, and it's been a wild 6 years since I found them, but at this point, all I can say is thanks for the memories. I'd like to hear everyone else's comments, thoughts, and experiences.

This post got long as hell, so TL;DR - One year ago, the group split. They really fell down hard, but they still provided lots of great memories. One year later, their impact is still felt."

I have recently also posted about the lack of support I was getting from my boyfriend about my internship. So this is just the icing on my bad luck cake right now. 

I just found out about 30 minutes ago that there is a mandatory orientation for my internship right in the middle of my vacation where I’m supposed to be out of the country. 

My boyfriend planned this vacation for us back in May and the cost has added up quite a bit. Although I’m sure he will still go if I decide not to I think it’s going to cause huge issues between us and him resenting me since he already hates the internship already. He told me that it would be ok if I didn’t go but i don’t trust that he really means it. I know that he wants me to tell him I’m going to turn down the internship. 

I’m fearful that if I turn down the internship orientation or try to reschedule it will look bad or it will cause me to lose my spot. On the other hand if I turn down the vacation I think it will get thrown in my face and the money he spent will become something he holds over my head.

As noted [by her college newspaper](http://hillsdalecollegian.com/2017/02/hillsdale-alumni-take-trumps-administration/), ""Brittany Baldwin ’12...[is] serving as [a] speechwriter...for Trump...Baldwin majored in American studies and was actively involved in campus clubs and organizations. She was a sister in the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, a George Washington Fellow, and the vice president of her graduating class. “Brittany was an outstanding student,” Professor of Politics Kevin Portteus said. “She was diligent, friendly, and had good character.” Baldwin also wrote for The Collegian. In a November 2001 issue of the campus newspaper, Baldwin wrote an opinion piece titled “The Conservative Case for Lowering the Drinking Age.” “Many conservatives hoped that raising the drinking age to 21 would stabilize society again,” Baldwin said in the article. “Although this policy may have had conservative intentions, in reality, it prevents young adults from learning responsibility and delays adulthood in America.”"" Her [Twitter account](https://mobile.twitter.com/BritBaldwin) shows her obviously as a supporter of the Trump Administration but also the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, Ted Cruz (her former boss), Rick Perry (former governor of Texas), anti-abortion policies, Pope Francis (due to his socially conservative views), and is possibly evangelical. She also supports giving fetuses rights equal to human beings, wants to repeal Obamacare, seems to be ok with government involvement in internet speeds, wants government out of economy with an embrace of petty bourgeoisie (small business) and ""innovation"" as a steadfast supporter of capitalism. It also seems she has taken in some level of anger at the DPRK and Russophobia into her thinking, while fully supporting the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision. Her LinkedIn calls her Deputy Director of Writing and Messaging for the Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce since 2016, speechwriter for Ted Cruz from 2014 to 2016, assistant in the US Senate from 2013 to 2014, varied positions at Hillsdale College (her alma mater), intern at the Center for Cultural Renewal in 2011, intern at the Heritage Foundation in 2011, and intern at the Free Enterprise Institute in 2010. Interestingly, there is no mention of Trump anywhere on this profile!

It worth noting that Hillsdale College is a small Christian college in southern Michigan, benefiting from ties to Trump and Fox News, with [Politico adding](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/05/12/hillsdale-college-trump-pence-218362) that a ""White House speechwriter who cut her teeth writing for Ted Cruz in the Senate, Brittany Baldwin, Hillsdale class of 2012, gets credit from former classmates for the president’s most convincingly conservative remarks."" She is also referenced in other [outlets](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/01/who-really-writes-trumps-speeches-white-house-wont-say.html), apparently [associated with the Koch Brothers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/koch-brothers-infiltrated-trump-administration-democrats-demanding-documents-say). As [another site says](https://www.cheatsheet.com/money-career/lowest-paid-trump-administration-employees.html/?a=viewall), ""part of Donald Trump’s job involves giving speeches. Fortunately, he has someone to help him with that. Brittany Baldwin is Trump’s speechwriter. As of this writing, she earns an annual salary of $70,000. She has the tough job of crafting eloquent speeches for the president. Before stepping into this role she was a press assistant for the United States Senate and speechwriter for Senator Ted Cruz.""

I'm an undergraduate senior majoring in chemistry. I have a 3.85 GPA, a prestigious internship this summer, and a great relationship with my professors.

And I can't fucking stand chemistry.

I love learning and teaching it, but lab work drives me insane. Something was supposed to take me two weeks max to do and it's been a month and a half and I still haven't done it. I got to a major step then through out my product by mistake, so I get to start over. Everything I do seems to go wrong and I'll do steps out of order no matter how much I read them. I break things. I pour the wrong things and spill them. I can't stand going into work everyday knowing I'm probably just going to waste my time and do something wrong. I also get to worry about spilling toxic chemicals on myself, and they can go straight through my gloves. Yay. I really want to quit my internship but can't.

I feel like I've wasted my life by getting a degree in something that I dread. I love learning chemistry, but if I can't stand doing lab work, what's it matter?

I also really want to leave home and get my own place, but I don't think I can stand working a chemistry job, so it'll be a pain to find a different job that pays well enough for me to do that.

I'm interested in an RP where a 'straight' girl has never had an actual orgasm in her life. She gets an internship her last semester of college, and she celebrates the night before her first day by celebrating with drinks. She gets hammered and has sex with my character, who makes her orgasm *several* times before the evening is through. She wakes up in the morning and, horrified and embarrassed, hurries off to her new job, only to find that her new boss just fucked her brains out.

The boss wants to have a Sugar Mama/Sugar Baby relationship with your character, but she resists, insisting that she's 'straight' and that she has a boyfriend. Her boss slowly seduces her, edging her over and over again throughout the work day, reminding her of the *actual* orgasms they had the night before.

In my limited free time, usually early mornings before I head to work and right before bed, is when the urges hit the hardest. 

I actually read the entire NoFap guide, which was much longer than anticipated, and read about monk mode. I think it is time for me to focus on using my devices for mainly work and school purposes. I will turn to reading, working out, bullet journaling, and investing (I'm a bit of a nerd). 

I have been ""doing"" NoFap for over 3 years and my longest streak has been around 40 days. PMO has led to me feeling isolated, lonely, grumpy, and depressed despite being surrounded with people and opportunities. PMO kept me content with a relationship that was not good for me and cost me time, money, stress, and other friendships with people, whom I am reaching out to.

Since holding myself accountable has not worked, I decided to post for the first time in a long time. Wish me luck!

8y0hie,0,2018-07-11,I [M26] confessed my feelings to her [F24] over the phone and she said “I don’t know.

There is this nice, petite girl I have been seeing for 2.5 months. We would meet up literally every weekend, go on a date, text everyday all day, hold hands and it was like as if we were an official happy couple. I feel like 2 and a half months is plenty of time to know and determine what kind of person this really is and the fact that she kept agreeing on a date/meeting up with me every weekend for 2.5 months (I’ll say we went on about 10-12 dates), gave me a clear signal she was interested in me and had feelings.

This past weekend on Saturday, I confessed to her over text and phone while also telling her that if she just thought of me as a good friend for these past 2 months, it’s best to just end our ambiguous relationship right now and that I wouldn’t be able to endure such an ambiguous relationship for a continual period of time.

 I wanted to make our relationship status “official” because our relationship was so ambiguous and unclear and I started confessing my feelings with sincerity and honesty. One cannot just keep on ""seeing"" the other party forever - and it's been 2.5 months. I knew it was time to make it firm and official.

 However, she goes onto say that “I don’t think I can endure it either. I’m beginning my internship next week and also very busy and stressed working these days, so I don’t think I can manage to particularly care for someone with such special feelings”. It sounded as if she was a bit pressured and lacked confidence in her tone. Then I tried to convince her saying if she could give me a chance and there was the whole awkward silence and she kept saying “I don’t know”. And then she eventually goes onto say, “I’ll think about it”. This was this past Saturday night.

The next night on Sunday, I called her again asking how her day was with typical small talk questions, and she definitely did not sound like the girl I knew before Saturday. (Our last date was on July 4th). She kept giving me one word responses, sounded disinterested with no energy in her voice, and I was just so shocked because I feel like she changed. It was just so awkward. 

Then I closed it off by saying, ""Good luck on your internship tomorrow. Have a great week."". It is now Wednesday. No response for her every since Sunday night. What I really want to know is what she meant by ""I don't know. I need time to think about it"". (If this is just a nicer way of rejecting or if she really needs time to think) Our relationship has now become very awkward. However, I still don't want to let her go. I really don't. What is the best thing I can do at this point to win her heart?

tldr: I confessed my feelings to the girl who I've been seeing for 2.5 months that I truly like and she said, ""I don't know"" ""I need time to think about it.""

8y0lwe,188,2018-07-11,DB from the perspective of someone who thought she was LL,KookyCommunication0,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/8y0lwe/db_from_the_perspective_of_someone_who_thought/,"First off thank you to this sub for its incredible honesty and perspective. Having returned to it periodically over the years to build better empathy with my SOs has been eye opening. I figured after some reflection, perhaps it was time for me to finally share my DB story in the hopes that others may learn from my (many) mistakes.

**TLDR; In my first adult, long term relationship I thought I was the LL, but with time I learned that there was so much more to it than that.**

I met him when I was a senior in college (he was a couple years older). I immediately fell in love with his personality--he was so fun and warm and cute. But initially sex with him was very painful in part because he was very big/thick (especially compared to my limited # of partners to this point). Silly 20 year old me figured that 80 year old me wasn't going to have much sex any way, and that loving a person's character was what mattered most and sex would come in time **(Mistake #1)**. I probably took this attitude on from my parents who as I've gotten older have (inappropriately) vocalized their non-existing sex life as I've watched the problems it has caused them (i.e. infidelity).

We fell in love very fast and moved in within 6 months **(Mistake #2)**. I graduated to a tough economy but luckily got my dream offer in the form of a job 3,000 miles away. He decided to quit his job and follow me **(Mistake #3)**. It was mutually beneficial because he wanted to start a company and this city was much better for it. For those keeping score at home: this is a great recipe for turning up the seriousness during an important period of transition for a young person on her own for the first time.

The first year was stressful between my high pressure job and the super adult situation we put ourselves into. We were having sex \~1x per week, despite just coming into adulthood and serious amounts of fighting. Sex continued to hurt--we're talking visible blood every single time, but we always assumed it was ""on me""--I went to gyno after gyno and they told me nothing was wrong, so we chalked it up to the stress of my lifestyle or a seeming inability to naturally lubricate. I also felt pressure as I was financially supporting him, and on my first real big girl paychecks (I still have no regrets about this--I'd do it again for someone I love and believed in). But through it we leaned on each other and moved back home 3,000 miles when I got a better job thinking that would be the fix.

Fast forward a couple of years later and I got an incredible job 3,000 miles away again (my industry exists on the coasts) and he once again agreed to join me via a job transfer. Our sex had slowed down to 1x every 1-2 weeks, but we had been through so much that I felt in my heart that we'd be married one day so we moved once more. I felt so honored by his sacrifices for me, but I felt some strange feelings creeping in that I kept to myself **(Mistake #4)**.

This is where the story gets worse. My new company paid me to live close to the office which meant going from a major city to the suburbs. At 24 years old, I suddenly panicked. I felt like despite everything being ideal from the outside that I was basically married and about to be a lifer at a dream company. I began seriously feeling like I had no idea who I was on my own as I had never been alone, and wondering whether or not I should've dated a bit more in my 20s. This created an anxiety-driven guilt spiral that I didn't appreciate what I have.

Over these years I should note I changed remarkably--and he largely supported me in big transitions personally and professionally. I had gone from shy intern at age 20 to team lead at a Fortune 500 company who was managing side work, built a mentorship community, speaking at conferences etc by age 25. But I couldn't shake the doubts that crept in.

Our sex life suffered immensely. We'd be lucky to have sex once a month. I felt so unsexy as well--our suburban lifestyle meant he never took me on dates. My male oriented-field meant I never got to dress up either. I booked date nights but we'd end up just cooking at home. I bought sexy dresses and underwear to spice things up. He didn't do anything for my birthday and became more difficult to communicate with (ex. about travel plans, finances, etc.). I found myself pulling back from him more than ever and the thought of relaxing with him to have sex overwhelmed me.

In the end, I read this board and decided to give it one final push. I continued to go to gynos to understand what was potentially wrong with me (they said everything looked great). I started eating better, exercising a ton, demanding better work life balance. We got to having sex 1x a week on the weekend scheduled in as I figured it would be a good starting place. I fear it may have been too late--he got frustrated it was scheduled and still wanted more. I felt like I wasn't woman enough--I felt so, so ugly. How couldn't I provide for this wonderful person who had sacrificed so much for me to this point?

Welcome to **Mistake #5**\--the worst of them all. I went that season on an annual friend trip for a professional network I was in. Pretty innocuous and many good friends I've maintained over the years. I felt relieved to be on my own and ""feeling"" like I was myself. A good looking acquaintance and I caught up and drank a little and then stayed up talking. I felt amazing getting so much attention. Stupid, stupid me. This is where I do a bad and make out with him. Not only did I cheat on my loyal partner, but with some scum bag who would even engage with someone taken.

I came home from that weekend and kept talking to the scum bag. My partner totally knows what's up (I have no poker face) and I break. We descend into a wild cascade of break up mode in the coming weeks and he moved back home. I will have to live with that awful mistake the rest of my life.

We go no contact immediately. I start therapy with a woman who isn't afraid to make me cry and be honest with myself (I still see her). I kick my ass into shape. I focus in on work. I get into my dream grad school program (god I can't wait to start!). I start a new life in a new city where I have to make a new social network from scratch. Needless to say, I definitely learned who I was, ugly bits and all, and started taking ownership of my previous Mistakes #1-5 above.

Here's where our story gets a bit more complex. I started slowly dating but only with people I met in person to avoid getting into weird confidence-sucking Tinder holes. I enjoyed meeting new people and seemed to be attracting really lovely men. The best part? I loved sex again. **In fact, I was told I was HL--one man I had been seeing for awhile said he couldn't keep up with my daily requests even!**

I reconnected with my ex once it felt safe, and he told me he had issues with sex with other partners. They said his penis was too thick and women were hard passing upon seeing it. While it made me feel a bit less crazy, it also broke my heart because we had become so emotionally connected that at the end we were able to do 1x per week and it wasn't enough. I want the best for him--he deserves it and I know it'll work out for him. I've since relaunched no contact since I really want for us to both be 100&amp;#37; full for our future partners, as painful as losing an important person like that is.

This brings us to the main lesson of this story. Regardless of the main mistakes and complexities above, these 5 years of heartache and lifetime of therapy could have been avoided if

1. I was aware of the importance of sex at the start of a relationship (i.e. it better be strong because it will likely only start to naturally diminish over time)
2. Had the courage to be extremely open with my partner throughout the mistakes above

It has been about 1.5 years since our split and I am still processing. I am now in a relationship with a man who I am for better or worse completely honest with, including the above. We have sex nearly daily and he's emotionally supportive in the way my ex largely was. I now view sex not only as an itch to scratch, but more importantly as a physical way to express my love and support for another. I will continue to see my therapist until days end, although she has given me positive feedback on my progress to date and suggested that I can start going in less.

**If you are the seemingly LL in a relationship:** Seek help, understand the root issue (there could be so many!), and do the right thing and end it if it's not working out. You won't be a bad person for it--quite the opposite. Then stop punishing yourself for having not known better sooner.

I know this was a super long story, but I hope it can benefit someone else in the thick of crises. If nothing else, thank you for letting me tell it all here if only to make my soul feel a bit more open."

**From Asmodeo in Spain:**

First of all, I would like to thank the Heroes team for their work, the game is growing and it's partly because of them, so thank you!

I would like to become a concept artist and **I would like to know if you take in consideration community fan art and creations to include them in the game?** How do you contact the artists, how do you usually get them and what is the currently process for this?

&gt;It seems like Standalone hero reworks are coming with new skins. Is this something we can expect in the future? 

Hello! Our recent reworks from Sonya &amp; Medivh through Raynor &amp; Azmodan have been paired with everything from new takes on existing skins to entirely new skins. With future reworks, we'll continue to have similar skin support across that range, though note that it's much more important to us to get the right rework at the right time for gameplay purposes rather than aligning a rework with a skin.

&gt;Alright I got several question so lets start with the big one, which I have been curious about for quite a while
&gt;
&gt;**Why was Nova's original taunt animation changed to the current one?**
&gt;
&gt;I believe you changed it after the game went ""live"", Im just curious as to why because its not like there has been a lot of animation changes, at least not after heroes are open to the public.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for doing and for probably being the best art direction in all of Blizzard right now, you guys rock!.

First of all, thank you so much for the kind words!

Nova's original taunt fluctuated a bit too far out of character for her. So the dev team decided to change it to something that actually fit her personality!

Taunts are a funny thing to animate because it's hard not to let our own personal attitudes seep into the characters. The way that I would taunt someone is dramatically different than the way Yrel would taunt someone, or Dehaka, or Artanis... In this case, I think Nova's old taunt dipped a little too far into the voice of the dev vs. the voice of the character.

&gt;Lana: What was your favorite animation to work on and why is it Enforcer Morales' hairflick?

Hahahahah -- That was a fun one! I begged to work on even just a tiny piece of Enforcer Morales, and was very lucky that I finished up Enforcer Jo quick enough to sneak in a hearth for Morales between other tasks. 

Favourite animation to work on, however? Gotta be my boy Dehaka.

&gt;Why aren't we getting banners as often as we should? There are plenty of banners that could/should be added, but we are only getting banners for events, and not regular ones :(

We think banners are a fun way to customize your character and we'll continue to invest in them even more moving forward! Banners were originally difficult to distinguish or associate with a given player, but in the past year, we've added the ability to see the owner of the banner (in text form) in-game, along with adding it to the MVP screen. As part of this expanding support, we'll be releasing more banner content in future patches that not only celebrates our events, but also our Heroes, skins, and the game as a whole. We hope you like them, and please keep those requests coming!

&gt;How much of the artwork that finds it's way into the games is just one of you, doodling and brainstorming by yourself, it gets traction w/the others in the team. Or is all the artwork made by commité? 

I think the team does an exceptional job of being mindful of the collaborative mentality. However, every good idea's gotta come from somewhere!

D.Haka, for example, came about because my buddy and I were making jokes while queing for QM during a lunch break. Chromie's sand-clone dance was something I begged FX for and we were able to make happen, and her Taunt, when the dragon appears, is something I mocked up a working protoype for and pitched to the team.

One of the most fantastic and most surprising things I've found working as a game developer at Blizzard is the seriously incredible sense of ownership over the work I'm creating. We have teams, there is an approval process, and yes, direction often comes down from on high -- but every voice really does matter. My opinions are valued, and good ideas are acted upon no matter what the source.

----

&gt;Hey /u/Blizz_LanaB, great job on Yrel, she looks amazing though I have a question. Did you get to animate her wings too or was that somebody else or the FX guys?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

I animated them, as well! The motions at least -- our amazing FX artist was responsible for making them look so beautiful, otherwise. 

They were a little tricky, because the wing rig lives in a separate file and then is attached to the model once they are in the game
together -- so it's a little funny animating them as separate pieces -- but I think they turned out great!

&gt;Alexstrasza's face looks a little stretched out horizontally in the hero bar at the top of the screen and in the observer/replay UI. Is it a trick of perspective or is it actually messed up somehow? Link:

&gt;Can we expect Ragnaros to get skins (or recolors) that are not red, orange or yellow? Something purple or green will be great. But he's the 2-nd oldest hero with only 3 skins.

Eventually yes. The biggest hurdle for Ragnaros is the heavy load of FX work associated with him. The model recolor would be easy to handle but FX would not only have to touch a myriad of FX, they would also be on the hook for maintenance of those skins should any issues arise. At the end of the day we have to consider if a Raganaros skin/recolor is worth the time that could have been used for multiple other skins or recolors. It's a balancing act, but one that we will eventually make time for.

----

&gt;The Lost Vikings haven't gotten new skins (or even recolors) ever. Any plans to change that?

Eventually, yes. The primary hurdle for The Lost Vikings is that it is a ""three models for one Hero"" situation. Building three new models is quite a commitment, so a new skin for them is something we have to clear time for. But I'll go ahead promise that recolors WILL happen!  ;)

----

&gt;I liked and missed master skins, not the exclusivity of them (okay maybe a little bit), but it was fun to have over the top versions of the base skins. Did you enjoy re-imagining decked out versions of each hero?

\- Absolutely :)  One of the joys of early HotS skin development was giving a Heroes twist to the established heroes coming into our game from other universes. We will still drop “Master level” skins from time to time, but we hope you’re also enjoying the themed skin bundles as well!

----

&gt;What hero was the most fun to design/animate?

For me it was Dehaka!

I was a hardcore Zerg player in BW and SC2, so it was exciting to be able to help bring Dehaka to the Nexus. One of the reasons I love the Zerg is their obsession with evolving. Our Art Director had a cool idea to help sell this fantasy: Dehaka's arm would regenerate once the player accomplished something, in this case, when they picked a heroic ability. This was both challenging and very fun to execute on. The fully grown arm had to line up perfectly to the severed one. This was also the first time a hero's model changed significantly after picking a heroic in our game.

&gt;Overwatch has victory poses and taunts available in lootboxes, will we ever see anything like that in HotS?

Hi Imephraim! That's a really fun question, it's an idea that gets brought up every now and then internally too. I can tell you there are currently no plans to do this but it's still an idea I'd like to hang onto. It requires a lot of technical hookups in the game before it would be possible that aren't currently at a high priority, but beyond victory poses and taunt animations, I think a Hearth animation you can choose in your Loadout would be fun too.

&gt;We didn't see an animated home screen for Yrel when she was released. Do they take too many resources to make and are from now on dropped, or was this a rare exception?
&gt;
&gt;I really liked the home screens in the past. I wish there was a way to let me choose a specific one from the past when I log in.

I also really liked those home screens, but they were seriously an incredible undertaking that took a lot of people offline for a long time. Plus, we have these incredible artists creating beautiful concept pieces that really deserve a chance to shine.

Furthermore, there is so much more we want to show you, and that stuff is equally deserving of space on the home screen -- stuff like upcoming events, and all the other content that we're always working on. Oftentimes, we'll be making cool things for you guys and have no obvious way of telling you where to check it out aside from patch notes.

In the end, having the 2D homescreen allowed us to show off our beautiful art and surface to you the things you might be looking for without taking 15 people offline for a few weeks to do it.

And that's more time for those people to make even newer, even cooler content. ;)

Circle of life.

&gt;When animating a character that has seen a previous iteration in the Blizzard universe (as is almost always the case) how much inspiration do you draw from the original iteration, and how much do you create fresh?  
&gt;In the case of a game like OW, are you able to directly port over animations, or do you end up creating everything from scratch anyways?  
&gt;
&gt;Bonus (and more important) question: Waffles or pancakes?

In general, when setting out to create an existing Blizzard hero, we collect reference materials from across the company with the goal of making the hero fit in the Nexus while still staying true to their other incarnations. We often will get in touch with other game teams to get their feedback as well as their buy-in on what we are doing. In the case of Overwatch heroes, we do not port over animations directly. We do heavily reference them though!

Waffles FTW.

&gt;**What are some touches you've put on a model, or character that you were REALLY proud of that we might have missed?**  *Something where after you were finished you called over your boss, showed him/her, yelled 'Nailed it', made some pseudo-obscene gesture, and walked out for the day.*
&gt;
&gt;You help make the game come to LIFE.  You made Leoric lumber, you made playing him FEEL lumbering.  To be able to make ME feel that way when I am playing him (or any character) is truly a feat.  I want to know more about something you've done to a character so I can more truly appreciate your hard work.

""Something where after you were finished you called over your boss, showed him/her, yelled 'Nailed it', made some pseudo-obscene gesture, and walked out for the day."" HAHAHAHA - I would neeeeeever. ;)

As for your question – Chromie is probably one of the heroes that I am most proud of. When I started working on her, I'd never animated something seriously 'cartoony' before -- pushed timing, held poses, crazy mid-air jumps and things. She came hot on the heels of Dehaka -- realistic monster bro. It was tough to switch gears, but I feel like in the end I squeezed cute-gnome-personality into every piece of her kit.

The one thing you might have missed, as we didn't want it to happen to often, is that if you begin walking by clicking far enough away -- Chromie will actually start her walk cycle with a little jump instead of just running. (Similar functionality  to how the bikes do a wheelie)

Speaking of Dehaka, he also has several walk variations. He looks side-to side while walking around (the little sneak is always prowlin') and every once in a while he gives a solid hobble onto his good arm to help him along.

&gt;Something me and many of my friends have noticed, is that a lot of the Heroes character models are muscular and chunkier than their other video game counter parts, Is there a particular reason for this?

Yes! We try our best to maintain the key elements that make those heroes who they are, however, when a new hero or skin comes into our game we have to take into account how those models are seen by the player. Because our game has a RTS-style isometric view, we often need to exaggerate proportions so that the asset is easily readable and identifiable from our game camera. Having said that, our game has evolved over time and with new features like Heroes 2.0 loot chest and collection views, we've been adjusting our modeling process to account for close up views as well.

&gt;The extension of certain skin-themes in events like Herostorm or Raiders of Warchrome have been a delight. Can we expect similar events to expand on other skin-themes in the future?

As long as the community is engaged and passionate for a skin theme, we would love to continue exploring those themes! :)

&gt;What hero was the most fun to design/animate?

For me it was ALSO Dehaka!

I started my life at Blizzard as an intern on StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, where we first met Dehaka, and I fell in love. By the time I got there, Dehaka was already animated, but I thought the concept of his character - this badass primal zerg - was SO awesome I jumped at the chance to give my own take on him.

Plus I got work with a pretty cool Tech Artist. (PS: Happy Birthday, Billy!)

I see you play Tyrande... one of the first things I did on the team was fix a deformation issue on Tyrande's gluteus maximus, which was quite visible in the hero selection screens and was the butt of many jokes. Without any patch notes mentioning the change, Reddit somehow [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3nuoo0/thank_you_blizz_for_fixing_tyrandes_ass)! That made my day and is still one of my most memorable moments working on Heroes of the Storm.

As for something that you may have missed... Cho'gall was such a large hero that we added extra joints to his skeleton to add realism to how his massive body moves. I'll leave it up to you to find those extra joints :)

&gt;What were some of the difficulties the team ran into when making/animating Alexstrazsa's dragon form? And can we be hopeful to see more like that in the future?

The biggest issue we ran into was the size of the dragon - we knew we wanted to have her in dragon-form out on the battle field, but to do so effectively proved a challenge. How do we ensure we're adding to the gameplay experience rather than obscuring it?

There was a lot of back and forth on the scale of her dragon form between art and design, but ultimately, it was our incredible engineering team who helped us cultivate a powerful and performant experience using turning tech.

Most heroes can turn on a dime and it's no problem, but a massive dragon pulling a 180 in a single frame is visually abysmal and breaks the immersion of the dragon fantasy. The tech enables us to have 'turning' animations for the dragon that we blend in/out of, so we can actually have the model bend and face the direction she wants to go as she turns, rather than popping in the opposite direction.

&gt;I've always been curious as to the process of getting a design from initial concept art to in-game, would you be able to give a general sketch (lul) of the steps leading to your art appearing before us in game? 
&gt;
&gt;I've always been a huge fan of how Blizzard games look and feel and HOTS is no different! You guys are awesome thanks for the passion you put into this game

It's truly a collaborative effort! Generally it looks like this.

Design comes up with a 'paper design' -- an idea of what the hero's abilities will look like and we can already start feedback before they begin implementing the hero into the engine.

In tandem, Concept art starts concepting how we want the hero to look.

The designer, once approved on paper, starts creating the asset in-game using temporary assets for testing.

The art team then goes on to create the model, textures, and tech artists make the rig -- and if possible, we support the designer by prototyping assets they may need. (i.e. Chromie's Q was so distinct, we had to do a custom animation with temp geo for the designers to work with) Writing also starts putting together the script and recording VO!

Once the design is somewhat locked in -- final Animation and FX begin, and then we hand off into our incredible sound, and video teams.

We consistently meet as a team the whole way through to make sure we're all on board with the direction, and eventually it makes it's way to you!

If you want a more in-depth view into the process, I'd advise scoping out the 'Ressurrecting Kel'thuzad' video series we created. :)

&gt;There are only 5 sprays in the Diablo category -- the D3 icons for the first 5 classes. Can we at least get the icons for the D3 Crusader and Necromancer that are missing as sprays?

I'll talk to the bringers of sprays and get these in the pipe for future addition.  And from this and other threads it sounds like there are a lot of suggestions for missing sprays/banners/portraits that you all would like to see - we love hearing those ideas, so please keep them coming and we'll get them on the list for eventual inclusion!

&gt;There are **so many** portraits in HotS but we can only use one at a time. What do you think about adding a portrait loadout slot so we could use different portraits with different loadouts, to be used on loading screen?

This is something we've discussed and we like the idea a lot.  No timeline for getting it in game yet, but it's definitely on our radar.

&gt;Could it be possible to cancel the taunt animation? Right now taunting means that you are rooted for like 3 seconds so it is a risk doing it.

If you are taunting the enemy team you gotta be C O N F I D E N T you earned it ... or pay the price! ;)

&gt;I know this isn't exactly ""art and animation"", but more likely ""organisation of the art in the collection"", but I don't think I can ask this in the other coming AMAs either, so I'll go ahead and post this here: Can we get better organisation on the sprays and portraits in our collection? Getting filters for the different unverses and filters for ""sketches"", ""herostorm"", ""stylized"", ""indigo"", ""classic"", ""nexus"", ""achievement"", ""event"", etc, would greatly help with finding what you are looking for, and it will make the collection seem less messy.

I'll bring this up as part of our ongoing discussions on evolving the collection. Thanks for the feedback!!

&gt;Oh, oh hello, When you animate a hero how do you know what movements do? do you sketch them first or have some one to act them for reference?
&gt;
&gt;hehe, thanks for doing this AMA, Im in my last year of animation school and Blizzard was always a big part of why I decide to study this, I love all the Blizz work but here in Heroes I think is were the artist put more heart in their work.

It varies animator to animator. 

Depending on the character, sometimes I can just feel it, but I do a lot of sketching, and a lot of video-recording! Sketching, often,for when the action is physically impossible. Video reference, when I'm looking for smaller moments -- how did I shift my weight just then? What is the way I'd look around in this instance. What are some unique ticks I could put into an idle animation? etc. 

You can see me working out Yrel's bubblehearth here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BkEOmH7A7m-/?taken-by=lifeatblizzard

And Enforcer Johanna's ready up here: https://twitter.com/Latienie/status/968674147889905664

Most importantly I'd suggest talking to your peers!  To this day I have a post-it on my monitor that says 'Feedback Early and Feedback Often'. Game development is collaborative, and learning how to give and receive feedback, and communicate effectively goes a long way!

&gt;In the past, folks at Blizzard have said they will update Probius's Pylons, Cannons, and Gate colors to match his skin tint ([link to blue response](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20753586544?page=3#post-43)). Is this still happening? Should we hold out hope for other ability updates to be recolored to match their skin tints too? Some examples:
&gt;
&gt;* Void Illidan uses purple blades but they become green when he uses Metamorphosis
&gt;* Dreambreaker Thrall is green but uses red lava-themed abilities
&gt;* Crimson Special Ordinance Raynor is red but his Banshee is blue

Hi Vambage, thanks for bringing this up. It's great to know updating Probius' ability models is still wanted. This is something that is still on the backlog for a rainy day. We also try to keep this in mind with all new skins we create. With regards to the other examples you give, in some cases a hero’s abilities can’t be adjusted to perfectly match an alternate appearance (i.e. a skin that’s a different color) due to the importance color has on communicating whether an ability is damaging or healing. Green and red are particularly tricky—if something that is red is turned to green, it can be mistaken as something that is safe and non-damaging. It can have an impact on gameplay that Design likes to keep an eye on, but every case is different, and we always like to review.

&gt;Might as well get this out of the way now because you know you are gonna get alot of these
&gt;
&gt;Will we ever see new models for BW and Arthas?
&gt;
&gt;BTW you guys do fantastic work and I'm going to college this year to start working towards a job in your industry! It's my dream to be able to do what you guys do keep it up!

Given the community's intense desire for an answer on this topic, I'll do my best to answer as directly as I can. 

The Heroes team as a whole is aware of this request and we have had many discussions on how best to approach the rework. Unfortunately a rework like this would affect many departments (design, modeling, animation, fx, tech art, engineering, etc.) and given our development bandwidth, we have to weigh the work it would take vs. what else we could be making in that time (other new heroes, skins, feature support, etc.). That said, we don't currently have any timelines for these reworks since we want to weigh the cost of doing them with all of the exciting new content we currently have in the works. 

We absolutely appreciate the passionate feedback that we get on the topic and we hope you'll continue to let us know what you think could be improved as well as what you love about the current version.

&gt;Is there any chance we can see more concept art or in-progress work on the game? Not like future stuff, but I would love to get some insight into the process of making my favorite skins/characters/maps that are already in the game.

I think that the @BlizzHeroes twitter account has been posting concept art fairly frequently -- that's a good place to start.
Also: we hosted some art drops on Art Station you should check out -- like this one! https://magazine.artstation.com/2017/05/blizzard-entertainment-heroes-storm-art-blast/

&gt;Most of the skins don't have abilities matching with the tint used, like any Probius skin where the pylon will always be yellow/blue, even when using another color. Some skins have abilities matching with the tint like Queen of Ghost Kerrigan. Why is that the case and do you have any plan on changing it to make it more consistant?

Hi!  We avoided creating a hard and fast rule to always match abilities with their tint as the overhead from such a commitment could constrain us to the point that it meant less new things like heroes or skins in the long run.  It’s a fine line that we try to balance skin-to-skin, but we’ve always wanted to go back specifically to Probius’ ability models as we agree that consistency there would be great.  It’s just a matter of when we can prioritize this work, so please continue giving input on which heroes would benefit most from these efforts and we'll take that into consideration.  Thanks!

&gt;What are your preferred art programs (Maya, Cinema4D, Blender, 
&gt; Photoshop, etc.)? Any hidden gem programs you think more people should use?

With 3D digital content creation programs, once you know one, it isn't too hard to learn another. A lot of the tech artists on our team had to learn one of these programs on the job. Just become familiar with one and you'll be fine! They each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

&gt;Sometimes various skin tints have many colors, sometimes they have a similar amount of colors as the base tint but are different, and sometimes they have much fewer colors or are all shades of the same color.
&gt;
&gt;**What is the reasoning for this limited pallet with some skins in particular?**
&gt;
&gt;Here is an example of the former (many colors)
&gt;
&gt;https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/File:Sonya_Death_Knight_Naxxramas.jpg
&gt;
&gt;and the latter (very limited color palette) 
&gt;https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/File:Sonya_Death_Knight_Blighted.jpg

So color variations are meant to give the players an outlet to see their favorite heroes and skins in new and colorful ways, but occasionally, we have to take gameplay implications into account. Sometimes we have to consider content that's coming in the future -- like all of the marine suit based heroes, including Raynor, Tychus, Lt. Morales, Blaze -- and therefore limit the base version of a hero into a uniquely identifiable palette. Other times we have to take hero silhouettes into account (like Stitches and Butcher) and make sure their palettes don't overlap. In other instances, we have to take into account the FX built for that hero or skin as it affects people on the team beyond those who are modeling them. 

That said, we do appreciate the feedback on any and all color variants and we hope the community continues to let us know what they love and what they feel could use more love 😉

&gt;How much work goes into making a legendary skin with unique animations and/or sound effects? If you decided today to make a new legendary skin for a hero, when would you guess it would be ready for release?

Artistically, it's typically the same amount of work for a brand new hero! New model often means new rig, often means new animation set. With all that work and TLC from so many different teams, it could typically take months and months!

&gt;What was the biggest animation error or glitch that has occurred during the entirety of HoTS? I wanna see how screwed up this can get.

Hi NumberOneBepsi! I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're after, but when animating Nazeebo's Gargantuan there was a bug in the game during development where a Minion would randomly attach to his hand. It was incredibly funny and the Designer agreed to make it a part of his kit. We created some animations to have him actually pickup the minions and then attack with the minion still in his hand. I think a lot of people don't realize this happens. :)

&gt;This is a question for each artist/animator: If you could redo one hero from scratch, who would you choose? Could be one of yours or someone else’s work.

Kerrigan! One of my favourite characters from lore (and I play her all the dang time). I was lucky enough that I got to animate a skin for her -- had a chance to animate a legendary homescreen and a few custom animations -- but I'd love the chance to do my take on her kit in full!

&gt;It seems like Standalone hero reworks are coming with new skins. Is this something we can expect in the future? 

Hello! Our recent reworks from Sonya &amp; Medivh through Raynor &amp; Azmodan have been paired with everything from new takes on existing skins to entirely new skins. With future reworks, we'll continue to have similar skin support across that range, though note that it's much more important to us to get the right rework at the right time for gameplay purposes rather than aligning a rework with a skin.

&gt;Alright I got several question so lets start with the big one, which I have been curious about for quite a while
&gt;
&gt;**Why was Nova's original taunt animation changed to the current one?**
&gt;
&gt;I believe you changed it after the game went ""live"", Im just curious as to why because its not like there has been a lot of animation changes, at least not after heroes are open to the public.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for doing and for probably being the best art direction in all of Blizzard right now, you guys rock!.

First of all, thank you so much for the kind words!

Nova's original taunt fluctuated a bit too far out of character for her. So the dev team decided to change it to something that actually fit her personality!

Taunts are a funny thing to animate because it's hard not to let our own personal attitudes seep into the characters. The way that I would taunt someone is dramatically different than the way Yrel would taunt someone, or Dehaka, or Artanis... In this case, I think Nova's old taunt dipped a little too far into the voice of the dev vs. the voice of the character.

&gt;Lana: What was your favorite animation to work on and why is it Enforcer Morales' hairflick?

Hahahahah -- That was a fun one! I begged to work on even just a tiny piece of Enforcer Morales, and was very lucky that I finished up Enforcer Jo quick enough to sneak in a hearth for Morales between other tasks. 

Favourite animation to work on, however? Gotta be my boy Dehaka.

&gt;Why aren't we getting banners as often as we should? There are plenty of banners that could/should be added, but we are only getting banners for events, and not regular ones :(

We think banners are a fun way to customize your character and we'll continue to invest in them even more moving forward! Banners were originally difficult to distinguish or associate with a given player, but in the past year, we've added the ability to see the owner of the banner (in text form) in-game, along with adding it to the MVP screen. As part of this expanding support, we'll be releasing more banner content in future patches that not only celebrates our events, but also our Heroes, skins, and the game as a whole. We hope you like them, and please keep those requests coming!

&gt;How much of the artwork that finds it's way into the games is just one of you, doodling and brainstorming by yourself, it gets traction w/the others in the team. Or is all the artwork made by commité? 

I think the team does an exceptional job of being mindful of the collaborative mentality. However, every good idea's gotta come from somewhere!

D.Haka, for example, came about because my buddy and I were making jokes while queing for QM during a lunch break. Chromie's sand-clone dance was something I begged FX for and we were able to make happen, and her Taunt, when the dragon appears, is something I mocked up a working protoype for and pitched to the team.

One of the most fantastic and most surprising things I've found working as a game developer at Blizzard is the seriously incredible sense of ownership over the work I'm creating. We have teams, there is an approval process, and yes, direction often comes down from on high -- but every voice really does matter. My opinions are valued, and good ideas are acted upon no matter what the source.

&gt;Hey /u/Blizz_LanaB, great job on Yrel, she looks amazing though I have a question. Did you get to animate her wings too or was that somebody else or the FX guys?
&gt;
&gt;Thanks!

I animated them, as well! The motions at least -- our amazing FX artist was responsible for making them look so beautiful, otherwise. 

They were a little tricky, because the wing rig lives in a separate file and then is attached to the model once they are in the game
together -- so it's a little funny animating them as separate pieces -- but I think they turned out great!

&gt;Can we expect Ragnaros to get skins (or recolors) that are not red, orange or yellow? Something purple or green will be great. But he's the 2-nd oldest hero with only 3 skins.

Eventually yes. The biggest hurdle for Ragnaros is the heavy load of FX work associated with him. The model recolor would be easy to handle but FX would not only have to touch a myriad of FX, they would also be on the hook for maintenance of those skins should any issues arise. At the end of the day we have to consider if a Raganaros skin/recolor is worth the time that could have been used for multiple other skins or recolors. It's a balancing act, but one that we will eventually make time for.

----

&gt;The Lost Vikings haven't gotten new skins (or even recolors) ever. Any plans to change that?

Eventually, yes. The primary hurdle for The Lost Vikings is that it is a ""three models for one Hero"" situation. Building three new models is quite a commitment, so a new skin for them is something we have to clear time for. But I'll go ahead promise that recolors WILL happen!  ;)

&gt;I liked and missed master skins, not the exclusivity of them (okay maybe a little bit), but it was fun to have over the top versions of the base skins. Did you enjoy re-imagining decked out versions of each hero?

\- Absolutely :)  One of the joys of early HotS skin development was giving a Heroes twist to the established heroes coming into our game from other universes. We will still drop “Master level” skins from time to time, but we hope you’re also enjoying the themed skin bundles as well!

&gt;What hero was the most fun to design/animate?

For me it was Dehaka!

I was a hardcore Zerg player in BW and SC2, so it was exciting to be able to help bring Dehaka to the Nexus. One of the reasons I love the Zerg is their obsession with evolving. Our Art Director had a cool idea to help sell this fantasy: Dehaka's arm would regenerate once the player accomplished something, in this case, when they picked a heroic ability. This was both challenging and very fun to execute on. The fully grown arm had to line up perfectly to the severed one. This was also the first time a hero's model changed significantly after picking a heroic in our game.

&gt;Overwatch has victory poses and taunts available in lootboxes, will we ever see anything like that in HotS?

Hi Imephraim! That's a really fun question, it's an idea that gets brought up every now and then internally too. I can tell you there are currently no plans to do this but it's still an idea I'd like to hang onto. It requires a lot of technical hookups in the game before it would be possible that aren't currently at a high priority, but beyond victory poses and taunt animations, I think a Hearth animation you can choose in your Loadout would be fun too.

&gt;We didn't see an animated home screen for Yrel when she was released. Do they take too many resources to make and are from now on dropped, or was this a rare exception?
&gt;
&gt;I really liked the home screens in the past. I wish there was a way to let me choose a specific one from the past when I log in.

I also really liked those home screens, but they were seriously an incredible undertaking that took a lot of people offline for a long time. Plus, we have these incredible artists creating beautiful concept pieces that really deserve a chance to shine.

Furthermore, there is so much more we want to show you, and that stuff is equally deserving of space on the home screen -- stuff like upcoming events, and all the other content that we're always working on. Oftentimes, we'll be making cool things for you guys and have no obvious way of telling you where to check it out aside from patch notes.

In the end, having the 2D homescreen allowed us to show off our beautiful art and surface to you the things you might be looking for without taking 15 people offline for a few weeks to do it.

And that's more time for those people to make even newer, even cooler content. ;)

Circle of life.

----

&gt;When animating a character that has seen a previous iteration in the Blizzard universe (as is almost always the case) how much inspiration do you draw from the original iteration, and how much do you create fresh?  
&gt;In the case of a game like OW, are you able to directly port over animations, or do you end up creating everything from scratch anyways?  
&gt;
&gt;Bonus (and more important) question: Waffles or pancakes?

In general, when setting out to create an existing Blizzard hero, we collect reference materials from across the company with the goal of making the hero fit in the Nexus while still staying true to their other incarnations. We often will get in touch with other game teams to get their feedback as well as their buy-in on what we are doing. In the case of Overwatch heroes, we do not port over animations directly. We do heavily reference them though!

Waffles FTW.

""Something where after you were finished you called over your boss, showed him/her, yelled 'Nailed it', made some pseudo-obscene gesture, and walked out for the day."" HAHAHAHA - I would neeeeeever. ;)

As for your question – Chromie is probably one of the heroes that I am most proud of. When I started working on her, I'd never animated something seriously 'cartoony' before -- pushed timing, held poses, crazy mid-air jumps and things. She came hot on the heels of Dehaka -- realistic monster bro. It was tough to switch gears, but I feel like in the end I squeezed cute-gnome-personality into every piece of her kit.

The one thing you might have missed, as we didn't want it to happen to often, is that if you begin walking by clicking far enough away -- Chromie will actually start her walk cycle with a little jump instead of just running. (Similar functionality  to how the bikes do a wheelie)

Speaking of Dehaka, he also has several walk variations. He looks side-to side while walking around (the little sneak is always prowlin') and every once in a while he gives a solid hobble onto his good arm to help him along.

&gt;Something me and many of my friends have noticed, is that a lot of the Heroes character models are muscular and chunkier than their other video game counter parts, Is there a particular reason for this?

Yes! We try our best to maintain the key elements that make those heroes who they are, however, when a new hero or skin comes into our game we have to take into account how those models are seen by the player. Because our game has a RTS-style isometric view, we often need to exaggerate proportions so that the asset is easily readable and identifiable from our game camera. Having said that, our game has evolved over time and with new features like Heroes 2.0 loot chest and collection views, we've been adjusting our modeling process to account for close up views as well.

&gt;The extension of certain skin-themes in events like Herostorm or Raiders of Warchrome have been a delight. Can we expect similar events to expand on other skin-themes in the future?

As long as the community is engaged and passionate for a skin theme, we would love to continue exploring those themes! :)

&gt;What hero was the most fun to design/animate?

For me it was ALSO Dehaka!

I started my life at Blizzard as an intern on StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, where we first met Dehaka, and I fell in love. By the time I got there, Dehaka was already animated, but I thought the concept of his character - this badass primal zerg - was SO awesome I jumped at the chance to give my own take on him.

Plus I got work with a pretty cool Tech Artist. (PS: Happy Birthday, Billy!)

I see you play Tyrande... one of the first things I did on the team was fix a deformation issue on Tyrande's gluteus maximus, which was quite visible in the hero selection screens and was the butt of many jokes. Without any patch notes mentioning the change, Reddit somehow [noticed](https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/3nuoo0/thank_you_blizz_for_fixing_tyrandes_ass)! That made my day and is still one of my most memorable moments working on Heroes of the Storm.

As for something that you may have missed... Cho'gall was such a large hero that we added extra joints to his skeleton to add realism to how his massive body moves. I'll leave it up to you to find those extra joints :)

&gt;What were some of the difficulties the team ran into when making/animating Alexstrazsa's dragon form? And can we be hopeful to see more like that in the future?

The biggest issue we ran into was the size of the dragon - we knew we wanted to have her in dragon-form out on the battle field, but to do so effectively proved a challenge. How do we ensure we're adding to the gameplay experience rather than obscuring it?

There was a lot of back and forth on the scale of her dragon form between art and design, but ultimately, it was our incredible engineering team who helped us cultivate a powerful and performant experience using turning tech.

Most heroes can turn on a dime and it's no problem, but a massive dragon pulling a 180 in a single frame is visually abysmal and breaks the immersion of the dragon fantasy. The tech enables us to have 'turning' animations for the dragon that we blend in/out of, so we can actually have the model bend and face the direction she wants to go as she turns, rather than popping in the opposite direction.

&gt;I've always been curious as to the process of getting a design from initial concept art to in-game, would you be able to give a general sketch (lul) of the steps leading to your art appearing before us in game? 
&gt;
&gt;I've always been a huge fan of how Blizzard games look and feel and HOTS is no different! You guys are awesome thanks for the passion you put into this game

It's truly a collaborative effort! Generally it looks like this.

Design comes up with a 'paper design' -- an idea of what the hero's abilities will look like and we can already start feedback before they begin implementing the hero into the engine.

In tandem, Concept art starts concepting how we want the hero to look.

The designer, once approved on paper, starts creating the asset in-game using temporary assets for testing.

The art team then goes on to create the model, textures, and tech artists make the rig -- and if possible, we support the designer by prototyping assets they may need. (i.e. Chromie's Q was so distinct, we had to do a custom animation with temp geo for the designers to work with) Writing also starts putting together the script and recording VO!

Once the design is somewhat locked in -- final Animation and FX begin, and then we hand off into our incredible sound, and video teams.

We consistently meet as a team the whole way through to make sure we're all on board with the direction, and eventually it makes it's way to you!

If you want a more in-depth view into the process, I'd advise scoping out the 'Ressurrecting Kel'thuzad' video series we created. :)

&gt;There are only 5 sprays in the Diablo category -- the D3 icons for the first 5 classes. Can we at least get the icons for the D3 Crusader and Necromancer that are missing as sprays?

I'll talk to the bringers of sprays and get these in the pipe for future addition.  And from this and other threads it sounds like there are a lot of suggestions for missing sprays/banners/portraits that you all would like to see - we love hearing those ideas, so please keep them coming and we'll get them on the list for eventual inclusion!

&gt;There are **so many** portraits in HotS but we can only use one at a time. What do you think about adding a portrait loadout slot so we could use different portraits with different loadouts, to be used on loading screen?

This is something we've discussed and we like the idea a lot.  No timeline for getting it in game yet, but it's definitely on our radar.

&gt;Could it be possible to cancel the taunt animation? Right now taunting means that you are rooted for like 3 seconds so it is a risk doing it.

&gt;I know this isn't exactly ""art and animation"", but more likely ""organisation of the art in the collection"", but I don't think I can ask this in the other coming AMAs either, so I'll go ahead and post this here: Can we get better organisation on the sprays and portraits in our collection? Getting filters for the different unverses and filters for ""sketches"", ""herostorm"", ""stylized"", ""indigo"", ""classic"", ""nexus"", ""achievement"", ""event"", etc, would greatly help with finding what you are looking for, and it will make the collection seem less messy.

I'll bring this up as part of our ongoing discussions on evolving the collection. Thanks for the feedback!!

&gt;Oh, oh hello, When you animate a hero how do you know what movements do? do you sketch them first or have some one to act them for reference?
&gt;
&gt;hehe, thanks for doing this AMA, Im in my last year of animation school and Blizzard was always a big part of why I decide to study this, I love all the Blizz work but here in Heroes I think is were the artist put more heart in their work.

It varies animator to animator. 

Depending on the character, sometimes I can just feel it, but I do a lot of sketching, and a lot of video-recording! Sketching, often,for when the action is physically impossible. Video reference, when I'm looking for smaller moments -- how did I shift my weight just then? What is the way I'd look around in this instance. What are some unique ticks I could put into an idle animation? etc. 

You can see me working out Yrel's bubblehearth here: https://www.instagram.com/p/BkEOmH7A7m-/?taken-by=lifeatblizzard

And Enforcer Johanna's ready up here: https://twitter.com/Latienie/status/968674147889905664

Most importantly I'd suggest talking to your peers!  To this day I have a post-it on my monitor that says 'Feedback Early and Feedback Often'. Game development is collaborative, and learning how to give and receive feedback, and communicate effectively goes a long way!

&gt;In the past, folks at Blizzard have said they will update Probius's Pylons, Cannons, and Gate colors to match his skin tint ([link to blue response](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/heroes/topic/20753586544?page=3#post-43)). Is this still happening? Should we hold out hope for other ability updates to be recolored to match their skin tints too? Some examples:
&gt;
&gt;* Void Illidan uses purple blades but they become green when he uses Metamorphosis
&gt;* Dreambreaker Thrall is green but uses red lava-themed abilities
&gt;* Crimson Special Ordinance Raynor is red but his Banshee is blue

Hi Vambage, thanks for bringing this up. It's great to know updating Probius' ability models is still wanted. This is something that is still on the backlog for a rainy day. We also try to keep this in mind with all new skins we create. With regards to the other examples you give, in some cases a hero’s abilities can’t be adjusted to perfectly match an alternate appearance (i.e. a skin that’s a different color) due to the importance color has on communicating whether an ability is damaging or healing. Green and red are particularly tricky—if something that is red is turned to green, it can be mistaken as something that is safe and non-damaging. It can have an impact on gameplay that Design likes to keep an eye on, but every case is different, and we always like to review.

&gt;BTW you guys do fantastic work and I'm going to college this year to start working towards a job in your industry! It's my dream to be able to do what you guys do keep it up!

Given the community's intense desire for an answer on this topic, I'll do my best to answer as directly as I can. 

The Heroes team as a whole is aware of this request and we have had many discussions on how best to approach the rework. Unfortunately a rework like this would affect many departments (design, modeling, animation, fx, tech art, engineering, etc.) and given our development bandwidth, we have to weigh the work it would take vs. what else we could be making in that time (other new heroes, skins, feature support, etc.). That said, we don't currently have any timelines for these reworks since we want to weigh the cost of doing them with all of the exciting new content we currently have in the works. 

We absolutely appreciate the passionate feedback that we get on the topic and we hope you'll continue to let us know what you think could be improved as well as what you love about the current version.

&gt;Most of the skins don't have abilities matching with the tint used, like any Probius skin where the pylon will always be yellow/blue, even when using another color. Some skins have abilities matching with the tint like Queen of Ghost Kerrigan. Why is that the case and do you have any plan on changing it to make it more consistant?

Hi!  We avoided creating a hard and fast rule to always match abilities with their tint as the overhead from such a commitment could constrain us to the point that it meant less new things like heroes or skins in the long run.  It’s a fine line that we try to balance skin-to-skin, but we’ve always wanted to go back specifically to Probius’ ability models as we agree that consistency there would be great.  It’s just a matter of when we can prioritize this work, so please continue giving input on which heroes would benefit most from these efforts and we'll take that into consideration.  Thanks!

&gt;What are your preferred art programs (Maya, Cinema4D, Blender, 
&gt; Photoshop, etc.)? Any hidden gem programs you think more people should use?

With 3D digital content creation programs, once you know one, it isn't too hard to learn another. A lot of the tech artists on our team had to learn one of these programs on the job. Just become familiar with one and you'll be fine! They each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

&gt;Sometimes various skin tints have many colors, sometimes they have a similar amount of colors as the base tint but are different, and sometimes they have much fewer colors or are all shades of the same color.
&gt;
&gt;**What is the reasoning for this limited pallet with some skins in particular?**
&gt;
&gt;Here is an example of the former (many colors)
&gt;
&gt;https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/File:Sonya_Death_Knight_Naxxramas.jpg
&gt;
&gt;and the latter (very limited color palette) 
&gt;https://heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com/File:Sonya_Death_Knight_Blighted.jpg

So color variations are meant to give the players an outlet to see their favorite heroes and skins in new and colorful ways, but occasionally, we have to take gameplay implications into account. Sometimes we have to consider content that's coming in the future -- like all of the marine suit based heroes, including Raynor, Tychus, Lt. Morales, Blaze -- and therefore limit the base version of a hero into a uniquely identifiable palette. Other times we have to take hero silhouettes into account (like Stitches and Butcher) and make sure their palettes don't overlap. In other instances, we have to take into account the FX built for that hero or skin as it affects people on the team beyond those who are modeling them. 

That said, we do appreciate the feedback on any and all color variants and we hope the community continues to let us know what they love and what they feel could use more love 😉

&gt;How much work goes into making a legendary skin with unique animations and/or sound effects? If you decided today to make a new legendary skin for a hero, when would you guess it would be ready for release?

Artistically, it's typically the same amount of work for a brand new hero! New model often means new rig, often means new animation set. With all that work and TLC from so many different teams, it could typically take months and months!

&gt;What was the biggest animation error or glitch that has occurred during the entirety of HoTS? I wanna see how screwed up this can get.

Hi NumberOneBepsi! I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're after, but when animating Nazeebo's Gargantuan there was a bug in the game during development where a Minion would randomly attach to his hand. It was incredibly funny and the Designer agreed to make it a part of his kit. We created some animations to have him actually pickup the minions and then attack with the minion still in his hand. I think a lot of people don't realize this happens. :)

&gt;This is a question for each artist/animator: If you could redo one hero from scratch, who would you choose? Could be one of yours or someone else’s work.

Kerrigan! One of my favourite characters from lore (and I play her all the dang time). I was lucky enough that I got to animate a skin for her -- had a chance to animate a legendary homescreen and a few custom animations -- but I'd love the chance to do my take on her kit in full!

“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
8y17bd,25,2018-07-11,I (26F) Need Help Establishing Boundaries With Coworker (34-37F?),onelessthrowaway55,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8y17bd/i_26f_need_help_establishing_boundaries_with/,"Hi, I'm really frustrated right now so this might be a little disjointed. I'll edit and add information as needed.

I've been working at a small, not-for-profit office since I moved to the area after graduating from college in 2014. I started out as a temp under my boss's special project he was doing, but a year later that fell through September 2015 and he officially hired me as an Executive Assistant in February 2016. In that in-between time and as I was getting used to the job, I believe he gave my corworker M (34-36F), our event coordinator, permission to delegate tasks to me. I was happy for the work to do and it helped him figure out where to put me.

Since then, I've been placed in charge of our monthly newsletters and other printed media and projects, expanding my title to Executive Assistant and Special Projects Coordinator. My boss was happy with the work I was doing and continued to give me more print and web design responsibilities. The problem is, my coworker continued to give me ""projects"" to do, which at times would frustrate me because if I'd try to tell her I was working on something specifically for my boss, she'd buckle down and tell me that whatever she needed done HAD to be done by x time and that it's higher priority than whatever project I was working on. My other coworker, (30-someF) overhead the ""lower priority"" comment once and actually told my boss because she also sees the constant offloading of ""intern"" work onto me (and even fights off attempts at M unloading stuff onto her as well), even though at this point I have established jobs and tasks, and asked him who onelessthrowaway actually reports to. He said all of us work for HIM and report to HIM and that's final. It's just us three and my boss in the office.

I doubt he talked to her about it because it has not at all let up. It's constant ""what are you working on,"" ""I have a project for you,"" etc etc, and every time I try to get her to back off she doubles down on me. I don't have many specific examples, because it happens so frequently, but every time I try to turn her down I'm just met with bickering back. Last year, we had to enter some projects into a competition for awards. As we're walking into the boss' office to present our awards, she lets me know she made some ""quick changes"" to my entries. This \*really\* bothered me as I take pride in my writing and was excited to finally show him something I'd worked on without collaboration. We work off a shared drive so I don't know what she changed or where, so I was in pure panic during our presentation to him because I had no idea what he was looking at when it got to my entries. This was made worse by him asking, ""onelessthrowaway, did you write this?"" I told him yes, but this frustrated me enough to finally ask to talk to him after and explain. It's one thing to proofread and edit and run it by me, but in this case I didn't know what I was presenting so when he asked if I wrote it, I honestly didn't know what he was reading. He assured me he asked because he was impressed by the writing style, and that it was fine, and encouraged me to set boundaries. So he is aware of the situation and has made efforts (being a little more involved in who does what, whereas normally he's hands-off) to try and fix it. But he told me ultimately I need to stand up for myself.

This month, I was promoted to the position of Director of Advertising. My boss even told me I'd be working less in events and more with the Director of Member Services, other coworker, which I was happy to do because when she has me help her with things, she asks me nicely and is appreciative when I accept. I was super excited about this promotion, even if it's just a title change, because it means the three of us are officially equals in title...except, when my boss announced it, M stayed silent and didn't even congratulate me. The other one did quietly, but it was super awkward and quiet and I felt like they didn't like the new change. It ruined the moment for sure.

This brings us to today. First of all, I heard M on the phone with a member/consumer, and telling them our respective positions as a small staff. She gave other coworker's, hers, and boss's, but when she got to me she said ""and ummm onelessthrowaway is kind of our jack of all trades, she does a little of everything."" I found this terribly offensive as it not only ignored new title, it ignored my OLD title of executive assistant, which I've had for years and have honestly been really proud of. So I feel like it was deliberate as she avoided giving me a title at all. Later, as I'm walking out to go to lunch, M tells me that she has a project for me when I get back. Verbatim, ""I have a project for you when you get back."" I asked, ""what project?"" and she said it's to make some table tents for an event tomorrow. I told her I'm working on the newsletter with the boss today and that HAS to get done as we've been behind on getting that out. She counters back with ""ok well you need to have this done BEFORE you leave today."" in a very rude tone. I said ""ok"" sarcastically and left, but reddit, I am pissed. Even worse, when I got back, she had the table tents on my chair along with a typed-out instruction sheet. If she has the time to write me instructions, why can't she do this herself?? I'm tired of the disrespect for my work, I'm tired of her acting like my boss and I'm just some fucking intern that piddles around the office part-time, I'm TIRED of the squabbling to try and get some basic respect here as an employee.

She only says this shit when my boss isn't around, so he's never here to hear it. I was ready to tell her today when I got back from lunch that I'm sorry I gave her attitude, and then go on to explain why I was so frustrated and finally put my foot down, but my boss was back and I didn't want to get him brought into it. You can hear everything in this tiny office. What can I do with the least amount of pushback or drama? I just want some basic respect; if she ASKED me to help today, I wouldn't have fought her at all. Other coworker asks for help on things all the time and I never, ever, turn her down, because she does it nicely and is appreciative when it's done, even if it's all just formality. It's one thing to ask, it's another to demand that I do something by X time otherwise...I can't go home? Like what? Am I being unreasonable at this point, and seeing things that aren't there? Am I just grouchy I'm being made to do more work? I don't know, I'm starting to second-guess because she acts SO offended every time I try to tell her I can't drop everything and do what she asks...Please help!

tl;dr Coworker delegates tasks to me still like an intern/temp despite my getting multiple promotions and won't take no for an answer"

I just want to make sure this physical configuration makes sense before I go make a fool of myself.

All we're trying to do right now is run Defender updates and antivirus profile updates through SCCM, but future-proof it so that we can more easily add features down the road. So the higher ups suggested starting w a CAS and one primary site, with DP's at each of our 45 different sites(no more than 200 users per site). My suggestion so far is that we connect the CAS to our SQL server, and the primary site, while the primary site is connected to a separate WSUS server that reaches out to Microsoft Updates and collects those files. Then sending those on (based on some policies) to the primary site, where the DP's (based on some policies) will reach up and grab their updates.

I've read the documentation through and through but at a certain point I need to apply all of this conceptual stuff.

Thanks to anyone who can offer help."

8y2rf0,5,2018-07-11,Funding a permanent protest,_Thrillhouse_,activism,https://www.reddit.com/r/activism/comments/8y2rf0/funding_a_permanent_protest/,"So I don't know how to get this going so I would love to see if someone hear has any thoughts. I'm just some random dude from Wisconsin but I've been increasingly terrified of this administration since before election day and the last couple weeks the scariness is becoming exponential.  


I keep hearing ""How is there not a permanent protest going on at the capital, this stuff is insanity. What is America doing?"" And I don't really have a good response for this.   


We are at a level that is utterly terrifying to me and the GOP is not backing down. They're getting emboldened. The fact that it's even a DEBATE that Trump gets to pick a second SCOTUS while his campaign manager is in prison, there have been 5 guilty please and like 19 indictments is utter lunacy. The immigration detention facilities have not been resolved but we've moved on from that story like it has been. Trump still never distanced himself from his business nor released his taxes. Those drops in the bucket to a Olympic pool full of corruption.

SO  


My question is, why hasn't this happened? Well, I look at myself and just think: What am I going to do about it? I have to work, I have bills to pay, I can't just like... quit my job and go to DC and protest? and what's that going to do? I've been trying to volunteer, recruit people to register to vote, donate time and money, etc. but where is that getting anyone? Every day this man is in office, more things continue to escalate. God forbid if Ruth Bader Ginsberg fell down a flight of stairs tomorrow. We are at a scary impasse.   


So it's fully reasonable to many many people  why there's not a permanent protest going on but that doesn't mean we can't MAKE one happen.   


I have no idea the logistics of how to make something like this happen fully but I don't pragmatically see why it wouldn't work? If we all committed to getting a ""kickstarter"" or ""GoFundMe"" or whatever the hell those sites are, if we could raise a couple hundred thousand dollars, we could fund a permanent protest.

Here's what I reckon:

We'd need something like $50,000 for ""Executive Director"" salary, someone who is literally taking this initiative and RUNNING with it. We would need expenses for a couple interns and essentially pay people to come protest on their time, to the point where Capital Hill or wherever we decide the protest is, will NEVER be done until they answer 5 questions.

What are those 5 questions? I don't particularly care. There have been so many unforgiveable crimes committed, we could just go through the pile and pick a couple.   


Why didn't he distance himself from the businesses? What about all those felonies Jared Kushner committed breaking FISA rules? Give us the fucking tax records you liar. Have we accounted for every single ""unaccounted"" or lost children that you've been doing the last year? Explain 3 of the top HUNDRED Russian connections. Smarter people than I could come up with this list. 

I would imagine that if this got started and we got a permanent protest STARTED, it would gain national attention and more people would willingly and happily contribute time money and occupy as well.

It cannot be me to start it, I would love to but as I said, all the reasons above plus I would be grossly unqualified and have no idea what I'm doing. That doesn't mean I wouldn't financially contribute to getting this thing going? Or pay for a video on kickstarter, or record something, donate time, whatever.  


I'm just looking for a few people who would be willing to potentially help me get this thing off the ground and started and if there WAS a capable person out there who would be willing to make such a noble sacrifice to run such a thing, hand it over to them. I would expect something like this to be a TOTALLY transparent operation so there could be ZERO questions of integrity or credibility.  


I don't know, maybe it's a horrible idea but I feel like we're at the breaking point that something like this NEEDS to happen and I'm running out of ideas.  


Thoughts?"

I figure from using SysML a lot at work, I’m getting a lot of preparation already. But from reading online I have no sense of how hard the exam is or what sort of questions to expect. Any information or advice is appreciated, thanks!"
8y3frj,0,2018-07-11,EMS Internship,_Macob,NewToEMS,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToEMS/comments/8y3frj/ems_internship/,"As the title says I (17 years old) have a question about whether an intenship as an EMT is the right thing for me. Attention: Wall of text.

In germany, where i live, there is the option to volunteer for one year as an EMT. I know from a friend of mine who is currently interning that you get to take part in everything even as a relatively untrained intern. She told me that she has had to deal with several dozen dead/dying patients in the time she has interned already, trying to reanimate them, administer CPR and so on. So its basically guaranteed that you will be around several dead people during the time and see gruesome things that might not be suited for everyone.

Now i'm really interested in doing this in internship, and she told me she could see me doing it and the people i know closely tell me i should go for it, they think i can deal with whatever may happen. But i'm not sure whether i can deal with it. My mother thinks i'm not suited for this because i used to be an emotional child who was affected closely by what happened around me. But honestly, she refers to my Kindergarden/elementary/junior high school time, and i have mentally grown quite a bit in the recent years, and i have learned to deal with stuff like this leading me to believe her view on this is outdated. Also she worries about everything, she basically wants to protect me from anything harsh.


I want to help people, and from experience i know that the several times i had to help people i instinctively went into autopilot and handled the situation well, and i had no long lasting negative efffects on my psyche. 


I dont know wether i can talk about this here but this is my most extreme experience relating to this topic, and a good example in my opinion, so here it goes: 

This summer i witnessed a suicide attempt i wont go into detail unless asked. While other people were standing around acknowledging it, but not doing anything, me and another guy immediately ran to the guy, administered first aid and restrained him from doing anything else to himself. i like to think that i did the right thing out of instinct, i have no formal training. Gladly he managed to pull through, he has since had therapy and is doing better. Now this whole situation didn't negatively affect my mental health at first, obviously the immediate reaction is ""SHIT SHIT SHIT"" but i managed to calm down really quick.  And i also have no long term trauma or anything from the situation, so i feel like i am mentally equipped to handle this and simmilar situations which may occur during the internship. What worries me is the time between the initial phase, where i ""autopiloted"" and the long term recovery phase. After we got him contained and got him the proper help he needed, so after his life was out of my hands basically, i really freaked out and, kind of obsessively, thought of him and the situation. I asked myself whether i could have done anything better, whether he will pull through and so on. I objectively knew i did everything i could and that it wasnt my fault if he didnt make it. Once i knew he was better for the time being i relaxed immensely, and i made peace with it a short time later. I think this really helped me grow as a human being as i mostly did everything right IMO.

And this is my problem. I dont know whether i could deal with this as an intern. Like i said, i'm totally fine in the long term, but the time just after the situation was out of my hands really was hard. Having my mother telling me i shouldnt do it based on how i behaved in my childhood kind of made me doubt myself, but i think i have changed and improved since then, meaning i could deal with it.

Now i would like to hear from some of you whether you think i'll be fine interning, after all i have no longterm effects from the few experiences i had, or whether you think i shouldn't deal with this,that i'm just not made for this

I know it is hard to tell from just a single experience, but maybe one of you deals with this simmilarily? Any input would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;DR: Thinking about an EMT Internship, I want to know whether I'm mentally suited to do so based on a first aid experience i had this summer."

Also, I’d prefer to use Discord as I personally think it’s the best chat app available.

I’m a male but I’m looking to play a futa character, the other character you play as could be male or female.

I’d like the futa to be based off Milla Jovovich appearance.
https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13943

The other roles can also be based off celebs or models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis.

A)  I would be the boss or a high level executive at some kind of company.  You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship).  I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me.  After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard.  Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.
   
This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe your the kid of an employee and your in the building for some reason).

B)  I’m a teacher or P.E. coach at a middle school, high school or college.  I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before before.  This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

You could be an aspiring track and field star or the anti social wallflower/bookworm/nerd/goth kid that I need to yell at on a regular basis to motivate you into participating.  Maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your future. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and walk past my office and I had completely forgot you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited.  Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing.  You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi large dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s.  You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s.  For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass (1 or 2) or any number of possibilities.

C)  Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where.  I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place.  For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car.  You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment.  Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do.

I don’t like scat, vore, blood or gore but I’m pretty much up to every other kink."

I would like to play the role of a trophy wife. This could come in several different varieties and cater to several different fetishes (one of the most obvious being bimbos)

If any of you have seen Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure, my first thought was that I could play a character like Missy, Bill's stepmom. For those of you who haven't seen the movie, Bill and Ted are seniors in high school Missy is only 3 years older than them.

These two quotes sum it up pretty well

**Missy**: Hi, Bill. Want a ride?

**Bill**: Sure, Missy.

\[*she draws a blank stare at Bill*\]

**Bill**: I mean, Mom.

\[*she smiles and puts on her Ray-Bans*\]

**Ted**: \[*whispering to Bill*\] Your stepmom's cute.

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted.

**Ted**: Remember when she was a senior and we were freshmen?

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted!

**Ted**: Now your dad's going for it in your own room!

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted.

**Ted**: Your stepmom \*is\* cute, though.

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted!

**Ted**: Remember when I asked her to the prom?

**Bill**: SHUT UP, TED!

Anyway I'd love to play a character like her and you could play either the father or my stepson

Another option for a scene would be one where I am a younger girl that you are seeing/married to and I am one of your daughters life long friends, so either we have to keep it secret or it is just very very uncomfortable for her.

Another idea is that I am a secretary of yours or an intern or something, and we are having an affair that you have to keep hidden from your family,

Also feel free to message me about doing one of my older prompts I would just prefer this one tonight. 

Either way I would love to play a woman who is much younger than you, sort of a forbidden love thing. I can't wait to hear from you all!

**P.S.** All charaters in these RPs are 18+"

**Volume One: Smells Like Teen Spirit**

*Sleep Walk*

“I’m not joking. We need to talk.” Carol whispered as the rest of the team scattered to the wind. 

“Now?” Nova sighed. “Ms. Marvel, now really isn’t the time to -”

“Don’t give me that shit, and don’t call me ‘*Ms. Marvel*’.” Carol hissed. “I have a lot to catch you up on - how I got these powers, for one. I met a *real* Marvel. The Captain.”

“The Avenger?” Rich gasped in disbelief. “I thought he disappeared… Worldmind said he went back to his homeworld.”

“Yeah, where he was branded a traitor and exiled for life,” she explained. “I… I’m sorry I left the way I did, but really. We need to sit down and talk. The diner?”

“The Diner. Tomorrow night.” He nodded, and the last two New Warriors took off, one towards Long Island and the other into Manhattan.

---

**The Diner. Tomorrow night.**

A star streaked across the sky, barely catching the side of Richard Rider’s eye. The summer air was warm, and damp. He wore a light cotton t-shirt and a pair of cargo shorts, his Nova helmet bundled up like a ski mask in his back pocket. He’d learned from the last time he left his helmet behind at Lantern Diner when it almost cost him and Carol their lives. Rich made a wish on the shooting star, and kept his eyes peeled for the figure that would be drifting down any second.

“Hey.”

“Waaugh!” Rich jumped in surprise, turning to see Carol right next to him.

“What’re you looking at, Frogger?” 

He laughed halfheartedly, his heart still in his throat. “Oh, nothing I guess. I figured you’d arrive with more… style.”

Carol rolled her eyes. “We can’t all be a human rocket. Now, come on. Let’s get a table.”

---

Chris Powell, aka Darkhawk, soared high above Hempstead, New York. Sometimes, he just needed a breather - to just open his wings, and fly. Hell, it beat rolling around in that wheelchair he was stuck in, right? For the past months, ever since he’d found that amulet in the amusement park, he’d wondered why it gave him the strength to stand, and walk. Flying was one thing - but it fixed his legs. And what did Spider-Man call him? A robot?

A shooting star darted across the sky, and Chris’s gaze followed it. He wished for the same thing he always did - and committed himself to its momentary demise over the horizon. But, a second later, the speck of light changed course - and headed straight down towards land! Darkhawk couldn’t tell where it was headed, just a field of green outside the city, but he flapped his wings and took off after it. 

“Speedball! I need you outside the city!” Darkhawk yelled into his Bluetooth. Since he couldn’t access his pockets or anything inside the suit, Spidey suggested attaching one on the *outside* instead. Chris grunted. At least the three of them had better things to talk about than their feelings. Like, the team’s communication protocol.

“C’mon, man! This is prime Fortnite time!” Speedball complained. 

“Really? Grab Spider-Man, while you’re at it,” Chris ordered.

“You mean Spider-Kid?”

“Aren’t you in middle school?”

“*No!*” shrieked Speedball. His voice cracking didn’t sell it much. 

“Whatever. Get here as fast as you can.” Darkhawk said, and hung up the line. He flapped his wings, and circled the crash site.

---

“So, you met Mar-Vell?” Richard asked as he slurped his shake. His phone vibrated in his pocket, but he paid it no mind.

“Yeah, but we need to talk about *other* stuff first. You look better. I see you ditched the goth color scheme,” Carol noted. She tapped the bottom of her glass without drinking.

“That wasn’t exactly *me*,” he explained. “You saw that suit Mike was wearing yesterday? Yeah, I was Venomed. And honestly, it felt like I had it under control. But then you showed me that video, and I realized…”

“You didn’t,” she finished for him. “Well, I left and went to Florida.”

“Florida? You don’t want to know how I got rid of Venom?”

“Should I?”

“I…” Rich thought for a second. “No, I guess it doesn’t matter. Why Florida?”

“I had to get as far away from home as possible. So, that’s about as far as I could get. I took a low-level intern job at NASA under a Dr. Walter Lawson, who was studying alien physiologies. It was all…” she blushed. “Really cool. I guess that alien nonsense rubbed off on me.”

“And what about Mar-Vell?” Richard pressed. “You said you met an *Avenger*.”

“Is that all you care about?”

---

“Is that all you care about!?” Darkhawk yelled right before he was punched in the face by a sudden, armored fist. His head slammed into the ground, leaving a small crater, and he dazedly got to his knees. Speedball was blabbering about Fortnite - paying the downed raptor no attention

Spider-Man leapt over him like a game of leap frog, limbo-ducking under another of the assailant’s swings and kicking up, connecting with her blue-skinned chin. She grunted, but shrugged off the blow. She was wearing silver and red Centurion-style armor and helmet, strikingly similar to Captain Marvel’s. Spidey barely had time to land before she swung again, and he just managed to pull her fist to the side with a quick *thwip* of his own. “Get up!” he yelled to Darkhawk. How did this kid compete with that chick? Darkhawk struggled to his feet, and flapped his wings. The vertigo was insane, but once he was able to get level, he had a clear view of the fighting. 

“Bring me Mar-Vell!” the woman roared at them, swinging at and connecting with Speedball. A bubble appeared at the point of contact, cushioning the blow, but he was knocked flat on his back - and she swung her heel down for his head.

Spider-Man webbed her ankle just before it smashed Speedball in the face, and yanked as hard as he could. “No one’s seen him in *months*!” He told her.

“He’s here - I know it,” the woman spat, wiping dirt from her lip. “Bring him to me!”

“We don’t, like, have the Avengers on speed dial,” Speedball commented. “That would be *so cool*.”

“Why do you want him, anyways?” Darkhawk demanded. 

“It is none of your concern,” the woman said distantly. “I suppose I will have to draw him here.”

“Wooooah, wait a sec, we’ll get him!” Spider-Man snapped, holding his hands up. “Right, guys?”

---

“I mean… you said you met an Avenger, I’m kinda curious,” Richard defended himself.

“Well… Dr. Lawson was… *is* Mar-Vell. And there was an accident.” Carol whispered.

“An accident?” he asked full-voiced, not taking the hint.

“Shhh!” Carol hushed him. “Yes, an accident. We were working on a project of his - a Kree project, when... ”

“Hang on, a *what*?” Richard interrupted.

“Rich, just shut up!” she snapped. “It had a weird name… I don’t remember. But I thought it was damaged, and went inside. The device powered up, and Mar-Vell’s genetic structure implanted itself over mine.”

“And that’s why…”

“It’s why I have superpowers,” she finished for him. “We’ve run the DNA tests. I’m some half-human, half-Kree *freak*.”

“You don’t look too freaky to me,” Rich reasoned. “And besides, I think all that’s pretty cool.”

“Well I don’t,” Carol huffed. “I left, and came back here. Didn’t even put in my two weeks.”

“Seriously? You can’t just ghost your way through life, Care.”

“Don’t call me that,” she told him. “And I… I *know*.”

“Are you gonna ghost us, too?” he demanded.

“... No,” Carol said after a long, strained second. “I just don’t do well with *dealing*. You know?”

“I guess,” Richard sighed. “If it were me, I would *fix* the problem. Running away just lets it control you. Right?”

“Yeah, totally,” she slurped on the last drops of milkshake in her glass. 

“I think you owe Captain Marvel an apology,” Rich told her seriously. “And you should introduce me! Oh, Nova doesn’t sound good anymore… what about *Supernova*? Or *Red Shift*, cause I’m fast?”

“Yeah, you’re a real speedster,” Carol giggled. “No, Nova’s fine. Seriously.”

“I *guess*.”

“Besides, he talks about you.”

“Huh?” Richard looked up from the bill.

“Nothing,” Carol said with a wink.

---

“What?” Darkhawk mumbled in disbelief.

“Yeah, definitely! We can call him!” Speedball backed Spidey up. “Just give us, like… five minutes, okay?”

“And, what’s your name?” Darkhawk followed up.

“He’ll ask,” Spider-Man quipped. “I know him like that.”

“Fine,” the armored woman agreed. “And I am Doctor Minn-Erva, Accuser of the Kree. The bane of Mar-Vell.”

“Yeah, okay, we’ll tell him!” Speedball gulped, and the three New Warriors huddled up.

“What the hell do you think you’re *doing*?” Darkhawk chided Spider-Man. “Lying to her like that. You didn’t get *hit* by this chick. She packs a punch like *Superman*...”

“What did you want me to do! I bought us some time, so let's use it,” Spider-Man replied. “Speedball, do you think you can go faster than her?”

“I can go as fast as you want, baby,” Speedball grinned. “Wait, that’s not what I -”

“Okay, so we need to -”

A streak of silver and green struck in from the sky, crashing down on Minn-Erva with untold force. Grass and dirt erupted into the air, raining down on the Warriors as dust clouded their vision. With a flap of Darkhawk’s wings, the wind cleared it away - and they were treated to the sight of the silver and green Avenger, standing above the self-labeled Kree warrior with his alien pistol leveled at her head. 

“Mar-Vell,” the woman smiled. “You are under arrest.”

“Minerva,” Captain Marvel replied. “I do not believe I am under your jurisdiction.”

“What did you *do*?” Darkhawk brushed past Spidey, and took off over the fight.

“Nothing!” Spider-Man replied, slinging a web to his teammate’s ankle and lifting off with him.

“Stick to the plan, Speedy. Don’t engage until Captain Marvel does,” Darkhawk ordered he didn’t know why, or *how* Captain Marvel heard about their problem - but he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

“Roger, roger,” Speedball replied with a salute, and sped around the alien duo on his wave of cosmic bubbles. 

“Do not call me by that Terranized name,” Doctor Minerva spat. “There is no jurisdiction required for treason against the Supreme Intelligence.”

“I fought to preserve our technology, and keep it from the wrong hands here on Earth. *You* are the ones who turned me away,” he gripped his pistol. It was clear he was struggling. “But if Hala won’t have me, Earth will.”

“No!” Spider-Man yelled as the Captain pulled the trigger, but suddenly Minn-Erva was gone. Like a rush of wind, she was suddenly on her feet - and a scorched burnmark stained the earth where her head just was. 

“Tsk, tsk, Mar-Vell. I’ll add resisting arrest, and attempted murder to the rap sheet.”

“And what else is on it?” Mar-Vell asked. “Fighting for my people?”

“No.” Doctor Minerva laughed. “Treason. Uplifting a lesser species. Crimes against the Intelligence.”

“Right,” Captain Marvel said. “I see you went through the trouble of uplifting *yourself*, as well? No normal Kree could move like that.”

“Anything for the Kree. You know that. And, Mar-Vell, you stand *accused*.” 

“Kids, get out of here,” Captain Marvel barely managed before Minn-Erva hurled herself at him.

“We should listen!” Speedball yelled over the two’s tangled battle. They were trading blows like it was nothing - hurling each other across the open field, only contained by their sheer ability to stop themselves mid-air and throw their bodies back into it. The two Kree were a perfect match in strength and power, and locked in a stalemate. 

Darkhawk was analyzing the situation. He felt Doctor Minerva’s punch, and if Captain Marvel was keeping up with *that*, he and Spider-Man would get ripped to shreds. But every time Speedball took a hit, one of those bubbles popped up to take the impact. Maybe they could…

“Speedball, tackle her!” 

“*What*?!” he shrieked. “Are you crazy?!”

“Just do it!” Darkhawk instructed, and the boy shrugged.

“If there’s any way to go…” he said, and leaped in between the raging Kree. 

A blue bubble formed on Speedball’s back, growing exponentially before Mar-Vell hit it and rocketed off with just as much speed. The same happened on his chest, but not before he could wrap his arms around Doctor Minerva. They slammed into the ground and he let go, allowing her body to smash itself into the ground with the same force she’d hit *him* with. When Darkhawk cleared away the dust, it revealed a breathless Speedball sitting beside a knocked-out Minn-Erva. 

“Accuse *that*,” he mumbled before dropping from exhaustion.

“I owe you thanks,” Mar-Vell said as he approached. He reached for his belt, and pulled out a pair of handcuffs. When he locked them around Minn-Erva’s hands, they glowed with blue energy. “My transponder registered a disturbance in the atmosphere - and I suspected it might be the Kree, after me. I will take her to the proper authorities.”

“Well, she was definitely after you all right,” Darkhawk commented. 

“And *we* owe *you* one,” Spider-Man offered. “Seriously, we woulda been toast without you.”

“Yes, well… I suppose there is another reason for my coming here,” Mar-Vell admitted. “I worked with a Carol Danvers, and I saw her on the news with your outfit yesterday.”

“Yeah, I don’t know where she is. With Nova, I’d guess,” Darkhawk told him. “Why do you ask?”

“I… I just wanted to make sure she was alright. But if she is in the care of a Nova, then that answers my question for me.” Captain Marvel lifted off the ground, hauling the unconscious Doctor Minerva by her bound wrists. “Thank you, New Warriors. I look forward to our next meeting.”

“Yeah, you too!” Spidey called after him before he looked at Darkhawk. “Wait. Did he say *a* Nova?”

---

Carol and Rich walked out of Lantern Diner, when his phone went off again. It was Chris. 

“Oh, answer it!” Carol chided him, and the boy pulled out his phone.

“Hello?” He answered, and his face blanched. “Woah, woah! Slow down, buddy!” 

“What is it?” Carol asked with concern. 

“He said there was a fight. Some Kree… accuser… and…” 

“And what?”

“And Captain Marvel was there!”

Carol stifled a giggle.

“What do you *mean*, Captain Marvel was there? The Avenger? He *knew* about me?”

After a minute, Richard hung up his phone. He stayed silent for a few seconds, before he mumbled, “This helmet better have Bluetooth.”

Lived together 3.5 years. I’m a working professional with a PhD, BF is in year 2 of a 3 year master’s program. We’re both 31.

I have always been in decent shape. My BF, on the other hand, was in great shape when we started dating and for about the first two years of our relationship. He worked out often and aggressively. I think though, that he never developed good eating habits because even when he was in shape, he ate like crap.

A year and a half or so into our relationship he stopped going to the gym. He started gaining weight. The whole thing crept up on me as I am sure it did him. About two years ago, he broke down a few times crying because he realized he couldn’t fit into a single thing he owned and he had major anxiety about going out or seeing friends because of the weight gain. This was about the time I also realized it was affecting our sex life. He has just about zero energy during sex, compared to what he used to and I admittedly feel less sexually attracted to him.

So, we resolved to go to the gym together 3-4 times a week. For about 6 months, things were working. He was losing weight, slowly but surely. But then he went back to school and everything stopped. He gained all the weight back and then some. Around 40 lbs. Plus his energy is just totally shot. He’s tried for a while now to get active or eat better but he goes in fits and starts, never actually following through. This cycle has repeated maybe three times.

Last week, que the cycle again. He broke down and committed to taking action. Then Monday comes. He’s been doing this for less than a week and he said he didn’t sleep well so he’s going to skip a day working out. Tuesday: a friend from out of town wanted to hang out, so he skipped again. They drank a bit and here we are on Wednesday and he’s tired and hungover so he says he can’t possibly work out. This has been a pattern with him over the years: excuses. Both excuses for eating well and working out. I’m too busy with school. I’m too stressed from my summer internship. I’m too tired because I’m not sleeping well.

Meanwhile, I’ve been sleeping like shit this week because of construction noise but I’ve still made it to the gym or out for a swim every day this week. He has NOTHING going on right now. No school. No work. Most days, he never leaves the apartment. I ask him how he’s doing (wondering if he’s depressed) and he says that he’s just bored and it’s hard to get motivated.

I don’t know what to do. He’s so upset and feels so ashamed at having gained this weight. I’ve been 100% supportive in every way I can imagine. The only thing I feel like I haven’t done is deliver an ultimatum. I love him to death but if he can’t get this together, I don’t think our sex life survives and the relationship falls apart. I also am just fed up with the self-loathing. I want us to be able to go out with friends without him spending two hours moping about how he has nothing he fits into and feels like everyone will be judging him. I understand feeling self-conscious but it’s the combination of self-loathing with complete and total inaction that drives me batty. Honestly, that behavior is more of a sexual turn off than the actual weight gain, itself.

I am so lost. He’s a huge part of my life but I’m at the end of my rope. Is an “ultimatum” even appropriate? If I tell him that I’m thinking about breaking up with him unless he can get this together, I am worried that it might be the wrong approach altogether and wreck every chance of actually salvaging the relationship.

Hoping you guys can be a sounding board. Thank you in advance."
8y55j1,2,2018-07-11,We Are Todd - Chapter Two,AlexLoganWriting,AlexLoganWriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlexLoganWriting/comments/8y55j1/we_are_todd_chapter_two/,"The new figure unfolded himself from his crouching position, lengthening to his full height of at least seven feet. The grey sky pieced itself back together over his head. Abruptly, the harsh rain ceased, though the lightning did not. It struck the city street. The light cracked into a blinding, crooked line directly behind the man’s broad shoulders, ominously shrouding his face in temporary darkness.

Chris looked down at the fractured sidewalk beneath the newcomer’s feet. His eyes trailed his studded boots to his muscled stomach, up further to his brawny neck, past his dark eyes and to his neat black hair. He fought the urge to gulp like a cartoon dog.

He had never been trained for this fated meeting. In fact, he had not even known it had been fated until one minute ago, and Chris felt fear. Real fear. The kind of fear you can only feel when you’ve been mistakenly selected for an epic supernatural battle. 

But in times of life or death, instinct often kicks in.

“Hello,” he heard himself say. He stepped forward with a confidence he did not feel and extended a hand. “Great to meet you, Henry. I’m Chris.”

Chris’ instincts had never been good.

Henry’s eyebrows furrowed and lines appeared on his forehead. He glanced at the offered hand before looking back up to meet Chris’ stare. “You heard the thing about the wrath, right?”

“Yeah, I’ve been hearing a lot of weird things today,” Chris said with a dismissive wave of his hand. He tilted his head to the side, eyeing Henry’s strong jaw. His instinct prompted him to keep speaking. “You know, I’ve never met a Henry before.”

Henry’s muscles bulged as he threw his arms out for display. “I am Henry!” he shouted, apparently to no one in particular.

“We are Todd,” the group behind Chris droned. He turned and found them cowering in a small huddle.

Turning back to Henry, Chris pinched his lips together and nodded. “Mhm, I think we’ve all covered our names.”

There was an awkward silence as Henry stared at him, his expression a unique blend of fury and confusion. Chris bounced on the balls of his feet and looked from Henry, to the shops behind him, to the lightning above. Cars were still filtering down the street; some of the passengers hung out of their windows to stare. “So…” he said, a bit awkwardly. “Erm, what do you do for a living, Henry?”

As if he had been waiting to be fed a line, Henry cried, “This!”

In one fluid movement, he pulled from the sling on his back an enormous metallic hammer, decorated with tiny, intricate ruins. He swung it into the nearest telephone pole, which immediately burst into flames.

“Oh,” Chris said, his eyes widening. A small piece of ash, glowing orange around the edges, landed lightly on the shoulder of his coat. He blew it off.

“And before this, I was in sales,” Henry added, nodding.

“Ah, I bet you were good at that,” Chris said, still unsure why he was bothering to talk to the man prophesized to destroy him, apparently with a fire hammer. “I’m a student at S.F.S.U and a marketing intern. I have a card here somewhere,” he said, patting at his outfit. He somehow found nothing in any of his seven pockets. He shrugged. “I guess I forgot my wallet at home… as well as my keys and umbrella.”

Henry was glowering at him, the fiery hammer resting in his enormous hands. He wasn’t sure what to say next. He turned to seek guidance from the group who had chosen him, but found they had shuffled back a few yards. He gave them a disbelieving look. “Are you serious, Todds?”

“The Book of Todd is extremely explicit about fire safety. The Great Todd wrote, ‘For I may not be labelled a coward if I have filled my heart with Todd and my surroundings are filled with fire,’” Main Todd called.

I glanced at Henry to see my confusion reflected on his face. I turned back to the Todds. “The Great Todd sounds like he was a coward,” I said, narrowing my eyes at them.

“Yep,” Henry agreed.

“Not all are blessed with the courage of the Chosen One,” Main Todd said, though he had the grace to look abashed.

Chris turned back to Henry and eyed his hammer, which still hung at his side. “What’s it made out of?” he asked politely, nodding at it.

“The core of the dying star Aglil,” he said seriously, puffing out his chest with obvious pride. “Those of the Many Named captured its very soul into the head. Its name is Prideful Mallet and we are destined for each other. Prideful Mallet cries out from the inside. Prideful Mallet cries out in flame!” he yelled.

Henry raised the hammer high over his head and whipped it down onto the pavement beside him. The concrete splintered into even more chunks, which then went molten.

He withdrew the hammer and slung it across his chest, holding it with both hands. “And the handle is wrapped with leather.”

“Cool,” Chris said with the same awe one might have when viewing a particularly average automobile. “But… where’d you come up with the name?”

Lines formed at the corners of Henry’s mouth. “Prideful Mallet was always destined to have its name,” he said, though his words contained a touch of uncertainty.

“Yeah, of course,” Chris said quickly. “But still, it’s not a mallet, is it?”

Henry’s forehead creased as he looked down at Prideful Mallet. His shoulders dropped an inch or so as he turned it over in his hands. “No…”

“I mean, hey, that’s cool, though. My older sister once named our dog ‘Kitten,’” Chris said in what he hoped was a soothing tone. “Names don’t have to be perfect.”

If Henry heard him, he didn’t acknowledge it. Instead, he continued to stare at his weapon in confusion, moving his lips wordlessly. Chris waited, awkwardly looking around for a way out of this confrontation.

“What do the runes mean?” a voice yelled. It sounded as though it were at least a block away. Chris turned his head, trying to locate the source. He looked down the street, peering with his hand over his eyes to block the sun. He found the group of Todds managing to hide behind a fire hydrant, and they were doing it better than Chris would have imagined possible. He resisted the urge to curse at them.

“Why don’t you come closer?” Chris shouted. He glanced at the runes. “They look pretty awesome.”

“The hydrant protects!” the Todds called out in unison.

“Oh, right. Fire safety,” Chris muttered. He looked back at Henry, who hadn’t moved an inch. “What do the runes mean?”

Henry stiffened and stood up straighter. “The rune upon the top is the symbol of the god Ythar, which holds the power to trap the soul of a dying star. This is the symbol of the guardian Alik, whose sanctified it with a rune meaning ‘cleansing fire.’ The rune on the bottom is the blessing of the goddess Eheai. It means… prideful,” he trailed, suddenly looking unsure.

“Do any of them mean mallet?” Chris asked politely.

Henry turned the weapon over several times in his hand. “I don’t…”

He looked up, his eyes clouded. His pupils found Chris and they regained focus, then widened. “Oh, I see,” he whispered, leaving his mouth agape in horror.

Chris looked behind him, but found nothing of note. He smiled nervously. “See what?”

Henry shook his head in shock, his eyes still locked on Chris. “How could I have been so blind?”

“I’m sorry?” Chris asked, now uncertain. “I didn’t mean anything by it. I was just asking if—""

Henry held up a hand. “Please, withhold your devious stratagems. I can’t believe I did not immediately see it,” he said, still watching Chris with horror. “Did they teach you this?” he asked, nodding toward the Todds.

“What? I—”

“I suppose it doesn’t matter,” Henry said. He gave a bark of laughter, but it was devoid of humor. “I have heard many things about you, Chosen One. I have been counselled on the weapons you might use, the magic you might employ, but this? *Rhetoric*? I was never even warned. I couldn’t have known that this would be your specialty power.”

He wasn’t sure what to say, so he didn’t use words at all. “Er…” he trailed as he tucked his hands into his pockets. “Yeh…”

Henry returned his hammer to his sling and looked around. “You looked so woefully inept, but I was wrong. It was I who was the unprepared one,” he said as he slipped a small silver box out of a pouch around his belt. “We will meet again at a later time, Todds’ Chosen One… when the prophecy dictates. I will see you then.”

His fingers found a button on the box and pressed it, causing a puff of smoke to erupt from the ground. When it dissipated, Henry was gone.

“What is he, a magician?” Chris yelled to the Todds, who were filing back across the street.

“I’m sure he has received magician training, yes,” Main Todd said, staring at the spot his nemesis disappeared, his expression blank. “That is hardly the point. Right now, we must make an escape to our home base to plan your next strike.”

“Strike? I’m not sure I would call what we just did a strike,” Chris said. “But where will we go?” 

In front of him, the six other Todds dropped their hoods, revealing six more aggressively average faces. 

Main Todd’s smirk made a comeback. “The Lair of Todd.”"

I’m subleasing from a guy who just graduated in a house of about 5 other people. 

Since I got here the ant problem has gotten worse and worse. What started out as a couple ants turned into swarms, it’s uncomfortable and disgusting. My girlfriend and I have done everything we can to keep them away, ant traps, borax, sprays, etc. it helps, but it easily isn’t enough.

I emailed the landlord making him aware of the problem and he told me that we could hire an exterminator ourselves, but he has nothing to do with it.

From what my girlfriend and I have read online, it seems like it IS his responsibility to take care of. 

Basically what I want to know is:

1) is it his responsibility to take care of it (do I need to look through the lease agreement to find that out)?

2) if it is his responsibility, then how should I confront him about it? "
8y5urb,7,2018-07-11,Prof Jordan B Peterson gave me confidence and stability,cyanaintblue,JordanPeterson,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/8y5urb/prof_jordan_b_peterson_gave_me_confidence_and/,"I just turned 27 years and I am an User Experience Designer. I have been in the industry and completing my 2 years.

I was extremely depressed by the jobs and internships I got after my post graduation and during my uni days. My country is an outsourcing hub so many of the time involving in a design process from start to finish is never possible. 

This always made me have intense job dissatisfaction as I felt all my knowledge was useless and whatever I learned will be useless. I was tired of being in the production part only to be left in dark on not knowing the origins of the product or service.

So after my first internship I joined a start up, the attitude at that place was just ultra casual. No discipline, people come at 11:00 am and 1:00 pm. The boss sleeps at 4 or 5 am and he keeps sending emails at 3:00 am and 4:00 am. I was getting irritated. The work was nice and we managed to get the status of top 10 trending cricket game on the appstore in 6 months and the app is still doing very well.

I already had an offer for joining the corporate so I just joined it (I won't mention the name of the company). The pay is pretty good and I am having a great time. Since the corporate is in service sector I am send to client location to assist with the dev team in the matters of UX and production of a product. Same crap as earlier again. 

No user research, no brainstorming, no persona study, no scenario build up, all people just sitting and behaving like robots with no original thoughts.

This is the time I came to know about prof JBP and I started to listen to him. This is the time I got inspired by him and understood we need to speak up and stand strong, we need to risk ourselves to bring out the truth, being a man of courage, taking initiative instead of others taking for you.

I was initially very silent as when compared to my managers, colleagues I didn't even I have 1 year experience so I thought I should keep listening to these seniors and learn. I learned a lot from them and the knowledge they imparted is still invaluable.

So one day I build up courage starts speaking up, throughout production sessions I start getting invited to managerial and decision making. The company started to understand my potential and the knowledge I have. 1 year later my client awards for my contribution to the project for creativity and original ideas. I was surprised, I couldn't believe.

I soon move to another client, there also I get appreciated and my senior gets notified on my performance. Again I get another project to work from client location.

This is the current client location and it has been 1 year now with this client, I now lead a small team on UX and experimentation on digital interaction, I designed a standard template and now the company follows it as their Bible for all digital projects. 

This will change and get updated based on the technological and skill advancement the company makes.

Last month the current client's Region head sends a email across all teams notifying my contribution to the company and now a talk session is planned along with.me for devs of other teams. 

Topic is on the importance of understanding human cognitive and psychological principles to achieve a efficient UX. This is on the design practices I did while doing the project.

I am not fully Happy as I want to find a career as JBP says, I just now have a job I want a career and hope more years down the line I can achieve with hard work and standing for truth.

I wouldn't have achieved this by JBPs talk sessions on YouTube and instilling courage for millions of people out there.

I will recommend to any junior person to speak up and show your skill and knowledge, keep reading and stand up and prove others that you are capable. (Please be respectful to others though, JBP has many talks on overkill backfire effect)

Nobody will come to you and knock at your door asking weather you are talented and knowledgeable. You have to get out there scoop your shit in one neat pile.

Thanks

Past some searching, he discovered strange engravings on the wall. Something like this had not been seen and it hinted at the previous inhabitants of the planet, which was still a mystery.

Of course, they had known of them, due to the ruins of the city, but not as big of a hint as this one.

The cave was flooded with curious people trying to decode it. It was hectic, crowded, and loud. The cave was at risk of being damaged, so action had to be taken. As a solution they made copies for the public, closing the cave off to only verified personnel. They decided to slap a reward on it as well, in hopes of getting fast results, five thousand dollars.

So the race for the solution was on hand, and we had received our first big clue. Perhaps there was still another lifeform to be discovered or something to be feared.

The onset of summer for many college students, including myself, means learning how to navigate the adult world. Working an internship, paying bills, and realizing the meaning of the ""freshman 20"" all rush in like a wave. All of these ""milestones"" led to me getting into meal prep this summer. Hoping to stretch my internship dollar and drop some weight for wedding season, I started meal prepping. With my meal reserves running low, I went home last weekend for my buddy's wedding. Luckily, I came back with a load of food to put to use, both left over from the wedding and from my parent's garden! Here was my haul:

3 lbs fajita chicken

40 mini tortillas

4 roma tomatoes

4 zucchini

4 squash

3 bell peppers (red and green)

1.5 lb round steak (thanks mom)

So I decided to do 2 meals. The back one has a Mexican flair, with 3 chicken fajitas and roasted squash. The front is pepper steak with sauteed zucchini and tomato.

The chicken fajitas are self explanatory, as the fajita meat was already prepared for me. The recipe for the squash can be found here, with the squash substituted for the zucchini:

[https://www.bowlofdelicious.com/2016/04/14/mexican-roasted-zucchini/](https://www.bowlofdelicious.com/2016/04/14/mexican-roasted-zucchini/)

The second meal was a bit of a comfort meal suggested by my mom. It was pepper steak and rice, with sauteed zucchini in a tomato sauce.

The pepper steak was a recipe from my mom, which I will post in the comments. The zucchini was simple: heat some oil in a pan, sautee for 6-8 minutes, then roughly cut the tomatoes (thick sliced and then quartered) and add them with a hearty helping of basil, oregano, thyme, and a dash of lemon or lime juice. Cook until the tomatoes are watery, and zucchini is soft. You can then either drain off the excess liquid, or add cornstarch to make a sauce that sticks to the zucchini (that's what I did). I added some leftover Italian bread to sop up the leftover tomato sauce off of the zucchini.

I mainly had to buy the liquid ingredients, as I didn't have them on hand. I had to purchase:

1 can diced tomatoes: $0.88

Soy Sauce: $2.12

Vinegar: $1.22

Lime Juice: $1.00

Feta Cheese: $3.98

Cornstarch: $1.56

Total: $10.76

Overall, I'm excited with how it turned out! I was, ahem, sampling the entire way and everything tasted great! I can't wait to try out the pepper steak tomorrow for lunch!"
8y6enr,2,2018-07-11,Feeling Under-equipped. Where should I spend my time learning?,Thnewkid,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/8y6enr/feeling_underequipped_where_should_i_spend_my/,"Since graduation and a month of time off, I've been applying for entry level, or low experience, positions with little success. On top of that, I really just don't feel qualified for anything that's out there. ""Entry level"" where I can learn and build skills seems to not really exist outside of internships which I can't afford to take on. My opportunities seem to limited by either 1) a requirement to have more years of experience than I'm comfortable claiming or 2) technical requirements that I just don't have. 

To address #1, I would place myself comfortably at 2 years experience between my marketing internship, coursework and customer service/sales/retail experience. The only constraining factor here is lack of specific marketing experience. (SEM, SEO, merchandising, ect.)

For #2, I'm more lost. I have social media marketing experience and copywriting work under my belt along with some SQL knowledge, Google Analytics familiarity, and Microsoft Office suite. However, many jobs are asking for niche program proficiency (SAP or Adobe creative suite) or years of SEO work. I don't have these and I'm lost as how to best go abut gaining experience as they were not a part of my degree or internship.

My question can be summed as this: Do I interview (I will anyway if they call) and expect to learn these programs on the job, or are these areas that I should be learning on my own? I know that ideally I would do this all on my own but I'm not really sure where to start. I can probably handle Adobe alone but SAP or some more technical programs are either too costly or unclear to do independently. Can I learn SAP from home, or is that something I need actual work experience on?

Am I being unrealistic or is it normal to feel unequipped for the job market out of college?"

I love him and he's been there for me through a lot. We've also gone through a lot together. We met while we were both in school but he graduated before me, and is now working. Throughout our relationship we've done almost 2 years of long distance. This is due to the fact that I took internships in cities elsewhere, and did a study abroad term. Throughout all of this, he was very supportive of the opportunities that I had gotten and was always there for me. 

Now I'm in a huge pickle. I got asked if I wanted to return to a previous company that I had worked at for an internship. I already technically verbally accepted an offer for another internship that would put me nearby my boyfriend. However.... after hearing this 2nd offer from the previous company, I am really considering reneging the offer that I got. I talked to my boyfriend and he said he wouldn't want to do long distance again if I took this offer - I totally understand that, as we have been through a lot throughout the past couple of months, and I admit that sometimes when I was out (especially during my international exchange term) travelling, we didn't talk very much. I feel very very bad for this, and I blame myself. I kind of tried to lay out the pros and cons thinking it might help.. but I still don't know. 

**Previous Job**  
***pros***  
\- what i want to be doing in the future   
\- really like the work culture and the people   
\- chance to do innovative work  
\- closer to family (like the location better compared to other job)   
\- higher pay (can probably go on more trips or pay off student debt) 

***cons***  
\- break up with boyfriend  
\- less job security   
\- always changing environment (start-upy)  
\- less work life balance 

  
**Current job that I verbally accepted an offer to**   
***pros***  
\- chance to try something new   
\- still be with boyfriend  
\- chance to get full time and stay in the area (would stay with boyfriend)   
\- more work life balance 

***cons***   
\- not too passionate about the type of work that i would be doing  
\- lower pay 

TL;DR: have to decide between an internship that i really want (and would work for full time) and my boyfriend. he doesn't want to do long distance anymore. unsure of what to do. "

A little backstory was that we broke up for a while last year due to me being controlling. I admit that I was controlling because I didn’t trust her, she would get drunk at parties and go out all the time. We got back together after I promised to be more chill. Flash forward, I started to be extremely relaxed with her and let her do whatever she want and she let me do whatever I wanted. Our relationship seemed great and then she went off to another state for an internship. The internship was only a month so I was completely fine. I wanted to prove to her I was chill so I would text her and not expect replies. I would only text her so she would have something to read and so she would know what I was up to while she was gone. A month later she comes back and she seems a little off, no problem. Probably because we haven’t seen each other for a month. We are now watching Netflix and a notification pops up in the corner of her computer from a guy saying “i wish we could be together but we cant”. Without a doubt she knew I saw it so we talked, she explained that she cheated. At that moment, I could’ve taken two routes. I knew it or it’s okay. I told her it’s not her fault because I must’ve given her a reason to cheat. I let her explain herself, let her go easy, and just left to go home. Haven’t communicated since.

I need advice. I’m completely wrecked and depressed. I don’t have any close friends to talk to this situation to because I don’t want it to spread and ruin her image. I love her but obviously the relationship can’t continue. At the moment of realization of the cheating, I knew I was truly alone, no name of any friend popped up when it happened so I could talk to. I just went home and cried my eyes out. Now I’m going onto my phone and seeking advice from strangers. I’m so depressed and don’t know how to continue. Anything will help.

Yesterday I volunteered at the dog shelter like I usually do on Tuesdays. I got there two hours before the shelter opens to the public to help clean up and walk the dogs. Now technically, I am a ""green dog volunteer"" which means I can only walk dogs with green labels; they are the easiest going dogs with no behavioral problems. I've been at the shelter for a few months now and I could have taken the test to become a ""yellow dog volunteer"" meaning I can walk and interact with both green and yellow dogs, but I was waiting until I got more comfortable with putting on harnesses on the dogs, because half the time I seem to do it wrong and need to redo the harness before I walk them. However, a few of the staff members have asked me to walk most of the yellow dogs--generally the ones who are borderline green/yellow in behavior--and there has never been any issues.

^^^^^^^^^.

When I was at the shelter yesterday I noticed one dog (who is labeled a yellow dog because of a injury to his front left leg and because, unknown to me at the time, he has stranger danger) had some poo in his room. I was just going to clean it up quickly but when I opened the door I noticed his whole room was a mess of doggo waste so I closed/locked the door again and went to go find someone to help me. None of the staff members were around, just one volunteer who has been there longer than me and a handful of new interns. I asked the volunteer if that dog had been walked yet because of the mess in his room and the volunteer told me that the dog generally doesn't walk but I could take him. This hasn't been the first time the volunteer has suggested/told me to walk a dog and so I trusted his word and went to get the dog.

^^^^^^^^^.

The dog was already jumping around and acting more energetic than usual even before the first time I opened the door to clean up after him. I didn't think much of it, many of the dogs are excited and vocal during the cleaning hours. I put his harness on him and walked him to the elevator. He was resisting a lot but again I didn't think much of it, since he has a bad leg I figured that was the issue. The volunteer, who was eating at that time, told me that the harness was upside down so I tried to bring the dog back to his room but he didn't want to move. A staff member got off the elevator with another dog at that time and was not happy to see I was trying to walk this dog, telling me about his stranger danger and that he could have bit me. I told her about the mess and asked if I should put him in the meet and greet room and she said yes, but sadly at that time it was being used by puppies who were having their room being cleaned. I had to use treats to bring the dog back to his room since he didn't want to move. I had to go into his room myself (carefully avoiding his little gifts while keeping the door open for him) to get him to go inside and take off his harness and leash. When I went to leave he started jumping around again. I started doing other stuff but I kept my eyes peeled on the meet and greet room for when it was clear to bring him in there. I never got the chance, two different puppies were moved in there before I was able to get the other dog.

^^^^^^^^^.

A little bit later someone walked by the room with the dog I tried to walk and noticed there was blood all over the floor. All the staff members who were around went into hyperdrive mode to bring him into the onsite vet's office. I was helping the interns with the puppies at this time and the staff member who saw me trying to walk him came by and asked if I closed the door on the dog because he was bleeding (this was before I knew of the situation) and I told her no. She left to go deal with the dog and everyone rushed to see what was happening. When he was in the vet's office I started cleaning up his room but the other volunteer took over. It looked really bad in there, I honestly don't know if there was any blood in the room before I took him out but there was a lot of it spread around (from his jumping) when I was cleaning. I tried to explain to the staff what had happened earlier and that I never saw blood but they were too focused on the situation to listen so I just went about the rest of my duties. Apparently he was bleeding from his paws (dunno which ones). The dog was doing much better when he left the vet's office and calmed down for the rest of the time I was there. I hope he's still all right.

^^^^^^^^.

I don't know if it was my own paranoia or if it was actually happening, but for the rest of the morning I just felt the staff glaring angrily at me. When people get mad at me I tend to shrink away and hide (and there isn't many places to hide in the shelter) so I went into a different dog's room (this was also a yellow dog) because he was whimpering loudly and I wanted to calm him down. I was petting him for a good amount of minutes when a different staff member came over and calmly but seriously asked me to leave his room and told me not to go into the yellow dogs rooms without their permission. There never seemed to be an issue with this before, especially since they all knew I spent a good amount of time with one specific yellow dog who looks and acts just like my own dog and since they'd allowed me to walk other yellow dogs, so this felt like a punch in the gut. I didn't go into any other dog's rooms for the rest of the time I was there, not even the green ones.

^^^^^^^^.

I totally understand their concern, the safety of the dogs is number 1 and I would have done the same thing in their position. I just hate how this situation unfolded. All I wanted to do was get this poor dog's room cleaned. Now my months of hard work with associating myself with the dogs and the staff is down the drain and I'm worried that it'll tarnish my chances in the near future of getting a job working with dogs as I try to work towards becoming a dog trainer. It's going to take months to work my way back into their trust with the dogs and right now I'm kinda demotivated to ever ask to take the yellow dog test. But what hurts the most is now I wont be able to play with the dog who looks like mine (and has become my favorite at the shelter) anymore.

**TL;DR- While volunteering I tried to walk a dog I'm technically not allowed to so that his room could get cleaned, was told not to walk him and put him back in his room, he started bleeding and the staff believe I did something to him when I didn't, now I can only interact with a very limited amount of dogs at the shelter**

But things aren't going that well. I'm sorry that I'm really stressed about everything and worry about you a lot whenever I don't hear from you for hours or your phone just dies and I have no idea if you're okay. I'm sorry for taking out my frustration from work on you. It's my first internship and I never thought finance would be this brutal. Sometimes I think they forget I'm 18 and that working 100 hour weeks aren't normal for me.  I'm sorry that I rant to you so much about stress I get from work and recruiting and everything else. We live super different lives. We go to completely different colleges and have majors on opposite sides of the spectrum and things are just... different... you don't understand why I'm stressing so much and why I'm doing all of this and I understand that. Despite not understanding, thanks for accepting and helping me get through it. 

I'm sorry if I blow up on you at 2am when I really just want to go back to my apartment and facetime you and instead I'm stuck at work. I just wish you were here. Long distance sucks, especially when it's year round. You're super kind and considerate and are always really understanding and are always there for me when I'm super stressed and anxious and confused. I really appreciate it. And I feel like I don't tell you enough how appreciative I am of you for sticking by me and always being there for me. I'm sorry that I can't be there for you when I'm at work and you really need me... it feels like shit but its just so hard to manage everything. We've talked about our future together and honestly I can see it happening. 

Thank you for being so kind and understanding. Thank you for always reminding me that you love me. I'm sorry for being insecure. Having my first girlfriend cheat on me really took a toll on my sense of security and thank you for staying with me despite that. You've helped me get over a lot of the insecurities I had when we first started dating and have really helped me develop into a better person. I love you so, so, so much and just want to tell you that I appreciate you and am so grateful to have you in my life. Thanks for being there for me especially since my parents are busy with their own thing and my only sibling is too busy to talk to me because of his job. Thanks for always sending me cute dog videos on instagram to cheer me up and for always being so affectionate. I love you. "

This may include, forcing you to behave like a dog, insults to your appearance, racial slurs, marking you body with words like ""slut, cumdump, etc"", making you crawl around nude in public (on a leash of course), walking around with a vibrator, and more.

For prompts I'm open to any ideas you may have or one of the following:

Professor: You come to my office for help, but all that happens is that I degrade you and your race, hopefully to the point of tears. I then other you an opportunity, do as I say and you might be able to pass the class after all. In reality you'll end up covered in cum (maybe spit and piss as well) and put up on display in the quad.

Boss: Your an intern that somehow got hired at my company. This one I have a few ideas on how it plays out. I could call you to my office and threaten to fire you, unless you do as i say. Or your at the office while no one else is and i force myself on you. Both end with you being the office fucktoy/(Toilet)

Slave Owner: I would purchase you and pretend that I am kind and caring, but in reality see you as nothing more than trash.

I would like to play the role of a trophy wife. This could come in several different varieties and cater to several different fetishes (one of the most obvious being bimbos)

If any of you have seen Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure, my first thought was that I could play a character like Missy, Bill's stepmom. For those of you who haven't seen the movie, Bill and Ted are seniors in high school Missy is only 3 years older than them.

These two quotes sum it up pretty well

**Missy**: Hi, Bill. Want a ride?

**Bill**: Sure, Missy.

\[*she draws a blank stare at Bill*\]

**Bill**: I mean, Mom.

\[*she smiles and puts on her Ray-Bans*\]

**Ted**: \[*whispering to Bill*\] Your stepmom's cute.

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted.

**Ted**: Remember when she was a senior and we were freshmen?

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted!

**Ted**: Now your dad's going for it in your own room!

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted.

**Ted**: Your stepmom \*is\* cute, though.

**Bill**: Shut up, Ted!

**Ted**: Remember when I asked her to the prom?

**Bill**: SHUT UP, TED!

Anyway I'd love to play a character like her and you could play either the father or my stepson

Another option for a scene would be one where I am a younger girl that you are seeing/married to and I am one of your daughters life long friends, so either we have to keep it secret or it is just very very uncomfortable for her.

Another idea is that I am a secretary of yours or an intern or something, and we are having an affair that you have to keep hidden from your family,

Also feel free to message me about doing one of my older prompts I would just prefer this one tonight. 

Either way I would love to play a woman who is much younger than you, sort of a forbidden love thing. I can't wait to hear from you all!

**P.S.** All charaters in these RPs are 18+"
8ya0ff,7,2018-07-12,Been dealing with RSI for 4-6 months and no signs of improvement,tigerx51v,RSI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RSI/comments/8ya0ff/been_dealing_with_rsi_for_46_months_and_no_signs/,"Hey everyone, I could really use some help with my RSI condition. Although I haven't officially been diagnosed with it, I believe that is my issue. I am a healthy 23 year old male that over did my wrists and forearms pretty bad while working (hands on work like gripping and tightening). Usually my forearms would get sore while doing it but I just kept going. One day about 4 or 5 months ago, they hurt the next morning and have hurt since. From that moment on, I haven't lifted weights, played video games, or do anything to aggravate the injury. I did have to work another two months at my internship which required a lot of typing and clicking.

During this it got to a point where it hurt to mouse click . After I was done with the internship in May, I was able to rest more and just had a few instances where they had to be used like to move houses but that was it. I've had an mri and xrays done that show nothing. The pain comes and goes, usually it is a dull pain that is on the underside of my arm (elbow to wrist). All of the doctors cannot find anything wrong and either say I am too young for an RSI or that rest will heal it. I've experimented with bracing them and taking ibprufen. The best I got to was when they wouldn't hurt during the day or with small tasks like unloading the dishwasher. I didn't do well in those early stages of stretching or doing strength exercises. I've had some physical therapy done recently. I start my desk job in 20 days and really need to fix or improve this issue before then. I get the most pain from typing, clicking, squeezing. I appreciate any insight or recommendations.  "

It's becoming a strain on our relationship.",Dirseyb9,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8yaj3n/my_25_m_girlfriend_20_f_has_a_crazy_schedule_this/,"Sarah is an engineering student in college. Every summer, she takes a couple college courses instead of taking a break, because she wants to get done with college faster. It will save her a lot of money, taking summer classes, because they're on a cheap per-credit basis, and will allow her to graduate two semesters early.

This summer, she's taking 3 classes and she also got an internship, at a great company. Her internship is 40 hours a week, and her classes are 10 hours a week, just of class time, not counting studying. She commutes to her internship by train, and studies on the train, so that adds another 10 hours a week that she's busy.

In comparison, I just work 40 hours a week, and have a really short commute.

We've been together for 3 years, and while she's generally been busier than me, this is the craziest schedule she's had.

----

It's been frustrating, because on weekdays, Sarah's schedule basically is work/class/sleep/work/class/sleep... Repeat

And on weekends, she wants to have a lot of fun to make up for working so hard during the week, so every Saturday she wants to go drinking and partying with her friends, staying up late. And of course she's hungover Sundays, wanting to stay in bed till the afternoon, then spend the rest of the day laying around reading a book or drawing.

She invites me around a lot on the weekends, but I miss being able to do more than party with a huge group, then spend the next day tending to her hangover. But when i suggest skipping the Saturday night partying, she basically says ""But I'm so busy, I hardly ever see my friends, I miss out on so much during the week anyway."" But even just seeing her friends weekly, is more often than I see a lot of my friends.

----

I don't know what to do. I think it's great she's so driven, and I understand why she wants to graduate early and not have to take out as much in student loans. But I miss her during the week, when she's not home till 10 pm and she's too tired to do much. And I'm not having fun with all the weekend partying anymore.

TLDR - My girlfriend is on an insane schedule this summer, and it's putting a strain on our relationship. "

First you take a testing session where one part is a logic - ""find the fitting pattern"" shit and second some math problems.  
Like that autist I am, I kind of started filling it while the GT employee was explaining the details which apparently I wasnt supposed to.  
I noticed this a couple questions in and stopped, but obv the employee had seen it too.  


Now, I was supposed to have received the test results by email 2 weeks in and a month has gone by without reply and I think it's because of that.  
If that ends here it's no big deal, but is there any chance I will be permanently blacklisted for this, or even that they share this with other companies too, forcing me to appropriately commit suicide?"
8yb70m,104,2018-07-12,Paranormal abilities &amp; synchronicity,Hathor46,patches765,https://www.reddit.com/r/patches765/comments/8yb70m/paranormal_abilities_synchronicity/,"Now for a topic that is somewhat controversial but dear to my heart. Not sure how much **#Patches765** has talked about this yet as far as I’m aware but I'm going to ease into this topic slowly. Today I'm going to talk about paranormal physic abilities and phenomenon. Physic gifts run in my family on $Mother’s side. Mother always said she predicted the big earthquake of ’89 beyond that I don’t know much about her gift.  Some complained about some negative entity in the house that was messing with her at one time but I don’t remember when that happened except that she did a lot of praying and eventually it went away.  As a child I remember believing in ghosts but never 100&amp;#37; sure that I saw any. I felt them and heard them but that was all I can remember. For example, feeling a hand come out of the wall and touch your back while you are sleeping on one side of your bed or hearing voices in your head saying weird things that you can’t explain. 

As I got older I didn’t think about these things much but once I got to middle school and high school my precognitive gift was in full force. I could see little snippets of the future. Nothing major about 15-30 seconds before an event happened. I accepted this gift as a warning system for bad things that were about to happen. For the rest of my adult life my precognitive gifts kind of dissipated. Lately it’s been all about synchronicities.  I’m a strong believe that things happen for a reason and nothing is by chance whether it be by some higher power or physic ability I’m not sure. 

*Last week* I had a dream about going back on jury duty. I served in Feb of this year on a criminal trial. Always wondered what it would be like to be on a jury and now I know. Never want to do THAT again. I am thankful for the experience and kept my emotions in check during deliberations but at the end when they read the verdict I couldn’t help feel sorry for the guy and started to cry. A few days later (after the dream) I was at the grocery store during lunch hour which is a very uncommon time for me to be there. I heard two gentleman talking in the street catching up as I walked by and as I sat in my car to leave, I looked up as they were finishing the conversation and one gentleman was heading to the store.  I looked closer at him and it was juror #12 from my case. He didn’t see me and I didn’t get a chance to say hi. All that I remember was that he was an older gentleman and he was a man of God. He led us thru prayer every day before we started on the case. (My trial lasted 5 days.) I just remember having mad respect for this guy.  Freaky?

\***side story**\* My company participates in a corporate work study program with a local private school. One of the students that went there worked for me for 4 years and graduated. A year had past and some people were wondering what ever happened to this kid. I messaged him on FB and never heard back. (about two months ago).  A rep from his school later told me that he joined the military. Last week I had to do some errands in the evening on a Friday. I had already picked a new restaurant to try that would be cheap comfort food for us after we were done shopping. I just had a feeling that I was meant to go there. As two workers brought our food I looked up and saw a HS student that works at my company as an intern (for another department.) I had no idea he worked there but it was nice to chat with him for a min, introduce my family to him and ask about school. Now this is the freaky part…….later that evening I finally heard back from that student who worked for me for 4 years! What are the odds running into/talking to two kids that go/went to that HS on the same day? 

Also at that same store we ran into someone who lived in our development that remembered me from last year’s annual picnic. She was excited to see me! That was so sweet and really gave me a boost. 

Another story. There is a parent that has a child in the same grade as my son. They went to preschool together and were in different classrooms in Kindergarten.  We invited ourselves to each other’s kids birthday parties last year. For the two weeks leading up to my trip to California (you can read all the gory details here [My Recent Trip to California](https://www.reddit.com/r/patches765/comments/8tnju1/my_recent_trip_to_california/)…..) I ran into her at least 3 different times in a two week period around the city. What are the freakin’ odds??? One time at the grocery store, another time can’t remember the exact whereabouts, and lastly at the gas station on our way to head out for our California trip. What is the universe trying to tell me about this person?

Yesterday I attended a makeup parent teacher conference for my daughter at her daycare. You can laugh all you want she is only 3 but I still believe in being an *involved* parent! We talked about my goals for my daughter and also brushed a little bit on her brother.  Her Teacher gave me some advice on a few areas. Later that day I was at the library returning some books and I started to randomly browse. There it was on the shelf- a new non- fiction book about education.  I have mixed feelings about my sons education at this time. He is transitioning from public to private school in a month and this book was exactly wanted I needed at THIS MOMENT.  Side note, there was also a book about a 20 day diet program that caught my interest. I had done the **#Whole30** earlier this year and was looking to start another round of SOMETHING. 

I’m also a strong believer in the fact that some people enter and/or exit your life at different times to fulfill some purpose. You may not fully understand that purpose but it happens. I think #patches765 gave me a book on synchronicity several years ago. Might be time to take another look at it. I’m not complaining about these events but I do find them very fascinating!

Question that I have: Is there a correlation between all that trauma we experienced in that house in our younger years with the negative entities/energy in that house?

In other news I decided to get more involved at church.  One of the requirements for going to the new private school was to have regular church attendance.  Last year was  a bad year for me spiritually.  It was like a ""Christmas and Easter"" only type of year.  After Easter this year I made a personal commitment to start going more often. The children need it, I need it. I even joined their little singing group.  We are too small to have any type of choir but I went to practice last night and it was fun.  All those years of being afraid to sing....

&gt;**$Mother:**  (several years ago) You can't sing. (Yet she insisted I join her church choir as a teen).  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Guitarplayer/keyboardist**:  (last night) You have a nice voice and can sing!  Just need a little bit more confidence to project to the back.

That's all for now.  Thanks for listening.

Most have, at a rough estimate of what I have seen, a 70/30 split in favor of not paying full price anywhere, with the most common and most obvious reason being that if you do not land a BigLaw position, you will be left with around $300k in debt and no way to pay it back. What I have been thinking about, though, is why $300k? Obviously I understand basic math. Add up the expenses for 3 years and you get around $300k depending on the school. What I mean is that, at least from what I have seen, BigLaw placement is almost entirely dependent on 1L grades, with your 1L grades determining 2L summer internships which almost exclusively determine post-law placement. Assuming this is the case (and if it isn't, please let me know), then why would Mr. BigLawOrBust, after getting poor 1L or hell even first semester grades not drop out?

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

School: California Polytechnic State University-Pomona

Major: Computer Information Systems-Concentration in Cyber Security (Information Assurance)

GPA: 3.2

I'm a very tech savvy person, but I have no foundational knowledge in IT. Here is my plan

1. Studying for my CompTIA A+ Certification right now. Should be done within a month

2. Going to get very involved with Cyber Security club at school. Also planning on trying to find a job as a helpdesk position to get experience while attending school in my third year of college (graduating in 5 years).

3. I already bought the Todd Lammle book for the CCENT/CCNA and started studying quite a bit before I realized that I'd be better off with getting the A+ first. I made the mistake of trying to go for the CCENT with no experience. **I am planning on studying and passing the CCENT after I pass the A+**

All this should take about six months. And although I can't plan on what's going to happen in the far future, here's my general guideline.

4. **Try and get an internship over the summer going into my second-to-last year of college.** If I can't get a cyber security position, I'll do my best to at least find an IT internship.

5. **Study and Pass the CCNA, then Security+.** Not sure which one I should do first. But either way, I want to have the CCNA and Security+ before graduating.

6. **Find a Cyber Security internship** in my last Summer before going into my 5th year of college. 


So in summary, I am going into my third year of college and I realized that I haven't done shit except for maintain a decent GPA throughout school so far. In my ""plan,"" I want to earn the CompTIA A+, CCNA, CompTIA Security+ certifications in three years. Will/Should this be enough to have a solid resume going out of college?"

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

Call it a vent, a cry for help, or a romantic tragedy in the making. But please, take a look.

Thank you in advance.

I met this girl – we’ll call her M- in October 2016 and we had talked a few times as acquaintances for a little over a month. I invited her to our fraternity date party in December- we talked for hours and we had a great time- I went to her house and fell asleep in her bed. Shortly thereafter, finals came and winter break was upon us. We texted back and forth periodically during the break; maybe once every three or four days. I had come to like this girl… a lot (I will save the descriptions of her attributes for brevity’s sake). 

When we returned to school in January 2017, I had asked her on an official first date. She told me that she would love to but canceled on me two or three times for various reasons- which at the time I was skeptical about, but later found them to be true. I was down but certainly not out. My best friend told me verbatim, “She’s not into you man. Who the hell is this girl anyway?” One would think this is enough discouragement to quit, but the real dagger came when she posted a snapchat story of this guy – we’ll call him Z- in her apartment at 3 AM (this is important for later). I was angry and figured it was over. 

Still in January, I was friends with another girl in her sorority, and on a night in early February, I hooked up with this friend – we’ll call her A. She was a friend at the time and I really had no intention in making things intimate or getting serious with her, as I had still been set on M. Fast forward two weeks, and my friends (including A) and I are drinking at my apartment. My 20-year old self asks A if she wants to “do anything” that night and she says no but still spends the night, as she was too drunk to go home (and I guess she didn’t want to Uber back). That night, M texted me and asked if I wanted to hang out. I said she could come to my apartment while people were still over, but I ended up going to her place once people had left and A had fallen asleep. M and I hung out late into the night and ended up hooking up for the first time. 

DISCLAIMER: I know I sound like a terrible human being at this point. I was thinking with the wrong head. But the feeling of excitement, confusion, and success I had when M had texted me is unparalleled. I felt like she was interested and those “blow-off” excuses were real. 

In mid-February, I finally got to take M on an official first date. She was nervous and had heard through the grape vine that I had maybe had a “thing” with A. She asked me, “Did you and A ever have a thing?” I can’t remember if the diction was “a thing” or “hooked up.” The first mistake: I said 

“no, we hadn’t.” 

It was a blatant lie, but in my head, I didn’t want to admit that on the very first date (I know this is wrong and it will show up later). I convinced myself that a white lie like that would save her from hurt and from me thinking I was just the run-of-the-mill fratboy who could have sex with every girl that shows the slightest interest. I was genuinely intrigued by M and I wanted to make something of it. Ever since October 2016. 

Fast forward six-seven months, and we had been dating the whole time since. She is my beautiful girlfriend; the one I get to call my own. 

One day she was eating lunch with a few of my buddies, and my hookup with A was talked about between two of my friends. M was confused and hurt; she sat me down and asked if it was true. I said yes and profusely apologized. She also asked

“Were you protected? Please tell me you were?”

Low and behold, as I feared more hurt for her, I lied about that too. (Important later)

She told me that she felt betrayed and that she couldn’t stand the lying. I explained that I was angry about seeing Z on her snapchat story that night, but she told me that nothing happened between the two of them, and I firmly believed her (and still do). Luckily for me, she forgave me within a few days. She was able to look past it and operate as normal, although today she tells me she never really recovered from it. 

Fast forward to January 2018. M was about to leave for her semester abroad in Switzerland. Things had gone spectacularly between us and I really believed I had struck gold with this one. When she left, I felt so sad and lonely. Unfortunately, as much as I hate admitting this, there were times I got angry at her and jealous because she was living her best life, as I was having a tough semester alone (it would have been a difficult semester even with her on campus- academics, roommate and family issues). The one saving grace is that I worked my ass of at my part time job, and with the help of my grandparents, I was able to visit her in Spain and France for spring break. If you can picture heaven, for me it was that week. Every part of me wants to relive that week with her, but I will save the specific details for the sake of time and attention. If you’re still reading this, thank you again.

When I had returned to the US for the remainder of the semester, we got into a bit of an argument over text. One of her guy friends was struggling with his relationship because his girlfriend was horrified by his number of sexual encounters. I said 

“Well if he treats her well now, what does it matter what he did in the past?”

M thought this was suspicious of me to say, so she asked me about my sexual history and my use of protection. I told her the correct number, I also hesitantly said 

“Protection with all of them,” knowing she would lose it if told her the truth. 

The fight got a bit worse, but we reconciled the day after. It wasn’t until that day after, I had realized that my white lie, panic lie, whatever you want to call it, was a terrible thing to do.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I had to be a man and fess up.

I texted her the next morning, so after lunch in her time, and she was disappointed but happy that the truth came out. She didn’t text me for two days, as she thought about what to say ad how to react. She was disgusted, furious, and very, very hurt. The worst part: she was 6000 miles away, so we couldn’t resolve anything in person; we were subjected to phone calls and FaceTime. 

Now if you’ve ever had to do long distance, you know how much it sucks (for lack of a better term). I certainly didn’t help things. A few weeks after the confession, she said she had forgiven me, but was still very much hurt, and would occasionally get angry at me when her thoughts ran about. 

Fast forward to the middle &amp; end of may. M had visited our campus for a week to celebrate her birthday and to see everyone she hadn’t seen since December 2017. She stayed at my place the whole week, and we had a fun week together. A week later, she met with me in person before the summer had started. I was working (and still am) working in Charlotte for the summer and she is in Philadelphia. She broke up with me right before my job started but this is the reason I am writing this post. She said,

“Look this is very hard for me, but I want to focus on myself this summer. I didn’t feel the same back on campus for that week, so I want to see how I’ll feel by myself. We’ll be long distance again and I don’t know If I can emotionally manage it at the time. I still love you and we’ll revisit our relationship when we return to campus in August. Hell, I may drive down to NC to see you and try to get you back. But let’s take the summer to focus on ourselves.”

I agreed with her as it seemed (and really is) like a good idea. 

After a year and two months of dating, I am now… single…?

The past month (June 2018) has been a struggle. My internship isn’t what I thought it would be- the people are pay are nice, but I don’t really like what I’m doing. I am not around any of my friends from college, and most of the other interns are from the area, so they are not eager to make friends for the summer. M’s job isn’t the best either. I have had my bouts of drunken calls and sad texts to win her back; roughly two weeks ago, we cut social media ties. 

It’s been a struggle to accept that she is no longer a part of my life. Although we are separated in our summer jobs, I had become acclimated to the long-distance relationship while she was abroad. 

I have come to reflect on a lot of things. 

One: no matter how much I show her I care for her in every way, flowers and dates, showing her off to the world, texting her every morning when I wake up and telling her “I love you” every night, It really means nothing if I can’t be honest with her about my past, no matter how small or insignificant it may be, or no matter how much it may initially anger her- the initial anger is always much better than the long-term hurt.

Two: I am not perfect, I should not try to act like I am, or pretend I am. I wanted to forget any mistakes and regrettable hookups I had before M, but regardless, I should embrace them as my own and learn not to be so promiscuous. I don’t like my past self and I will make sure to live differently. In fact, I think I was a scumbag and never really had the guts to let myself know that what I was doing was wrong and hurtful

**This is where I seek advice:** We will see each other for our final year of college come mid-August. I have come to accept the fact that if she wants to move on, I am ok with it and I can move on myself- it’s not the end of the world. But then again, we haven’t been in the same location for an extended period of times since December 2017, so I don’t know I she’ll feel differently with me back in the general picture every day. 

I understand why she is hurt. I jeopardized her health (luckily, she is clean, as am I). I betrayed her trust and now she is insecure about the smallest of things. She sometimes thinks if the whole relationship was a lie or never meant to be because it was started on a rocky foundation. She thinks I am “unbelievably sketchy.” I made her question everything about me. 

What do I do? When I see her in person, I’ll be swept away by her because she really is my world and my best friend. I don’t know how she’ll feel come August. I am in a constant battle with myself on how to proceed. Once again, any comments and advice are welcome. Am I just a bad person who should use this relationship as a learning experience? Can we make it work because we will finally be in the same location again? Can she ever completely forgive me, even though she thinks that the relationship was doomed from the start? Is she overreacting? Am I a bad human?

Can we ever be friends again?

I’ve certainly left out some details that I can’t remember at the moment, but I will most likely remember more if anyone comments.

Thank you from a distraught young adult who doesn’t sleep at night and who is just looking for an outlet and peace."

I’ve always been good at school and test taking, and I’ve always been considered “smart” because of this. But now that I’m here, I feel like I’m not actually smart enough to be here. I feel like I finessed my way into this internship by faking confidence/outgoingness in my interviews and having a high enough GPA. My GPA is only good because I’m great at rote memorization and using the process of elimination on multiple choice tests. I know accounting, but I’m not smart in the sense of having a natural ability to come up with solutions quickly. Despite what I said in my interviews, I’m not even a fast learner. I can hear things explained to me but a lot of times I won’t actually understand/process it until I do it myself. 

On the other two teams I’ve been on since starting, I’ve been lucky to have seniors who are very clear on what they want from me and super nice second years sitting near me, helping me understand everything and giving me recommendations on how to do my tasks. But on this new engagement I started on yesterday, I don’t have that, so I just feel like an idiot. The senior only comes in a couple times a day to ask me to do something, and I spend hours working on tasks that I know should probably not take that long. I spend a lot of time trying to understand the files I’m looking at, and then trying to understand what I’m supposed to be doing, and then trying to figure out how to do it. I literally just learned how to do do a Vlookup yesterday after wasting several hours going through information manually. I can tell the only second year on here is brilliant by the way he figures things out when I ask him confusing questions and quickly finds solutions to problems. But most of the time, I don’t even know how to ask questions because I’m unclear about everything. 

This scares me, because I know come busy season, things will probably be a lot more like this engagement than my previous ones. With more work to be done, people above me will be less likely to take the time to walk me through everything. And I’m not smart enough to just figure out how to do everything on my own. I’m sure I can figure things out, but it’ll take a lot longer than is probably reasonable.

Is auditing filled with a lot of problem solving? Or is it more processes within repetitive processes that I can learn? I really want this job and all the benefits of it, but I’m worried I’m not actually fast/smart enough, so I’m not impressing the people I’m working with. "

Does anyone else experience this?,littlefoot17,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/8ygmr0/anxiety_is_making_me_feel_like_i_am_going_crazy/,"Hi, everyone! Just a warning, kind of a long story, as you can probably tell from the paragraph. So my relationship with anxiety has always been a thing, at least from what I remember from childhood (undiagnosed OCD). But recently my anxiety has gotten worse, no thanks to unfortunate events over the past few years involving 3 family deaths and the loss of a childhood home and pets. While I have always been kind of an anxious person, I have upgraded (downgraded?) to full-fledged anxiety attacks. Heart palpitations, shortness of breath, closing of the throat, the whole shebang. This doesn't happen often but when it does, it feels like hell and it's becoming more frequent. I also have really irrational worries. I worry that if I don't check the stove before I leave that my apartment will burn down. I worry that if I sit around too often, I will develop blood clots and die. Anything to do with death really. On top of that, I have been developing intrusive thoughts. But the worst part is that last week I was laying in bed and randomly became afraid that I was going to lose my sense of reality and start hallucinating. I have never hallucinated in my life (unless you count the 2 times that I tried psychedelics) and have never had this fear before but it scared the shit out of me. My ears got hot, I felt nauseous, blurry vision, all the symptoms of feeling like I was about to faint. I was just so afraid that if I started to hallucinate that I would do something terrible to myself and nobody would be around to help (my boyfriend is currently living out of town for an internship and family lives hours away) and that my poor dog would be injured. Just completely irrational thinking. I didn't sleep that night and obviously didn't hallucinate but I was convinced that if I looked at any one object too long that I was going to lose it. This is when I finally came to terms with the fact that I need to see a professional to sort this out but I can't do that until the summer is over because I cannot afford the copay with my insurance at the moment (I work at a charter school so I have no solid income for the summer). So my real point is, does anyone else struggle with these strange occurrences? If so, how do you cope with this, including or not including professional help? Or am I on the verge of a psychological breakdown? I'm just really confused and hate living this way and just need some advice or encouragement or something helpful. This increasing anxiety has really been affecting my life without me realizing it and I've secluded myself from my friends and lost interest in things that I used to love doing and haven't told even my closest loved-ones about how bad it's gotten because I don't want to worry them or feel judged, so I'd appreciate anything at this point. Thanks a million in advance to anyone who reads this and takes the time to reply."

8yh166,14,2018-07-13,I [20M] have a longtime crush on an old friend [21F] and am trying to start a relationship,amiinovermyhead22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8yh166/i_20m_have_a_longtime_crush_on_an_old_friend_21f/,"For some backstory, when I was younger around 14 through 17 I used to play junior golf with my old friend who we will call Leah.  Leah was always super kind to everyone and had such a sweet smile and personality that I always had a crush on her.  During summers we played once a week on Wednesday mornings and I would generally be in the same group as her.  Being the edgy high school kid I was, I was never able to hold conversations too long and tended to get way too nervous when we were playing, so I didn't talk much to her about anything outside of golf.

Fast forward 3 years and my friends have been asking me to make an Instagram to send me memes, and I finally decide to make one.  While going through the suggested followers her name popped up at one point, and I decided to follow her on insta and see if she remembers me.  Surprisingly, it worked, and we suddenly had contact again over social media.  

Fast forward another two months and its May of 2018 and the weather has gotten warm again, so I decided to take a shot at it and ask her to play golf with me this summer.  She agrees, and about 1 month later we actually manage to get a free day to play.  The round of golf was amazing and I had an incredible time with her, she also claimed to have a good time as well and we agreed to setup another day to play.  This is where the issue is coming in.  We both have internships and are working 40 hours a week, and in  addition Leah is preparing for the LSAT test to get into law school.  Neither of us have had much free time to get out and play, and I have been trying to text her to get to know her better, but she only answers in specific intervals.  Typically it is early in the morning before she goes to work, and will not answer me the rest of the day.

I'm trying to figure out if there is a disinterest in talking to me, based on the fact that she only answers my texts once a day, or perhaps she is just too busy to text throughout the day.  Ever since I first texted her it would take about a day or two for her to respond, so there has not been any change in her texting habit after playing golf with me.  Or maybe I am just totally overreacting and need to let her do her thing because it is a very hectic and busy time in our lives, but I know shes a catch and I want to take the right approach to this to work things out.

Other important information is I am finishing up at community college before going to university and live at home, and she goes to college about 3 hours away from where we both live.  

Thanks!!

TL;DR  Have a crush on an old friend, played golf with her again last month, had a great time, conflicting schedules and college stress is making it hard to hangout more, not entirely sure if she is interested. 

Edit:  Meant to put this under the dating flair!"

Title says it all.  I'm 21 and the only history I have on my credit report is 2 years and 6 months of an auto lease (I'm a cosigner), which has 6 months left.  I haven't missed a single payment, and CreditKarma indicates that my VantageScore is right at 680.

I was hoping to go for the Chase Freedom Unlimited (CK says my approval odds are good, and it says they're fair for the Chase Freedom).  I don't know if that would be a good choice however as I don't really know my true approval odds.  I know my score is fair and my credit history is limited (with no missed payments), but I don't want to ding my credit score with a hard inquiry if it's almost certain I'd be declined.  My hangup is the fact that I have not had a credit card before, so I don't know how negatively Chase will look on that.  That said, my car lease is a Mazda, and Mazda Capital Services runs through Chase, so that can't hurt. 

I'm a student (currently an intern this summer) and am in a great financial position, so paying off my card monthly will be no problem.  That said, I'd like to start building credit ASAP so I have a more solid credit history when I graduate.  If anybody can give me some advice (or point me towards a card that might be more appropriate) I would be very appreciative.

Just for reference, I personally bank with PNC and was also considering the PNC Cash Rewards card.  Please let me know what you think!  Thanks for the help."

About two years ago I befriended Sarah. We quickly became attached by the fact that we had a lot in common and we simply got one another. We were two introverts who had were comfortable with each other (and for you fellow introverts, you know how valuable that is). 

After a year our conversations became gradually flirtatious in nature until we decided to make it official and become a couple. Things went well. I, at least, was falling for her more and more. However, one day she told me that she was scared to lose me if this somehow didn’t work out. She said she valued my presence in her life so much more and figured it would be safer if we were friends. I didn’t argue because I honestly didn’t want to lose her either.

So we broke it off and remained friends and I genuinely was okay with it. (I know by this point people might assume that I was secretly angry or distraught by it but I promise I wasn’t. I didn’t want to lose her because she was my best friend and ultimately, if we didn’t get together, I would have wanted her to stay in my life for good.) 

Yet, as one could expect, there was something amiss about it all; a shift in tone occurred between us and it became awkward, though I desperately tried to keep it from furthering. I tried to bring back that best friend spark so much. I had even pitched the idea of writing handwritten letters to one another to make it like “our thing”, you know? 

Spoiler alert: I wrote her 5 letters, only ever got 1 in return. 

This all happened in May when I had just quit my job which I’d been in for a year and was beginning an internship with my church for our youth group. I was in a transitional period. By this point, our conversations were days apart. In terms of texting, I would text her a long paragraph, only to wait a week to a halfhearted response.  

One day, I just got tired and didn’t feel like replying for a few days. I figured that if it wasn’t a big deal to her to reply, why should it be a big deal for me? 

After a week of not replying (mind you, her longest time responding to me was 2 weeks), l felt so shitty so I sent a long apology to her, hoping that she would respond. 

She never did. 

Now here we are in mid-July and nothing has changed. No response, nothing. 

Normally I would have just accepted it at that but the thing that bothers me is: she still frequently checks my insta-stories, she’s still actively posting without having blocked/unfollowed me. She still posts and I can’t escape the feeling that she knows I’m seeing them too. 

Last week was her birthday, and so after talking it with a friend, I decided to try one more time and send her a message. 

“Happy Birthday, Sarah! I hope you have a wonderful day today! 🎈”

A reply never came and she still updates everything else like nothing’s bothered her. 

And yes, I have thought about “what if her number is different? or she hasn’t been receiving your messages? etc etc - to that I ask: wouldn’t she have reached out if I hadn’t messaged her in a while?  Like hey are you still alive? Kind of thing. But no, she’s just unresponsive. 

I don’t know if she’s doing some passive-aggressive silent treatment kind of business or what but I just don’t understand why she didn’t just block me or unfollow me - does she not care that much? What changed? Did I do something super wrong that I was unaware of? 

I can’t lie, every time she posts a picture or selfie, my heart aches - my best friend isn’t my best friend anymore. 


If nothing else, if you’ve gone though something similar or simply have had someone close walk out on you - how did you cope? do you have any advice to a healing heart? should I reach out one last time to say goodbyes? 

Your insight would be greatly appreciated and if you made it to the end of this post - thank you for listening 💌"
8yhcd3,2,2018-07-13,I think my laziness is going to catch up with me.,throwaways5101,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/8yhcd3/i_think_my_laziness_is_going_to_catch_up_with_me/,"I graduated in December, 2017 with B.S. in civil engineering with a 3.34 gpa. I did fairly well in school on paper, although I don't feel like I learned much about civil engineering. I started my first job when I was 14, and I had some sort of job every summer sense then, except for one summer.... I saved and invested aggressively, and landed a full ride to the university I attended. During my education I did undergraduate research for two years, and had one internship in which I got to oversee construction in rural towns in Alaska. All told I graduated with $42000 in savings.

I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitas in 2013. That summer was the worst of my life. I was horribly sick for several months and my girlfriend of 3 years left me for another guy lol. Somehow I continued to work that summer. A temporary steroid called Prednisone helped a lot. I was honestly on my deathbed and that drug saved my life. I got off Prednisone and onto a long term drug that work okay until my senior year of college. The pain and damage to my quality of life was annoying, but manageable, so I quit my research and struck through with graduating. In December after graduating I started Prednisone and again, it did wonders. it applied for about 100 jobs and had only 2 interviews, neither of which I landed as jobs. The thing that really sucks about Prednisone is that it stops working. That and the permanent bone damage it does if your on it for longer than 3 months. By February I was starting a new medication and I decided I should wait to get better because I really didn't think I could work effectively if the medication didn't work. Sense then I've tried a few medications and haven't gotten any better, and know I wouldn't be able to work right now. I also contracted a parasite about a month ago, probably because one of my medications lowered my immune system. It's now been 7 months and I'm worse off than when I graduated.

So as you may have guessed, this is the first summer without work sense I was 14. Probably the most critical summer as far as having a career in civil engineering. Honestly I don't remember that technical parts of engineering at all. I put minimal effort into a lot of my work. Before exams I would cram for 5 days in a row on very specific material I believed would be on the test. Then for weeks I would day dream in class and use my friends for complete homework and projects. I never really had great aspirations about being an engineer. I was always in it for the money. I only decided on civil because I was told it was easier than mechanical and electrical. Lots of stuff was interesting, but only the stuff that would be interesting to any curious individual. Just 7 months ago I thought about continuing the standard lifestyle of making a home for myself someplace with a successful career. The standard lifestyle that I have been breezing through for years. It wasn't that hard. I struggled through phases of my disease, but life always had a clear and achievable path. Its been 7 months and I feel unhirable. I lay around playing video games and watching TV every single day, and I have literally forgetting half of the things I'm suppose to know.

 The disease is an easy excuse. It is a horrible disease, and much of these past 7 months have been spent in physical pain. That's not the true problem of the disease though. Pain is manageable. It doesn't actually stop me, it just damages my quality of life. You probably don't want the gory details, I know. But those details are key to understanding how horrible of a disease it is. When I have to poop 4 times a day, I consider myself cured for the time being. At 10 times, I'm pretty concerned about doing any activities outside of my house. At 15 I try my best to leave home as little as possible. I'm somewhere around 15-20 right now. Have been for over a month now. Much of that is probably the parasite, but I know the disease is there too. Today I had to pick up medicine from Safeway. Its about a 20 minute drive. That drive is a scary experience for me.  I realize when I have to poop, sometimes 30 seconds before I am pooping no matter what. And when I drive, or am in public, I think about that. My anxiety builds and stomach tenses. The entire journey I feel worried. The 20 minutes there 20 minutes back drive today took about an hour and twenty minutes. I stopped twice on the way to poop, and when I was there, I attempted to poop twice even though I didn't need to because my anxiety was forcing me to. I suppose anxiety can't force anything, but it really did feel like it was. If you can understand that anxiety, you might excuse my 7 months of video games. I have, to my own downfall.

Trouble is, an excuse doesn't help me. I need to get better, and I'm trying, albeit maybe not hard enough. But on top of that, I have a lifestyle to get through. I h a v e to get money to support myself. Something should have happened these 7 months, but I purely digressed. It really can't continue this way.  "

8yiash,2,2018-07-13,How can I set up future financial stability? 19 y/o student seeking advice,needhelpwithmoney11,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8yiash/how_can_i_set_up_future_financial_stability_19_yo/,"Hello,

I want to preface by introducing a bit about myself and how my background relates to my issues and concerns with financial security. My single father is a janitor and we’ve always lived paycheck to paycheck. Regardless, I’ve lived a very fortunate and comfortable life, but sometimes that’s easy to forget about when many of my high school peers had parents who bought cars for them, etc. My primary struggles in high school were getting around (eventually bought my own car) and getting luxuries that many of my high school peers got (new shoes, brand name clothes, etc.).

Now, in college, I have enormous financial opportunity, but I feel like I’m throwing it away. I believe that my past background has lead me to become materialistic. Sort of the idea that now that I finally have money, I just want to spend it on things I’ve always wanted.

Here’s my current situation:

- I’m 19 years old.
- I go to arguably the best college in the US, and as an extension of that, I was fortunate enough to receive a full ride.
- Due to scholarships and my college’s graciousness, I am getting paid to go to school.
- I have no expenses (needs).
- As an extension of having no needs, if any “major” needs pop up, my university will cover them (ex: emergency flight back home, interview clothes, passport).
- I am studying computer science.


Overall, I’m extremely lucky, and I’m so glad my work in high school has paid off. With that said, I believe I’m treating myself a little too much.

This is what the numbers look like for me:

- The past two summers in junior and senior year of high school I earned $3,200 each summer working an internship.
- I made an additional ~$6,000 over the last two high school years from other jobs during school, etc.
- My freshman year of college I was graciously granted approx. ~$7,500 (this is after everything is covered).
- This current summer, I am earning $22.2/hr full time at 40hr/wk. I am actually working in a different state, but I am once again lucky that I am living with a host family that doesn’t ask me to pay rent. Here I pay $50/wk for food they bring home (they are amazing chefs and I think this ask is more than fair). I take the bus so I only pay about $50/mo, and I’m also using a gym here that costs $35/mo.
- This coming school year, the university will grant me $2,500.
- The summer after, I expect to earn approx $30-40/hr.

Currently - in my bank accounts I have $300 to my name. Yep. That’s it. This upcoming paycheck (in a few days) will be about $2000. 

What are the next steps I can take to financial success? Overall I spend my money extremely irresponsibly, but I am good at maximizing what I get out of my money (like always taking advantage of student discounts, calling to try and get better deals, taking advantage of rebates etc.). Either way, this is no excuse for how much I needlessly spend on shoes, clothes, and tech. 

How do I balance my wants with savings? And also, how do I save while being willing to spend money on things truly important to me (traveling with friends, etc.)?

I want to start investing, and I also believe I will be applying for a chase sapphire preferred credit card in just a little bit.

Thank you for reading. I’m frustrated because I’m in such a fortunate, privileged position, and I feel like I’m throwing it all away.

8yj4qz,2,2018-07-13,Sentinel Chain und POA Network vereinbaren strategische Partnerschaft,POA_Network_Deutsch,u_POA_Network_Deutsch,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_POA_Network_Deutsch/comments/8yj4qz/sentinel_chain_und_poa_network_vereinbaren/,"*13. Juli 2018; 18.00 Uhr Singapur Zeit -* Sentinel Chain und POA Network gründen eine geschäftliche und technische Partnerschaft für das gemeinsame Design und die Entwicklung der ERC20-to-ERC20 Cross Chain Bridge, die die Integration beider Ökosysteme erleichtert, um den Nutzen von SENC- und POA20-Token zu erweitern. Beide Netzwerke sind voll kompatibel mit dem Ethereum-Protokoll und unterstützen nur den Parity-Client 1.7 und höher. Dies ist eine direkte Entwicklung in der Welt der Blockchain und schließt die Lücke zwischen privaten und öffentlichen Blockchain-Implementierungen.

Zu den Geschäftsvorteilen der Partnerschaft gehört die gleichzeitige Nutzung von SENC- und POA20-Tokens in Sentinel Chain und POA Network. Dies öffnet das POA-Ökosystem außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika für den Zugang zu einem größeren Marktplatz über Sentinel Chain als Gateway. Der Nutzwert von SENC-Token wiederum steigt durch einen erhöhten Netzwerkeffekt.

**""Unsere Partnerschaft mit POA ist ein wichtiger Meilenstein für Sentinel Chain, um die Fähigkeit zu demonstrieren, die Ethereum-Gemeinschaften an unserem Ökosystem teilhaben zu lassen und die finanzielle Integration in reale Anwendungsfälle für nicht bankengebundene Märkte zu bringen"", so Roy Lai, CEO von Sentinel Chain / InfoCorp Technologies.**

Sowohl POA Network als auch Sentinel Chain setzen rechtlich durchsetzbare Hard Fork-Strategien um. Ein Blockchain Hard Fork bezieht sich auf das erzwungene Upgrade von Blockchain-Protokoll-Clients. Die Ähnlichkeit zwischen den beiden Netzwerken gewährleistet eine effiziente Behandlung von Software-Upgrades und Schwachstellenbehebungen.

Obwohl beide ein ähnliches Netzwerkdesign haben, unterscheiden sie sich darin, dass Sentinel Chain auf der Basis eines privaten Konsortiums und POA Network auf der Basis einer öffentlichen Genehmigung arbeitet. Außerdem setzen sowohl Sentinel Chain als auch POA Network auf den Einsatz von Prüfknoten mit bekannten und überprüfbaren rechtlichen Identitäten. Allerdings wird die Kollusion von Validatoren auf Sentinel Chain durch die Diversifizierung von Validatoren in verschiedenen Ländern mit einer Vielzahl von Geschäftsschwerpunkten umgesetzt, während die Kollusion von Validatoren auf dem POA-Netzwerk durch von Validatoren unterzeichnete Nicht-Affiliationsvereinbarungen durchgesetzt wird.

Das Design von Sentinel Chain beinhaltet den Einsatz von drei Blockchain-Netzwerken. Das CrossPay-Netzwerk ist ein länderspezifisches, privates Blockchain-Netzwerk, in dem sich Tiere und ungebundene Identitätsdaten befinden und das mit Local Currency Tokens (LCT) arbeitet. Sentinel Chain verwendet intern SENI (Sentinel Chain Internal Token) als natives Token, das eine 1:1-Konvertierungsrate zu SENC (Sentinel Chain ERC20 Token) im öffentlichen Netzwerk der Ethereum Foundation hat. Im öffentlichen Ethereum-Netzwerk wurden 500 Millionen (Gesamtversorgung) ERC-20 SENC-Token erstellt. Und es gibt 500 Millionen (insgesamt) SENI native Token, die innerhalb von Sentinel Chain erstellt wurden. Der Sentinel Bridge Relay-Vertrag umfasst zunächst 500 Millionen SENI. SENI wird vom Sentinel-Brückenrelais freigeschaltet, wenn SENC an das Ethereum-Brückenrelais im Ethereum-Netzwerk gesendet wird. Umgekehrt, wenn SENI an Sentinel Bridge Relay gesendet wird, wird SENC entsperrt und an die Empfängeradresse im Ethereum-Netzwerk übertragen. SENI wird bei CrossPay auf LCT (Local Currency Token) für den lokalen Markt umgestellt.

https://i.redd.it/m7p9ygyr8p911.jpg

Das POA-Netzwerk nutzt einen Home Bridge-Vertrag, der sich im POA-Netzwerk befindet, das durch seine native Krypto-Währung POA-Münze gesteuert wird, während der Foreign Bridge Contract on Ethereum POA20 (das ERC-20 POA-Token auf Ethereum) verwaltet. Der Begriff ""Kaution"" wird verwendet, um die Umwandlung der POA-Münze in den Home Bridge-Vertrag zu bezeichnen, und POA20-Münzen werden auf dem Foreign Bridge-Vertrag geprägt, um auf Ethereum an den Empfänger übertragen zu werden. Der Begriff ""Zurückziehen"" wird verwendet, um POA20 von Foreign Bridge-Vertrag zu erhalten, der zum Brennen gesendet wird, und die POA-Münze auf dem Home Bridge-Vertrag an den Empfänger im POA-Netzwerk freizuschalten.

Diese Partnerschaft ermöglicht der EVM-basierten Blockchain-Community den Zugang zu einem geschlossenen Markt, der auf einer privaten Blockchain läuft. DApp (Dezentrale Anwendung), die für die Verwendung mit POA20 geschrieben wurde, kann in Sentinel Chain eingesetzt werden und in Sentinel Chain betrieben werden. Dies bietet POA20 DApp die Möglichkeit, in einem offenen Blockketten-Netzwerk wie Ethereum oder einem geschlossenen Blockketten-Netzwerk über Sentinel Chain zu arbeiten. Beispielsweise hat Sentinel Chain derzeit damit begonnen, in Myanmar mit Hilfe seines Myanmar CrossPay-Netzwerks tiergestützte Sicherheiten zu schaffen.

https://i.redd.it/7uexcbpv8p911.jpg

""Wir freuen uns über diese Partnerschaft, da sie zeigt, wie EVM-basierte Blockketten wie POA Network Zugang zu einem ansonsten geschlossenen Markt haben können. Als wir die POA Bridge entwickelten, zeigten wir die erste serienmäßige Cross-Chain-Brücke. Jetzt gehen wir noch weiter und freuen uns darauf. ""Igor Barinov, Technischer Leiter des POA-Netzwerks.

https://i.redd.it/4tg6dcy19p911.jpg

**Über das POA-Netzwerk**

Der Zweck des POA-Netzwerks ist es, ein ""Sandbox""-Universum zu schaffen, auf das die Ethereum-Gemeinschaft zugreifen kann, ohne unter unvorhersehbaren Transaktionskosten und volatilen Bergbaugebühren (Gas) zu leiden und somit von der verbesserten Skalierbarkeit zu profitieren. POA Network ist eine offene, öffentliche, zugelassene Blockkette, die auf dem Ethereum-Protokoll basiert. Um einen Konsens über einen globalen Staat zu erreichen, verwendet es einen Proof-of-Authority-Konsens-Algorithmus. Eine Liste von Validatoren wird durch einen intelligenten Vertrag mit Governance durch Validatoren verwaltet. Validatoren im POA-Netzwerk müssen über eine gültige Notarlizenz in den Vereinigten Staaten verfügen. Eine betroffene Drittpartei kann die Identität des Prüfers anhand offener Datenquellen überprüfen und sicherstellen, dass jeder Prüfer ein guter Akteur ohne Strafregister ist.

We dated for 4 years and met while working in a coffee shop together.

He is funny, supportive, quirky, loving, and we share the exact same sense of humor. I love him so much. If you care, I'm an INFP and he's an INTP.

During this relationship, I graduated from high school, went to college, had several different jobs, two internships, and made a lot of different friends. I have anxiety, but other than that life is good.

In the meantime, he continued working at the coffee shop, maintained his 2 sort-of friends, lived with his parents, and did not get a professional job due to his social awkwardness. He is currently 27 with no professional experience. He has, however, got into a PhD program starting in the fall, and I'm really happy about that. I think that'll help him get his life together!

I would say that my main problems are that I emotionally vent to him a little too often and I'm needy. His main problems are that he doesn't always realize when he says something offensive to me and doesn't communicate well. He's also really socially awkward in front of everyone he talks to aside from me and his close friends, but I really don't mind that. I also feel like I wasn't giving him enough attention while I was at college because I struggled in juggling my homework, him, friends, and alone time. I was very busy... and he was not busy at all during this time (no job).

I've told him in the past that I wish that he could be more emotionally supportive a couple of times. I don't know if this is me being a ""relationship perfectionist"" or something, but I feel bad about those times. I always apologized right after I told him that and said that I love him the way he is, and realized that maybe I have this fairytale idea of what love should be like (which I think is true), and we forgot about it.

I always tell him when there's a problem, but he is very passive and barely ever says that he is upset about something.

Two months ago, however, he sat me down and angrily told me that I should've hung out with him more often while I've been at college, I should've been more clear about whether we should have sex or not (I didn't really think he wanted to that much until he said that), and he feels weird about those times I said I wish he'd be more emotionally supportive. He also brought up breaking up, but I called him later that day saying I feel unsure about this break-up because it came out of nowhere and he agreed. We then got back together the next day basically.

I am crazy, so I wrote him an 18,000 word document detailing how sorry I am, how I really didn't know these were problems because he didn't communicate them, explained exactly how I will improve our relationship, discussed how some past trauma has influenced my flaws and bad actions, told him that he is emotionally supportive (he actually is very affectionate, I think I'm just needy and weirdly perfectionistic... I'm realizing that) and told him how much I love him. I also brought him a milkshake at work as a romantic gesture lol. And a donut on another day.

He still said ""I feel unsure"" after these gestures.

We then took a 2 week break.

During this 2 week break, we weren't exactly supposed to text, but I ended up texting him kind of a lot because I was freaking out a little... (oops). He, however, also messed up because his friends made him a Tinder as a joke, and he just kept it up and even updated it, and I found out via my best friend that he made one and felt completely devastated.

Later he apologized, explained the Tinder thing was a joke, he updated it as a joke, and he should've known that was a stupid idea. He also reiterated that he definitely wasn't trying to date anyone. He also deleted it right away.

After the 2 week break, he said that he was still unsure about us.

I then decided to just have fun, joke around, and do our usual thing for a while and figured that might clear up this unsureness. We laughed together, cuddled, etc., but after 3 weeks of having fun, he said that he was still unsure about us.

I asked him, ""Are you unsure because of me or my flaws?""

He said, ""No.""

I asked him, ""Are you unsure because I vent to you too much/am needy?""

He said, ""Surprisingly, no"" lol

He then said, ""I just don't know what I'm doing right now. I don't just feel unsure about you. I feel unsure about everything. I also feel kind of depressed. I'm just not happy. I don't want to do this PhD program either.""

At this point he is 27 years old, still without professional experience, still with very few friends, and currently working 15 hours a day at a minimum wage job. He seems very lost and doesn't have enough time to process what's going on.

After 1.5 months of him being unsure, I texted him ""If you don't figure out how you feel soon, I might break up with you because I want someone who is sure about me. I feel like I'm disrespecting myself by staying with you.""

He took 5 days to respond to this text (very annoying) and said, ""I don't know how I feel. Maybe we should break up so I can figure it out.""

I then broke up with him, and I wanted to spend an hour talking with him during the break up. He did not like this. He wanted to only talk for 15 minutes and break up fast (which was annoying). But he ended up talking to me for an hour.

He was sobbing like I've never seen him. I reiterated that I wanted to be with him &amp; I'm just breaking up because he's unsure, and he seemed to calm down when I said that. He looked very sad. He can't seem to put how he feels into words.

I told him to let me know when he figures out how he feels about me, and he said that he would.

We've been broken up for 2 weeks now. I'm successfully doing the no contact thing. I hated breaking up, but I had to do it because we were in relationship limbo for so long, he was being very distant, and it seems like he needs time alone in order to figure this out. I've had doubts about our relationship, but when he first started saying that he was unsure/thinking about a break up, I realized I love this guy so much, and I felt dumb that I have been needy, and I really wanted to improve our relationship. The grass is not greener anywhere else. I'm worried I ruined it, but at least he said he's not unsure because of me. I think he needs to get his life in order.

I'm really hoping he comes back. We both definitely have flaws, but we're good together.

I don't even know what I'm asking for here. Do you think that I messed up the relationship? Do you think he'll give it a second chance? Do you think we just need some time apart and will later reunite? Will we be able to have a happy relationship even after all of this drama? Should I just move on and forget him?

**TL;DR** I broke up with my boyfriend because he felt unsure about us for 1.5 months. His life's a mess, and I think that's why he wanted to break up. He left saying he feels unsure about our break up, and he will let me know when he figures it out. Does it sound like getting back together would be okay? Did I completely screw up the relationship? Will he even want to get back with me?

If you are still reading this, I genuinely appreciate you so much."

She graduated, and I am a senior in college. I had to move about 15 hours away from her for an internship but we agreed that we wanted to continue dating. We had been texting and face-timing every day and everything seemed great until recently. 

After this past weekend, she seems to be very distant and uninterested in me. She is usually very open to talk to and always very involved in our conversations, but recently she has been monosyllabic with anything I say to her. When I talk to her on the phone, its the same monotone voice, she never initiates the conversation and she  is very quick to end the call. 

I asked her today if there is anything wrong with our relationship and if she is starting to losing interest in me. She said that there is nothing wrong and that she is still interested, but her actions are starting to speak louder than her words. I also asked her is there a reason why we don't talk as much anymore and she simply  just said ""I don't know"". A little bit after the phone call, I asked her what she had going on tonight. She didn't text back but I saw from a  friends Snapchat that she is is at the bars with her cousin. 

I have never mistreated her and I treat her like she is my favorite person, because she is. Even the week before any of this started happening, she told me that I always find a was to make her happy. I just dont know where to go from here. 

At the end of the day I know its just going to come down to me and her, but I just want to hear some input on what you all thinks is happening. "
8ykcxi,65,2018-07-13,[REVIEW] Guidi 988-SCFG-ANTHRACITE,Astronautswag,goodyearwelt,https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/8ykcxi/review_guidi_988scfganthracite/,"[Album](https://imgur.com/gallery/xTWtsm4?s=sms)

**The Initial Purchase** 

Since I was 16 or so, I've always been fascinated by Guidi boots. The rippling and flowing of the leather, especially on the back zip models, was something that I had not seen before. 5 years later, I finally began to leave school and enter the professional world, making actual money. Using some of the signing bonus I got for my summer internship, I decided to treat myself to something. For the next month, I stalked Grailed, The Arca, and countless other p2p shopping platforms for either 988 or a pair of 998s. Eventually, I came across a seller who had a deadstock pair for 800 USD, including shipping. After a night at the pub, I said screw it and pulled the trigger. A week later, my precious babies arrived. 

**Sizing** 
Usually, the first thing that gets brought up when talking about Guidi is their inconsistent sizing. They aren't wrong but I think a lot of that debate comes from people buying pre-owned pairs that have already taken the shape of someone else's feet. As a few reference points for my own sizing, I'm a 44 in MMM GATs, a 43 in RO mainline footwear and a 43 in A. Testoni dress shoes. For me, I purchased a pair in a size 44 that ended up fitting perfectly. However, I do think that these are a pair of shoes you need to try on in-person or purchase with a return policy. For models such as 7xx or hiking boots, I find that my size fluctuates +/-2, so your sizing experience will vary depending on the model. 

**The Shoes**

They arrive in a plain cardboard box with handwritten sizing and model numbers, which helps cement their artisanal aesthetic. Mine also came with a large white tote-bag, but this may have been because the seller purchased them at the flagship store. The boots are composed of soft calf full-grained leather (SCFG) and came in the Anthracite/Dark Grey colorway. However, I think they're just black. The leather itself is unlike any shoe that I've ever felt, somehow managing to be both substantial and powerful feeling while being incredibly flexible and soft. The soles are of course Goodyear-Welted. In the heel of the insole, there are 6 nails with a small leather patch sewn in the center of them.  With the exception of this and the pull tabs, there is 0 branding on the boots. I found the width of the boots to be quite restrictive for my first few wears, but after a week or two, they stretched to the size of my foot perfectly. An important thing to note with non-slim shaft Guidis and especially those in leathers that are more stretchy than others: if you wear thick socks or enjoy tucking your pants into your boots for those sick creases, eventually the shaft will get stretched out and force you to wear your pants over them instead. A professional can treat them and have them tightened up, but it is something to keep in mind when purchasing. One last point of consideration: if they are a deadstock pair that has been sitting in a box for a while, they will have a crease/discoloration that runs across the upper where Guidi folds the shaft to fit them into a box. It is somewhat noticeable in my photos but it can be easily polished out. 

**To Wrap it All Up**
I am head over heels for these boots. Within owning them for around a month now, they have formed ripples that perfectly match the contour of my feet. What once was a high-school grail is finally a reality and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Not to sound too sophomoric, but I think I now understand why the people in this sub are so passionate about GYW boots. Until I purchased these boots, I have never had to stop myself from getting distracted and staring at them while I work or read a book. I had a 5mm Michelin heel protector cobbled onto the shoe and after a few months of wear, I'll toss on full sole protectors. 


*This is my first review so let me know how I did!*"
8ykea1,55,2018-07-13,Vainglory: Requests to SEMC for Update 3.6 Current Positives and Constructive Feedback for the Current State of the Game,kmill1982,vainglorygame,https://www.reddit.com/r/vainglorygame/comments/8ykea1/vainglory_requests_to_semc_for_update_36_current/,"Dear SEMC,

I first want to thank you for making my current fav, and only game I currently play. From my own personal perspective I tend to hyper focus on one game which has pro’s and cons. I am sure many can relate, and many cannot with the popularity of Fortnite, PUBG and other games. As someone coming from Clash of Clans, a notorious grind/paywall/pay to win approach, I was refreshed that in the early days, Vainglory had ZERO pay to win features. Now with brawl modes, this is less than true but I do not condemn making money off of these modes, which are an addition, not a staple to the game itself.

My current favourite changes are:

The addition of 5v5:  
\-Everyone wins here, even non fans. New players come to the game, and the game modes you know and love stay. This is an additional game mode, and nothing was removed.  
\-Unfortunately 3v3 suffers dramatically as it gets, at least from the outside looking in, very little to no love. The addition of scout cams is cool, but makes flicker, CP Taka and CP Kestrel much harder to play.

Solution: Balance the camera’s or make super scout cams the new contraption and balanced for 3v3-PLEASE REVISIT DRAFT FOR 3v3!!! It’s been. Long time. What would it take? A copy paste of 8 lines of code to have DOUBLE BAN like 5v5? Could we have a draft system similar to 3v3 in the old competitive scene (again another copy paste of code from the tournament server)? Please consider allowing this feature either across the board, for for Tiers 7 or 8+

I encourage the work being done on 5v5 from my own bias that it is my new favourite game mode. In an attempt to speak on behalf of the entire community, It is important to understand that many still prefer 3v3. Please show the 3v3 people some love and allow for creative drafting instead of this broken mess of heroes balanced for 5v5 getting through draft in 3v3 and causing frustration which in turn causes complaints for your team. If you can’t balance it because energy is being focused elsewhere, lets us have the creative control to ban or counter pick more comfortably.

I will get condemend for this one by half the community, buttt….. the OVER PRICED EMOTES are a GOOD CHANGE/Addition:  
\-These are purely cosmetic. They are not mandatory. They do not help game play. In a world of instant gratification, pay up or grind it out. I realize grinding will take forever. To bad. There are taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and other unnecessary items in life. If you want to these items, pay the inherited “stupid/lazy” convenience tax and move on. Other wise, stop complaining spend ice on other features.

Solution: Customer recognizes how ridiculous complaining about emotes is and pays up or grinds it out.

The addition of weekly and other “events”:-While some of these come off as “cheesy” or in the words of many “boring” or “not very good,” They are far better than not having any. Similar to BATTLE PASS (one of the top additions in a very long time) having a challenge that is specific to those that purchased the new hero early is much like giving an optional “subscription” nearly monthly (most patches now have a hero in recent history). This guarantees modest monthly income that is OPTIONAL.

I now everyone wants to be able to get everything for free but you simply can’t. It is important to understand when you re getting flat out ripped off, and when you are making a cognitive decision to rip yourself off in the face of instant gratification.

Solution: Customer buys hero and does modest challenges that were not available before. Consider it a bonus. Customer Waites one week and uses glory for hero. A week or two is easily enough to gain enough glory for a new hero for many people. A month is more than enough for a casual player.

\*I have always liked that hero’s were roughly 8 dollars a month give or take, depending on location. Skins are much more for the nicer ones, but unnecessary to pursue game play, as noted by Druid and his famous no skin Vox in competitive play.

Guild Incentives: I don’t think this should ever have been a priority much to the dislike of what many prominent community members think. Good Guilds are built by good people with good intentions. In game rewards are not enough to hold people together who become frustrated with human interaction. I am thankful you gave them some love. It was much needed, but guilds need to realize it is on them to make places they want to call home in Vainglory.

Best Quote (paraphrased, not exact) about guilds IMO: Bleeko from TIME for Rolling: Guilds are a place to come and find people to rank with or play with so you don’t have to deal with the frustration of solo.

Things needing addressing:

Competitive Play: RIP, 2018 (Insert Kappa Emoji Here)-Heart breaking from a fan or a players perspective. These people unfortunate make up 1&amp;#37; of the population, fans included. It is easy to see why it isn’t being focused, but it sucks butt cheeks. Please try and communicate at minimum.

Solution: Be transparent or you end up with a bunch of high school kids who make up most of your competitive scene just being obscene about your level of service in discord servers far and wide. I’d rather hear it from FooJee (oh wait, nvm) or @vaingloryesports in a professional and reasonable well rather than a bunch of slander including words I cannot say here about how trash the devs are from a kid who skipped his grade nine math homework to rant in a server and change the sexual disposition of a dev and tell everyone how and where they put what during “adult bedroom time.”

I realize you are signing with third parties. Just communicate that 4 months ago. Jezuz Qrist.

In Game Currency systems:

\-Broken. Busted. Too many. Trashola-crapola. Too much of 1-2 resources, never enough of another.

\-I DO agree with making it so that there is a pay element to take advantage of the previously mentioned world of instant gratification we live in. The 5&amp;#37; boxes etc. You just keep it up, Vainglory. Look atchu go. I DO agree grinding skins shouldn’t be easy, especially for legendaries. I am nostalgic and I miss the old card system. It probably isn’t coming back.

\-Perhaps allow purchase of gold, silver and bronze chest keys for opals or essence or glory

Solution: Can we not make a way to GRIND blue prints so that we can get specific ones for our own hero pool?-Can we not have EITHER CURRENCIES COMBINED or a CURRECY EXCHANGE System?

Example: 6-1 or 8-1 essence to glory or glory to essence (or opals). Make it a ton. Rip us off a little even. It was free currency  to begin with in many cases (or at least CAN BE FREE in game. Just give us something. I’m sitting on 140k essence  which I realize is my fault for buying skins, but god dammit, make glory great again.

Not expecting any answer or feedback on the next part, as for professional reasons, SEMC staff probably won’t even touch this next section:

The current state of staff rumours is hard to watch for many reasons. Maybe you guys hired friends of friends too often in the early days and the pot of gold at the rainbow never came and now you re burning bridges out of desperation. Maybe people got complacent and comfortable and are underperforming. I could just be making up shit as I speak with no knowledge…… WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE IS DOING BECAUSE THERE IS ZERO COMMUNICATION. This is in no way to insinuate the employee’s are not capable. We just have no bloody idea and we just assume SEMC is incompetent because we hear one half of the story, or buy into tweets based on opinion. I realize you do not want to start a he said she said debate on twitter as it is a PR nightmare.

One of the best things about vainglory was the family feel of dev streams and the spilling out of the camaraderie of staff into discord servers, twitter and on twitch. It really was about the community as PlayoffBear always used to say. Now times change. This happens in every business. Places grow. New people are needed. Things become more mechanical and less personable. JUST DON”T FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM or WHY YOU STARTED.

To summarize:

\-Add double Ban for 3v3 and consider balance of vision items

\-Abolish essence and opals or provide a cohesive conversion system for essence and opals, or allow us to spend them on keys for those new chests from spoils of war. (The Ice prices for those chests were ridiculous and the drop rate for keys is less than inspiring)

\-Communicate professionally and timely instead of allowing angry players and fans to do it for you, first-Keep selling aesthetic things to make money.-Focus on 5v5 if that is whats attracting the most new players, but use small easy changes to give the other game modes some love.

I want to thank SEMC for the good times The early days were amazing and as with anything that grows and changes, whether it be your fav local band getting famous, or Cozz the God being to busy to answer all his old guild mates messages, these things happen. Just remember where you came from and why. Grow. I encourage you too. Balance the quality of life features with a firm mix of still maintaining a business. Grab the money from talents. Grab the money from emotes. Reward players that spend with small bonuses. Reward players that grind with small bonuses too.

I think its important to remember a lot of the OG players felt like their input was heard in the early days far more than now. By grinding that luxury, you also shot yourselves in the foot for current times, but thank you for doing so. I know it is damn near impossible to make everyone happy in a generation where we want everything now, this instant, never broken and perfect. (Anyone remember game cartridges? No updates period? You just and to wait for the second version of that game to come out to keep going?)

Anyhow, please keep up all the things you do well which are often swept over and forgotten in the wake of the negative things. You have some work to do and some poop to clean up, but you do deserve some props for many peoples fav mobile game of all time. People can argue other mob’s are better, and thats OK. (They aren’t, at least not for mobile). You have made an amazing game with a great engine and an originally amazing staff team with such a positive, forward thinking culture that spilled out into the community, which intern made everyone and their dog want to work for you. Do not lose that feel. Do fix the busted things.

Thank You and Happy Turret Diving,

\-kmill1982

TL;DR, Summarize:

To summarize:-Add double Ban for 3v3 and consider balance of vision items-Abolish essence and opals or provide a cohesive conversion system for essence and opals, or allow us to spend them on keys for those new chests from spoils of war. (The Ice prices for those chests were ridiculous and the drop rate for keys is less than inspiring)-Communicate professionally and timely instead of allowing angry players and fans to do it for you, first-Keep selling aesthetic things to make money.-Focus on 5v5 if that is whats attracting the most new players, but use small easy changes to give the other game modes some love."

upon starting at a cc in 2012 i couldn’t get fafsa because of my parents, so the first two years I had to get a private loan with salliemae ( Neither my parents or i had anything saved up for college, but i was forced to go)
from 2013 till last semester i’ve had a few setbacks, from the death of my brother to me becoming sick and falling into depression. Because of this I had a few semesters of me failing classes until i decided to take some time off from school. I had one semester break back in 2014 and another this past spring semester. My first loan that  I took out is now nearing repayment in june of next year and its total is 24000. I work at apple and i’m still in school, and I’m freaking out as to how I’m going to pay this as I have used up my deferment.
I wont get my bachelor’s degree until fall 2019 at least so making a 300/mo payment is a lot for me. I feel like a failure and I feel as if I shouldnt’ have started college until I saved up enough money or got some counseling about loans and financial aid.

8ykqgi,0,2018-07-13,I [20M] am in a different city for the summer and have begun a relationship with my partner [21 Nonbinary]. Is long distance the right choice?,Kevin_spaceys_mom,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykqgi/i_20m_am_in_a_different_city_for_the_summer_and/,"I’m currently working an internship in a city 8 hours from where I live and go to school. While here I met my partner. The relationship is going very well, and is by far the healthiest, most mature relationship I have ever had. I’m obviously still in the early stages of the relationship, but I leave in less than a month. We have talked about what happens when I leave, and so far the consensus has been “we don’t want to make a final decision right now, we’ll see where we are at the end and decide then.”

Things have been going very well, and I think that I want to try to do long distance, however I haven’t ever been in a long distance relationship before. Additionally, physical intimacy is a big part of our relationship and that would obviously disappear when I leave. I feel like this is the best relationship I have ever had and want nothing more than to continue it, but I understand that I am still in the “honeymoon phase” and don’t want to make rash decisions based on passion. 

All of this would be more manageable if I thought that we were definitely going to be in the same city after we graduate next year but that’s not the case. I live on the east coast and they live on the west coast, so after we graduate we will actually be further from each other. Additionally a 3 hour time difference would probably have a big impact as well. I am hoping to attend a PhD program, so I won’t know where in the country I will be until February of this year. 

That being said, I am so happy in this relationship and feel that my partner is truly adding something to my life, and me to theirs. I could see myself being with them for a long time, and I don’t want to pass up on an incredible relationship because I’m scared of us getting hurt. My apprehensions are entirely on the situation, not at all on the quality of the relationship.

Is long distance a good idea/sustainable? If so, how can I make sure we maintain a level of intimacy without being physically together for a year?

Tl;dr fell for someone while in a different city, long distance would mean being apart for at least a year, maybe longer. I’m fine with that, but I have never done it before."

I graduated May, 2017 and started paying then. They actually entered repayment in Nov, 2017. I am currently on in income driven repayment plan based on my income (29.5K before taxes) for the internship I did from June 2017 - June 2018. In October, I have to resubmit income information (95K before taxes) and I will no longer qualify for IDR. The interest accrued since Oct 2017 will capitalize at that point as well. I currently have a monthly payment of $95 distributed across the four loans, but have been paying more than that. I plan to apply for the 30 year fixed and then pay faster than that throwing the minimum payment at the lower interest rate loans and extra payments at the highest interest rate. The loans are:

* $32K + 1K interest @ 5.16&amp;#37;
* $4K + 0 interest @ 5.96&amp;#37;
* $33K + 1K interest @ 5.59&amp;#37;
* $32K + 1K interest @ 5.06&amp;#37;

**My question:** should I pay off all the interest on every loan before it is added to the principal in October? Or should I just continue to pay the highest interest rate loan aggressively.

With my current budget, I plan to have the 5.96&amp;#37; loan done in August and then switch to working on the 5.59&amp;#37; loan. Any other suggestions are welcome as well."

I jumped, my hands hastily returning to my chair as I wheeled around. It was Trica Porter, the new intern for my boss. She held a bundle of folders in her arms, and stared at me with a bemused look.

""Twisted balls, you wouldn't understand,"" I said, flashing a photogenic smile.

She rolled her eyes, ""Right."" She walked on shaking her head slowly. She was clearly into me, but I didn't have time for socializing as I dug into my pants once more, watching the coast as I pulled out the USB tracker.

""Let's see what you have more me,"" I muttered as I plugged the tracker in, drumming my fingers as the program slowly booted up. And then the location tracker popped up, but there was no movement at all, the tracker stayed in my room the entire time. Would I have to swallow the damn thing to find out what the hell was going on?

Suddenly the phone rang, it's punctuality making me jump in my chair once again. I muttered a curse under my breath and stared at the phone, the slow ring tone suddenly seeming very ominous. I picked it up.

""Hello?"" I said weakly, surprised by the sudden fear that was punctuating my voice yet unable to help it.

There was a silence, not even breathing, and then a deep, computer-scrambled voice spoke. ""We know you know, say nothing and immediately walk to the address that has just been texted to you.""

I opened my mouth to say something, to sound tough, but a sudden wave of nausea hit me like a train, and I stuttered. And then the voice spoke again, interrupting my attempts to establish control of the situation, something I was accustomed to having.

""Failure to comply will result in the removal of all 32,451 dollars from your primary savings account."" The line went dead.

My stomach dropped, I had just made a 400 dollar deposit, bringing my total up to that exact amount. I took out my phone and saw the text from a number which had only five zeros enclosed in parentheses. Had I pissed off the government in some way? Or some covert spy society that now wanted me to be there errand boy? I leaned over and thought hard for a moment, and then stood up, grabbing my work bag, hung in it's usual place by my unconscious self, beelining toward the elevators to the lobby. Trica caught my eye, her face now one of subtle confusion. I looked away and continued on to the elevators. As the doors closed I took out my phone, looking hard at the address. It was in New York alright, and I was going to find out who the hell was fucking with me."

So on the phone the guy makes me aware that this is a unpaid internship but that he wants me to receive college credit for this.  He mentions that he's well known in the SEO industry &amp; that his company worked with dell, samsung &amp; IBM (red flag 1) &amp; that compared to other applicants i seem to be very straight forward &amp; mature about the internship which obviously made me feel good but it came off as bit ego push for me? (red flag 2)

Now he also mentions that if I manage to work out well for their company that I can accompany them  to their events in Vancouver &amp; LA all expenses paid.  Now i'm thinking ""why in the world would you pay for everything jsut for a unpaid intern to accompany you?"" it comes off as a too-good-to-be-true moment imo. (red flag 3)

Now i'm meeting up with the guy in a couple of days to discuss further what this internship entails, but one thing that really made me suspicious is that it's a virtual internship.  I don't know what exactly a virtual internship is or if i'd even heard about it beforehand but thats 4 red flags imo &amp; i'm not sure if i should do this.  For one is that i've never heard of the company at all which is called Network Media Group, which sounds so contrived i don't know what to make of it.  

Honestly should I be following my gut feeling or am i overthinking it? "

I failed for a few reasons:
1. I spent hours prepping to come home from work Monday afternoon to all of the food gone. My family ate most of it, and I had packed only one lunch.
2. I haven't enjoyed the meals this week because they're all sort of thrown together. Definitely could have planned better
3. I started my new internship last week and it's been creating a lot of stress for me
4. I had a particularly stressful day yesterday. The weather was terrible and I don't have a gym membership, so I didn't go for a run or walk which is what I usually do to unwind 

I'm starting over this morning but feel a lot of guilt and embarrassment, even though I haven't told anyone in my family. Any advice on how to stay on track/let go of the first trial?"

I am a software development intern at a company a few miles away from my house. I am in a stable home, with little to no monthly expenses. Overall, I would say my life is pretty good, but admittedly, I could be doing much more to benefit my future. I have been browsing this sub for the past few days, and have been inspired to become more financially organized.

**Here are some stats about me:**

*Work schedule:* 8-5 Mon-Fri w/ 1hr lunch break. Normally doing 40 hrs/week, but sometimes 32-35. $10.50/hr

I also do all of the yard work for my Dad's farm. $50/week.

*Expenses:*

\- Transportation: Thankfully, my parents pay for my insurance, but I do pay for gas.

I make 2 full trips to work every day (I go home on my lunch break), which totals to about 20 miles/day.

\- ""Fun things"": I do not have any friends in my hometown; I have a girlfriend who lives \~30 miles away, and I visit her 1-2 times per week. In terms of food, I rarely go out to eat (maybe once every few months).

I do not have phone service. I have an internet connection at work and at my house, so theres little to no reason for me to buy it.

Lately, I have been upgrading a lot of things for my setup (I game on PC), which are nice to have, but I definitely do not need. My mindset has been ""Eh, I'm making quite a bit of money, and I'm still in high school, so who cares?"". I want to change this mindset, as I think it may be unhealthy.

In terms of what I plan on doing after high school. I plan on studying Computer Engineering or Computer Science at a university. I do not plan on working during college, so hopefully I can do something now to prevent that.  I will not be receiving much financial aid, and my parents will not be paying for my student loans.

What I have right now in terms of organization, is I have been saving 75&amp;#37; of my paycheck, and doing whatever with the rest. I'm making this post to hopefully receive suggestions on what I should be doing. Should I invest my money? Should I start a separate bank account for college savings? I'm new and clueless on this stuff."
8yntq9,7,2018-07-13,Feeling lost and afraid about a career change,livefree62,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/8yntq9/feeling_lost_and_afraid_about_a_career_change/,"I [24F] have been working at a construction company as an engineer for four years now. I started low as an intern and eventually moved my way up to a senior position. I know it sounds a little crazy, but I did it. However I’m finding it hard to be equally compensated as my male peers are compensated. 

Recently, I got a promotion. I know for a fact that the man in my position before me was making 150 K a year and was doing a horrible job because I fixed a lot of the mistakes that he made which drastically affected the company. I’ve been in this position for two months now and when I finally approached my boss about my salary adjustments, he said he would be giving me my raise with everyone’s annual raise. After receiving this raise, I realize that it wasn’t much more than I was making. This brought me at 90 K which means my boss wants me to do the job for 60 K less than the guy before me even though I have an engineering degree and he didn’t have a college degree at all.

When I approach my boss about this, he just said that we will talk about it but is now avoiding me at every turn and not even saying hello to me when he sees me in the morning.

This has not been the first time that I’ve had to fight for an equal salary in this company. I am very frustrated and I am finding that loyalty doesn’t mean much. 

This ordeal, being ignored, being underpaid, has made me want to switch careers. I know you will say that going from 90 K to 150 K is unheard of in industries but my responsibilities have multiplied by 12 and this is technically not a raise but his salary adjustment for a much bigger position than I previously had.

I have applied to multiple jobs in various industries because I want to be in a more inclusive environment where it’s not a boys club and women can be treated fairly and paid equally. I have a lot of anxiety about this, and was wondering if anybody can offer any advice.

Has anyone made a drastic change in their career? Do you have any advice? Or words of encouragement?"

Yes, this precedes Westworld, which as it happens I somehow haven't gotten around to watching yet. I don't know exactly why, but artificiality is a huge turn-on for me. [My DPP profile](https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/6azk9p/m4f_android_fantasy/) has more explanation, and some previous prompts.

This prompt just occurred to me. I'm keeping the writeup short this time, though I might flesh it out (so to speak) more later on.

Note: I'm only seeking RL-female partners.

---

You're a cute geeky girl with a passion for robotics. You spend most of your time outside the classroom working in labs and garages, putting together robots for competitions. You're on a college team, you intern with a bunch of grad students on theirs, and you volunteer time to help with a high school team.

You're adorably dorky, with your hair pulled into a boring, simple ponytail, a pair of glasses on the bridge of your nose, and sparkling, intelligent eyes. You alternate between a blank, thoughtful expression and a big beaming smile. You have a skinny frame (""I always forget to eat, haha""), with small breasts and a cute perky butt. Plenty of guys are clearly into you, but you're always too busy. In fact, you're still a virgin. That's not so embarrassing to you, though, both because you think everyone should feel free to have sex or not have sex without social pressure, and because, in fairness, you were only assembled and activated a couple months ago, when you ""transferred"" to this university.

That, of course, is your secret: you are yourself someone's robotics project. That team of grad students you ""intern"" with? They put you together and programmed you themselves. Sometimes, you go to ""meetings"" which are really servicing sessions, where you strip down, and they run diagnostics, and open you up to tune your systems, and adjust your programming.

Mmm. It always feels so good. So embarrassing that your cheeks flush bright pink, but ... it also feels so good, for some reason. You don't know why. Maybe it's because the only times your sexual hardware has been activated has been during lab tests, with your internal wiring and circuitry exposed, cables running into your systems recording your feelings as you squirm and moan and beg for more in all the naughty ways they programmed into you.

It all turns you on, all the attention, from Tom struggling to conceal his arousal, to Lisa's caring manner as she strokes your hair and asks if you're okay, to Rebecca's cold scowl as she rolls her eyes and mutters ""guys, come on, she's a robot,"" then just reaches inside your panel and controls you like a machine, which you are, making you do whatever tests she has, then switching you off without another word. Sometimes you think about Tom fucking you like that. Maybe he'd fuck you if you convinced him it wasn't weird, because you weren't real. Who cares if he has a girlfriend?

*She won't be jealous, Tom. It's not like you're banging one of the real girls on the undergrad robot team. I'm basically a fleshlight. Hearing me say that is getting you hard, huh?*

You run some self-diagnostics, too. On your own. You have a single, because the admin cleared it for ""research"" purposes. You tell everyone it's because you have a diagnosed sleep issue and need an isolated sleeping space. It's really so that a roomie doesn't notice the power cable running up under your sheets.

And sometimes, lying on top of those sheets, you spread your legs, and reach beneath your panties, and start testing that hardware you've yet to *really* use so far. And you open up the concealed panel above it, revealing all those tension motors, working with quiet little whirs, making that pink silicone sheath grip at your fingers. You see the wiring that leads to the sensor nub in your clit. You see the circuitry that dampens your sensory input to avoid overload, and you reach a hand down there, and loosen one of those wires, and ...

---

I'd better stop myself there for now. But if you're intrigued, message me! Lots of options. Maybe she meets a cute boybot. Maybe she gets fucked by Tom. Maybe she breaks down and gets discovered and reprogrammed by a guy on her team. I'm open to lots of options, and, of course, to lots of other kinks."
8yokq7,214,2018-07-13,Mr.Kevin the Medic,JaschaE,StoriesAboutKevin,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/8yokq7/mrkevin_the_medic/,"Just to make things clear: I hopped careers a bit, in case you have seen my photographer-story.  
Also, becoming a ""Rettungssanitäter"" takes just three months in germany, but i don't know if there is a english version of that kind of degree.  


We where in a Medic school, everyone was refered to with their last name, and I don't think anyone bothered to learn the guys first name, so let's call him Mr. Kevin, shall we?  


We all hated his guts.  
That isn't unusual for kevins I guess, but the guy wasn't all that stupid, just obnoxious.  
He'd constantly interrupt our teachers to start discussions about topics that where not interesting to anyone else.  
The one I remember most was trying to get our teacher tell us his preference for stretchers...as there are about two manufacturers used in germany.  
Not only was this... not exactly relevant to the topic, but where we where going to work was going to determine what equipment we got, not Mr. Kevins preference.  


On one occasion, as part of our preparation for the exam, he was asked to demonstrate how to stick a hypodermic needle into a patient (the kind that stays in and is connected to a big of saltwater...)  
Luckily, we had a dummy arm for that kind of thing so Mr. Kevin starts and at the same time he starts explaining what he does.  
Our teacher: ""Mr. Kevin, can I give you a piece of advice?""  
""Yeah, sure.""  
""Shut up.""  
This led to standing ovations from everyone around, just to give you an idea of how much everyone hated him.  
Our, very emberassed, teacher explained that, in order to pass the exam, we should all shut up instead of explaining, as explanaitions might lead to further questioning.  


Now that we have set the stage, let's recount Mr.Kevins crowning achievement: Getting a way to immobilise a patient named after him.  


Him and his unlucky training partner had to do a training exercice.  
One guy played the unconcious person on the floor, while Mr.Kevin and his Partner had to, well, keep him alive and get him ready to be transported to a hospital, that's basicly the job discripton.  


So, they check pulse, breathing, blood pressure...patient is fine, apart from unconcious.  
Very good, they just racked up a tally of owing 3-4 cases of beer, as you owe the group a case of beer whenever you step over a patient.  


They get the patient in the recovery position and onto the stretcher, racking up about 10-12 cases of beer.  


Now please take a moment to visualize our patient, lying on the narrow stretcher, on his side, in the recovery position, held securely in place by three broad straps.  
This should have been the end of that particular scenario.  


Mr. Kevin looks at the whole thing, and you can actually see the gears turning in his head:  
""Make it comfortable for the patient."" was a thing we where told.  
So he goes and puts up the head-rest into a ""sitting"" position.  
With a unconcious person, lying on their side.  
This would be the opposite of ""good""  


He looks at the thing again ""Unconcious person..."" he thinks ""... legs up!""   
So he goes and lifts the leg-section of the stretcher.  


Now he looks at the patient, still pretending to be unconcious, still on his side, with a nearly 90° bend in his waist.  
Seemingly happy with his work, he tourns around to our teacher and happily claims ""We're done!""  


Our teacher, a former army-medic-instructor, veteran of many years civil emergency service, and also a mountain of a man, very calmly asks   
""Mr. Kevin, please look at what you did, is there anything out of the ordinary?""  
If any examiner ever asks you in this manner if there is something wrong, there is something VERY wrong.  


Totally oblivious Mr. Kevin looks at the back-breaking position he created for our collegue, who is still palying unconcious and says ""No, everythings fine.""

Needless to say, he got screamed at, a lot... at first commands to untie his victim, before ""any lasting damage"" could occur, but sometime in there, the position was coined something along the lines of ""Mr. Kevins longbow-Special"".  


Last I heard of him, he didn't pass his internship because he tried to lecture a emergency-doctor on what to do.

8yovq0,1,2018-07-13,I just need some help,hungryboy1234,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8yovq0/i_just_need_some_help/,"This is actually the first time I've gone through this, so everything is extra painful.

I was dating my gf for 8 months. She actually hit on me, and I had never been in a real relationship before. We didn't have a label at first since we both knew it had to end at some point because I would be heading to grad school the next year and she'd still be in college for 2 more years. She had done long distance before and vowed to never do it again (more on that later). Eventually we were fine with calling ourselves boyfriend and girlfriend even though we knew there was an expiration date. When we were on, we were ON. Amazing sex, laughter, hours upon hours of calls, texting all day, spending days with each other. Sex became more then just physical, it was an emotional connection. I did new things and went to events I'd never seen myself going to before. It was amazing. When we were not on, it was bad. She recognized she was emotionally abusive, hypocritical and had a bunch of other problems and insecurities, but she didn't fix them. I'm no gem either, but she recognized she was much worse and didn't understand how I put up with it. I did because I genuinely wanted to be with her.

She dumped me in mid-May. She said she wanted to focus on moving on from me, spend time with friends, focus on her new internship etc, but she wanted to be friends because I became her best friend and rock through an incredibly stressful time in her life. I was heartbroken. I was in bed all day, miserable, and it was finals week! I even browsed this sub for help (thanks for the advice even if it wasn't directed at me). What ultimately helped was focusing on all the bad things she did to me to get over her, and it mostly worked.

Fast forward to the middle of June, she texts me. We were texting the whole time we were broken up. I know, NC, but I never had been in a relationship like this so I didn't really know what I was doing. She says she recognized how bad she was, how she didn't appreciate me, and wanted to be with me for the remainder of my time before I left. I thought a lot, but I eventually said yes because I just wanted to be happy.

That time together was amazing. She had actually changed. It was magical. I couldn't stop spending time with her. She told me she was falling in love with me again.

During our second period of time together she floated the idea of a long distance relationship, but we both agreed that it wouldn't work. Eventually the day came where I had to leave and I was a wreck. She was too. Our last day was perfect and when I was gone (on a family vacation) I realized that I was in love with her. This wasn't just me missing her. I was actually in love. I thought up a whole plan of doing long distance with intricate details and poured my heart out to her. She was hesitant, but said yes. A day later, she said no. She couldn't do long distance again, especially one that would take years because she said she needs someone actually physically there for her. She was miserable with her last one. I tried to make the case, but she wouldn't have it. I tried everything, but she just couldn't do it. She still wanted to be friends and tried to get me to move on, but it was hard. She had done breaking up before so it was easier for her. I've never done it so I was floundering. There was nothing I could do. It felt like she didn't love me anymore or was trying to be callous to protect herself from pain. I was helpless and no option was a win. Either I'm with her and she's unhappy, or I lose her. I still wanted to try it, but after fighting for it for a full on week, I eventually decided to give in. She didn't want to have the relationship because she felt it would make her unhappy. I know the reality of the situation is that I'll never be with her again because we probably won't be in the same physical area anymore. Now I know this weekend she's going out with friends so she can ""rip the bandaid off"" and move on and I'm just devastated. I can't handle her with other people, sharing moments I wanted to have with her. My imagination got really really vivid and it just fucked with me and messed up entire days for me. I became really irritable, insecure, and even had moments of stomach turning anxiety. This was all foreign to me. I just need help. I don't even know what to be mad at. The situation? The universe? It's just brutal."
8yoypp,1,2018-07-13,"My Ex (21,F) Ghosted Me (21,M) After Two Years",JonahRaeH,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8yoypp/my_ex_21f_ghosted_me_21m_after_two_years/,"I’m really hoping that by posting this I can let go of some pent up feelings and be able to move passed this whole situation because it’s emotionally draining. 

I’m a 21 year old guy, and this is how about two years ago I befriended Sarah (F, 22). We quickly became attached by the fact that we had a lot in common and we simply got one another. We were two introverts who had were comfortable with each other (and for you fellow introverts, you know how valuable that is). 

After a year our conversations became gradually flirtatious in nature until we decided to make it official and become a couple. Things went well. I, at least, was falling for her more and more. However, one day she told me that she was scared to lose me if this somehow didn’t work out. She said she valued my presence in her life so much more and figured it would be safer if we were friends. I didn’t argue because I honestly didn’t want to lose her either.

So we broke it off and remained friends and I genuinely was okay with it. (I know by this point people might assume that I was secretly angry or distraught by it but I promise I wasn’t. I didn’t want to lose her because she was my best friend and ultimately, if we didn’t get together, I would have wanted her to stay in my life for good.) 

Yet, as one could expect, there was something amiss about it all; a shift in tone occurred between us and it became awkward, though I desperately tried to keep it from furthering. I tried to bring back that best friend spark so much. I had even pitched the idea of writing handwritten letters to one another to make it like “our thing”, you know? 

In total, I wrote her 5 letters, I only ever got 1 in return. 

This all happened in May when I had just quit my job which I’d been in for a year and was beginning an internship with my church for our youth group. I was in a transitional period. By this point, our conversations were days apart. In terms of texting, I would text her a long paragraph, only to wait a week to a halfhearted response.  

One day, I just got tired and didn’t feel like replying for a few days. I figured that if it wasn’t a big deal to her to reply, why should it be a big deal for me? 

After a week of not replying (mind you, her longest time responding to me was 2 weeks), l felt so shitty so I sent a long apology to her, hoping that she would respond. 

She never did. 

Now here we are in mid-July and nothing has changed. No response, nothing. 

Normally I would have just accepted it at that but the thing that bothers me is: she still frequently checks my insta-stories, she’s still actively posting without having blocked/unfollowed me. She still posts and I can’t escape the feeling that she knows I’m seeing them too. 

Last week was her birthday, and so after talking it with a friend, I decided to try one more time and send her a message. 

“Happy Birthday, Sarah! I hope you have a wonderful day today! 🎈”

A reply never came and she still updates everything else like nothing’s bothered her. 

And yes, I have thought about “what if her number is different? or she hasn’t been receiving your messages? etc etc - to that I ask: wouldn’t she have reached out if I hadn’t messaged her in a while?  Like hey are you still alive? Kind of thing. But no, she’s just unresponsive. 

I don’t know if she’s doing some passive-aggressive silent treatment kind of business or what but I just don’t understand why she didn’t just block me or unfollow me - does she not care that much? What changed? Did I do something super wrong that I was unaware of? 

I can’t lie, every time she posts a picture or selfie, my heart aches - my best friend isn’t my best friend anymore. 


If nothing else, if you’ve gone though something similar or simply have had someone close walk out on you - how did you cope? do you have any advice to a healing heart? should I reach out one last time to say goodbyes? 

Your insight would be greatly appreciated and if you made it to the end of this post - thank you for listening 💌

TL;DR - I was ghosted (?) by my ex after knowing each other for two years but she still looks at my Insta stories/Snapchat stories and vice versa. "

I've already gotten 2 positions with a lot of interest in me but the classes I need to take aren't easy to work with. They aren't early, they aren't late. They're right smack dab in the middle of the day. I was already worried about this coming semester because I'll be doing my first 3 major specific classes plus another class with math. I've never worked while in college and wanted to know how it was for others. I don't want my gpa dropping and I don't want to not learn anything at an internship.

Another side note is that this is the first semester I'll be without my mom. She had to move for work so now I have to do everything myself. Not complaining, it's just something I haven't had to consider before. I never had to make time for laundry or cooking and cleaning and all that. I know most people have had to adult for awhile so they're used to it. I'm not quite there yet.

Five years ago, my brother (25 currently) and I (26) both dropped out of college. We were both washouts living in our parents’ attic with few future aspirations; it wasn’t an enjoyable time or experience for anyone involved. In that time, the relationship that we had became extremely toxic. I don’t know what about him changed between me going off to college and me dropping out, but I saw all of his worst attributes enhanced and his best ones all but extinguished. He and I used to butt heads on occasion (as siblings generally do), but those occurrences began to happen *far* more often than before, and he began to treat the rest of the household like garbage.


A few examples:


* Turning down an internship that would have guaranteed him a place to stay, all because he “wanted to walk his own path in life”. This was code for smoking marijuana/playing video games all night and sleeping all day


* While I was working shit jobs that I hated and interviewing for jobs that would allow me to move out of my parents’ home, he spent his time getting high and playing video games. 


* ”Borrowing” money from me and my sister (15 currently) and either never paying it back or taking years to do so. I lent him $150 so he could buy himself an HD PVR (his money making scheme was getting popular on Youtube). While I was lucky enough to get my money back, the $80 that my sister gave him (money our dad gave her for her report card grades) was never returned. 


* Generally being inconsiderate of the wants and needs of anyone else. Using cars and never refilling the gas tank, never cleaning up after himself, always being loud and obnoxious while playing video games well into the night, demanding favors and getting pissy when he didn’t get his way, and many other similar undesirable traits. 


Before long, I simply stopped acknowledging him or his presence. I did my best to avoid him at all times and made sure that I needed him as little as possible. During this time, I also began to bond with our younger sister; not just over mutual interests, but because of a mutual dislike of our brother. We began to hang out with each other during summer months; when our parents noticed that we were hanging out more, they were happy, but asked us to include our brother more as well. Unfortunately, whenever we did, we always ended up regretting that decision, and whatever outing we were on was drastically less enjoyable while he was around.


Two years ago, my brother began showing signs of severe mental illness, which culminated in a mental breakdown and a stay in a mental hospital for a week. I’d be lying if I said that wasn’t the best week of sleep I had gotten in a while. When he got back, he was given medication and he began to see a psychiatrist. During this time, he (and my father) attempted to rebuild our broken relationship, but I had been burned far too many times and lost too much respect for him to return or entertain any of his attempts, so they all fell flat.


Eventually, he stopped seeing the psychiatrist, he stopped taking his meds, and had an even worse series of breakdowns than previous. All of his breakdowns were preceded by a negative event occurring for him, which led to extreme and hostile behavior. They also never occur while I’m around.


Last week, my brother got fired from his job (6th in three years), and my dad is attempting to get us to bond yet again. Much of this stems from his own regrets about his relationship with his own brother, as well as a history of mental illness on both his and my mother’s sides of the family. I understand his concerns, and why this is so important to him, but I’m having serious trouble even speaking with my brother, let alone being friends with him. My father has expressed both frustration and understanding when I voiced my uneasiness after suggesting I invite my brother to tag along.


Even if his actions are due to his mental illness, he has taken no initiative to do anything about it. He still doesn’t take his meds, he quit seeing his psychiatrist, he still acts selfish and obnoxious, and most of all he just isn’t a person that I like very much. He reminds me of the people that I disliked back in high school, and while my dad told me to avoid those people as best that I can, he wants me to spend more time with my brother who isn’t much different. Even if he does start taking his medication consistently, I don’t think we’ll ever be friends, let alone have the type of relationship that I have with my sister.


tl;dr: my brother treated me and everyone around him like shit, possibly because of a mental illness. This ruined our relationship, and I don’t have any desire to see it fixed, in spite of our parents’ desires to see otherwise. AITA?"

If you’re not up for long back and forth, but you just want to chat, that works too.

*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa you can choose a different name, if you prefer).... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "
8yq1d9,3,2018-07-13,Applied to several Walgreens but haven't heard back yet,emellegien,PharmacyTechnician,https://www.reddit.com/r/PharmacyTechnician/comments/8yq1d9/applied_to_several_walgreens_but_havent_heard/,"So I finished pharmacy school abroad and finally moved back to the US end of November. I got PTCB certified end of May and got my state license June 22nd. I applied to one Walgreens location June 24th and still haven't heard back yet but I can still see that the job is online. This is the same for another location I applied for on June 27th. I recently applied for 2 more locations just a few days ago.

Should I go to all of the branches I applied to and follow up my applications or do I just wait? I read online that other people got emails saying to go do another assessment in-store but I did the data entry assessment online already. Not sure if that's the same thing. I really don't know what I should do at this point. I've applied to Kroger and Costco and haven't heard anything back either. I feel defeated and I'm starting to think I should just apply for any job so I can save up enough to take TOEFL (even though English is my only language, I still have to take this since I graduated from the Philippines) so I can get my FPGEC and starting looking for a graduate intern job instead. I feel like I wasted so much time just waiting..."
8yqhxb,1,2018-07-13,Training for all around performance. Need structure. One last push for competition,zoochadookdook,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/8yqhxb/training_for_all_around_performance_need/,"Hey all. 

Me: 26. Prior high functioning alcoholic. 3 classes away from graduating college. One garage bay home gym with all thenecessities. Brown belt instructor 10th planet bjj. Looking to get a structured program in that fits my busy lifestyle to make a last push at competing.

I'm just finishing up jts  but due to a new job, lack of consistency in accessories, lack of sleep, too long of breaks in between days etc-I feel like I haven't made near the progress I should have. I'm not the strongest guy at 6ft 170 but I wanted to build a better base for generic lifting before I buckle down.

This fall I have Gracie worlds and adcc  trials coming up. I haven't competed for years but I'm determined to come in in the best most technical shape of my life. I also have a few potential fights depending on if I can get in a camp with school and such.

Currently I work 7-4 as a data intern making a whopping 12 an hour. Come home feed the pups. Gym for bjj and boxing 6-8/9 Back home to eat. Work on my llc/the house/chores/whatever. Try to get a hour/2 hour workout in the garage and go to sleep around 1 wake up at 5.30. 

My schedule should open a bit for days and such in several weeks but I'm looking for the best balance of strength, conditioning and just overall performance. I have the equipment, the want, the ability and I've done just about every type of split under the sun but it's always felt cobbled together.

Any advice, input, ideas etc are appreciated.

Thanks

I have just finished driving across the state to where he lives and tomorrow I'm going to meet his doctors and he's due for surgery in the morning.

I am honestly losing my shit. His wife talked to the doctors today but she's also elderly and she's so upset that she's not really keeping up with what's going on.

So here's my question - I have a laundry list of detailed questions I want to ask the staff but if I learned anything from watching Scrubs it's that hospital staff are too busy to sit down with the psychotic relative and gently explain everything to my heart's desire.

Who can I talk to and how should I talk to them in order to most efficiently get the information I want without grabbing them by the throat and daring somebody to get 9 big orderlies to drag my gigantic ass off the premises? 

I am very bad at being assertive and tend to get aggressive instead in stressful conversations and that's not going to be good for me or them.

Furthermore, I understand that I probably don't need the chief of surgery to talk to me, but neither do I want to get pawned off on some brand new intern.

Do I need any forms or proof to get them to talk to me (for HIPAA)? I also want to contact his regular doctors, would I need a revised HIPAA form for that or could I just ask him to sign something temporarily.

I would also appreciate it if you suggest any questions I should ask to get the best understanding of what's going on. I'm making a list but I'm sure I've overlooked something

Please help.

Age: 83
Weight: 250-ish
Height: 6'0""
Sex: M
Race: Caucasian

Injury: Broke either his hip or his leg just below the hip. Right side. That's all I got before she started crying.

Existing medical issues: Nerve damage from a fall 2 years ago in his left leg/foot and his right shoulder/upper arm.

Also cancer in lungs and throat. Currently receiving immunotherapy (Opdivo) for that.

Im a rising ssenior (3.6 GPA) going into fall recruitment.

 So far in my time here I've been analyzing retrospective trends in disbursements, receipts, and general cash inflow and outflow identifying variances and issues. I've also done a bit of cash forecasting while here but haven't done heavy modelling work yet but will push for it. I've also done a lot of reporting building using NetSuite and Excel together to better showcase information and have assisted on various Ad Hoc projects. 

Overall my work has been done to support the accounting and Corp finance directors decision making capabilities. 

Now I've looked and have read in Big 4 TAS on my own and based on what I've found I'd favor the Corp finance and valuation groups more than FDD. Although I would be very open to FDD if it meant I could move to a valuations group eventually. 

Anyways, the big 4 only recruit for audit and tax on campus at my school with only one person doing TAS/deals advisory graduating recently. 

I've approached recruiters with my interest in TAS highlighting my experience in email and why I think I'd be a good fit but wanted to read some of you guys input on this. I'd hate to graduate without a job because I opted out of audit internship recruiting next fall by putting all my cards in TAS.  But I know for certain I'd be more motivated and better working on that side. 

How should I approach this? "

This is my first post here and I just want to say that this is such a wonderful subreddit to have stumbled upon, especially as a believer. It’s always comforting to find a community of brothers and sisters. 

This summer I was blessed to be apart of my church’s summer youth team for my fourth year now. I’ve been what we call Summer Staff for three years and this is my first year as a youth intern! 

Being an intern, I have been given the opportunity to preach a sermon to the entire youth group this Sunday. I’ve had a while to prepare and while I do feel ready, I’m an incredibly anxious person with terrible stage fright and a ton of social anxiety. 

For context, during my sophomore year I took a public speaking class and I nearly failed because I was so awful at speaking in front of people. I stutter and often break a nervous sweat and mumble and start breathing heavily. It’s rough. 

However, I’ve seen God trying to comfort me and teach me new things. He’s reminded me that, when my trust and hope are in Him, all my fears pale in comparison to the God of the universe. He has also reminded me that He has made me the way I am on purpose. I am uniquely made and my introverted nature is by His glorious design. 

This all being said, I’m trying my best to give it all to Him and keep cool; though as we draw nearer to Sunday, my anxiety can’t help but increase. I know that no matter what, God will be by my side and it will all be okay - even if I mess up some. 

I would appreciate prayers for peace and if I may be so bold, a bit of confidence too. I really want to be a youth pastor myself in the future and I would like to start overcoming this stage fright sooner rather than later. 

Thank you all so much for your support and I hope you all have a blessed day! 


TL;DR - This Sunday I’m preaching my first sermon in front of the entire youth group and I’m an incredibly anxious person. Prayers for peace and confidence.

Obviously dumb me went to a private school, but I love where I am. Before I knew I would have a job, I signed for graduate plus loans for about 42,000 for this coming school year and planned to pay/give back what I did not use. So total I will have about 100k in loans, most federal.

I am now making about 3,500 a month and live on about 1,500-1,700 a month. I just started tracking my expenses more seriously. I already have okay spending habits and do not eat out very much. I have two credit cards I pay off in full every month, and a car at home that is fully paid off but never used because I'm in a city where I don't need it (I don't know what to do with it). My problem is I have a heart condition and most of my money is going to medical bills right now. I have about 4k of medical expenses I expect within the next month. I have pretty good insurance but I've had to have surgeries (and will have another soon) and I'm going to meet my out of pocket max after the 4k. If I don't pay the bills in a timely manner, will my credit score be affected? 

I've just gotten a job offer to continue where I am for my internship but with better pay but less hours. Starting in August until the end of 2018 I will make about 3,700 a month and then I will make about 2,500-3,000 a month. I guess I am not sure what the smartest thing to do first is - prioritize medical bills, loans, or contributing to emergency fund? Some mix of these things?"

Basically I am using it as a workstation computer, no gaming whatsoever, only work and casual surfing. I will probably be linking it to a bigger monitor(heard you could do that) so I probably will try that method to get a bigger screen to work easily. 

I am getting myself the IPad Pro and pencil as well to make use of the back to school promotion, but man, the 15 inch MacBook Pro is crazy expensive if I add i9core, 32GB ram and 1TB storage. Is it worth to spend so much for those three components? Or it’s enough to just have  i7, 16GB ram and 512GB SSD? Thanks, appreciate for any advices.

I've seen a lot of general software resume critiques but I'm posting here to look for any specific advice on my very iOS centric resume. It'd be great to get some feedback about my project descriptions (am I describing my work well?) , skills section, and any general resume formatting issues. 

On a side note, I have Objective-C on my resume but I really only have a basic understanding of the syntax and can go through some stack overflow posts. I'm not sure how big of a concern that'll be especially for internships.

8yv7oy,3,2018-07-14,47[M4F] My daughter’s roommate,ClearlyALoon,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8yv7oy/47m4f_my_daughters_roommate/,"I’ve posted this one before and have had fun with it. If you’re not up for long back and forth, but you just want to chat, that works too.

*****

I'm Jack. I'm 45 and in decent shape for a guy my age: 6' tall, 195 lbs. with thick brown hair and bright green eyes. My daughter, Amy, just graduated from college, and as a gift, I had planned a long weekend at a beach in North Carolina. She thought it would be boring to go with just Dad, especially after dark, so she asked if she could invite Vanessa, an old roommate of hers. I resisted at first because it was supposed to be a daddy-daughter event, but we had an extra bedroom in the condo I had rented, and it was her gift not mine. I acquiesced.

On Thursday morning Amy helped me pack the car, and we were off. We picked up Vanessa, who was attractive in a girl next door sort of way. Amy helped Vanessa put her things in the car while I chatted mindlessly with her mother, whose beauty wasn't as fresh as her daughter's but still held up quite well.

I started the car, found a jazz station, pulled away from the curb, and headed for the highway. After driving almost five hours straight, we stopped for lunch in Asheville. Amy noticed she had a message, listened to it, and then stepped outside to make a phone call.

Vanessa and I sat awkwardly until she told me how much she appreciated me letting her come on the trip. She said she'd make sure to find some excuses to disappear to allow Amy and I to have some quality one-on-one time together. I protested a bit, but eventually agreed that would be nice. I had noticed that like Amy she had brought a yoga mat, and I asked if she did yoga a lot, and she said yes, she often does it alone, but she did some research and found a really cool studio to check out. She suggested I try it out with them. I blushed, and said thanks but no, I'm not sure what I'd do in a yoga studio other than hurt myself. She laughed, twirled a strand of her hair and said it was an open invitation in case I changed my mind. Her smile and laugh kicked her girl next door beauty up a notch.

Amy returned with a huge smile on her face. She explained that a very highly-regarded Seattle-based consulting firm had called and explained that one of their summer interns had dropped out and she was the first on their waitlist. They needed her to interview her in person ASAP because the training began in just ten days. Amy had explained where she was, and the firm said they sympathized and they'd be happy to get her a first-class ticket out of either the Nashville or Raleigh-Durham airport that evening, but they couldn't wait until after the weekend.

Of course, you have to go, I said. I need a return on my investment. (Emory wasn't cheap.) We'll turn around and make sure you're on that plane.

Vanessa nodded and agreed it would be great if Amy got that job. Moments later, as we walked to the car, Vanessa let out an audible sigh. She looked disappointed, pouty. Amy took her hand with one of her own and then hugged when she saw more was needed. I could see Vanessa was fighting back some emotion. After they let go, Amy asked Vanessa if she could talk to me alone.

“I know I have to go, Daddy. It's just that Vanessa was really looking forward to the trip. Unlike me, she had to pay for school herself, and she has a lot of student loans to show for it. She grew up without much, and this would have been the first vacation she's had since before her dad died. I've got a huge favor to ask. You've paid for the condo, and I doubt you can get a refund at this point. Why don't you just take me to Raleigh so I can catch a flight, and the two of you can go to the beach for the weekend. The condo has three bedrooms so it's not like it'd be that weird. You could do your thing, she could do her thing, and maybe you'd have a couple of meals together.”

*****

I'm looking for Vanessa you can choose a different name, if you prefer).... I have several ideas about how this can unfold, but am eager for input and collaboration to fit mutual kinks. Have I piqued your interest? If so, tell me what Vanessa looks like, and tell me what your kinks and limits are.

Ideally this would go on for a bit. I like buildup.

Ideally I’d find a partner who wants to chat and role play beyond this scenario assuming there’s some chemistry.

Sometimes I have a lot of time, sometimes I can only write once a day. "
8yvfgd,2,2018-07-14,My 3 year noFap experience and differences between mental and physical urges,martinsloother,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/8yvfgd/my_3_year_nofap_experience_and_differences/,"Hey guys. I have been pursuing a NoFap lifestyle for just over 3 years now, and have read a lot of content pertaining to the subject over that time period. This is however my first time posting and talking about my experiences. I have struggled a lot with porn over this time period and feel I have come to a point where I am finally starting to understand my triggers and the true effect porn use has had on me over the course of my young life. As I am currently 21 years old. Starting off my longest ""streak"" was about 6 months, no porn or masturbation. This was just about a year ago, although during this time I was having a lot of sex, with my then and current girlfriend. I realize now that over this time period, even though I was not participating in viewing P or M I was definitely not doing a whole lot of recovering, per se. I would often feel very agitated after sex and would experience what I now know to be called the ""chaser effect"", as it is referred to on [Yourbrainonporn.com](https://Yourbrainonporn.com). I often would feel a sense of irritation towards my girlfriend that was hard to overlook. It's not that I didn't want to be around her, it was more just the thought of sex with any other women felt greatly more desirable and the thought of sex with her was just not very desirable. This feeling of the ""chaser effect"" was at its strongest during this long streak of months without any PMO. Soon after this time I went away to college and would only see my girlfriend about once a week on weekends instead of everyday, as I had all summer. I soon started PMOing again out of curiosity, and felt less shameful about it then i had remembered before my long streak. I noticed that although the ""chaser effect"", still persisted from time to time after intercourse with my gf, it was not as common or strong as when i hadn't been doing any PMO. My girlfriend now is working at an internship on the other side of the country and we have been away from each other for quite some time. I have had an uptake in my PMO habits ever since she has been gone. One thing I have noticed is I undoubtedly have much more control as pertaining to PMO then before my long streak. I generally feel a sense of control even when performing the act of PMO. I don't rush anything, I just take the moment for what it is. Although I don't feel the same level of shame, I sure enough still think afterwards, ""I really could've done without that"". But I do feel a sense of ""sexual relief"" after and am able to go on with my day with less sexual thoughts flooding my brain. This had led me to discover through my own experience the difference I feel between mental and physical urges. I feel mental urges are more brought about by the visualization of porn or obsession with the female body. I have become a lot better at resisting this type of urge. This type of urge, in my experience results from boredom or not occupying your mind with meaningful tasks. Also constantly checking out women in public, in an obsessive, compulsive manner, can bring about a flood of these type of urges and mental images. This type of urge is brought about through your own fault as you are consciously focusing on sexualizing or objectifying women. This type of urge usually results through a choice of your own. Through awareness I have found that these ""mental urges"" can be stifled mostly. Although sexual images will always flash across a man's brain in some quantity, due to the way we are wired. But distracting yourself and being attentive to your thought patterns and tendencies to fantasize can be very effective at keeping many ""mental urges"" at bay. The thing I have found I really struggle with, especially since my girlfriend has been away, and I have had no physical contact with woman is the ""physical urge"". The only way I can describe this is a sudden rush of sexual energy. Sometimes I won't even be fantasizing of thinking about any women in particular, I just get this surge or feeling of sexuality coursing through my body. I guess some would call this, ""feeling horny"". But I feel there is a big distinction with this from ""mental urges"". Because the physical urge is brought about more by chemicals in your brain. I experience this many time after about a week of no PMO. I will be keeping busy all day, not even focusing on sex at all over this entire time. And suddenly my body just gets a rush, it makes my hands shake, and my penis shrivel up for some odd reason. The thought of P or any sexually attractive women hadn't even crossed my mind, but this feeling persists. This is my kryptonite, because as soon as I start to entertain a sexual image in my mind when feeling this way. I am prone to give in. Usually I can predict this sort of feeling coming on if I have had a day where I feel particularly good all day. I will get home after a long day of working, working out and will either be laying in bed or relaxing, when this feeling comes on out of no where. It may just be my natural libido, because in a way it is an exciting, and empowering energy that comes over me. I just feel for so long my body has been wired to release when feeling this way. I automatically equate this feeling with jerking off. I feel mental urges are what cause the obsession, the habit of masturbating constantly, daily, or multiple times a day. This is a result of boredom and not filling your day with meaningful activities. But these ""physical urges"" are the true barrier in overcoming PMO, because this is where it is deeply engrained in your wiring and how you operate. I hope my persistence will pay off, as it has in the past. Maybe I am making more progress than I know or can see. Just wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has experienced anything similar. I feel I have rambled a bit, but I hope most of you are able to get the overall idea of what I am saying.

8yvmtw,7,2018-07-14,Advice on car service taking too long,IWantMyCarBack,FocusST,https://www.reddit.com/r/FocusST/comments/8yvmtw/advice_on_car_service_taking_too_long/,"Hey guys,

I need some advice here. I bought a used 2013 Focus ST with about 72.5k miles from a Ford dealership in Michigan on May 16. With it I also purchased the Ford Premium Care warranty which is good for 7 years from the manufacture date of the car or 100,00 miles. When I was purchasing the car the salesman told me that there were no aftermarket parts on the car except for the wheels and the head unit. About a week or two later I come to find out that this is not the case. I see can see that there is a Cobb air intake and an aftermarket exhaust as well (I don't recall the brand, starts with an M but it's not Mountune). There's also blow off valve sounds which I'm not sure are stock either, but beyond that I'm not sure what else is aftermarket on the car. At this point I am in Georgia for an internship.

On June 16th, I came off the highway and stop at a light and I feel the car shaking and the check engine light comes on. I pull over into a parking lot and use my OBD2 scanner which tells me that there is a misfire in cylinder 4. I checked the ignition coils and spark plugs myself and determined that those weren't the cause.  I didn't feel comfortable doing anything beyond that nor did I have the tools to do so so I decided to take the car to a dealer.

On June 19th, I took the car to a different Ford Dealership from where the car was purchased (because I'm in Georgia still).

On June 28th, they looked at the car for the first time. All they were able to tell me is that there is there is anti-freeze in the cylinder.  After they told me that they said they needed to determine if the issue was caused by any of the after market parts.  Every time I call they say they are still trying to diagnose the issue. From what I understand, anti-freeze in a cylinder can be caused by a broken head gasket, a cracked engine block, or a broken cylinder head.

On July 13th, is the last time I spoke with them. They are still trying to diagnose at this point. They said the mechanic had inspected the top of the engine and was at that point looking at it from below. They have not checked the head gasket at this point.

Should diagnosing these issues really take this long? What do I need to do to protect myself in the case that the dealership denies warranty and says that the issue  was caused by the aftermarket parts in the car? Am I liable for any misuse of the car from previous owners of the car? Is the dealer that sold me the car liable for not informing me of the aftermarket parts? Can anyone give me some insight on how an aftermarket air intake or exhaust can cause antifreeze to leak into a cylinder, if they can do so at all.

TL;DR - Dealership has had my car for about a month now trying to diagnose why there is anti-freeze in one of my cylinders."

With it I also purchased the Ford Premium Care warranty which is good for 7 years from the manufacture date of the car or 100,00 miles. When I was purchasing the car the salesman told me that there were no aftermarket parts on the car except for the wheels and the head unit. About a week or two later I come to find out that this is not the case. I see can see that there is a Cobb air intake and an aftermarket exhaust as well (I don't recall the brand, starts with an M but it's not Mountune). There's also blow off valve sounds which I'm not sure are stock either, but beyond that I'm not sure what else is aftermarket on the car. At this point I am in Georgia for an internship.

On June 16th, I came off the highway and stop at a light and I feel the car shaking and the check engine light comes on. I pull over into a parking lot and use my OBD2 scanner which tells me that there is a misfire in cylinder 4. I checked the ignition coils and spark plugs myself and determined that those weren't the cause. I didn't feel comfortable doing anything beyond that nor did I have the tools to do so so I decided to take the car to a dealer.

On June 19th, I took the car to a different Ford Dealership from where the car was purchased (because I'm in Georgia still).

On June 28th, they looked at the car for the first time. All they were able to tell me is that there is there is anti-freeze in the cylinder. After they told me that they said they needed to determine if the issue was caused by any of the after market parts. Every time I call they say they are still trying to diagnose the issue. From what I understand, anti-freeze in a cylinder can be caused by a broken head gasket, a cracked engine block, or a broken cylinder head.

On July 13th, is the last time I spoke with them. They are still trying to diagnose at this point. They said the mechanic had inspected the top of the engine and was at that point looking at it from below. They have not checked the head gasket at this point.

Should diagnosing these issues really take this long? What do I need to do to protect myself in the case that the dealership denies warranty and says that the issue was caused by the aftermarket parts in the car? Am I liable for any misuse of the car from previous owners of the car? Is the dealer that sold me the car liable for not informing me of the aftermarket parts? Can anyone give me some insight on how an aftermarket air intake or exhaust can cause antifreeze to leak into a cylinder, if they can do so at all.

TL;DR - Dealership has had my car for about a month now trying to diagnose why there is anti-freeze in one of my cylinders."

Office dynamics changed, and his apathy plus lack of leadership from our manager is making it very difficult to do my job &amp; will create problems for our boss. I need advice!",office_problems_thwy,askamanager,https://www.reddit.com/r/askamanager/comments/8yvq5l/xpost_from_rrelationships_i_have_a_new_coworker/,"I work in a very small government office for a local elected official. There are 4 FT staffers, and usually several interns any given semester. One of the 4 staffers is the Chief of Staff, who manages the 3 of us (in theory). Last spring our Communications Director found a new job, and we hired a new one. This person has no government/political experience, they were previously a reporter who happened to cover local government. I'm still not sure why they want to change career paths. I've been in the office over 3 years, and my other two coworkers have been around for about 7.

I have had a very hard time working with this new person. They are incredibly dismissive of the work I do, and I perceive them to be disrespectful. I have tried to work around these feelings by increasing communication, by email and in person, and by talking with our Chief of Staff about it. I've met with our boss (the elected official) to express my concerns, but I don't necessarily want to bother them about this constantly because they have more important things on their plate.

This person has very different values than a typical person who works someone in my political party. These views affect how they conduct themselves and their perception of our constituents, and I think this is a problem. This person does not respond to my emails generally, and is very flippant when talking in person. They get very loud and talk over me, and like to crack jokes that a friend might (he jokingly called me retarded)...but we're not friends so, it's not something I'm laughing about. They are also extremely dismissive of my work because it focuses on a specific part of our district that is more well off than another part of it, and since those problems aren't ""real"" to them, they wave me off anytime I plan something for that geographic area. This makes it much harder to do anything successfully in my area, but that's literally 60% of my day-to-day job.

This person has had some good ideas in meetings, and gets along so far with the elected official, so both they/the Chief of Staff like them so far. But I and my other coworker [39 F] have had a lot of problems with him. I wonder if it's because we're women? I have no concrete evidence of this but I am struggling with trying to figure out why this person is making my work harder than it has to be. They have ignored my requests for certain things to be posted to social media, there are huge mistakes in press releases related to events I've planned, and they are extremely defensive when said mistakes are brought up (in private, between the two of us). One such example was a social media post which used ""affect"" when it should have been ""effect"". I told this person about the mistake so they could edit it. They told me they ran the sentence through a ""grammar website"" and it came back correct. I told him I used to be a copywriter, and it was wrong. They refused to change it. Another issue was a community event that we wanted press to cover, and a press advisory was published with a typo, the wrong date, and the wrong location. So we got pretty terrible press coverage and I didn't know why until weeks later, because they wouldn't show me the press release in advance. So you can imagine how difficult it has been to bring up larger problems and issues.

I've sat and talked to the Chief of Staff about this at length, on multiple occasions. They've told me that our new staffer told them, in confidence, that I was coming off as ""aggressive"" because I was correcting too many things and asking too much. Not only is this person making lots of mistakes on the work their currently doing, they are not doing 100% of the things their predecessor did, making a lot of work fall into my lap. On top of that, they keep saying how much easier this job is than their last job, which is an insult to the fact that we are working our asses off to keep things afloat while this new person learns the ropes.

I told my Chief of Staff that I would feel better about all of this, be more understanding of the learning curve, as long as there is a concerted effort, a plan in place to get this new person get up to 100% capacity. I was told, basically, that that was the goal, but no plan in place. That I just need to stop expecting so much of people, and meet them where they're at. Meanwhile it feels like everything is on my plate all the time, and I'm drowning in all the work I can't handle. This Chief of Staff also recently told me that the only reason they went back to school (just got a Masters in May) was because they were bored in their job, and had it not been for that program, they would have quit out of boredom/complacency.

SO. I am dealing with an apathetic Chief of Staff who is supposed to be managing the performance of the office, a new staffer who is unqualified, possibly misogynistic, and unresponsive to suggestions/working in a team setting, and me &amp; my other female coworker who are really suffering under the stress of it all and the added responsibilities that haven't been recognized. I am totally frustrated and angry about the situation because I feel like I'm being gaslighted into thinking I'M the one who is a problem, when in reality, I am trying to do what's best for our office and for the elected official we work for.

I sent an email to both the Chief of Staff and the new staffer today about a problem that we need to resolve, and the Chief of Staff only responded ""I want you both in my office at 9am sharp Monday."" I'm hoping that this finally opens the floodgates so we can actually talk about the issues in the office, but I'm concerned they'll just again tell me I'm the one causing problems, being aggressive, having overly high expectations, and basically shut me down.

I need advice. Advice on how to not lose it in this meeting, advice on the best possible logical argument to make, advice on how to meander this successfully since what I'm doing now is apparently not working. What do I do to maintain these work relationships and move past these growing pains?

**TL;DR I work in a small office where a lot of work overlaps, but a new staffer is making my job a lot harder than it has to be, keeps making mistakes, and isn't responsive to constructive criticism. Our Chief of Staff is apathetic and refuses to do anything about it. I am struggling in dealing with twice as much work as I used to, plus the stress of working with someone who does not respect me.**"

2:34 AM (HKT)

If you are looking for a beautiful ending to my last post, please do not continue reading. 

This is real life after all. There’s no guaranteed happy ending. And I just happen to get the bad side of the story.

It is a rainy night. A really, rainy night. I was playing Warframe on PC as usual, trying to compensate time I “lost” on my internship. I mean, tomorrow’s Sunday, wouldn’t hurt to play a bit more late, right? But tonight was different. I was not able to tell why, but then my mom got a phone call from the nursing home……

Last week I visited the nursing home with my family. The experience was quite something. In my last post, I kind of talked a bit on how people with Alzheimer’s decease, their soul would leave prior to their body? Yup, let just say I have never been more frustrated to say I’m correct on this matter. We arrived at the nursing home around lunch, so that we could accompany grandma during lunch, then when she gets sleepy, we would go back. However, this time when we arrive, we waited for a long, long time. The staff still couldn’t get grandma to the visiting lobby. Then a senior nurse came to us and reported on her status.

“ (My grandma’s name) is not in her best condition today, she has been in an unstable state lately, sometimes good, sometimes bad. Actually she’s one tough girl! Being able to keep in her shape in 100s in really something remarkable. She is now sleeping in her room, we (nurse) usually just let them keep on sleeping, you know”. 

She was insinuating that grandma’s time is almost up. My heart sank right when I heard this. My mum asked whether we could visit her room (They usually don’t allow visitors to go into their room without consent, due to privacy, and dignity of the elders). The nurse said yes without even hesitation. 

My grandma was sleeping on her bed. Tranquil, looked tired. It’s like she has been through thousands fights. We called her name, she did not wake up. So we called out to her again. This time, she woke, but with genuine fear in her eyes.

“LEAVE! I NEED TO SLEEP!”

“Grandma, it’s me! (My name)!”

“I SAID LEAVE, I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE!”

“Do you remember him? He’s (my father’s name), you son!”

“IF YOU WANNA DIE, SUIT YOURSELF, I AM NOT GOING TO.”

We then have no choice but bid her farewell and left the nursing house.

She was in her “true nature”. The uglier side of her I think. Judging from the conversation, my family and I are certain that she thought we were there to take her to the afterlife. In Chinese myths, when people experience death, the workers of death would pretend to be their most closed family / friends and lure them to the afterlife. It is common when fatal accidents happen to someone, we’d say “Don’t sleep, do not follow them, they are mere passing by, come back!” and stuff like that, and try to rally that people’s soul to our side (material plane). There was nothing we could do, we can only ask for extra care from the nursing home.

Then, here comes this night. The phone call was from nursing home. They said my grandma is now in severe fever and is having asthma. We are kind of prepared for this situation, but there’s nothing we can do. The rain outside is way too heavy, we could not get to the nursing home in time. I somehow knew, that when I has that dream, she’s already gone. We will go to the hospital they are sending her tomorrow. At this stage, I think it is actually better to let her go instead of having ER trying to rescue her. She is in her better state, if she were to pass away now, it is totally a good thing (Not that I am hoping for, but it is naturally a better option compared to pass away in pain). Right now, I am writing this update and going to sleep. I asked my parents to get a “paper talisman” that is supposed to lower my “Yang Chi” (陽氣) and protect my spirit (by extra bonding) at the same time, so that I could try to connect to my grandma in my sleep. But this time, it is initiated from our side.

Side note: The photo I uploaded is not the one my parents gave me, as it SHOULD NOT BE MADE PUBLIC (The paper talisman should be burnt to be effective, and they draw power from the caster). That photo's paper talisman has a very similar format to Chinese paper talisman (for many purposes). The upper part (勒令 means ""Command"", which forces spirits around / specified entities to execute the order), the lower part is the order's content, the one on the photo seems to be ""Protect the temple"", which make sense as I see this is coming from a game about a Miko (Japanese Witch) which guards her temple (?) Chinese use yellow colored special paper instead."
8ywqvf,34,2018-07-14,SCP: Talk **** get hit?,paleolithicprep,SCP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/8ywqvf/scp_talk_get_hit/,"**Item #:** SCP-XXXX

**Object Class:** Safe

**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-XXXX is to be placed on a cushion made of 100&amp;#37; silk and stored in a locked container. To prevent accidental containment breach, personnel are forbidden from bringing anything consisting of more than 70&amp;#37; silk onto Site-██.

All staff stationed within 1 kilometer of SCP-XXXX are to avoid using foul language of any kind, and to use pleasantries such ""Please"" and ""Thank you"" as appropriate. Polite greetings and farewells are to be said before and after all staff interactions. Nearby personnel are to avoid any actions that would have been considered ""indecent"" before the 1960's.

SCP-XXXX does not require monitoring, as this has been deemed ineffective at preventing its anomalous properties. Its effects do not apply to online or written communications within SCP-3565's effective range.

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a white, cotton glove measuring 23 centimeters in length and 8 centimeters in width, with a weight of 207 grams. SCP-XXXX was located by Foundation operatives inside of a ████████████ in Oxford, England, immediately following the 1954 FIFA World Cup match between Uruguay and England.

SCP-XXXX's anomalous properties are observed when an individual within half a kilometer of it swears or threatens another individual. SCP-XXXX materializes half a meter from the face of the offender and slaps them with disproportionate force depending on the type of insult or threat, disappearing immediately after and reappearing on the nearest silk cushion. To date, the range of SCP-XXXX's manifestation has not exceeded more than half a kilometer from its containment site.

It should be noted that SCP-XXXX has slapped personnel with considerable force, in one case slapping Senior Agent Harrington following an incident involving an intern and hot coffee with an estimated ████ Newtons of force, shattering his jaw. ~~Following this incident, experiments into SCP-XXXX's capabilities using D-Class subjects have been approved.~~

\- \[SCP-XXXX Experiment Logs\]

***For experiments 1-5, D-Class volunteers with unremarkable psychological backgrounds were given instructions to insult Special Agent Sato in a room within active range of SCP-XXXX.***

**Experiment XXXX-1:** D-3349 is warned not to speak after repeating his given phrase. D-3349 proceeds to tell Agent Sato to ""get ████"". SCP-XXXX manifests and slaps D-3349 with an estimated ████ Newtons of force, knocking him to the ground. D-3349 is returned to his cell.

**Experiment 3565-2:** D-2291 is instructed to read off a stream of insults and threats towards Agent Sato. Upon completion, SCP-XXXX immediately slaps D-2291 with a notable force of ████ Newtons, concussing him. D-2291 is returned to his cell with medical staff.

**Experiment 3565-3:** 5 D-Class personnel are placed into separate rooms and instructed to read off the same stream of insults after a buzzer. The buzzer is activated at the same time in each room. Upon reading their scripts SCP-XXXX manifests and slaps all 5 D-Class one by one, concussing all 5 D-Class using an average of ████ Newtons of force in under 22 seconds. All 5 are returned to their cells with medical staff.

**Experiment 3565-4:** D-6664 is instructed to attack Agent Sato after reading off the same stream of insults as D-2291. After several minutes of apprehension and attempts at negotiation with research staff, D-6664 complies and charges towards Sato. SCP-XXXX manifests and slaps D-6664 mid-charge with an estimated force of █████ Newtons, knocking him back 3.1 meters into the wall. D-6664 suffers a spinal fracture and is unresponsive. D-6664 is removed by medical staff.

*Researcher's Note: I think we've gathered enough data this way. I doubt there will be different results with similar experiments, and funding is beginning to dwindle. We need to think outside of the box here a bit.*

**Experiment 3565-5:** D-████ is taken to SCP-XXXX's containment cell. D-████ is instructed to ██████████████████████████. SCP-XXXX ███████████████████████ at an estimated speed of ████. ██████████████████████████.

**Addendum 3565-1:** Following Experiment XXXX-5, further experimentation with SCP-XXXX has been suspended indefinitely.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was wondering if this SCP seems like a good entry into the universe.

Two other versions I considered: Make it much weaker, at worst slapping you hard enough to make you fall backwords. But usually just enough to surprise/sting. Other version is its made into an SCP-J entry. Opinions?

8ywzlu,2,2018-07-14,M4F Wet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ywzlu/m4f_wet/,"Nobody said it worked this fast...

Wet.  It's the slang term for the newest illegal drug running rampant in the world.  It's actual name was ridiculously long and boring, so it quickly took on th name ""Wet"".

Wet had quite a few effects on the human body.  It gave the sensory pleasures and euphoria of ecstacy, the energy of cocaine, the libido of a double dose of Viagra, and the sexual hunger of a rabbit.  Altogether, the name made a lot of sense because it made men harder than a top pornstar and women...well wet.

People took it for the high ostensibly, as the high was supposed to be extremely pleasant, but as it became more commonplace, people began taking it for wild nights with a special friend and then taking it in groups for wild orgies with several special friends.  It worked for both men and women and could even be dissolved in fruit juices.

Cops barely enforced the laws against it, as arresting people high on Wet always guaranteed a fun night in the squad car.  Politicians publicly condemned it, but day after day scandals came to light as more and more elected officials were caught high on Wet and buried in writhing interns.

The hangover wasn't bad for most, but for some rare cases, it caused a psychological addiction to physical contact with that person.  Taking too much Wet and getting your pussy eaten might even give your partner an addiction to your pussy and the same could be said of blowing a Wet fueled erection.

It's mostly harmless right?  So why is it hitting you so hard and so fast....?

Let's create an experience.  You tell me where you are when Wet kicks in and who you're with.  Does it kick in while you're still working?  Does someone slip it into your drink?  Do you give some to your boyfriend as an experiment only to have it become more intense than expected?  How does Wet affect your life?  Let's have some fun with this."

After 7 years we (23M and 24F) broke up amicably and “mutually” about a month and a half ago. I say “mutually” because she initiated it, and with the things going on in my life at the time I agreed as much as it hurt. 

First two weeks were horrible, down right worst times of my life I can say. I beat myself up, checkup up on her on social media all day, and couldn’t focus on my final exams and responsibilities. 

Decided right after finals to pick myself up by the boot straps and go NC, despite her wanting to be friends. Started exercising, hanging out with my friends and getting back into old hobbies that I didn’t have time for before. Yeah at first while starting this self improvement period I still thought about her all damn day (still do but I find myself realizing I haven’t thought about her since so and so time of the day). But lately, this last week really I haven’t had the urge to focus on her as much. I have stopped checking up on her social media as often as I did before, and this is what was killing me over and over again. So much time and energy is spent to just trying to get a glimpse at her, and I’m starting to have enough of it. I’m getting tired of it. I’m tired of letting this person who decided we weren’t worth it to have so much control over my actions and thoughts when there are so many more positive things in life to focus on. 

I have this awesome internship over the summer, been reconnecting old friendships and have been reflecting on my thoughts and what I want in life. Although bittersweet, I’m excited for the future has in store for me. My health/fitness has greatly improved, I graduate in less than a year, and I have friends and family that are super supportive of me in this whole fallout of the relationship.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not completely over her and don’t think I will be for a quite a while. But I can at least say I’m better off now than I was on the first day of being single. 

Moral of my story. It does get better, I don’t think I’m one of the success stories that you read on here yet, but I feel like I’m on the right track now. I’ve learned to accept she is gone and there’s is nothing I can do to bring her back. She can contact me if she wants to talk about reconciling. 

I got a life to live and I’m looking forward to it now and you do to. "

8yyw6g,8,2018-07-14,Experience Using Tinder for 1 Week,TinderWeek,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8yyw6g/experience_using_tinder_for_1_week/,"I'm a 19M college student with quite a bit of time on my hands over the summer outside my internship. Because grinding leetcode gets boring, I figured I'd try tinder for one week and here are my results. The ideal result from this for me was a bit of data, a couple memes and a fwb or two. I'll put my conclusions and tl;dr at the bottom.

Tinder stats:
Days: 7 (last day cut short)
Right swipes: ~300, probably swiped right on around 30-50% of girls
Matches: 35 (2 unmatched me, one I unmatched)
Matches by day:
Day: Number of matches
1: 13
2: 4
3: 4
4: 5
5: 3
6: 4
7: 2

Girls messaged: 25  (I am an engineering nerd (tho I don't really look like one) so I sent my fair share of cringey/memey messages, note this In response rates)

Personalized messages (excluding unmatch I was trolling): 12

Personalized message responses: 9 (75% response rate!)

Personalized message numbers gotten: 3 (33% date/number conversion :/)


Generic ""How is your XXX (day, weekemd, summer) going?"" (Or similar) messages: 7

Generic responses: 3 (42% response rate)

Generic message numbers gotten: 1? (A second girl said she'd give me her number but has yet to, so still 33% date/number conversion :/)


""What brings you to tinder?"" messages sent: 3 (I thought I sent 4, so maybe someone unmatched me because of this message as well?), no responses on this one 🤔


Conclusions/reflections:
I had a ton of fun on tinder at first! The matches are really fun initially! For me it wore off for a few reasons:
1: It's hard to find what you're looking for! I don't really like hookups, so that really narrowed down my pool.  
2: I'm also attracted to studious/introverted girls way more than I realized, and most of the girls on Tinder were not much of this type.
3: Ending conversations/not messaging matches doesn't feel very good, even if it is the right thing to do.
4: There was one match early on I really liked, she was exactly my type and really smart, so messaging people after she agreed to go out felt kind of bad to me

Out of my 35 matches I would have been ecstatic to go out with 4 of them (am going to lunch with 1) and really happy to go out with 6 more (maybe going out with 2 of them if the other one doesn't go well). I think the enthusiasm came across in my messages even if I didn't realize it, as I sent most of them unique messages helping to gain their interest. 

My matches were super high the first day after I made the account, but reasonably steady afterwards, getting 3-5 per day, even with a location change on days 6-7. 

Finally some misc and memes: of the two girls that unmatched me, one did so because I asked her number and the other because I tried to recount the history of the Dassler family (founders of Adidas and Puma) as a fairy tale to her. Much of the time I tried humour in a personalized message it really ended up failing, usually leading to conversational halts.

Tl;dr:
Asking girls about interesting things in their bio/pics is the best way to get a good response (I could learn from this in real life XD)! Tinder is not the best way to meet the most studious girls as a young guy. If you have questions or more data or your own (or experience on other apps) I'd love to hear it!

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

8yyzh4,285,2018-07-14,Ex-fiance's blonde sister stays the night [MF],timemura,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/8yyzh4/exfiances_blonde_sister_stays_the_night_mf/,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6y8ihc/mf\_the\_blonde\_sister\_in\_an\_italian\_family/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/6y8ihc/mf_the_blonde_sister_in_an_italian_family/)

Over a year ago I had an encounter with my fiancé's sister. We never fucked but if it hadn't been for my phone ringing in the middle of us exploring each other's bodies, we most certainly would have. Since then, my fiancé and I broke up. It was a mutual decision that we both had dreams in life that we could not achieve together, one of us would have had to give up in total support of the other, so we decided to pursue our own goals in life. Since the breakup was mutual, we're still on speaking terms with each other and each other's family. 

Fast forward to a month ago, the blonde sister in my ex's Italian family texts me unexpectedly. She got accepted for a summer internship in Washington DC and she asking if she could stay at my place for a night when she made the drive from Texas to DC. My apartment in North Carolina was a perfect stop for her to get some sleep, eat breakfast and continue the drive. I remember being in college with barely any money for groceries, let alone a hotel room. Instantly, her perky tits flashed into my mind and the memory of feeling her pussy lips through her boxer shorts that morning a year ago came flooding back to me. 

The thought of her staying a night at my apartment consumed me. My mind imagined all of the ways I wanted to rip her clothes off, suck her tits and fuck her. Right on the couch? Will she want to take a shower? Should I answer the door naked? We still weren't good enough friends to talk regularly but comfortable enough with each other that asking to stay in my spare bedroom wasn't a crazy request. The next thing I heard from her was that she was leaving Texas and that she could be at my apartment around 2am. 

When she got here, we hugged and I helped her with her bag. I showed her to the guest bedroom and asked if she wanted anything. She asked for a glass of wine and closed the door to change. I poured two glasses and sat on the couch, waiting for her to come out. When she walked around the corner she was in the pajamas that had turned me on for so many years. A baggy t-shirt with no bra and boxer shorts. I immediately looked down at her boobs that were gently swaying as she walked over to the couch and sat next to me. She thanked me again for letting her stay, took a sip of wine and we started catching up. How was the drive? It was good. Tell me about this internship. It's at some newspaper that will look really good on my resume. She asked me about the breakup with the fiancé. I explained how we came to the decision and how we parted ways. She says she's so sorry I had to go through that and leans in to give me a hug. She puts her hand on the back of my neck and kisses my cheek. When she pulls away, we look into each other's eyes and she says ""You know I was disappointed how that morning over Memorial Day ended"". I finish my second glass of wine, and say ""Me too."" She puts her hand on my thigh and leans in and kisses me.

I put my hand on her cheek and kiss her harder. My dick immediately starts getting hard. She slips her tongue into my mouth and digs her fingers into my thigh. After a minute or two of sucking on her tongue and feeling her rub my leg, she stands up, finishes her wine, grabs my hands and leads me into the guest bedroom. My rock hard erection is bulging against my pants. She leads me to the bed where I lay on my back, she grabs my waistband and pulls it down around my knees, revealing my cock. She immediately grabs it with her warm hand and starts to suck it. Her tongue massages and licks up and down my dick. I see her hand move to between her legs and she starts rubbing her pussy. I can imagine how wet, perfectly hairless her lips are. After another minute of licking and kissing my cock, she leans up and takes her shirt off. This is my first look at her perfect tits, they're perfectly perky with hard nipples, perfectly round with just enough sway to know they're real. I sit up and start to lick her tits, popping the nipple in and out of my mouth with my tongue, grabbing and massaging them with my hands. Kneading and rubbing them as she arches her back and lets out a moan. 

Then she stands up, slides her shorts off and sits back down on my lap perfectly placing my dick between her pussy lips, grinding her lips over the length of my dick. She closes her eyes, massages her own tits with her left hand and presses my cock against her clit with her right. I can feel her juices making me wet. I grab her ass and press my dick harder onto her clit, making her gasp and she grinds harder into me. Finally, I've had enough. I sit up, gently push her onto the bed, stand up and let my shorts fall to the ground. I lean over her and start licking her boobs again as she grabs my dick and slides it into her. She's extremely wet and I push my cock all the way into her just as she lets out a loud moan. She whispers into my ear ""Fuck me"" and I pull all the way out and push my dick all the way back in. She grabs my hips and starts ramming my dick into her, hard and deep, faster and faster. She moves her hands to her clit and she starts rubbing in circular motions. I start massaging her chest and watch her tits bounce every time I slide my cock into her increasingly wet pussy.

Her eyes are still closed, just moaning and rubbing her fingers between her pussy lips. She looks at me a whispers ""I'm cumming"". I lean down to lick her hard nipples and keep the pace of fucking her, all the way in and all the way out. Suddenly she lets out a scream and I feel her pussy tightening on my dick. I watch her chest heave as she cums and her tits bounce up and down every time I push my dick into her. She opens her eyes, leans up to kiss me and grabs my hips again and starts ramming me deep into her again. I can only stand one more second before I pull out and unload onto her belly. 

I fall onto my side next to her as she let's out a loud sigh and starts laughing. I start laughing too and we just lay there for a long time just staring at each others bodies. 

The next morning, I cook her breakfast and as we're hugging good bye, we start fucking once more. But that's a story for another time."
8yzkgr,1,2018-07-15,A must read checklist before applying for top universities in Dubai-,Eduuae,u_Eduuae,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Eduuae/comments/8yzkgr/a_must_read_checklist_before_applying_for_top/,"https://i.redd.it/4lgx8s4it1a11.png

The city of Dubai has emerged as an educational hub in the United Arab Emirates. Taking into account the huge influx of immigrants, many foreign universities have opened their campus in Dubai. This has helped in the establishment of **top universities in Dubai** with an academic system on a par with western standards. These globally recognized educational institutions provide flourishing career opportunities to people all over the UAE.

Choosing the right university is of course a massive task. After all, this is a commitment that’s likely to demand at least three years of your life, and probably a significant amount of money. Picking among the long [**list of universities in Dubai**](https://www.eduuae.ae/universities/dubai/), with only a vague idea, is a real challenge**.** Even if you already have an idea or know for sure what you want to do in the future, there are many factors you should consider before making a decision about which university to choose.

 In order to make your journey towards finding the **best university in Dubai** a little less challenging. Here is the checklist of few of the things that you might consider, that will help you from the start of your search:

**Checklist:**

1.**University accreditation:**  


The wide range of academic programmes offered by National and International universities set up in Dubai open to both nationals and expatriates. You need to check for the official accreditations which are done by Commission of Academic Accreditation (CAA) before you join the university.

**2.** **Placement Policy:**

Student placements are an essential part of many undergraduate programmes and postgraduate research projects, providing students with valuable work experience in their chosen disciplines. It’s important to check the placement policy of the university and ask them about the jobs that recent graduates have obtained. These institutions should also have internship programmes where you can apply skills or career service that helps you to get trained for job interviews.

**3.** **Infrastructure Facilities:**

No doubt the [Top universities of UAE](https://www.eduuae.ae/universities/dubai/) have world class infrastructure and facilities. The university campus should provide an excellent range of facilities from high tech classrooms and laboratories to multi-mix food outlets and sports facilities. This will help students enjoy a campus life that's stimulating, interesting and full of new opportunities. The availability of student accommodation may also become an important factor in your decision. It is essential to check if the place is nice and friendly, somewhere you can call your “home”.

**4.** **Check About the courses Available:**

 You can check the courses available on the university website. If there’s an area within the subject you’re particularly interested in, check whether the university has it “on its menu” or you can contact the university directly. Some Universities will even let you take modules from other subjects. For example, a degree in [English](https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/courses/english/), for example, might let you branch out into other areas of the humanities.

**5.** **Scholarships:**

Scholarships encourage students to excel in their coursework and students become valuable participants in extracurricular and community activities. These scholarships provide support to highly motivated and academically strong students based on your scholastic and extracurricular achievement.

**6.** **Reviews form students:**

Student reviews will help us in knowing how the overall academic and student experience have benefited their personal development. Doing this extra bit of research could help you find out about issues that might affect your university choice.

There might be other factors as well that might influence your decision. It’s all about making sure you know what you want from your course, about deciding what's right for you. It is also important to mention that whichever university you end up at, whether it was your first choice or not, you will still have a life-changing and exciting few years. Finally, remember that choosing the right university is not easy and it takes time so don't rush it."

I know you have received hundreds upon hundreds of these over the last week but I wanted to say something as the video for your 10 years has been released.

First of all Thankyou to all of you in general, you guys are amazing in every way. The way you make me laugh or even cry (sad and happy) is incredible. From Simon lighting fires and Lewis putting them out to now a large company with fire sprinklers to avoid fires all together (Simon has a way...).

Lewis &amp; Simon, the pair of you deserve a big thanks for all the amazing ideas you guys have thought up but also put into practice. It wouldn’t be the same without you, you are the company and deserve the upmost respect and thanks!

Turps you amazing talker, you allowed them to become who they are today. Through your “business development” and your other many talents have allowed the Yogscast to become who they are today. Thankyou very, very much.

Other content creators, you guys continue to make me laugh. Through the little smartass comments made my Sjin or the running jokes continued from other series over the years. I can’t name all of you as there are too many to thank  so as a whole you are very much appreciated.

Behind the scenes staff ; quirky, funny and skilled in so many ways. The way you work is incredible making the videos enjoyable and easy to watch, making thumbnails look amazing or even the intern making coffees and vacuuming? Anyway Thankyou for all your effort towards the Yogscast. 

So there it is my personal thanks for the entire Yogscast company. I really hope to meet you all one day.

My deepest thanks,

Will :)

So we've been together like 1.5 years, throwaway for obvious reasons. We are currently long distance as I am living with family for the summer. 

The last few conversations we have had have been exhausting, as he always finds a way to blame me for something/talk crap about my family. He doesn't understand my culture/family life, and I think this has something to do with his background (coming from a broken family). Although he doesn't understand these kinds of things (like that family always comes first), he chooses instead to vocally disagree/argue with me about it. It's very draining, as I don't think it's his place to necessarily make any such direct comments about my family. 

And it's not like there aren't things I could do for our relationship while long distance, but we had both agreed this was a time for both of us to focus and grow on our own (I have an internship I'm really excited about and have summer classes). He seems to think he should always be my absolute #1 priority, regardless of family, school, or work. And he was my priority for all of this last year, which sort of screwed me over in a lot of aspects because I was too dependent (hence why we agreed that his time apart should be seen as beneficial). 

During the last convo we had, he started up again with telling me I'm not doing anything to contribute to the relationship, how he doesn't agree with my family, etc. I tend to always try to stay on the positive side of things (because long distance is hard enough without laying on whatever issues we think there may be). I ended up saying I had to go, and he has made no effort to contact me over the last two days, which makes me think he doesn't care about reconciling the issue. 

Which brings me to my current situation. I think because of recent events, coupled with the fact that I don't feel that he is being supportive of me, I should end the relationship. However, I don't know how to go about it because we are still long distance, and of course I don't want to break up over text. How should I go about this in a respectful way?

tldr; my relationship is no longer supporting my life, and is stressing me out, so I think the right thing to do is to end the relationship. However, I don't know what the most respectable way to do this is, because we are currently long distance and I won't be back for another two months. (and I don't want to do it over text)."

8z0p7x,3,2018-07-15,"Thank you, from an 18 yr old!! (warning, a rant)",youwhinet00much,MGTOW,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/8z0p7x/thank_you_from_an_18_yr_old_warning_a_rant/,"tl;dr:

My mom is an AWALT. I'm only 18 and I've been accused of both beating up and groping girls already in my life. My strategy is to pretend to please women and be their beta cuck simp soyboy whiteknight orbitter, because I've already seen the risk of not doing so is too great in this society where women can just scream ""rapeeee"". And thank you all for helping me see the evils of female nature.

# thanks guys!!

I'm 18 and I don't know whether to consider myself a ""Tyrone"" or an ""incel"" (as you people say). Im tall, about 6'3"", with an ugly face, but girls flock to me because I am dominant socially and tend to be the leader in social situations, But owhenever I'm put in situations where I don't get to establish myself socially, girl's actions begin to change. Long story short, I've had two major situations in my life where girls have falsely accused me of serious shit. One where a girl accused me of beating her up in a closet in middle school, told my whole grade and all the teachers, nearly got me kicked out of school. They couldn't find any proof I actually hit her, but they all believed it obviously (I mean who are they gonna believe, scary tall black man or sweet innocent dainty white girl?). And another, less serious one, where a girl I used to be friends (I used to actually see her as a friend, and had no romantic interest in her, but she probably saw me as her beta cuck orbitter) with claimed ""I touched her innappropriately"" (didnt report me or anything, just told my entire friend group) after not speaking to her for a month. Then I come to find out this girl has done this to another friend of mine and when I hear the real reason xhes mad at me is cuz ""I never hang out with her"" and because ""Im a fake friend and only talk to her when its convenient"". (Of course, we all know this girl didn't care about me. I've literally heard about this girl telling people she only hangs out with me because of the way I'm very popular with people, so naturally it gives her social status). So when I stop talking to her (literally only cuz I was busy with classes), naturally she sees no benefit in continuing to associate me, and her ego is too big to face the fact that I don't want to be another one of her simp friends (I mean this girl is considered to be very attractive and has at least 5 simps following her at a time), and she says some fake shit. And these aren't even girls I'm ROMANTICALLY involved with, so imagine how bad it would be if I was.

And its so funny how girls see me and pay no attention to me, but after I've been in a room for an hour and established myself socially, they all start flocking. And you can even see the tendencies of women you people talk about in girls I have flings with. For example, flaking if they find a better deal, complaining for 2 hours  about their problems but if you dare talk about your own problems all you get is a ""there there"", a disinterested or uncomfortable look, then she cuts you off and talks about herself again, all the double standards..etc.

I even see these behaviors in my own mom tbh. All the shaming tactcs and physical abuse (that ironically started to end when I got bigger then her, what a coincidence) made me feel like I was a bad person for years. And whenever I bring it up she tries to shame me more ""hOw cOuLd yOu sAy tHaT aFtEr aLl iVe dOnE fOr yOu?"", and pretends like all the shit she put me through growing up never happened.

I grew up in a Catholic household, so if I tell my mom I don't want to get married, she says ""its your responsibility as a Christian to get married and have a family, and if you don't you're being an irresponsible bum. If a man doesn't get married he'ss being irresponsible, but not a woman, because what if no one asks her to marry?"" There it goes, all the dumb double standards, and societal idea that they're trying to teach me that basically boils down to give a woman what you want or you're a bad person.

I know there is no point in talking to my mom, or any women, about my perspective, or why I wouldn't want to get married, or the shit I went through as a child, because they really don't care, or they'll pretend to care if they see a benefit in getting closer to me. Most women would just shame me for having a weakness anyway. But for some strange reason, I still want to. Probably just my blue pilled programming. So I just plan to smile and pretend like I'm still plugged in, because I have learned girls knowing I won't be their orbitter if they find me too ugly to fuck infuriates them, and the idea of refusing to marry and pumping and dumping infuriates the white knights and women. I just plan to get into LTRs for show to pretend like I'm looking to get married. I'm currently a student at an ivy league school,, and I'm working a very lucrative internship this summer after my freshman year, so I'm already on a path to be very successful AKA have too much to risk by getting married. All the while covertly showing men the ways of MGTOW by giving them firsthand experience. (I have so many friends my age putting up with bullshit and I wish I could help them without being called a misogynist).

So thank you to subs and videos like these for helping me put the pieces together on why women infuriate me so much. Thank you for allowing me to further see female nature for what it truly is. I was already kind of seeing it clearly, but it would have been at least 3-4 years before I had come up with the answers on my own. (Like I said, I was born too ugly to be a beta cuck provider, but charismatic and socially dominant enough to be considered a Tyrone, so I've experienced firsthand how women treat both Chads and Incels, so it allowed me to see female nature for what it really is faster than most people my age, but this sub and a Youtube channel called AlphaMaleStrategies accelerated my understanding). SO thanks guys, even though y'all have this strange need to refer to black Chads as Tyrones (like why do we have to be separated out? Why can't we just be Chads lol?)"

I recently graduated from college pursuing a Computer Engineering degree with little working experience (last summer programming and this year just networking related stuff to see what interests me. I'm leaning towards more hands on work, little programming). However, it's just for this summer. I get released around August. 

I'm interested in working for the MTA, even if it's just an internship. I explored around through the MTA career services, and most jobs require a civil service exam or X amount of years experience/trade work. Internships I key-worded requires undergrad students, pursuing a degree within Mechanical/Electrical, etc.  I would like any advice on obtaining a position within MTA. Please and Thank you!"
8z29hn,102,2018-07-15,"I (20 F) think my relationship with fuck buddy (24 M) has suddenly become a lot less casual, but I am unsure about how to bring up the ""define the relationship"" conversation. Any advice?",couplandgenx,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8z29hn/i_20_f_think_my_relationship_with_fuck_buddy_24_m/,"I am going to try and make this as concise as possible. I started sleeping with this guy (let's call him S) around 6 months ago. It started out very casual (we didn't know each other, we met at a party, we would meet up once every three weeks, if even that). But now I think the relationship has snowballed into something not casual at all... Let me just begin by saying, I certainly would not mind dating him, I just have trouble bringing it up. 

Why I think this is not casual anymore: 

1) I spend almost every night at his place. At least four nights a week. Sometimes we don't even have sex, we just cuddle and watch a movie in bed together. 

2) If it is the weekend (i.e., I don't have school and he doesn't have work), we always go get brunch together, or go do something (walk around the neighborhood, etc.) I usually spend the whole day with him just doing whatever. We've also go to the movies together pretty regularly. 

3) He's starting to introduce me to all of his friends. Seriously. He would always text me to go to a party so I can meet his friends. The latest time, a guy at the party was pretty wasted and yelled at him (about me) IS THIS YOUR GIRLFRIEND??? But his response was ""Uh.... I don't think so?"" He didn't seem upset by the question, just genuinely confused and taken aback. A similar incident is when S took me to grab drinks with his coworkers after hours, and one of his coworkers excitedly asked me how I know S, because apparently he had been talking about me and he seemed to really like me. 

4) He literally showers me in compliments, LOL. It's the nicest thing, he would just tell me over and over how much he likes me, how he finds me attractive, etc. 

5) I was out of town for 6 weeks when I had an internship in a different city; at this point we'd been hanging out a lot already, but I still figured he only saw me as a fuck buddy and porbably wouldn't contact me until I was back in town. Instead, we texted almost every day. I think this is when I realized I wouldn't mind being official with him: I was excited about my internship but also really looked forward to returning to the city. 

6) Similar to point 5... He's drunkenly told me before he didn't want to have sex with anybody else, but I didn't take it seriously. When I came back from my internship, I asked him if he hooked up with anyone else when I was away, fully expecting him to say yes, but he said he didn't. I was surprised but also not that surprised... We never discussed exclusivity but I definitely stopped sleeping with other people and he's hinted at it a few times that he did too as well. 

7) My best friend likes him. This sounds so silly but it is honestly such an important point for me. My best friend has always been very protective of me and has basically hated every single person I've slept with. My best friend is completely different with S. I introduced them at a party, and my best friend kept telling me how I should ""lock it down"" because S was looking in my direction the entire night and he clearly liked me.  

Why I am hesitant to bring it up: 

1) The biggest thing is that I am taking a leave of absence next year for various reasons, so we will not be in the same city. I do not think it's fair to spring this on him... long distance relationship seems unrealistic, and I don't want to make him ""wait"" per se, but I know I'd be very crushed if, after a year and I come back to town, he has already found someone. 

2) I have never been in a relationship before. I came to college pretty much a messy party girl (although I've since gotten my act together) so I didn't really have the time or emotional stability to be in a serious relationship. What short flings I had all ended in disaster. He's the opposite: he dated a girl for three years in high school, another girl for three years in college, and then another girl for two years after that. He seems to be a serial monogamist, but from what I've heard he had a really bad breakup with his most recent ex, and I'm guessing that's why we initially started hooking up: I was the rebound. It's not a big deal, but our dating history is so different, I'm kind of scared it won't work out, and it wouldn't be worth it ruining what we have right now. 

TL;DR: I think my relationship with fuck buddy became kind of serious without either of us even realizing. I'm hesitant to bring it up because we are not in the best situation to date, as I am leaving the country for a year. However, I definitely like him. I don't know how to assess the situation as I don't want to ruin the balance of what we have now. What to do? "

As I stared into those brown eyes, she spoke. It was barely above a whisper but every word was heard clearly.

*""Be gentle...I'm very tight.""*

---------------------------------

So this is going to be a weird story but I had to tell it as it has been weighing on me. I'm going to try and format it as best I can but I apologize for any jumps. 

A little over a month ago, we hired an intern from a local college. This was something that I've pushed for every year I've been employed with my company but I was always told no. Imagine my surprise when on a Wednesday they told me my intern was going to start on Friday. I wasn't consulted. Never saw a resume. I didn't have a name until Friday morning. But whatever. I work in a chaotic environment and this would be easy to deal with. There have been much grander challenges thrown my way.

I meet the intern on Friday and she's great. She's incredibly smart (way overqualified for what I was going to have her do), personable, and charming. I was given her resume that morning and learned as much as I could about her so it wasn't *too* awkward when we met. After the formal introductions, the day was spent mostly just showing Karen (the intern) around the workplace, introducing her to people, taking her to lunch to get to know her, and setting up her workstation with our IT department, you know, the usual orientation style stuff. 

I would be at fault if I didn't mention Karen as being attractive. She was (and I guess still is) a volleyball player and her body reflected that. She was thin and toned everywhere, her skirt showing off her athletic calves and thighs while also highlighting her serious ass. Her blouse showed a pair of small B cups and the white nail polish clashing with her dark skin complimented her look well. Her hair was tight in a weave that I'm certain was her preferred look due to years of sports.

Our conversations were good but it just seemed like there was some awkwardness between us. One minute she was confident and bositerous and the next she was timid and shy. I chalked it up to a millenial/lack of job experience thing and thought nothing of it. This was her first ""real"" job opportunity and I don't think she was used to being around so many older individuals. My company tends to be more senior in nature with me being one of the younger employees.

Two weeks go by and everything is great. I basically leave her be for days at a time then check in to see how the projects are going. She has taken to the work like a fish in water and minus my interruptions to force her to network with other colleagues, she's perfect. While we had a good ""boss""/employee relationship going on, there wasn't any personal talks. If I asked how her weekend went, I got a ""good"" or ""uneventful"". If I asked about the world cup (as she wore a pin for a particular country), she'd respond with ""it's a fun time of year."" I wasn't asking to be best friends but with the informal nature of our office, it was noticeable how reserved she was being.

One of my closer friends at my company, Sage, had taken a liking to the girl and they had quickly become very chummy. Sage would chat with her and then share any 'fun' stories with me, just so I could hear about her being a human being as opposed to my ""underling"" and honestly, the work is dry so any gossip is worthwhile. Sage had a fun tidbit for me.

Sage told me that Karen was not 22, as she said, but actually 20. She was graduating early and embelished her age as other organizations dismissed her as being too young. She had bought a fake ID for bars (through some website that we browsed for a few hours as jealousy took hold. I remember just handing a photo of ourselves and cash to a stranger and receiving a weird name and address in return) and I guess she used that for her HR forms or our HR team didn't notice the discrepency (that's more likely. They're a mess). I was honestly more upset that we didn't background check compared to the fact that she had lied about her age. She's a minority woman and anything that she can do to get a leg up is worthwhile. She was clearly qualified and I was glad to have her around. This information, while juicy, didn't particularly do anything for me so it was fun to know but basically useless.

Things went off the rails that weekend though. I went to a new bar in my city that was basically a food court that younger people frequent. I'm 29 but there's a clear disconnect between my age and the 22 year old's running around here but I was told I had to eat there and I was glad I did. The food was amazing. But I'll save that for a different subreddit. 

Lo and behold, I spot Karen out with some people I've never seen before. She's sitting at the bar drinking some blue/orange concoction and laughing and having fun. I'm not going to butt in and rain on her parade so I chalk this spotting up as gossip for Sage and finish my beer with the group I went with. 

She eventually got up to use the restroom and I couldn't help but check her out. She wore this short white dress that looked like the designer outfit of the bedsheet toga's you'd wear to parties in college. She was stunning and I wasn't the only one to be caught making eyes at her. It's always so weird (to me at least) to see people you only see professionally live a little.

On her way back from the restroom however, she saw me. I didn't know this at the time but learned it later. It became apparent that she was aware of me being here as while she sat at the bar, she was constantly turning her head and body to look at me and see if I was aware of her.

Eventually we made eye contact and Karen physically shrank in her seat. I learned later that Sage had told her that I was aware of her real age and her being spotted had her thinking she was going to be fired for one, lying and two, drinking as an underage person. After making eye contact, we did that weird thing where you look away like you're both guilty and when I looked back a few minutes later, she had left. I actually felt bad as I didn't want to be the cause of ruining her night but I also didn't want to text her to say so as that would probably be more embarrassing. 

On Monday, I share the story with Sage and we laugh. When Karen came in, it was like a switch had flipped for the girl. For the prior two weeks, she had dressed mostly professionally. But Monday, she wore a skirt that was an inch from being too short. We have standing desks at work and I know for a fact she didn't sit all day. Not because she didn't want to, but because she would have given more of a show than she was ready for. I made a comment to Sage and another coworker as I was unsure how to proceed. We figured it was a one-off type of deal.

Karen also made a point in our check-in to ask how my weekend was. We chatted about the restaurant, she blushed, but I didn't mention anything else. My mind actually raced to one of those porno ""what will it take for you not to say anything"" scenes and I did not want that to even be an option of a sentence for her.

On Tuesday, we dressed way down to do some community outreach. The standard fair was a t-shirt and jeans. I volunteered to work outside (which was dumb. It was so hot) painting and repairing a playground that was in disarray. I was rocking a grey shirt and basketball shorts. She was wearing a tight white t-shirt that outlined her sports bra and jeans that must have been a fight to get on. While there were other coworkers with us, we mostly worked in pairs and try as I might to ger her to meet other people, we kept getting stuck together. 

At work, I'm always in a suit and I don't really interact with my colleagues outside the office so seeing me dressed differently is typically a shock to most people. I like to dress as down and comfortably as possible. If it was any more down, you'd be offering me money on the street. I guess it helps me be ""incognito"". But I digress. 

Karen kept her eyes on me all damn day. Whenever it was just us, she would brush against me or make double entedres straight out of a bad porno like ""you can be rougher with that hoe, I know you can"" as I worked the ground. There would be a laugh after it like we were friends making old jokes but we had never gotten to the friend stage so getting to the dirty joke stage was weird. The touching I didn't think of risque in the moment as it was always a hand to be helped up or her hand on my shoulder for support but that was me being niave.

After the day of service, we were filthy. Just caked in sweat, dirt, dust, and paint. We organized our crew to have a happy hour in the office as while we all earned a beer, we didn't think a bar would want us in our state. Drinking in the office had everyone having fun and the few of us that didn't have to drive or could Uber home, took advantage of the fact. There were five of us. Sage, myself, Karen, another intern, and Sami. Sami and the other intern were pretty much doing their own thing, talking local politics. Sage was waiting for her wife so they could walk home together and was basically just reading memes on her phone. Karen didn't drink. She had water and maybe a La Croix but no alcohol. I had all the alcohol.

""Sorry if I disappointed you the other day..."" Karen said during a lull in the action.

The puzzled look on my face made her clarify.

""You know, at the marketplace...""

I laughed. I assured her that's nothing and water under the bridge. We ended up having the chat that her and Sage (and then, Sage and I) had about the ID website and such. This led to sharing dumb college stories and she made sure that her hand would touch my forearm with each joke. Sage picked up on it before leaving but told me later that I was a ""grown man"" and could ""do what you want.""

Wednesday was not any better. Her outfit. Dear lord. It was a black and blue striped skirt that thankfully went to her knees but was body tight. Nothing was left to the imagination. Her top was a modest ivory top with a blazer that paired was perfectly respectful of the workplace but when it got 'hot', that top was anything but appropriate. Due to the labor of the previous day, a lot of people were working from home. There were maybe seven of us in the entire building. She stood in the doorframe of my office with her back against the frame. She brought her leg up so the bottom of her foot was against the frame and it caused the arch of her back to *just* curve off the frame. I swear I've seen Angelina Jolie do it in some movie.

""Seems pretty dead in here today. Any *hard* assignments I can help with today?""

She accentuated the word *hard* and the sweat started to form on my brow in my air conditioned office. I had ""prepared"" for this escalation by having an actual tough assignment ready for her. There was some dismay in her face when I started talking jargon but she was not broken. After she settled back at her station, I immiediately left my office.

Things were getting so out of control that I went to HR to make a formal record that I was uncomfortable with her attire and advances. I even had a witness back me up. Don't get me wrong. This woman was incredible. Sexy, forward, young. At a bar, I wouldn't have given this a second thought.

But I have bills to pay and while I oogle every woman I see and enjoy the rougher side of things in the bedroom, I was not going to risk my career. 

But sex is such an odd topic. Some people don't want to hear about it. I mentioned this scenario to some friends and they were like ""so ya fucked her on your desk, right?"". I needed an outlet. Enter Stephany.

Stephany was a former FWB/quasi-girlfriend from the past year and while we no longer hooked up, we remained good friends. The whole relationship aspect fizzled because she would do anything I asked. Which sounds great but eventually the fun wears off when you realize she's not into it but only performing for you. That wasn't fair to her and since my likes are more left-field than most, I didn't want to subject her to that.

I texted her that I needed her ear and she joked that was one hole I hadn't been in. She's a great friend. We got a drink Wednesday night.

As we sat at the bar and chatted, she could tell that I was actually conflicted about what was going on. I could paraphrase the psychoanalysis that she subjected me to but that's not really important. She jokingly suggested that I needed a surrogate to get my attraction to her out of my system. We scanned the bar but being a Wednesday, the crowd wasn't exactly the A-Team. Rather bluntly she asked if I wanted to ""bang it out"". I wasn't sure if that was the answer but who was I to say no?

As we barged into my home, we quickly embraced in a liplock that was forged from familiarity. Stephany licked and nipped at my earlobe and i moaned her name. She instantly stopped and looked into my eyes.

""No."" She grabbed my hand and outstretcthed my index finger to poke her in the chest. ""Tonight, I'm Karen.""

I felt my knees buckle and didn't need further instruction. I immediately grabbed her and turned her, pushing her face against the door we just walked in from. While Stephany was being Karen, I knew what I could and could not do to her. We didn't have to cover our bases or establish a safeword. I didn't have to ask if she was clean or how hard I could smack her face.

With her cheek pressed against the peep hole, my hand came down on her jean covered ass. She yelped on the first hit and the peephole dug into her skin. I pressed my chin against her ear and started to whisper.

""You thought you could tease me? At work!?"" I snarled, another hard slap coming down on her ass. I grabbed at her waist and belt loop and dragged her pants off her hips. This is the only thing I regret as I popped a belt loop and it definitely wasn't comfortable. I could have done a better job unfastening and unzipping the jeans.

The thong covering her holes was pushed to the side bluntly as my fingers started to push and prod at her body. Two fingers quickly found their way into her wet pussy as my forearm held her by the neck against the door.

""So what is it? You want to sleep your way up the ladder or are you just a slut?"" I growled, my fingers causing a whimper to escape her lips. She answered but I couldn't hear her. I asked her to speak up but it was the same result. Loosening my grip around her neck she coughed and looked to the ground. Pulling out of her cunt, my hand found her bare ass for the first time and I let her have it. Three hard strikes and she breathed out ""both"".

""On the ground. Now"". I ordered, stepping back and undressing as she fell to her knees. As I stepped back, she went completely commando to the floor, her stomach hugging the hardwood. I moved to the sofa, sitting down and told her to crawl. Propping herself on her elbows, she crawled two feet to the carpet when I motioned for her to come around under the coffee table.

""So you want to be a professional? Let me see if your mouth is even worth keeping around, let alone hiring full-time."" I slipped off the sofa onto my knees, my cock bobbing in front of her mouth under the table. The table was glass and as we made eye contact, she lowered her mouth over every inch I gave her. 

She didn't blow me like a whore or a slut or even like Stephany used to. She was Karen and this was the blowjob she imagined Karen would give.

The glass separating us created two different worlds and while I was staring into the eyes of a woman who had sucked me dry 100's of times, I was in the mouth of a complete stranger.

Every flick of her tongue, every time she bottomed out, the look in her eyes, I was seeing a different person.

The positioning and table left her mostly in control as I couldn't face-fuck her due to the table edge but for once, I was fine relenting.

I couldn't tell you how long the blowjob lasted before I emerged from my trance and grabbed her under the table by her hair. I pulled her under towards the sofa, her body and back bouncing against the frame of the table before I threw her on the couch.

She turned and laid on her stomach as while she was 'Karen', Stephany knew my favorite position was prone. I climbed behind her and placed my cock against her waiting lips.

""Wait"" she whispered.

I had never been told to wait and thought maybe she was laying on a remote or something.

She looked over her shoulder to ensure she had my attention as she guided my cock toward her pussy. As I stared into those brown eyes, she spoke. It was barely above a whisper but every word was heard clearly.

*""Be gentle...I'm very tight.""*

Those five words unleashed a primal awakening within me. As my head slid between her pussy lips, I grabbed her around the forearms and plunged my length into her with one fell swoop. Her back arched and her hips pressed against the blue cushions as her fingers intertwined with the blanket left on the sofa. Two weeks of pent up frustrations with a twenty year old intern were taken out on another woman's cunt.

All she could do under me was take it. There was no end in sight and her small body was no match for me or the leverage I had. She would try to moan but the sofa or blanket would muffle the noise. The same when she tried to catch her breath. My rythym was all over the place. For a few minutes, I would be fucking her pussy like I was trying to make the neighbors call the police for abuse. The next few, I was hitting her with long, deep strokes like I wanted to find her stomach. Throughout all of this, I never let go of her forearms.

She kept the act up, saying more things to make me think it was Karen I was fucking but honestly, I don't remember what it was. All I could think about was my cock fucking her pussy. I eventually flooded her with cum and we fooled around a little more that night.

Going to work was strange. Pretending to fuck someone and then seeing them is *not* a solution. If anything, it made my intensity towards her more. Thursday and Friday we were in a conference so the interactions were normal.

But I only have one more week with her and after that, she's no longer an intern.

Regina was running late.  It wasn’t necessarily abnormal for her, but it was problematic on her first day at college.  She wasn’t the brightest of students, one of the reasons she was attending Willoughby Academy, a specialty college in backwoods Massachusetts rather than some ‘real college’—as she called—anywhere else.  She’d been dropped off the night before, having already missed the first day of move-in and campus orientation, since her mother had been called into work and later caught in traffic.  Regina wasn’t really mad about that, but it was one more thing frustrate her with her mother.  Somehow, it was apparently still Regina’s fault in her mother’s eyes.  That night, she was ushered right up to a temporary dorm room.  Today was academic orientation.  She’d be assigned a roommate, a room, and move forward from there.  Regina had hoped to make a good impression, especially as her mother made a big point about the strings that had been pulled to get her into Willoughby.

“I know you think you’re missing out,” she’d told her in about twenty different ways in the ride up from Pennsylvania, “but I’ve been assured that Willoughby not only produces model students, but their placement into good internships and jobs, is well-above 75%.”  Regina hadn’t really cared.  She was under the impression this was some sort of junior college, a commuter school, maybe—she hadn’t done much research—so the idea of having some semblance of ‘real’ college life was all she really cared about.  She’d gone to college parties a lot in her junior and senior years of high school, probably one of the many reasons she barely graduated, but the parties were fun, way more interesting than anything in high school…and the guys, well, she had no complaints there, either.  “Honestly, after being caught with those two boys in the high school pool…”  Regina suppressed a grin.  They weren’t even students at her high school.  They broke in over the summer, three weekends in a row, before finally being caught.  The fact that they’d been caught naked, and doing much more than swimming, had almost gotten them all arrested, until her mother pulled strings yet again.  “I honestly wish that you took sex seriously enough to not just have it on a lark….with anyone, at any time.”

""Things are different now, mom,” Regina said, “we just don’t…we’re not prudes.”  Regina was tired, certainly tired of arguing, and fell asleep for the remainder of the car ride.  Sex was an escape, an occasional weapon of rebellion against her mother, but not something she much worried about.  Her mother would’ve preferred a nineteen-year-old virgin sitting next to her, but she had Regina instead.  She barely recalled being led to her room after the car ride, her mother saying goodbye.  The room was stuff, making her head spin a little, though it was mostly exhaustion after the long car ride.  Still, she fell asleep more soundly than she ever remembered.

----

Regina finished brushing and tying back her hair, then hiked up her jeans, before heading out to the main hall and following the signs to orientation.  She walked up to a young woman in a business suit sitting behind a foldout table.

“Is this the orientation room?”  Regina asked.

“Yes,” the woman said stiffly, “and you’re late,” she looked her up and down, “and out of uniform.”  She pushed a clipboard across the table.  “Sign in here, go inside, take any seat you want.”

“Uniform?”  Regina muttered, writing her name and handing back the clipboard.

“You probably won’t be penalized too badly, but yes, all first year’s must wear uniforms—even during orientation.  Your acceptance materials explained all of this in detail.  And,” she added, “they explained this thoroughly *yesterday* as well.”  Regina smiled pleasantly, a trick she learned over the years that conveyed, well, anything but contradiction.  She had no idea about the school at all.  The materials her mother left on her bed a month or so ago had collected a fine layer of dust.  She looked it up on her phone, say it was in Massachusetts, in the woods, it looked like, and groaned at not going to someplace warmer.  Other than that, what did it matter?  Her mother had even filled out the application to Willoughby and written the essay for her.  She thanked the woman and pushed through the doors into the orientation room.  A few eyes turned in her direction, but most were looking to the tall blonde woman at the front of the class.  She wore a gray pencil skirt, black heels, and a white blouse with some frill at the collar and three-quarter sleeves.  Her blonde hair was tied back in tight bun, and she peered over her black-framed glasses as Regina walked in.  The glasses made her look older, though she was probably in her thirties, at best.

“Miss…?”  The woman asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Regina…um, Regina Trent.”  She sputtered.

“It is the first day of academic orientation, of course, but you are out of uniform—.”

“I’m sorry,” she said, moving toward an empty seat, “I didn’t know.  I didn’t arrive until last night…transportation issues.”  She added hastily.  Of the two dozen students in the room, all the guys were wearing dark gray suits with crisp white shirts, the lapels of the jackets and legs of the pants trimmed with maroon stripes.  The girls wore similar jackets, cut a little closer, with white shirts underneath, and a flared circle skirt, also dark grey with a maroon stripe circling the lower hem and tight waist.  She also noticed each girl was wearing dark hose and chunky black heels.  She rolled her eyes at the hose.  The uniform was passable, but having to wear hose every day…ugh.

“I appreciate your sincerity.”  The woman said.  “And I did *just* start, so I’ll begin again.”  She stood straighter, tapping her desk with her short nails.  “I am Ms. Corbin, Dean of Academics at Willoughby.  I am responsible for turning you into fine students, capable young adults, and worldly ones at that.  I rarely fail.  This is only partly due to my skill, the majority of success results from your own willingness to be better than person you were before you entered Willoughby grounds.  Oh, I know many of you are thinking that this college is a consolation prize, no Ivy League, no west coast sun, no Big 10 school, but I assure you Willoughby is elite in its own manner.  Some of you, no doubt, know this, and are aware of our sterling reputation.  All of you, in time, will come to realize the doors Willoughby can open for you.  Now, since we have a late arrival, she can assist me with the next part of orientation.”  Ms. Corbin opened a box on her desk, removing a few trays of bracelets.  “Miss Regina, please distribute these to the class.”  Regina moved quickly from her desk and took one of the trays and handed a bracelet to each student in the row.  Ms. Corbin did the same on the other side.  Finally, Regina took her own bracelet and sat at her seat again.  “Place the bracelet on your non-dominant wrist and click it closed.”  A series of loud clicks followed the command.  “This is your student ID, how you pay for things, how you are tracked, how you are monitored.  Some of you are already giving me looks.  You did not read your welcome package in your rooms.  Laziness, lack of curiosity, is no longer tolerated.  The bracelet is not much different from a fitness tracker, though it’s one you’ll find quite impossible to remove.”  Some people started tugging, though, Regina say quietly, simply glancing from her bracelet back to the dean.  “This is for your safety.  The nearest town is ten miles away through a thick forest dotted with occasional mires.  Wander off campus, and we will find you—eventually.  Students, thinking to have a beer or two in town, have found themselves lost in the woods for nearly 24 hours.  We can track you, but it’s not perfect off campus.  People have died…”  She said, ominously.  The class started muttering.  “Not in ten years or so…but still, fair warning.”  She laughed.

“But why,” a student raised his hand, “can’t they be removed?”

“Would you prefer to have someone wandering around buying things on your account, perhaps breaking the rules and pinning the blame on you, or for us not to know of your successes?  At Willoughby, we have learned from these past mistakes.”  She said.  “Also, of course, there is this…”  She held up her phone and tapped a button.  Regina felt her arm jolt, and her and the rest of the class yelped.  “Wakes you up, doesn’t it?  Before any of you think to call home to mummy or daddy, that was *not* a shock, it was neuro-response stimulation.  The bracelet can make you feel localized pain.  It is not an injury.  It cannot kill you, burn you, or any other variation.  It is pain at its worst, and a motivator at its best.  You cannot block it with cloth, or any other substance.  Feel free to try, though.  We’re always looking for bugs to fix.”  She gave a satisfied smile.  “In each twelve-hour school day, eight in the morning to eight in the evening, you are expected to be in uniform.  You are expected to sign up for five classes, one extracurricular activity, and spend at least one hour in the library each day.  For those of you weak in mathematics, that accounts for seven of your twelve hours.  The rest of the time is yours, more or less.  Your weekends are yours, more or less, and holidays, should you choose to stay on campus, are, of course, yours.  Fail to comply, though, and you will receive a reminder,” she tapped her phone, and everyone yelped once more, “every fifteen minutes until you report to a dorm master or someone affiliated with my office to correct the issues.  With that, your time at Willoughby has officially started.  You have thirty minutes to get to Auditorium A.  There, you will select your classes.  Dismissed.”  Everyone started moving out of the room, though Regina was taken by the arm by the dean.  “A moment or two, Miss Regina.”

“Yes, dean?”  She asked, as the other students filed out.  The dean held up a finger to silence her.

“Mr. Gunderson,” she said into her phone, “would you be so kind to bring a female uniform kit to the Orientation Room?  Size…”  She looked at Regina and guessed her sizes perfectly.  The voice on the other end said her would be there in five minutes.  “Now, since you’re going to be running a few minutes late to class selection, I can register your bracelet here.”  She tapped a few buttons on her phone, brought up a file on Regina, her picture already in it, and held her phone to the bracelet until they both beeped.  “There we go…now you exist in the system.”  She scrolled through some items.  “You’ll be in Crenshaw Dorm, room 211, second floor, bear left, and your roommate will be…”  She tapped a few more buttons.  “Kiera O’Grady.”  She held up a photo of a pale redheaded girl with glasses and freckles.  “You’d think she’s fresh off the boat from Ireland, wouldn’t you?  She’s from Minnesota.”  There was a knock at the door.  “Ah, Mr. Gunderson.”  A middle-aged man with slicked-back dark hair, a well-fitted suit, though a slight belly, walked into the room.  He held a brown box in his arms and set it on the desk.  The dean scanned the box with her phone, then tapped Regina’s wrist.  “Your account will be charged for this uniform.  You may purchase others at the college store.  We recommend at least three sets, though students, female students in particular, often find it more convenient to purchase more.”  She looked at her watch.  “Now, if you’d be so kind to get changed, I can lead you to Auditorium A so you don’t end up in all the terrible classes.”  She laughed.  “There are no terrible, classes, really.”

“Um, is there a bathroom nearby, or a closet?”  Regina asked.

“Oh, please, here, now, Miss Regina, you don’t have time to waste.”  Regina glanced at Mr. Gunderson, who stood there patiently, but expectantly.  “Don’t mind him.  He’s seen it all before.  Mr. Gunderson has been fitting Willoughby students with uniforms for nearly two decades.  What do you say, Mr. Gunderson, will Miss Regina have anything under her street clothes that will surprise you?”

“Not unless they’ve invented a new level of depravity since last semester.”  He chuckled.

“There, now, please get undressed, Miss Regina.  Mr. Gunderson will take your street clothes in the box up to your dorm room while you’re going about the rest of your day.”

“I just…this is really weird.”  Regina said.

“No,” Ms. Corbin said, “it is the way things are done.  Now, are you going to get dressed or do you need a reminder?”  She held up her phone.  Regina gave a slight frown.  The ‘shocks’ were just painful enough to be annoying, like getting snapped with a rubber band, but no one really volunteers for that feeling, do they?  She kicked off her sneakers, glanced once more at Mr. Gunderson, before turning her back to him and unbuttoning her jeans.  She slid down her jeans, stepping out of them, knowing Mr. Gunderson was getting a good look at her ass in her boyshorts, but there wasn’t much she could do.  She peeled off her t-shirt, then her socks, and gathered up the clothes, setting them on the desk.  “The bra and panties, too, Miss Regina.  Those are also part of the Willoughby uniform.”  Regina’s face went slack, but she quickly recognized the dean wasn’t kidding when she opened the uniform box and saw a bra and pair of underwear, each in separate labeled bags.  She took off her bra, keeping one arm over her breasts, then, with her free hand, pushed her underwear down in alternating left-to-right movements until she could step out of them.

“Lovely,” Mr. Gunderson said, “but nothing I haven’t seen before, truly.”  He stepped around Regina so he was standing next to the dean in front of her.  Regina kept a hand in front of her crotch, the other arm over her breasts.  Mr. Gunderson plucked the panties Regina’s hand, clamped in front of her pussy, and set them with the other clothes.  He then pulled open the bag with the bra and held it out to her.  “Let’s see if it fits.”  Regina took it from him, but realized she couldn’t keep doing this, keeping covered, hiding, and not waste all her time to choose classes.  She started to pull on the bra, adjusting the straps a bit, and was surprised to see it clasped in the front.  It was simple, with basic lace and some sheer panels.  Her pink nipples were visible through the fabric making up the top half of her cups, though she had to admit, as embarrassing as getting dressed like this was, the bra itself was well-made and comfortable.  Gunderson had the panties waiting for her when the bra was on.  They were low-cut, but appeared to offer full-coverage, also made out of the same mostly sheer lace of the bra.  She pulled them on quickly, and Ms. Corbin spoke, tapping at her phone.

“I made an appointment with you at the campus salon for five this afternoon.  They’ll trim up the loose ends on that ponytail of yours, and then they’ll get you cleaned up down below.”

“Excuse me?”  Regina said, making a face.

“The dress code may seem unorthodox, but regarding your pudenda, you may be fully covered, but groomed to no more than one-half inch of pubic hair, or you must be properly landscaped—with a triangle or landing strip above—with waxing below.  Most girls prefer waxing, as trimming is much more maintenance, but to each their own.  You are trimmed and not well-shaved, so thus, out of compliance.”  Regina blushed.  “You *really* do need to read your handbook over the next few days.  The dorm masters keep tabs on health and safety, proper grooming, among other things.”  Regina’s mind raced, but this was hardly something worth fighting about in the moment.  She’d already stripped in front of two complete strangers, and was still in revealing underwear.  Gunderson handed her a mass of nylon, the dark hose of the uniform, but as she moved to put them on, she saw that they were pull-up stockings.

“Line up the toe seam on the top of your toes and the heel seam at the back, and they should slip on smoothly, Miss.”  Gunderson said.  She’d never worn stockings except as part of sexy Halloween costume, and they certainly weren’t as nice as those in the uniform.  She pulled the first one on, adjusting it a few times, before the lacy stocking top fit at her thigh, then the other, a little easier with practice.  She was handed the blouse next, which was a collared v-neck, showing a little cleavage, but not much more.  It followed the contours of her body so well that she barely need to struggle to tuck in the tails when she stepped into the circle skirt.  The defined waist of the skirt was flattering, and she sort of wished there was a mirror in the room.  The jacket was the last bit, and she slipped it on, once again finding a near-perfect fit.  “You can come see me if you want particular tailoring.”  He leaned in conspiratorially.  “Don’t tell the dean,” he glanced in Ms. Corbin’s direction with a grin, “but some of the young women like a shorter hem or a closer fit on the blouse.”

“The administration is well-aware of your tinkering, Mr. Gunderson, and if your tailoring wasn’t so impeccable, the day might come where we may yet have words.”  The dean said.  Regina paused for a moment, watching Mr. Gunderson start to fold up her old clothes, including her underwear, and place them in the box.  “Slip on your shoes, and let’s go, Miss Regina.”  She did as the dean asked stepping into the shiny black shoes, and she followed behind the dean, her square heels clicking in unison with the blonde woman’s not-quite-stiletto heels.  “Auditorium A.”  The dean announced.  Go inside, start at station one, and work your way around to registration kiosks.  You’re actually about five minutes early, so you may have a chance at getting everything you want this semester.”  She left Regina in the doorway, and Regina went inside, talking to department heads and planning out her academics.  

----

After two hours, she had registered in a refresher math course, art, biology, history, and a philosophy course.  She saw the redheaded girl who was going to be her roommate and approached her.

“Hi, um, Kiera?”  The girl looked up at her.  “I’m Regina.  The dean, she let me know we’re going to be roommates.”

“Oh, wonderful…I get saddled with the girl who doesn’t know to show up in uniform, let alone on time…”

“I blame my mother.  She got us here very late last night, and, well, it really threw me off.  I’ll be better, I promise.”  Regina smiled, trying to be polite, even though Kiera had made no effort to do so.

“Yeah, my parents were ecstatic to finally get me out of the house, no more nerdy daughter making them feel dumb.  The joke is, you don’t go here to work your way toward an BA or BS, you go here to get your MRS…”

“Uh, what?”  Regina asked.

“To get married, dummy…MRS…missus…duh.  Look, many of you are here because you were crap students, but some are here because they’re troublemakers, or there’re others like me who don’t fit the norm their parents want.  Just because we’re sharing a room, don’t expect me to become a Barbie doll.”

“No problem.”  Regina said, smirking.  “I’m a brunette.  You want a Barbie, go talk to the dean.”

“No kidding.”  She said.  “Come on, Regina, let’s go get lunch.  We have to pick an extracurricular activity after one thirty.”  The girls went to the cafeteria.  On the way, she saw what turned out to be second year students.  They wore a similar uniform with dark blue stripes, rather than maroon, and there was little more variety in the cuts and styles.

“Wow,” Regina said, after sitting down at a table with Kiera, “when they said all first year’s had to wear uniforms, I thought that meant things changed later…but they’re still wearing uniforms, just slightly different.”

“They’re allowed to choose what they wear and in what combination.  Technically not a uniform, right?”  She bit into her sandwich.  “It’s silly, but we’ll probably come to appreciate the slight freedom next year.”

“My mom did not sell this place as a boarding school or whatever.  I was just expecting a slightly more upscale community college.”  Kiera almost spit out what she was eating, laughing.

“Oh, you’re fucking kidding me, do you even know where you are?  Willoughby is, like, the *best* specialty school in the northeast.  Your mom either was a student, is filthy rich, or has some very powerful friends to get you in here.”  She took a drink before continuing.  “Even with all of that, you had to show some talent to get in here, but yeah, sure, upscale *community* college.”  She laughed.

“Hey ladies,” a tall guy with loose brown curls sat next to Kiera across from Regina, “what are you laughing about?  I’m Nate, by the way.”

“Oh, my new roommate here was just comparing Willoughby to some pay-by-the-credit community college.”  Kiera said.  “Nice to meet you, Nate.”  She added.

“Well, I mean, you’re obviously new,” he said, looking at Regina, I mean, we all are, but wow, do you know nothing about Willoughby?”

“You weren’t in our orientation class.”  Regina said.

“There are 250 incoming students.  They don’t have a room big enough to fit us all…did you not read anything, really, about the school?”  He asked.  Regina shook her head.  “Look, I just came over here to see if…”   He looked to Kiera, and she supplied her name, “if Kiera was a natural red.”  Regina raised an eyebrow at the casualness of the rude comment.  “But you better have a long talk with your roommate, because this is not a normal school, and if you’re so oblivious to that, I’m not going to be the one to break it to you.  At least I had an older brother and sister who both went here, so I know, mostly, what to expect, but you?  Well…have fun.”  He smiled and started to stand.

“Wait,” Kiera said, she pulled him back down in his seat, “you wanted to know.”  She lifted up her skirt, and pulled out the waistband of her panties, letting Nate see the red curls between her legs.  Regina blushed a little, and she wasn’t getting nearly as good a look as the guy.  “Off you go.  It’s the first day…rules are rules.”  Nate nodded and Kiera straightened her clothes, going back to her sandwich.

“I can’t believe you just flashed that guy.”  Regina said.

“He asked.”

“Well, it’ a good thing he didn’t ask you to blow him.”  Regina muttered.

“No sex on the first day.  What the heck did you think I meant by ‘rules are rules’?”

“I know this school is, well, odd, but seriously, you just flashed that guy, weren’t even shy about it, and all…I mean…I don’t *know* what I mean.”  She blushed.

“I don’t know where *you* grew up, but from eighteen onward, if a guy asks you for something you give it to him.  Willoughby has the First Day Rule, because otherwise, we’d probably all be fucking each other rather than registering for classes or finding out where the library is, but yeah, if Nate wants to get a peek, he gets one.”

“So, you know him, then.”  Regina said.

“That guy?  No, not at all…I mean, I know his name now, that he has an older brother and sister who are legacies, apparently, but no, never met him before.”

“Well, I mean, I don’t normally just let anyone see me naked, and…”

“But you’re in a uniform, which means Mr. Gunderson has seen you naked…”  Kiera countered.

“That’s not the same—.”

“And I can tell, just by looking at you, you’re not a virgin.”  She pushed her empty tray away.  “I find it had to believe that in, what Kansas or wherever you’re from—.”

“Pennsylvania.”

“Okay, PA, then…are you Pennsylvania Dutch, or whatever they call them?”  Kiera asked.

“What?  No.  I’m from the Philly area.”

“So, you live in *normal* society.  Sure, you might not know anything about Willoughby, most families don’t even really know it exists—it’s not as if Willoughby advertises—and even if you do know about it, it’s basically seen as some unattainable rich-kid college, but I mean, come on, your last year in high school, when you were eighteen, probably every guy your age fucked you and then some.  Hell, *I* kind of want to fuck you, and I don’t even have *Privilege*.  I am not a lesbian by the way.”  She added, as if that mattered to Regina.

“What the fuck are talking about?”  Regina said.

“Privilege Night?  Were you poor or something?  Even poor kids do *something* for Privilege Night or Announcement.  Listen, I don’t know if your mom kept you cloistered or whatever, but when a guy turns eighteen, they have their Privilege Night party.  The girls have an Announcement Ceremony.”  She held up her wrist with the school bracelet, just past it was an ornate woven metal band with colored beads embedded in it.  “You let your friends know what sexy stuff you’re into, they make you your bracelet, and then you go out partying in your Announcement gown, or you just have a house party or something if you can’t really afford to go out.”  She frowned, looking at Regina’s wrist, bare excepy for her school-issued bracelet.  “Where *is* yours, by the way?”

“You’re talking gibberish.  I don’t have some fancy friendship bracelet, certainly didn’t have a party where I told people my fetishes…and sure, I’ve had my fun in high school, started when I was fifteen, but I haven’t slept with *that* many people.”

“Whoa!”  Kiera snapped.  “Keep your voice down.  Okay, I get it, it’s your first day, you want to make an impression, but pre-Announcement sex is still a felony,” she whispered, “and while, sure, a lot of people have that particular secret in their past, they don’t fucking blab about it.”  She leaned back.  “Just to be clear, you’re not, like mentally diminished, right?”

“What, no!”  Regina snapped.

“And everything works below the belt?  You’re not an avowed lesbian or asexual?”

“No…of course, not.”

“Then, I’ll ask again, where’s your Announcement bracelet.”

“I literally have no idea what you’re talking about.  I…I think I need to call my mom or something.”

“Sure, Regina.”  Kiera said.  “You do that.  I’m sure she has your bracelet at home.  We can probably get you some beads to plug into your school-issued bracelet here at the campus store.  I think I saw them yesterday during the tour.  The not-quite-handcuff they gave even has a slot for beads, so you can technically just wear this.”  She held up her school bracelet to reveal a slot along the bottom just wide enough for the beads present on her other bracelet.  “Go call your mom.  You have a half hour before we have to pick an extracurricular.”  Kiera took both her and Regina’s trays up to the bin, walking over to where Nate was sitting with a couple of guys.  Regina looked around the room, seeing all the girls were wearing colored bracelets on the same wrist as the school’s tracker.  It was obviously a code, though many of the girls seemed to have similar colors on their bracelets.  As she got up to find a phone, at that moment realizing she’d left hers in her room with her hurry that morning, she watched Nate slide his hand up the back of Kiera’s leg as she stood talking to him.  His hand was under her skirt and grabbing her ass.  She started to take in the fact that similar interaction was occurring throughout the lunchroom, maybe not as blatant as Nate, but some heavy petting by any other measure.

----

Regina went back to her temporary room and found it open, some maintenance guys taking her luggage and bedding and putting it onto a cart.

“Did you need something?”  One of the men asked.  “We’re just moving these things to your permanent residence.  Crenshaw 211, right?”  Regina nodded.  “Oh, rookie mistake, you packed your bracelet, didn’t you?”  He pointed to her wrist, and she covered it with her hand.  “It’s the first day, no worries.  I’m not unloading this cart, though, so you’ll have to wait until after orientation to get in your luggage.”

“I, um, just wanted my phone.”  She said, grabbing it from a loose bin on top of all the other stuff.  “Can I, um, make a call in here?”

“Sure, we’re just leaving.  Close the door behind when you’re done, that’s all.”  The two men wheeled the overloaded cart with all her belongings out of the room.  She closed the door and sat down on the bare bed, dialing her mom.

“Well, this is a first.”  Her mother said, answering.

“Hi, mom.  Look, um, I know this is going to sound weird, but have you ever heard of an Announcement Party?”  She heard her mother laughing on the other end.

“Well, I should say so, considering we spent nearly twenty grand on yours last year.”  There was a pause.  “Oh, honey, don’t tell me you forgot to wear your bracelet.  That’s what this is about, right?  I saw yours by the front door when I got home last night.  I thought it was one of your spares.  How many times do I have to tell you, you don’t leave that out for anyone to see.”

“Mom, this is important…can you, um, can you tell me what my bracelet looks like?”

“Oh, Regina, really?”  She huffed.  “Look, I know you like to throw things in my face, but there are limits.  I think you are quite capable of determining what your *sexual*,” she whispered, “proclivities are.  I’m sure they have an Announcement section in the campus bookstore.  I know *my* tastes changed during college, so you always need to update.  Look, honey, I have to go.  I have a meeting in an hour, and my boss likes me there early.  He really likes the idea of bending me over the table before I have to give a presentation.”

“Mom!”  Regina cried.

“Oh, now you’re shy?  But before you wanted me to read off my own daughter’s Announcement bracelet.  Have a good first day, dear.”  She hung up.  Regina sat there, stunned.  She had no idea what was happening.  Sex was codified?  People announced what they liked, allowed every bit of it?  The thought crossed her mind to look on her phone, and she scrolled through her photos, finding those dated from her eighteenth birthday.

They were in a hotel ballroom, downtown Philly obviously, and—what the hell, she was naked!  Well, she was wearing heels.  Her mother was in the background, and eighteen of her female friends, some just passing acquaintances—though she recognized them all—and all dressed up in very sexy dresses.  Each was holding up a different colored silk scarf.  The next picture had her mostly covered by the various scarves tied around her, though a lot of skin was showing, not to mention the scarves were sheer.  Her mother was in one picture with her, then apparently absent from the rest of the evening.  Her friends were making her a bracelet, and she saw a few colors, two different shades of green beads, a blue, a turquoise, red, but not a picture of the completed item—ugh!  There were some pictures of her at a club, men and women around her, then a guy was untying a scarf, and she was blowing him—on the dance floor!  She never kept photos like that on her phone, at least not for long.  The scene progressed and she was giving two guys handjobs—with two scarves—and she was getting progressively less clothes.  One of her breastsd was fully exposed, the nipple of the other one visible through a sheer scarf.  Her friends must have taken most of the pictures, if they existed, because the last set of photos was from a couple hours later, and she was down to just a scarf tied around her waist, her tits and most of her ass exposed to the cold March night of Philadelphia.  She was smiling and walking down the street.  There was a video, and Regina played it, biting her lip in anxiety.  She was bent over against a brick wall, a cop in uniform fucking her from behind.  One of her friends…Katy, she could tell be the voice…was narrating.

“Happy Announcement Ceremony, Regina.  Look at her, losing her last scarf to the long arm of the law…and he does have a *long*…um…arm.”  She laughed.  Regina, the Regina in the video, was grinning, really enjoying herself.  “Regina claims she’s innocent,” Katy continued, “but I have my suspicions.”  The cop turned toward the camera, smiling.

“We’d love to have you ladies stop by the station.  I know your friend here is about to be done for the night,” he pumped her a few times for effect, “but that doesn’t mean the rest of *you* have to be done—those of you who are eighteen, of course.”  He sped his movements and started crying out ‘fuck’ over and over, clearly coming, and as he pulled out, Regina flinched, seeing come dripping from her pussy.  No condom.  The cop’s cock was shiny in the half-light, and he untied the scarf from around Regina’s waist and wiped himself off before cleaning up Regina as much as he could before slapping her bare ass.  “You girls have a safe night, whether I see you later or not, and you,” he put his arm around Regina, caressing one of her bare breasts, “Happy Announcement.  Welcome to womanhood.”  He tore the scarf and threw it in the air as the other girls cheered.  The video cut off.

“What…the…fuck.”  Regina remember none of that, nothing.  She’d done all of what she’d seen in the pictures and videos with other people, but never with an audience, certainly not in public, or with a cop.  All the girls did this?  *All* of them?  She looked up the ceremony on Wikipedia and was shocked by the level of detail, that all of it was practiced, in various iterations, by cultures all around the world.  It had been around for nearly a thousand years, ever since most of the world religions…*collapsed*?  “What the fuck?”  Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism…it was all remembered, but none of it practiced.  Buddhism was the only major world religion still in existence, and most people didn’t seriously practice it.  At best…curse words, blasphemy, was the only real legacy of religion and moralism.  She could have spent hours reading up on the crazy world she was in, but she didn’t even know what questions to ask—she wasn’t a good student.  

Still, one part struck her.  There were no STDs, there hadn’t been any in over a century, and birth control was injected once at the onset of puberty, and turned off once you wanted to have children.  God, no wonder she hadn’t cared that the cop came right inside her, no condom, no nothing.  She shoved her phone in her blazer pocket and went off to find Auditorium B.  She needed to pick an extracurricular activity.

8z3r4r,8,2018-07-15,CPA registration - Background check - Summary offenses,Bum_In_The_Park,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/8z3r4r/cpa_registration_background_check_summary_offenses/,"I am nearing my graduation date from my university and have the opportunity to study for the CPA starting this August as the only classes I have remaining are audit and a non-accounting capstone course. I'm quite concerned that past history may bar me from the certification. During the first two years of my college career (2012 to 2014) I had accumulated a significant amount of summary offenses (5) - disorderly conduct and public intoxication are the specific crimes committed. 

It has been 4 years since the last citation and a significant period of time since I have consumed alcohol. While I have managed to work an internship with a national CPA firm during this year's busy season despite this, it seems to me questions of moral turpitude will be more significant and stringent for something like the CPA.

I will be able to begin the process to get all 5 citations expunged at the end of Summer 2019 based on PA state law, however I feel it may be a hindrance to wait so long to begin the process of registration.

Anyone here have experience in a situation such as this? Like I said, I've been able to provide merit as a basis for employment and an internship despite all of this, but I'm deeply concerned."
8z43w9,5,2018-07-15,I hold a grudge against my grandparents for the way they treat my nparents,_Jolene_,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8z43w9/i_hold_a_grudge_against_my_grandparents_for_the/,"I hold a grudge against my grandparents for raising their kids in a way that they turned out to be full-blown narcissists.

My grandparents didn’t have it easy. All of them grew up in a post-war Western European country, had little money and poor access to education. When it was their turn to have kids however, the economy was having a huge boost. They experienced a great rise in wealth and their kids (aka my parents) had it way better than them. Yet, they emotionally fucked them up, to say the least. My dad was brought up in a super conservative way which still manifests itself when it comes to gender roles (I’m a woman). Plus, he’s one of the most self-centered human beings that I personally know of. He speaks only of himself and doesn’t give a shit about anyone around him (his 4 kids and his now-girlfriend included) My mom on the other hand was an ‘oops’-child and her parents made it hard for her because she was a girl who aimed for higher education. Once again, my mom turned out to be very, very selfish. Plus, she severely lacks in independence, self-awareness and maturity. 

Then, I was born. I was an accident outside of wedlock. My parents didn’t stay together, so I was left alone with my narcissist mom. She regularly abused me - emotionally and verbally. My dad wasn’t really in the picture. I just saw him every second weekend.

Fast forward to today. I’m in my mid-twenties, hold a bachelor degree in business administration and I’m about to move abroad for a longer period of time. My parents don’t really give a shit about anything - be it my achievements or my fails. 

What struck me though was that my grandparents seem to still helicopter-parent them. They give my parents everything that they would never give to me: advice, guidance, financial support, etc. They’re always there for them and my parents don’t even really acknowledge that. When one of my parents needs ANYTHING, they’re there for them. On the other hand, when I struggle with uni, depression, relationships and the like, not a single fuck is given by literally anyone. 

The thing that bothers me right now is, is how my grandparents try to ‘use’ me for when my parents seemingly need help. They do not consider my personal situation, emotions or needs at all. My mom is sick and I’m currently abroad for an internship? -&gt; “HOLY SHIT, go shopping with her already!” (Why wouldn’t I take a couple days off, spend money that I don’t have on a flight just so that I can help my mom with selecting a new carpet). My dad’s family situation with his girlfriend and their 3 young kids is fucked up? -&gt; Better make me on my way to spend quality time with them (The girlfriend fucking hates me and the kids grow into socially awkward persons themselves - they don’t even talk to me - but SURE, let me help keeping that picture of a happy family intact!). One of them has a bad day? -&gt; “Better be there for them!” Because, ya know, my parents don’t always have it easy. They know my story. They know I had an awful childhood and that my parents still don’t treat me in a way that would be considered appropriate. They should know better. 

I have little empathy with my parents’ struggles since they don’t give a fuck about my life AT ALL. I don’t know why my grandparents think that I’m their little helper with their 50-year old kids. I’m SO sick of it. That’s why I’m leaving my country next month. Aiming for a master’s and starting a career in an environment where people actually see my potential. I’m done with that bullshit. "
8z443c,2,2018-07-15,M4F Wet and Wild,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8z443c/m4f_wet_and_wild/,"Nobody said it worked this fast...

Wet.  It's the slang term for the newest illegal drug running rampant in the world.  It's actual name was ridiculously long and boring, so it quickly took on th name ""Wet"".

Wet had quite a few effects on the human body.  It gave the sensory pleasures and euphoria of ecstacy, the energy of cocaine, the libido of a double dose of Viagra, and the sexual hunger of a rabbit.  Altogether, the name made a lot of sense because it made men harder than a top pornstar and women...well wet.

People took it for the high ostensibly, as the high was supposed to be extremely pleasant, but as it became more commonplace, people began taking it for wild nights with a special friend and then taking it in groups for wild orgies with several special friends.  It worked for both men and women and could even be dissolved in fruit juices.

Cops barely enforced the laws against it, as arresting people high on Wet always guaranteed a fun night in the squad car.  Politicians publicly condemned it, but day after day scandals came to light as more and more elected officials were caught high on Wet and buried in writhing interns.

The hangover wasn't bad for most, but for some rare cases, it caused a psychological addiction to physical contact with that person.  Taking too much Wet and getting your pussy eaten might even give your partner an addiction to your pussy and the same could be said of blowing a Wet fueled erection.

It's mostly harmless right?  So why is it hitting you so hard and so fast....?

Let's create an experience.  You tell me where you are when Wet kicks in and who you're with.  Does it kick in while you're still working?  Does someone slip it into your drink?  Do you give some to your boyfriend as an experiment only to have it become more intense than expected?  How does Wet affect your life?  Let's have some fun with this."
8z4gtl,3,2018-07-15,Weird neighbours,SaltedEggCaramel,creepyencounters,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/8z4gtl/weird_neighbours/,"I found this subreddit not long ago and decided to post my own experiences here.

 I'm sorry if my story is hard to understand because my english is not good enough.

So I live in a dorm ,,Studentenwohnheim"". The dorm itself is not that great, but it's good enough to live in it and also cheap. It has 4 floors (ground floor, 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor). 
Each floor has two corridors. And each corridor has 10 single rooms, one kitchen, and one bathroom. In the bathroom there are 4 Toilets and 2 showers.

I have lived here for a little bit more than 3 years and in this 3 years, many have moved in and out. I'm the only one in my corridor that has live here the longest. Have many different neighbours, and some of them are really weird. It's not as creppy as the other posts here, but it really made me uncomfortable.



It happened in 2016. I had a neighbour, whose room is in front of the kitchen, Ali. He was actually okay. I have never really talked with him, just said hello or something like that. 

Then one day, I was cooking in the kitchen, and he came, also wanted to cook. We ended talking, and he offered some food for me. Well I said yes, we sat and talked while eating. 

Suddenly he asked me more private things like if I have a boyfriend. I didn't think anything bad and just answered him. He also asked if I want to go to his room, I said no, and he asked if he can go to my room with me. I thought there was no reason to go, so I said no.

But then he asked if he can kiss me. I was confused, a little bit frozen and then he kissed me. Not that kind of sweet kiss, but an aggressive one. My arms were between his and my body, tried to push him. He then lifted me up, brought me to my room, put me on my bed and started being more..wild. I remember I was just there, shaking, and tried my best to push him not to be raped. I was lucky he didn't do anything more than that. He then left, laughed at how crazy I was shaking.

After it I just cut contact with him, and he moved out not long after.
But the next year, Spring, I saw him again, in my corridor. He moved in again, and told the office that he wanted the same room again. I just tried my best to ignore him. He knew that I was angry with him, tried several times to talk with me and said sorry.

 One time I was in my room (I opened my door at the time) and he came. He brought some food and said he wanted to talk with me in my room. I said okay, but I want the door to be left open. We sat and talked a little bit. He then tried to put the food in my mouth. I leaned back, shook my head, and said no. But after it he tried to do it again several times, to which I said no. He also asked to close the door but I refused. 

I was really annoyed, so I told him to leave, and he did. There was no major accident after it. Once I was in my Bed as I heard someone in front of my door, tried to open my door. I was really scared, but luckily I locked the door. I knew it was him because at the time only 3 from 10 rooms are used, and the other guy was almost never home.

Fast forward he was finally moving out. He knocked my door. I just peeked a little, the door was not open fully. He was moving out, and wondered if he can leave his blanket in my room because he had too may things. I had many neighbours moved out so it was pretty normal for me to have their things in my room for a while. 

I said okay, took the blanket and put it on the floor near the door. He then showed me his sad face, asked if he can talk to me. I said I didn't want to. And suddenly his sad face was gone, replaced by a straight expression. He said ,,I'm coming in"" and tried to put off his shoes. I quickly closed the door but he was faster, put his leg in and tried to block me from closing the door. 
I know I should've scream but I couldn't, instead I shook my head repeatedly. He was taller than me, and obviously stronger. Fortunately he still had some right minds and didn't use his full power. He then stopped, I took the blanket, gave it to him, and locked the door. I haven't met him since then.


And this year I already met 3 new weird neighbours.


I work in a big laundry near my dorm, so 10 Min walk. And because of something I always get the night shift (It's a big laundry for Hotels. In Summer peak, the laundry runs from 4a.m. till 2a.m.). I never had any problems working night shift. It's pretty safe here.

One day as I was going outside from my corridor, I heard someone was running upstairs. I was on the 1st floor, and I think he was on the 2nd. I didn't think anything because it is pretty common for someone to run downstairs.

 I went to the ground floor, where the mailboxes are, checked mine, and then I realized that the one who was running was already on the ground floor. I have never seen him before, I think. He just stand still in front of the staircase. I thought he wanted to check his mailbox and waited for me to leave, so I brushed it off and went outside to the bike stands. 

And I saw him, he was also walking outside. (It was fast. I mean, if he checked his mailbox he wouldn't be outside that fast).

I have this habit to put my bag on the bike, so it took me some time to get ready on my bike. But he didn't bring anything with him, already unlocked his bike and just stand there. 
He was already done to leave before I were (I saw him from the corner of my eyes). But because I was almost late, I just ignored him and went to work. 

The road is almost just straight, but at the end of the road, I have to turn left. That day, I was riding my bike on the road, not on the walking path where people normally ride their bike. So I was on the right, and the walking path was on the left side of the road. 

As I turned left, I saw the guy, and he starred at me. I had the feeling that he was following me. In front of my workplace there are those big trucks to carry the laundry. I quickly went behind those trucks and slowed down. I wanted to see if he was really following me. 

Because I slowed down, he was a little bit ahead, and do you know what I saw as I got out from my hiding behind the trucks? He was there, on the left side of the road, still riding the bike, but his head turned to the right, he looked at the trucks. He then went straight, didn't look back anymore. I went home that night while calling my friend though because I was scared that he will poop out somewhere.

On the next day I planned to go to work a little bit late to not meet him. Well he was not there, I rode my bike, and I saw him. I was getting out from the dorm complex, and he was getting in. I don't know if it was just a coincidence or not. Thankfully I haven't seen him again since then. His bike is also nowhere to be seen.


Another one that crepped me was ,,neighbour"" Carp. I was washing some socks and TShirts in a Toilet stall when I heard someone went in another stall, which is normal because there were like 7 People that live in my corridor.

 I went out and saw this guy. He was an african (important info for later), and he was putting something like foam on his chin (he didn't close the door). He said hello, and we talked a little bit. He asked my name, and I just answered and asked his name back. He then asked, ,,where are you from?"" Before I could answer, he already said ,,From country X right?"".

For a background info, I currently studying in Germany. I do come from Country X. I was born and raised there, so were my parents. But there was never once in my life someone who correctly guess that I come from Country X. 

Both my mother and father families were migrants, so although I'm a citizen of country X, I don't look like one. I think I'm the 4th generation. Even the people from my country can't recognize me, they always talk to me in german, before they realize that I'm also from country X. So it was weird that he knew I'm from country X.

We continued talking, and I asked him if he lives here, because never once I saw him before (and no, he was not that ,,stalker"" neighbour). He said, yes he lives here, but he will be for sometime in another city and he will come back next semester.

The conversation didn't go well though, because my active English is bad, I always mix some german if I try to speak english, and I couldn't really understand him because of his accent. to summarize he asked if I can teach him german, to which I said okay and he asked my number. I didn't really want to, but I don't want to be rude to my neighbour. 
Ah he also asked when my semester will end, when I will have my summer holiday and how long. I explained that I will not really have holiday because I will have to do 2 weeks of a course, and 2 weeks of internship. and the rest I will have to work. I think he said ,,but then it means you have holiday right?"". I just said maybe and went to my room.

Not long after he texted me, how are you. I answered. but after it he started to make me uncomfortable. He asked when I have classes, at what time, something like that. I have only met and talked to him once, so I didn't want to answer it. I just asked him why and he said he just don't want to disturb me, he wants to text me on my free time. I ignored him and he also didn't text me again.

And 3 weeks ago when I was in the kitchen, my another neighbour, Tes, came. He already lived here after Ali left. Tes uses Ali's room. I already talked with Tes several times, and he was okay actually. 

So we just chatted and then he asked if I want to go to party with him on Saturday. I said sorry, I have to work. He said okay, and left. Not long after, he came back and asked if I want to go to a bar with him to drink on weekends. I refused, told him that I work on weekends and I can't drink (I get tipsy and my face will be reddish after one beer). He seemed not satisfied, and asked how about coffee, to which I also refused. And then he said, ,,It's Wednesday, so you have time until Saturday to think about it. I will wait"". Just then he left.

After it I just realized something. Carp and Tes are friends, and both are also African (I don't mean to be racist here. And I know African is a contingent, but I really don't know from which country they are from. They already said it to me, but I couldn't understand them. And because they already repeated their answer 2 or 3 times, I just said yes). I think that's why Carp knew I'm from country X. It's possible that they talked about me. And Tes will move out next semester. I think Carp lives now in another city and next semester he will come and use Tes' room.

Fast forward Tes didn't ask me anything until Sunday. He texted me on Sunday morning, asked if I'm home. I didn't answer, instead I waited till afternoon, went to the library and answered his text ,,no"". He just read my message.

In the library I met a good friend of mine. She is African. I then told her that I met that Carp guy, and showed her his text message. As she read his contact name, she was a little bit shocked, quickly opened her facebook and searched his name. ,,Is it him?"" she asked him. And I said yes. She sighed and said he is a weird guy, and he also did a similar thing to my friend.

She was riding her bike home when she saw him on the street. They greeted each other (my friend said it's normal for african to greet each other even though they are strangers). Carp told her that he was new in this city, and he was searching for a room, but it was hard and he needed her help. They exchanged number, and he began texting her, but not about ,,searching a room"".
 He asked her when is her free time, he wants to meet her for coffee. How he always dreams of her, etc. She then told me to just block his number like what she did.

Several days later, I was in my room listening to music when I heard someone knocked my door. I almost already went up to open the door, when I heard someone held the handle and pushed the door. Because of the accident with Ali, I was really scared, I lowered the volume of my laptop. The knocking continued, he knocked louder, but then he left. 
What not appropriate was, a man tried to go inside a girl's room. He only knocked two times before he tried to open the door. What happen if I didn't lock the door and was in the middle of changing clothes? (I'm the only girl in my corridor at least until now).

Like 1,5 hours latter I went outside to go to the toilet, tried to be as quiet as possible, locked my door. As I was doing that, my another neighbour, Yole, whose room is right in front of my room came outside. He is from my country. I tried to explain him what happened quietly, but not realized that I didn't want Tes to hear me, he answered in his normal voice which is a little loud. I ended talking with him in the kitchen (fortunately Tes didn't came out). 

Yole told me that it was probably Tes, because one time, Tes also opened Yole's room after short knocking. Well I don't care if it's a habit from his country or something like that, I can't see that a man tried to open a girl's room without permission is right.

After it Tew didn't message me again. I saw him several times, but he didn't try to talk with me. I also haven't talk to him about he tried to go into my room because I'm scared of him. I just hope he won't do something weird till he move. And I really hope that Carp won't use Tes' room next semester.
Thanks for reading. And I'm sorry if it's confusing.."

A couple weeks ago, while I was grocery shopping at Safeway with my roommates, a nice, well put-together man approached me to ask about a Texas shirt I was wearing. He said his son goes to Rice University, studying computer science. Well I'm a 20 year old college student from Houston, and I'm also studying computer science, so we immediately hit it off and started talking about the city, the tech industry, etc. He asks me what I'm doing in the Bay Area, and I tell him I'm doing a software development internship at one of the big firms, and his eyes lit up. He started asking me about the job, how much it paid (weird), whether I liked it or not, etc. (Note, I've had this conversation a million times, usually with other people who are interested in going into tech, so nothing set off any red flags). 

After a long 30 minute conversation, I was desperately just trying to finish my shopping, as my roommates were already done and wanted to leave. He asks for my phone number so that maybe we can ""grab coffee after work sometime"" so that I could give some tips for his son to get a tech internship. I was hesitant, but he was very nice and I wanted to help his son, so I said what the hell and gave him my number. As I was on my way out, I noticed that this man didn't have a shopping cart and just seemed to be roaming the aisles for conversation. Huge red flag went up in my head.

The next day, I get a long , barely coherent text from him about ""mentorship"" and ""debt free cash flow assets"". At this point, I've seen enough MLM pitches to know that this is exactly what it was. I was furious, not because he was trying to pitch his MLM, but because he was so deceitful in getting my number and because he had wasted my time at the grocery store.

Long story short, I told him I was free to meet for coffee, with no intention of going. Once he was in the Starbucks waiting for me for about 30 minutes, I gave him a piece of my mind. I haven't gotten any texts from him since.

TL;DR: Friendly stranger at Safeway tricks me into giving him my number, turns out to be an MLMer, so I stand him up for a coffee chat and shit on his ""profession""

8z5f21,2,2018-07-15,F4A - Worthless Asian College Slut,sexyasiangirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8z5f21/f4a_worthless_asian_college_slut/,"Check out the bottom for a last minute addition that I really love!

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

8z5nls,160,2018-07-15,Advice to freshman from a professor,AZCollegeProfessor,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/8z5nls/advice_to_freshman_from_a_professor/,"Disclaimer: While I am a professor, these views are entirely my own.

Disclaimer 2: I teach mostly juniors/seniors/grad students and these things that my thousand plus students have said over time...

Factor 1: Go to ASU orientation plus every other orientation you can think of (like Camp Carey). You will get insights and connections that you will get nowhere else. We (the faculty) assume you know the stuff that was covered in these and you put yourself tremendously in a bind if you don't know something basic (like how to log into BB).

Factor 2: Go to (most of your) classes. If you are in a class with fewer than 50 people, we know if you are skipping or not. While I have no written attendance policy, I am very unlikely to write a recommendation for you if you skip my class. In my class, I have documented that people who attend every class score, on average, 17% higher than those who skip more than two class sessions.

Factor 3: Start your professional networking immediately. There are a ton of professional clubs for you to join and you should join at least one and attend regularly. You will not get any immediately benefits out of it but, by the time you do, you will be seen as a leader of the club and I can PROMISE that you are much more likely to get an internship and full time job.

Factor 4: Study. Your freshman year gpa counts exactly the same as your senior year gpa. And, it is very difficult to recover from a sterling 2.0 gpa your freshman year. In my discipline, a 3.4 is the gold standard for all the recruiters and this starts to matter immensely by the fall of your junior year (for internships). I hope I do not need to educate you on the extreme unlikelihood of having a 2.0 gpa your first year and a 3.4 overall gpa by the start of your junior year.

Factor 5: Network with your profs but we are not your buddies. I know a ton of recruiters and other students. I can very much help you get ready for your career but I am unwilling to use my personal network for someone that I don't know. Stop by my office and ask a question every so often or just stop by to chat so I can get to know you. But, please do not mistake me for a buddy. In other words, I do not want to hear details about last weekend and how drunk you got. I want to see you as a budding professional and so you need to act that way around me.

Factor 6: Read my syllabus. My most frequent response is ""what does it say in my syllabus."" Remember, the syllabus represents a contract of sorts between us and we load ours up with things that you should know. Please be very aware of what is in there before you ask me a question. Related comment, please do not tell me that you missed a class and ask if we covered anything important. We die a little bit inside each time that question gets asked.

Factor 7: You will have one great and one lousy teacher per semester. Just like in high school, you will have one professor every semester that you love and one that you can't stand. But, in 16 short weeks, it will all reset and you can survive until then.

Factor 8: We want you to succeed. We all became educators because we like educating people. We all very much want you to be successful and nothing makes us happier when you are (in class and in life). In fact, we like to brag about you to our friends (e.g. my former student just got a great job with xyz). So, see us as a resource and not an impediment.

Happy to answer any questions.

PS: News12 picked it and so it is being shared with a wider audience under my real name: [https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/advice-to-freshmen-from-a-professor/574433052](https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/advice-to-freshmen-from-a-professor/574433052)"
8z62s1,19,2018-07-15,A Message to the Chief Resident,Flighty_Philosophy,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/8z62s1/a_message_to_the_chief_resident/,"I'm a relatively new attending and as I reflect back on my training, many things come to mind that I would love to go back and ""fix."" This post is a slight variation of this theme. 

I'm not sure of the yield this may welcome, but the following are a handful of notes that I wish someone told me before my residency ended.

Whether you're 3 years in or 7 years in, depending on your training, you've just entered your chief year. You're the boss. This is your service. This is your team and everything is your fault. Learn it fast, but embrace the autonomy.  Use the first month or two get the real frustration and stress out. Take a deep breath and move on. 

&gt;This year is all about how to **manage**

We're all smart people. We got here for a reason. We're great test takers and can solve complex problems. Managing people or managing a team is a beast all on its own. We can intellectualize on this all day. You know exactly who the people are on your team and you know exactly what to say to them. That's the easy part. The application of this to produce results is a whole different obstacle. Here- I'll even make it easy for you:

&gt;1. the cocky know-it-all (maybe PGY-2,3)  
&gt;  
&gt;2. the stressed and frustrated one who ""just cant take it anymore"" (PGY-3, sometimes 6)  
&gt;  
&gt;3. the relaxed, calm, collected one \[likely doing an elective month(s) or research year\]  
&gt;  
&gt;4. the materialistic one who's wondering when his/her hair supplies or shoes will arrive instead of reviewing labs  
&gt;  
&gt;5. the absent intern ( these days the intern may qualify for #1 as well- be careful!)  
&gt;  
&gt;6. the angry resident that will be the stimulus for all the emails from other teams, nursing staff, supervisors, HR that you'll receive this year about them  
&gt;  
&gt;7. the quiet, yet seemingly reliable one that you never hear anything about  
&gt;  
&gt;8. the know it all, that actually knows it all, but has zero social skills, technical skills, common sense (pick one)  
&gt;  
&gt;9. the nervous, self conscious one who asks you if everything he/she did was okay or good enough or asks for help even though you know they can handle the issue  
&gt;  
&gt;10. the complainer- everything doesn't make sense and they never understand why someone would do something  
&gt;  
&gt;11. the partier- everyone knows this person in the hospital, can get things done because they are well-liked but depends on this too much  
&gt;  
&gt;12.  the one who is going to bother you about exact vacation days or will have random doctors appointments  
&gt;  
&gt;13. the unprepared one- tell you the day of his/her presentation that they don't have the presenation ready

I definitely missed some in my reflections, but you get the idea. Everyones flying to their own drift. They all have different learning styles and will react differently to the same stimulus. So you need to figure out someway to reverse that. Have them react the same, but individualizing the stimulus. 

&gt;Make the outcome predictable by changing your actions. 

Easier said than done. That's why application is the hardest part. 

Finally, lead by example. If you're a hard working member of the team, everyone will follow. You need to lighten to load on yourself by feeling you're not doing ""everything"" by delegating. Of course. But don't get carried away and crack a whip all year. Keeping a team happy will make you happy in return. 

That being said, it's your last year. After this year, you're not a resident; chief or otherwise. After this year, a patient's identifier wrist band will have your name on it. Let that sink in for a minute. Treat this year like that is already a reality and you'll be well ahead of the curve. If you haven't already- treat every complication like its your own and learn to accept the faults of other residents as your own. This is part of the territory. You can do this with a buffer. Your buffer is your supervising attending. Appreciate this cushion. You wont have it next year.

So as you pray for this year to go by quickly, you'll look back and wish you were there again to learn more and make more mistakes over that safety net. You're going to roll your eyes when you read this, but residency holds some of the best years of your entire career. It's a very unique place to be in- despite the obvious well-advertised and understandably echoed negatives. Cherish these years. Cherish this year.

Hope this helps. Hope this wasn't just ranting. "
8z6pth,1,2018-07-15,I fucked up but didn’t mean too,borken_man182,BreakUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUp/comments/8z6pth/i_fucked_up_but_didnt_mean_too/,So me and my ex had an amazing relationship. We dated for 7 months and it was all going great. Had an amazing girlfriend and the internship of my dreams. That all came crashing down when I was blackmailed. They had a video of me mutually masturbating on webcam. At the time it was just porn to me. I would have never cheated on her physically or emotionally with someone else. This really stems from my stupid immaturity. I knew that I would have gotten away with it but I wanted no secrets between me and my now ex so I told her what happened and she was very upset. She was willing to work things out with me for the first two weeks but then other things came up she mentioned a time I said something that bothered her and I told her that during that time it was stressful for me and that sometimes you say things you don’t mean and she understood. Eventually she said she was tired of talking about it. we had our last phone call with each other and I told her that there are big lessons to be learned here and that after this I’ll be a better person. She said that maybe sometime in the future but for now she is to unsure that it’s unfair. I love this girl soooooo much but I don’t want to put emotional baggage on her so I just want to move on. It’s been 3 weeks since I haven’t spoken to her she’s in Cali and I’m in nyc and the next time we’ll see each other is on campus in about a month. I have forgiven myself because I am only 20 and I’m still learning born sinner but I get better each night. I know to whoever reads that I seem like a piece of shit. But I really treated her like I’ve never treated anyone else. She was my everything but if you love something sometimes you got to let it go. Can you guys give me any advice or words of wisdom or insults? I’m open to anything.

8z77m9,53,2018-07-15,An Old Friend,reddituser93,gaystoriesgonewild,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystoriesgonewild/comments/8z77m9/an_old_friend/,"The summer after I graduated college, I moved back home to take some graduate school courses at a local college to save on living expenses. I had a pretty light class schedule (though plenty of coursework!) When I wasn't in class or studying, I was hanging out with old high school friends, or more likely, trolling grindr for summer fun.

One weekend afternoon, I went out fishing along the river with a good buddy from high school. We caught up, drank some beers, and had a great time. Since high school, my friend had been hitting the gym a lot. His biceps were huge, and the tank top he had on was showing them off nicely. Unfortunately, he's straight and I'm not out. Though, I had never really thought about him that way, he was definitely looking good today. 

We had drove to the river separately, and we were both a bit tired from the sun and booze, so decided to just both head home. I hadn't jerked off in a couple days, being so busy with school work, and didn't get any time that day, hanging out most of the day with my friend. It was around 5pm, when we left and as I got in my car and turned on the a/c I realized how horny I was. 

I drove a bit, thinking I'd just go home and jerk it, unfortunately there weren't any college fuck buddies just down the hall. My cock was hardening under my loose boxers in my black mesh gym shorts, and making it pretty difficult to drive. I pulled over at an empty park and ride lot and unbuckled my seat belt. 

I opened up grindr and browsed a bit, massaging my growing bulge. Sent a few messages to guys in the area. Again, the closest guys are 1, 2, 3 miles away - not like 600, 1200, 3200 feet away at undergrad. But, I had a car, and it's a lot easier to fuck when the other guy has his own place, not a 6 person dorm suite. My phone buzzed, taking me away from my memories of that tall stud I got on my knees for between the tennis courts just a few months back because both of our bedrooms were unavailable.

We exchanged the normal hellos and boring grindr chatting about how we are looking for DL casaul fun. His profile had no picture, was 28, and said he lived in a neighboring town, so I was comfortable sharing a picture as I didn't think I knew him. I sent a G rated face picture.

Silence, no response. Alright, whatever, guys don't reply to pics all the time if we aren't a 'match’, aka I'm not his type. 

Then he replies, “I know you”. 

My heart drops, this has never happened to me before. How does he know me, I rack my brain of everyone I know from his town. Was he lying about where he lived, his age? Did we go to high school together? 

I asked him how we knew each other. He said “work”. Uhh, I've had multiple jobs since I was 16. Working retail, summer camp, professional internships in my field, and other odd jobs. I asked him his name or where he worked with me, slowly trying to get him to reveal who he was. He told me he was equally as nervous and unsure if he wanted to keep chatting. “Mike”, and the retail job. Fuck. There was 2, maybe 3, guys in that age range named Mike that worked with me there. One was definitely not my type, and would surprise me if he was into guys at all. The other guy was actually kind of handsome, but from being his facebook friend I knew he still had a long term girlfriend.

I was nervous, but also extremely horny, as he still hadn't ghosted me and it was hot talking to a guy I was still not sure of their identity but knew mine. Finally he told me his last name and I was still shocked. I asked if we should just text, as I still had his number from trying to switch shifts from a few years ago. We had both left that job, and moved on to college for me and a job in his chosen field. 

We texted a bit and exchanged our thoughts about how nervous and crazy this was. He asked if I wanted to come get a beer, but I told him I was not dressed at all to go to a bar, and would be okay to meet him after showering and changing. He meant a beer at his house. Oh. 

I pulled up 25 minutes later and found my way to his front door, the second story of a two family house. We exchanged hellos, he poured me a beer, which I drank up to try and call my nerves. We sat at his kitchen table and chatted about normal stuff, catching up. We were sitting next to each other, chairs turned towards each other a bit. I don't exactly remember how, but the subject of body hair came up, both us being pretty hairy. He told me he recently trimmed his pubes and pulled his shorts down just above his cock, showing off his neatly trimmed pubes. I told him, mine weren't nearly as neatly trimmed, and really actually quite a mess. 

He asked if he could see, and before I said yes, he pulled down my shorts like he did with his own, but grabbed my bulge with the his other hand. I smiled, and he leaned in to kiss me. We made out for a few minutes in the kitchen, with his hand down my shorts. 

That's enough for now, will post part 2 soon."
8z7kpg,0,2018-07-15,"Taking a huge risk while young with no kids. If it fails, FIRE target through traditional work in 6-8 years. If it works, FIRE before 30. Anyone else with a similar story, like starting a business or something?",TiredOfRatRacing,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8z7kpg/taking_a_huge_risk_while_young_with_no_kids_if_it/,"Hey ladies and gents, they say goals are best acomplished if you tell others, so here is my story, and my plan. This is going to be a wildly unpopular opinion, but rest assured I researched my decisions carefully, have the traditional FIRE plan in place should my gamble fail, and it will not impact any children. The FIRE plan is pretty general, so I'll spare you the details. Ill be saving my usual 60&amp;#37; of each paycheck, and I'll keep enjoying inexpensive hobbies, like mountain biking, hiking, and camping. The question is, how to invest the savings for the best return? The method I decided on will seem very controvertial, so let me be clear, I know it may not work. Actually, it likely will not work the way I plan out. But the possible benefits are an extra 10 years of life without waking up to an alarm clock. 

**Background**

I am young, as in 25. I am a family medicine intern. My wife is 24, a resident optometrist. We both grew up almost poor. Like, ""always had a roof, but in a cramped house; always got a few christmas presents, but had parents that could barely get to the next paycheck, and sometimes racked up credit card debt to do so"" kind of poor. We also graduated from high school into the teeth of the Great Recession. Between that and our combined 15 years of college/professional school, we are experts at surviving off nothing and delaying purchases until we absolutely need them. We do not want kids, so we do not have to be as financially secure as a normal family. We are doing well now, with combined incomes of $5000 and $2000 per month for myself and my wife, respectively. This is more money flowing in than we have ever had. And we are so frugal, we usually only spend 30-40&amp;#37; of each paycheck. 

\*Plus, I was a vandweller for a while, so I know have a Plan C as well\*

So, since we are so young, and yet toughened, we can take risks now and still have a decent length working life to make up for the likely failure of those risks. However, should the risk pay off, we could possibly FatFIRE within 1-2 years. I'd say the chance of that success is... maybe 1 in 3. It was good enough for Sean Connery and the Red October. And to have some time in our 20s back from the hellhole that is professional education... oh my god so worth the risk.

So, in the hopes that people will recognize we did not make this decision lightly, and we are simply trying to go out of the box, even the normal FIRE box, to attain freedom. Here is our story, and here is our plan.

**Learning how to invest**

Back in 2016, I had read some of the MMM blogs, and a few thousand dollars saved up. I was looking for anything that had decent returns, and a friend showed me how the Dow had tanked on news about China, and how he wished he had cash when the price was lower. At the time, I questioned the wisdom of buying when the market was going down. He looked at me, smiled, and told me it was just on sale. 

So I got a Wealthfront account and put a few hundred in at 90&amp;#37; stocks. The market recovered within months and I had a pretty good return. I then took some funds out. I tried timing things using the ""Fear/Greed Index"" and Warren Buffets ""be greedy when others are fearful"" advice. I wasn't a day trader, more of a week trader. Then the stock market went down a little, and I bought more. I was just super lucky, but I thought I had a good stomach for risk at that point.

**Finding... (Dare I say it...) cryptocurrencies**

Here I may lose some of you, if you hate the idea of cryptocurrencys, and I respect your opinion. They are almost all speculation at this point, so I don't blame you. 

Anyway, I went looking for other, more volatile markets to apply Buffets advice after stocks flattened out in 2016. My sister's boyfriend told me he played with cryptocurrencies. So, I took some money off Wealthfront and I dabbled a bit on Gemini with Bitcoin ($600 at the time) and Ethereum ($12 at the time). I did my best to sell high, and buy in when FUD went around. I had put in maybe 1/2 of all my savings at that point. In total, my savings was only $15k then, but that was literally my life savings. Most was in Ethereum since it was cheaper. I started researching Bitcoin and Ethereum, and I liked Eth better.

Naturally, Ethereum took a 30&amp;#37; dump to $9, and I realized that ""volatile"" meant down as well as up. Feeling a little stung, I pulled most of my remaining funds from Ethereum to even out my stock gains to avoid capital gains tax headaches (since I had no idea how any of that worked back then either.) 

Equally naturally, Ethereum then went off the rails to $40 before I could get my cash back in. The FOMO was strong, and I'm still kicking myself for missing that huge first leap. Luckily, it went from $40 to $400 in the span of a year. I had gone from $15k to $150k. I was in vapor lock for most of 2017 over this. I had never built up so much, so fast, and especially as it went higher in Autumn. At that point, I decided to pull from Ethereum and diversify in the cryptos, thinking the other shoe must be about to drop. 

**XRP and the New Years 2018 Ripple Pump**

My sister's boyfriend again gave me some advice. He casually mentioned Ripple might be picked up by some big companies. My first thought was, ""What the heck is a Ripple?"" So I did some digging, and managed to get on the Kraken exchange, and glitched my way to a few hundred thousand XRP, while saving some of my precious Ethereum. Then XRP had that massive speculative pump, and I suddenly had over a 7-figure net worth within weeks. I was giddy. Then the market slumped. No big deal, I told myself. Then XRP took an 80&amp;#37; dump. \*80. FREAKING. PERCENT.\* 

I lost over $800,000 on paper from the high. I consoled myself on still having a mid 6-figure net worth, even to this day, but that didn't help much. As to why I did not withdraw at the peak, it was because I was simply astonished, a bit greedy, and I had no idea how such massive capital gains would impact my taxes, since they would be short term gains. At the time, I remember deciding not to decide and just roll with it. I knew I was young enough to deal with the volatility. So Im still holding on, even as the cryptocurrency market stumbles along.

**The Gamble**

Thank you for reading along this far. Before going any further, allow me to clarify that I don't want to sound like a gambler who can make his losses back with ""just one more good hand..."" which this will certainly sound like. My calculated risk is this: We will pour every extra cent that we can into XRP until we are 30 or have $6-8 million, whichever comes first. We would never do any leverage trades, as buying on margin is as stupid as essentially burning money in such volatile markets. If XRP has not taken off by the time we are 30, we will re-evaluate it against other cryptos with use-cases or stocks. Meanwhile, we will remain as frugal as we have always been, and continue to save at least 60&amp;#37; of each paycheck. The idea is this: plenty of people discover the FIRE movement in their 30s, after having terrible financial habits and no savings. If those people can FIRE in a few years, we would be able to do so as well if the Crypto market collapses. Its been around since 2009, so I bet it will be around at least another decade. 

**The reasoning**

There is a finance quote that goes something like, ""diversification protects, concentration grows,"" and right now we need our funds to grow, quickly, to reach FIRE. I have researched Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and XRP. I chose XRP because it serves a very useful purpose already. Ethereum does as well, but currently mostly in theory. I agree with MMM on Bitcoin, in that it is a ""greater fool"" game. Bitcoin is also the first. So was MySpace. 

Anyway, XRP could easily become highly prized by banks for global money transfers, and in providing an actual service, behaves more as a ""natural resource"" than a security. And it is wise to buy natural resources before the demand grows for it. Imagine buying land in West Texas before the automobile was invented. 

Also, while I hate to depend on speculation, rampant speculation made me a momentary-millionaire on paper over the course of weeks earlier this year. Even if having a good use-case isn't enough, I bet the speculators will return to the cryptosphere within the next year because it could be very useful. Call that my ""Hail-Mary.""

**Discussion on Ripple and XRP, and why most people hate it. Skip if you don't want the technical talk**

So there are currently a lot of risks. XRP could be ruled a security of the Ripple Company, and it would not be listed on certain exchanges. XRP could be abandoned by Ripple. XRP could grow more slowly than Ethereum, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, or the myriad of other cryptocurrencies like EOS, Litecoin, or Cardano. Additionally, XRP uses a Ledger protocol, which is different from the Proof of Work ""mining"" required for Bitcoin or Ethereum. So it may technically not actually be a real cryptocurrency in the traditional sense. This makes it understandable why so many people do not like it, since they don't understand it compared to what they're used to. That doesn't mean it can't have value. 

I have an answer to those concerns listed above. Ripple is doing its best to conform to SEC rules, and wants to be regulated as a currency. XRP likely won't be ruled a security, even though Ripple is selling the technology to utilize them. Currently XRP and its ledger system operate independently from Ripple, and can scale to demand, using tiny fees taken from each transaction. As far as growth, XRP does tend to lag, however, last time Bitcoin was $6k, XRP was $0.20. Now Bitcoin is $6k, and XRP is $0.45. I'll take 100&amp;#37; growth any day. And with some nudging from the Ripple Company, I think XRP is most likely to increase in value, and stay increased, where something else more popular may get pumped faster, then quickly dumped. That happened to XRP already, so I like to think it ""got it out of it's system.""

To digress a moment on the security/currency/natural resource thing, imagine XRP as a lump of iron. Now imagine you're in the bronze age. Ripple found and mined the iron, and had a lot of it. It was found to be valuable, so Ripple had to carefully manage how it interacts with the Iron supply. Now the lumps are being released by an escrow, so Ripple doesn't control such a large suppy any more. (Ripple is also decentralizing their control of the XRP ledger, with more 3rd party nodes coming online.) So, these lumps of iron are sitting there, and Ripple had an idea. Rather than use horses to carry sacks of gold, they could build a rail system out of the iron. Ripple would control the rail system. The iron could be made into mine carts. So, Ripple doesn't control the carts, just the rails, and so doesn't have to have the carts regulated as portions of the company. Kingdoms can easily transfer their gold to other kingdoms on the rails in the carts that they own. Buy the iron, and you can move value with it. That inherently gives value to the iron, since there is a finite supply. The cool thing is though, what else can iron be used for besides carts? I don't know, but someone like Jeff Bezos might. 

**Historical Comparison**

Jeff Bezos came up with a book sales program. He focused it, got really good at it, and customers loved it. It became super popular, then it branched out and is involved in nearly everything. Anyone who invested in early Amazon is extremely wealthy. 

Ripple the Company is getting really good at one thing, global payments. And they may be decentralizing, but Ripple can still nudge XRPs future. In the future, Ripple will certainly find other uses for their programs and for the global XRP supply. For example, imagine if it became the standard Xbox Live or PS4 Online token. Good golly miss molly, everyone and their grandmother would be trying to buy them.

So, with so many unknowns, XRP is unpopular now, and thus cheap. But IF it is ruled not a security, and IF it is used in global remittance markets, and IF the Ripple developers don't get stolen away by other blockchain teams, and IF another coin doesn't come out and do XRPs job better... then this might be a very dirty, balled up, golden ticket. We shall see. If you have questions, please comment, and I will try to better explain what I have found in my research. 

**Recap**

So, being young and able to stomach some epic risks, (really, does the stock market count as risky if everyone intends to be able to have a 4&amp;#37; SWR after inflation?) I am going to put all my eggs in one basket. My life savings in XRP. At least til Im 30. If the gamble fails, I work 8 years as a frugal physician and FIRE before Im 40. If XRP (and a few Eth for good luck) go crazy, I may FIRE before 30. That extra 10 years is, like Tom Hanks says in  Joe vs The Volcano, ""gold in my hand."" 

Since there are a lot of ways to get to FIRE, please let me know if anyone else is trying the ""eggs in one basket, concentrate wealth to grow"" strategy. Or if you took a similarly huge risk that worked out, what is your story?

\*\*\*I would love to answer any questions, but please also do your own research, and only invest what you can afford to lose. We have income, so we can afford to lose a good chunk of our life savings. We watched our parents survive that in 2009."
8z7xqo,7,2018-07-16,My gf (21) brokeup with me (20) i need help,Endowh11,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8z7xqo/my_gf_21_brokeup_with_me_20_i_need_help/,"My gf broke up with me a week ago because of a small argument we've been together for almost 4 years.. she start her intership last may and will be finish by the end of july however its very far from where we lived . Most of our argument has been resolved quickly before i tried to apologize to her but now she doesnt want to talk to me anymore because she's confuse if she still loves me. She broke and form on contact and block me on all sorts of social media we use to communicate. 

I try to contact her in any way i can but to no avail.after a few days  Luckily i remember one of her accounts on facebook (she has 2 btw) i login and try to talk to her and she replied to me and says that she think and cried about wheter she still loves me or not she then told me that she then told me to break up and just want us to be friends and stuff like that i tried to change her mind but to no avail .then i ask her if any thirdparty is involved she says no. 

After a few days i try to contact her again and tell to unblock me she did. Then i still try to ask for an apology and if she can still change her mind but when we talk she always says that she just us to be friends then i tried to ask her to a party this last saturday she accepts it. In the party in the party i have friends and family that welcome her they know about the breakup. At the party tried to give her some gifts (with sentimental value to her)with letters without other ppl seeing atleast. She then told me to go somewhere we can talk one on one. 

At a room she started to cry and told me if she dont know if she will  accept it then she opened up something about a guy( also an intern but different school) in her internship courting with her and she told me that she is developing a feeling for the guy too but still not accepting him. She asked me why im still trying to fix our relationship I told her that i do it because i still love her we both cried and embrace each other she told me that she still care about me that she doesnt want to hurt me. Then i  open somenthing to her too that i tried to change myself since the breakup that i feel her value more that i want to take more care of her sadly she said that she doesnt know we cuddle eachother for sometime like we used to do..

 I walk her home then after and talk about it more she told me that she is really confuse she told me again the she doesnt want to hurt me but cant decide if she tell the guy to stop. She told me that her friends(fellow intrerns) in her internship are a good friends of the guy that she is scared if they will hate her. I told her that what ever the other people says about her i will still be there for her. She appreciate it. 

After the day i tried to contact her in the morning she on her way to work again. She acted somewhat cold again to me i feel bad ofcourse knowing that she are with the guy again.
After that i always try to encourage her before and after her work. But one night she told me why i still trying to help her. I told her i just want to do it because shes special to me. She then ask me if ""what if we cant be together again?"" I told her atleast i did what my heart wants to and no regrets. She then told me that she can be surely give friendship to me. I ask her out again if we can go to enlistment and a date after together she accepts it. 

Now i dont know what to do i have so many thoughts on my mind i fear that she will accept the other guy before with have a date.. i think my chance on getting her back are getting slimmer because everytime she goes to work the guy is with her trying to win her heart more. I also thinks she brokeup with me because of the guy but doesnt want to tell me about it.

Hi mom. This last weekend our town had its festival again.  It was a lot of fun. Dad and I both won at bingo and I'm still playing the same carnival games from when I was little.  But it's still bittersweet cause you can't be here for it because you were supposed to be at the fair ten years ago, but you couldn't hold on anymore. It's been a decade without you, but I've been missing you so much lately. 

You've missed so much and there's so much I wish we could've talked about. For now I'll stick with the last year.  

Mom, last year I got engaged to this amazing guy who gave me a unique ring that's just perfectly me. You never got to actually meet him. But he did buy pet food at the store you worked at,  so you may have met him briefly. He's so supportive and understanding and very handsome. 

I recently graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in the top of my class. Your sister and her husband came to town. They've really mellowed over the years. I don't think you guys would fight as much anymore.

I've been looking for a job.  I've had several interviews,  but they haven't led to anything.  I'm starting to struggle to believe in myself. I know I don't have any real experience in my field besides schoolwork, but I just need someone to give me a chance. I didn't have a chance to get an internship while in school and it feels like that has completely messed up my career path. 

10 years later and there's still days I'm lost without you.  I might talk to you later about wedding plans. But that's all for now. "

I know not everyone reads every single prompt, but if you could at least read the very end that would make my day! Thanks!

# Animal Slut

In this prompt I could play as a woman who owns a farm, a zoo, a dog kennel, or a dog walking service. The animals however tend to get the better of me. Maybe it's something I do often, maybe its only for special occasions, maybe I'm experimenting, or maybe they take advantage of me. I would be interested in taking this to a really weird place and having me be able to get pregnant with the animals litter. The more exotic the animal the better

# Violence Slut

For this one I would either be a girl who loves violence, it turns me on and is the only way that I can cum. Maybe I hate the violence. The pain is too much but I can't cum without it. Maybe it doesn't turn me on at all and it's your thing, but you won't let me go without hurting me. I can see this one going a lot of different ways and being very depraved.

# Office Slut

In this prompt I was thinking that I could be a woman working in an office who gets used and abused by her superiors, or even the people below her. I could be a young intern who they use because she's going to be out of here in a little less than a year anyway. Or I could be a higher up who uses her body to get what she wants. There are lots of different ways that this could go.

# Festival Slut

For this Prompt I would play as a festival girl. You know the ones. I'd be dressed skimpy with tons of glitter covering my body. I would love it if you took advantage of me in the crowd or in my tent or somewhere else on the festival grounds. Drugs get thrown around a lot at these kind of things and I could see myself getting my drink spiked or something like that. Maybe I'm not a girl who does drugs very often, or I don't see any of this as sexual, but you decide to change that.

# Filthy Slut

In this prompt I would be a filthy little slut. And I don't just mean that I have a naughty mind, but I mean I roll around in the mud, I live in a literal trash heap, I piss or shit myself, I never wash, I shove food in my holes. There are tons of different kind of filth we could play with and I'd love to hear your ideas for some of them.These are just some of my prompts and I would love to hear what you think. All of these prompts are just suggestions or starters. Things can be tweaked or changed about any one of them. They could be combined or you could even come up with your very own idea. As you can also probably tell I am quiet dark and fucked up and if you want to get into some of those ideas I would really appreciate it! I can't wait to see what you guys have in store for me!

# Barbie Slut

I'm sure you all know the doll, Barbie. There's no way that she isn't a slut right? You know how people always say that if she was real her proportions would make her so top heavy and she wouldn't be able to stand without heels? I want to be turned into that. I want to live my life like Barbie. Not only the shopping and the clothes and the pink. But also the brainless cock sucking and fucking that she must constantly do.

# Daddy's Little Slut

For this scenario I was thinking that we could do a father/daughter RP. There are a few ways we could do this one. It could be father forcing himself on his daughter. Or it could be consensual. If we go consensual I am thinking something more like the Josie art. If you don't know what I'm talking about I would suggest checking out the pieces that Sparrow does of her.

# Trophy Slut

I want to be a trophy wife of some kind in this. This sort of fits in with the Barbie slut, but I think that there could be some fun variations on this. Maybe I'm a friend of your daughters but you decided to marry me. Maybe I'm like Missy (From Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure) You could play my older husband, or my younger step son, who really isn't that much younger than me. Can't wait to hear your ideas for this one!

# Furry Slut

This one kind of fits in with the Animal slut, but I was thinking more along the lines of Anthros and Yiffing. If you want this could probably be added to several of the other prompts as well!

These are just some of my prompts and I would love to hear what you think. All of these prompts are just suggestions or starters. Things can be tweaked or changed about any one of them. They could be combined or you could even come up with your very own idea. As you can also probably tell I am quiet dark and fucked up and if you want to get into some of those ideas I would really appreciate it! Tonight I am feeling extra fucked up and filthy so I would love that to be an aspect of these RPs I can't wait to see what you guys have in store for me!

8z8s3g,71,2018-07-16,Conflict with future MIL: should we still get married??,Caramel_skies,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8z8s3g/conflict_with_future_mil_should_we_still_get/,"I'm engaged to a wonderful person, but I recently found out there is zero chance I'll get along with his mother. Now I'm concerned if our marriage is going to work out if I'm always at odds with his mom.

Our relationship is a bit complicated. We've been a long distance couple for eight months. We live across the country from each other (I'm completing my undergrad and he's completing his MD). After eight months apart, I decided to take some time off school to be with him and also because I'm waiting to switch into another program. He just so happens to be graduating this year so he also gets a few months off. It was perfect timing. But as soon as his mom heard that I'd be moving in with him, she told him I was a gold digger who was trying to freeload off of him. Then insinuated that I'm trying to drop out of school and rely on him. She demanded that I pay rent (even though he owns the condo he's staying in). I've made it very clear to her when we met that I'm in a finance program, and I alternate between internships and school. The year before I moved in with my fiancé, I've worked eight months out of the year, and I've worked for consulting firms in Hong Kong and New York. I had a huge fight with my fiancé over this because he doesn't seem to understand why I'd be insulted. I could have gone anywhere during my time off. I could have went home and stayed with my parents, whom I only see once a year due to school and work. But I chose to stay with him, in a city where I have no family or friends, because I'm trying to spend as much time as I can with him as we still have a few years of long distance ahead of us.

Second conflict: when we got engaged. This time she truly freaked out and was saying things like how I'm ""sinking my claws into him and was using him because he'll soon be in an enviable position"". ""I'm a woman, so I know how she thinks,"" was what my fiancé repeated back to me. We got into another fight because even though we talked to DEATH about getting married, he now said he wanted to wait. The reason we wanted to make this commitment was because of the years of long distance ahead of us. We wanted to show each other that we are committed to each other no matter what so we can focus on building our careers, instead of rushing to end up in the same city.

During my fiancé's graduation was when I spend the most time with her. She was staying in the condo we were in and things just went downhill from there. I never knew this before, but everything she talks about revolves around conspiracy theories. It is absolutely insane, the things that come out of her mouth. There's no use providing a different point of view or changing her mind. Okay, fine. I'll just listen. But a few days before she left, she found the receipt for a pair of Stuart Weitzman boots I got, and she just LOST IT. She starts going on about how I can justify buying something not worth its value… I'm not even in a position where I'm earning money and I'm buying something so extravagant… she has never in forty years bought something like this…money doesn't buy taste…I'm just feeding into propaganda and buying from the Jews who are the 1&amp;#37; and owns all the store (huh???)…Victoria Secret models are just trannies who are exploited and forced to model…and somehow this all relates back to my boots.

This is the LAST straw. Not only has she been bringing this up to my fiancé for an entire week, she blatantly disrespected me and my family. I explained very clearly when she got upset about the boots that they were something I've been thinking of getting for two years. I recently asked my dad because I was so torn, wondering if they were worth it, he told me to go ahead and buy them (or he'd buy them for me). If my parents are okay with me spending this money, it's not her place to get upset. It's not my problem that she never bought anything like this in forty years. I'm not responsible for the way she lives. My family saves and spends appropriately, and I don't need anyone calling into question our financial awareness. Perhaps we have more disposable income, or perhaps we're not so frugal we're taking every penny into the grave. I don't need to justify something's value, but it's not *her* money I'm spending. I have also earned 43k in a year in between school terms in a year while I'm an undergrad student, which is more than she's earned in the last ten years since from what my fiancé tells me, she stays at home. She's quick to pass judgement about how I'm only trying to use her son, discrediting my future potential and all the hard work I've put into my degree. 

Anyone in the situation where they don't get along with their MIL, how much does it affect your marriage? If you were in my situation, would you be seriously reconsidering marrying your fiancé? "
8z90b0,206,2018-07-16,[OC] Interesting Transfers you might have missed in Europe’s Top 5 Leagues,I_FEEL_LIKE_POGBA,soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8z90b0/oc_interesting_transfers_you_might_have_missed_in/,"Bored at my internship so thought I’d write this up.

I’ve tried to find some less talked about, but nonetheless really interesting transfers that have flown under the radar - I will discuss some statistics of each player, why the transfer is interesting and what I think the transfer will add to the team - have put quite a few hours into researching each player, so feedback is appreciated.

I’ve also tried to include a variety of teams, so I’ve avoided including multiple transfers from the same club.


Premier League


Marc Navarro, 23, RB/CB

Espanyol to Watford, £3m

A product of Barcelona’s youth academy, Navarro scored 3 goals in 36 appearances for Espanyol and reportedly attracted interest from many top European clubs. With Watford having one of the oldest average squad ages in the Premier League, Navarro’s youth will certainly rejuvenate their back line.


Florin Andone, 25, ST

Deportivo La Coruna to Brighton, £5m

A hard working, powerful Romanian striker who has scored 18 goals in 69 appearances for the Spanish side will be the 14th Romanian to play in the Premier League after his side was relegated from La Liga last season. Brighton have found themselves a bargain because of this, with his transfer fee reportedly being slashed from £17.5m to £5.25m. 


Josh Murphy, 23, LW/RW

Norwich to Cardiff City, £11m

The twin brother of Newcastle youngster Jacob Murphy, Josh Murphy will be joining his twin in the Premier League as Neil Warnock’s first signing of the summer. The England U20 international contributed 11 goals and 3 assists in 45 appearances for Norwich last season and becomes Cardiff’s most expensive signing since Gary Medel. His versatility on both flanks and also being able to slot in as a centre forward makes him a very useful player to have in Cardiff’s squad although his inconsistency could prove issues in Cardiff’s fight to stay up.


David Brooks, 21, CAM

Sheffield United to Bournemouth, £12m

The young Welsh starlet sparkled in the Championship last season and has immense technical ability that will suit Bournemouth’s style of football superbly. The former Manchester City youngster was rumoured to have interest from most top 6 clubs in England, and is certainly a coup for Bournemouth if he develops into the playmaker they hope he can become.


Mohamed Elyounoussi, 23, LAM

Basel to Southampton, £16m

Originally from Morocco, Elyounoussi is a 23 year old Norwegian international who has bounced around some of Europe’s smaller leagues before finally getting his Premier League move after an outstanding season with Basel where he scored 13 goals and helped Basel progress out of the group stages of the Champions League. With the departure of Dusan Tadic, Mark Hughes will hope the little Norwegian can replace the creativity that Tadic provided.


Issa Diop, 21, CB

Toulouse to West Ham, £22m

One of the most highly rated young French defenders in a class which has a plethora of talent, Diop is part of West Ham’s incredible summer of transfers which will give new manager Pellegrini a great squad to manage. Making his debut in November 2015, Diop’s leadership quickly allowed him to rise to club captain in April 2017, making 34 Ligue 1 appearances last season. At 6 foot 4, he becomes West Ham’s tallest player.



Serie A


Justin Kluivert, 19, LW

Ajax to Roma, £15m

After the disgruntled wonderkid expressed his desire to leave Ajax, Roma pounced at the opportunity to sign one of the most exciting young players in Europe. Already winning his first senior cap for Holland in March, Kluivert scored 10 goals in 30 appearances last season and appears to have all of the abilities to become a top player, just as his father was.


Lautaro Martinez, 20, ST

Racing Club to Inter, £20m

Another wonder kid to join the Serie A,Lautaro ‘The Bull’ Martinez joins Inter’s rich history of having Argentinian attackers and has a goal scoring record in South America that can only be described as impressive. A clinical finisher who is also a hard worker off the ball, don’t be surprised to see Martinez bang in goals for fun in Italy, like his predecessors Tevez and Crespo.


Fabian Ruiz, 22, CM

Real Betis to Napoli, £26.5m

Part of an exhilarating Real Betis team last year, new manager Ancelotti signed Ruiz to add greater strength in Napoli’s midfield, and Fabian Ruiz will provide that and much more, including assists and a goal threat. Having rising through the Real Betis youth academy, Ruiz has made 59 appearances for the senior side and joined Napoli amidst interest from Real Madrid and Barcelona. With the exit of Jorginho, this signing could prove to be crucial in helping Napoli remain at the top of the Serie A.


Joao Cancelo, 24, RWB

Valencia to Juventus, £35m

Amidst the headlines of another Portuguese star going to Juventus, Cancelo joins a star studded list of Juventus signings which will propel them to one of the favourites to win the Champions League. Spending last season on loan at Inter Milan, Cancelo is well adjusted to Italian football. As he shares the same agent as Ronaldo, his signing reportedly was one of the catalysts for Ronaldo’s move to Juventus, which is why this transfer is so fascinating.



Ligue 1


Danilo, 22, CDM

Braga to Nice, £7m

After plying his trade in Portugal, the young Brazilian made his move to the South of France, joining a youthful Nice side. He captained Brazil in the U20 World Cup and was a mainstay in a Braga side that finished 4th in the Portuguese league. He will certainly aim to replace Seri’s energy in the Nice midfield.


Willem Geubbels, 16, ST

Lyon to Monaco, £14m

The first player born in the 21st century to play in Ligue 1, Geubbels joins Monaco’s rank of starlets and will hope to emulate Martial’s career path, as he was also bought from Lyon at a similar age and sold for £61m at the age of 19. He will certainly be one of the most popular players in Fifa career modes for many years to come.


Jordan Siebatchu, 22, ST

Reims to Rennes, £10.5m

Scoring 17 goals in 35 appearances in French’s second division, this Franco-American striker who is eligible to play for USA is certainly one to watch for any soccer fans.




Bundesliga


Marcelo Saracchi, 20, LB

River Plate to RB Leipzig, £12m

RB Leipzig are a club who have an excellent scouting system, and they have identified Saracchi as a versatile left sided player who can also be compatible on the wing. Originally from Uruguay, this young man could be a fixture in their side for years to come.


Alassane Plea, 25, ST

Nice to Monchengladbach, £20m

Rejecting Premier League interest to ply his trade in Germany, Plea had an outstanding season in France, scoring 21 goals last season. Plea is a streaky player, scoring most of his goals in spurts but when he is on form he is a pacey inside forward who can score 4 goals in a game, as he did this year against Guingamp.


Paulinho, 18, ST

Vasco de Gama to Bayer Leverkusen, £21m

Continuing their tradition of cultivating Brazilian youth, Leverkusen will be delighted to sign Brazilian wonderkid Paulinho due to financial difficulties for the Brazilian club. The U20 international scored 3 goals in 18 appearances for the club who has helped develop stars such as Coutinho and Allan.



La Liga


Mouctar Diakhaby, 21, CB

Lyon to Valencia, £13m

This talented young French international joins Valencia under plenty of Premier League interest - he is a ball playing defender who will slot in nicely to the fast pace of La Liga.


Karl Toko Ekambi, 25, ST

Angers to Villarreal, £20m

A pacey, technical Cameroon international who scored 17 goals in Ligue 1 last season joins a host of Ligue 1 top performers to move to other leagues. An excellent player on the counter attack, Villarreal will hope Ekambi can produce similar form to last season,


Ibrahim Amadou, 25, CDM

Lille to Sevilla, £22m

Sevilla’s highly lauded transfer policy could have another success in their hands with the Lille captain Amadou joining them after making 102 appearances for the French club. Amadou can also slot in as a CB, which makes him a versatile player to steel up Sevilla’s side.

Hierbij bied ik u aan de antwoorden op de vragen van het lid Kerstens &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; inzake het bedrijf Supreme Group. De vragen zijn ingezonden op 27 juni 2018 jl. &amp;#40;kenmerk 2018Z12618&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
DE MINISTER VAN DEFENSIE  
&amp;nbsp;    
Drs. A.Th.B. Bijleveld-Schouten  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoorden op de vragen van het lid Kerstens &amp;#40;PvdA&amp;#41; aan de minister van Defensie over ‘de frauduleuze praktijken van NAVO’s cateraar Supreme’ met kenmerk 2018Z12618 &amp;#40;ingezonden 27 juni 2018&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
1  
Heeft u kennisgenomen van het bericht ‘Hoe cateraar Supreme de NAVO een oor aannaaide’ van 23 juni 2018? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.   
&amp;nbsp;    
2  
Heeft u contact gehad met andere landen over hun ervaringen met het contracteren met private bedrijven? Zo ja, met welke landen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
3  
Waarom is er voor gekozen, ondanks de onervarenheid met contracten met private beveiligers, zelf een contract met Supreme af te sluiten? Is overwogen om voor de proviand voorziening aansluiting te zoeken bij een ander land? Zo ja, welke? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
4  
Waren ten tijde van het afsluiten van het contract met Supreme ook andere leveranciers werkzaam in Afghanistan? Zo ja, heeft u contact gehad met de andere leveranciers?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij iedere missie onderzoekt Defensie of zij taken zelf uitvoert of dat zij deze uitbesteedt. Hierbij spelen bedrijfsvoerings-, financiële en pragmatische overwegingen een rol. Aanbestedingen verlopen volgens een procedure en worden zorgvuldig toegekend. Waar mogelijk wordt daarbij samengewerkt met bondgenoten, of met de NAVO Support and Procurement Agency. Dit is een uitvoerend orgaan van de NAVO waarmee landen worden ondersteund voor logistieke zaken en aanbesteding.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Gezien de logistieke uitdagingen en veiligheidsrisico’s voor het bevoorraden van de operaties is slechts een gering aantal bedrijven in staat deze diensten te leveren. Supreme Group &amp;#40;SG&amp;#41; is in Afghanistan, na het zorgvuldig doorlopen van de aanbestedingsprocedure, de opdracht gegund.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer contracten met leveranciers reeds zijn gesloten, worden deze in principe niet gedeeld tussen partners, vanwege commerciële vertrouwelijkheid. Het is echter bekend dat andere bondgenoten in Afghanistan ook gebruik maakten van de diensten van de SG.  
&amp;nbsp;    
5  
Was u op de hoogte van de hoorzitting van de Amerikaanse senaatscommissies van Toezicht in 2013? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, welke gevolgen heeft u aan de uitkomst van die hoorzitting gegeven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja. De uitkomst van de hoorzitting had voor de samenwerking tussen SG en Nederland geen gevolgen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
6  
Heeft u contact gehad met uw ambtgenoot in de Verenigde Staten &amp;#40;VS&amp;#41; na afloop van de hoorzitting van de Amerikaanse senaatscommissies van Toezicht in 2013? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, welke opvolging heeft u daaraan gegeven?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Gelet op de bovenstaande beantwoording was daar geen aanleiding toe.  
&amp;nbsp;    
7  
Op basis van welke totaalkosten over de periode 2006-2009 heeft u de 2,8 miljoen teveel betaalde euro’s van Supreme teruggekregen? Hoe is het teveel betaalde bedrag berekend en door wie?  
&amp;nbsp;    
In de antwoorden op de Kamervragen uit 2016 &amp;#40;kenmerk 2016Z11247&amp;#41; wordt de werkwijze van de Audit Dienst Defensie &amp;#40;ADD, tegenwoordig Auditdienst Rijk, ADR&amp;#41; toegelicht. Bedragen en berekeningen zijn te vinden in de brief van 6 juli 2016 &amp;#40;kenmerk BS2016011591&amp;#41; waarin uw Kamer vertrouwelijk de rapporten over de bij SG gehouden audits zijn aangeboden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
8  
Heeft u ooit overwogen een ruwe schatting te &amp;#40;laten&amp;#41; maken van het teveel betaalde aan Supreme op basis van openbare gegevens? Zo nee, waarom niet? Zo ja, wat is daarvan de uitkomst?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ik heb vertrouwen in de audits die zijn gedaan en het oordeel van de ADR. Ik zie dan ook geen reden om de audits over te doen.  
&amp;nbsp;    
9  
Had de ambtenaar van de Centrale Organisatie Integriteit Defensie &amp;#40;COID&amp;#41;, die de melding van Chris Vos heeft ontvangen, nog andere mogelijkheden om de kwestie intern aan te kaarten? Zo ja, welke? Zo nee, welke instructies gelden er nu voor vergelijkbare meldingen bij de COID die wel de integriteit betreffen met negatieve gevolgen voor Defensie maar geen integriteitsschendig zijn van een Defensiemedewerker?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Meldingen die bij de COID kenbaar worden gemaakt, worden, met instemming van de melder, door de integriteitsadviseur doorgeleid naar de verantwoordelijke lijnmanager of aanbestedende partij. Als de melding betrekking heeft op strafbare feiten wordt de melder ook altijd aangegeven dat hij of zij hier aangifte van kan doen bij de politie of, als het Defensiepersoneel betreft, de Koninklijke Marechaussee.  
&amp;nbsp;    
10  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wanneer Defensie private partijen inhuurt, hoe is dan de controle op integriteitsschendingen geregeld? Hoe kunt u voorkomen dat vergelijkbare gevallen van integriteitsschending door derden, die ten nadele zijn van Defensie, zich wederom voordoen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij het sluiten van contracten door de Rijksoverheid geldt in bepaalde gevallen een auditbeding, zo ook bij SG. Dit betekent dat de ADR tijdens de looptijd van contracten audits kan uitvoeren over de geleverde dienstverlening.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Private partijen kunnen, in geval van een Europese aanbesteding, op basis van de Aanbestedingswet uitgesloten worden van deelneming. Afhankelijk van het type opdracht kan de inkooporganisatie facultatieve uitsluitingsgronden toevoegen zoals prestaties uit het verleden.  
&amp;nbsp;    
11  
Overweegt u alsnog een strafrechtelijke vervolging analoog aan de VS? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bij de audits over de dienstverlening is geconstateerd dat Supreme Groupe G Defensie te veel had berekend voor een aantal diensten. Naar aanleiding van de audits is gezamenlijk gewerkt aan herziening van de contractvoorwaarden om herhaling te voorkomen en de overeenkomst te verbeteren. Vanwege de aard van de bevindingen en het feit dat het te veel betaalde bedrag is terugbetaald aan Defensie, heeft de ADR geoordeeld dat er geen aanleiding was voor aangifte.  
&amp;nbsp;    
12  
Hoe gaat u voorkomen dat de uitbesteding van de logistiek voor de militaire missie in Afghanistan de staat verzwakt als de beveiliging van de private transporten deze &amp;#40;mogelijk&amp;#41; ondermijnt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Zoals beschreven in de reactie op het AIV advies aangaande de inzet van civiele dienstverleners in operatiegebieden &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 31 200 X, nr. 116&amp;#41; werkt Defensie aan het verbeteren van veiligheid en stabiliteit ter bevordering van staatsvorming. Stimuleren van de lokale economie draagt hieraan bij. Vanuit wederopbouwperspectief is het van belang om, indien de veiligheidssituatie het toelaat, diensten door lokale partijen te laten uitvoeren. Een andere reden om van lokale partijen gebruik te maken, is om de inzet van militaire capaciteiten zoveel mogelijk te richten op het uitvoeren van militaire kerntaken binnen het vastgestelde mandaat.   
&amp;nbsp;    
In deze kabinetsreactie is tevens gemeld dat de groei van de inzet van particuliere beveiligingsbedrijven in operatiegebieden niet onomstreden is. Er moet altijd een zorgvuldige afweging gemaakt worden bij de inhuur van &amp;#40;lokale&amp;#41; beveiligingsdiensten. De regering ondersteunt nationale en internationale initiatieven om het functioneren van deze sector aan duidelijke normen en regels te binden.   
&amp;nbsp;    
13  
Wat is uw standpunt over de aansprakelijkheid van Nederland voor slachtoffers die vallen bij de door Defensie ingehuurde private bedrijven? Op welke manier geeft u invulling aan de aanbeveling van de Adviesraad Internationale Vraagstukken &amp;#40;AIV&amp;#41; om een zo ruim mogelijke invulling aan het beginsel staatsaansprakelijkheid te hanteren?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Nederland is niet aansprakelijk voor schade die zich bij de civiele dienstverlener en derden &amp;#40;waaronder de werknemers van die dienstverleners&amp;#41; voordoen. In de kabinetsreactie op het desbetreffende AIV-advies &amp;#40;Kamerstuk 31 200 X, nr. 116&amp;#41; wordt het kabinetsstandpunt ten aanzien van staatsaansprakelijkheid nader toegelicht.    
&amp;nbsp;    
14  
Wat was de contractduur met Supreme omtrent de levering van proviand? Waarom heeft u de samenwerking met Supreme tot 1 december 2017 laten doorlopen, ondanks eerdere berichten dat Supreme onnodige hoge kosten doorberekende bij leveranties? Heeft u bij de NAVO geïnformeerd nadat zij in 2015 het brandstofcontract met Supreme niet heeft verlengd of er andere leverancier voorhanden waren die eventueel de levering van proviand hadden kunnen overnemen? Zo nee, waarom niet?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Defensie heeft diensten aan SG uitbesteed in Afghanistan &amp;#40;tot 2010&amp;#41; en Mali &amp;#40;t/m 2017&amp;#41;. Defensie heeft in 2011 een raamovereenkomst gesloten met vaste prijzen en tarieven met een looptijd tot 1 augustus 2015. Hierna zijn tot aan 1 december 2017 langer lopende nadere overeenkomsten gesloten. De redenen hiervoor waren bovenal een pragmatische aanpak en zekerheid. Destijds was nog niet bekend hoe lang de missie zou duren en of het zinvol zou zijn om een aanbestedingsprocedure, welke minimaal zes maanden duurt, te starten.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Daarnaast was het eerdere geschil met SG naar behoren opgelost en waren er geen klachten over de dienstverlening.   
&amp;nbsp;    
De levering van proviand aan Nederland en de levering van brandstof aan de ISAF-missie in Afghanistan zijn twee verschillende opdrachten voor verschillende diensten van SG. Voor nadere informatie over de brandstofleveranties in Afghanistan verwijs ik u graag naar de beantwoording van de Kamervragen die eerder naar uw Kamer zijn gestuurd op 13 januari 2017 &amp;#40;kenmerk 2016Z23277&amp;#41;.  
&amp;nbsp;    
15  
Bij wie kopen de Duitsers het proviand voor de missie in? Welke kosten zijn daar voor Nederland aan verbonden?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Duitsland heeft in Gao, Mali &amp;#40;Camp Castor&amp;#41;, een contract met Valiant Integrated Services. Dit bedrijf heeft SG overgenomen. De precieze kosten die verbonden zijn aan de levering van proviand door Duitsland aan Nederland worden momenteel nader uitgewerkt in een overeenkomst.

It's not something your company usually does, but I'd begged him and I guess he'd begged you because one interview later I'm sitting at the desk outside your office. My desk. It's a little dull, my main job seems to be managing your phone lines, and making sure you don't run out of coffee, but I'm also getting very well acquainted with the copy machine and the backlog files that are slowly migrating to the storage room.

Oh, and you.

It started off innocently enough, brushing a little too close to me if we passed in the hall, or your hand lingering against mine as you accepted the files I'd hand you. I won't pretend I didn't like it. It was flattering to think a man like you would be interested in me. And maybe I played into it a little. Maybe one or two buttons would come undone on my blouse throughout the day. And okay, maybe I spent more time on my hair and makeup, and yes I'd started wearing heels most days instead of the much more comfortable flats that now sat unused in my closet, but that didn't mean anything... Did it?

I tell myself it doesn't. I tell myself it didn't mean anything when you'd complimented me on my skirt as I bent over to pull something from a bottom drawer. I tell myself it didn't mean anything when your hand lingered on the small of my back as you lead me into your office. I tell myself it doesn't mean anything when you ask me if I can stay late tonight. I just wish someone would remind the butterflies in my stomach of that.

""You sure you're okay staying late, Nora?"" my dad asks, walking past my desk with an arm full of folders he's taking home with him. ""You don't have to just because he asks.""

""I know,"" I answer, ""I just want to make a good impression, you know what it's like trying to get a job, this internship is going to help me later, I just wanna make sure I get a good reference.""

""Well, just call me when you get home, alright?""

""Promise,"" I tell him, watching him leave, and the last few stragglers follow soon behind him. The quiet makes me uneasy, the office feels strange without the low buzz of chatter or the sound of copies running and phones ringing. There's just the quiet sound of my fingers on the keyboard and the soft tapping of my foot beneath my desk.

Every few moments my eyes are pulled away from the emails I'm answering to look at my phone. Any moment now that button is going to glow red and I'll hear you calling me in. You'll just want me to dig out some files, I tell myself. Or set up a few dozen copies of something to get overnighted. That's all. What else could it be?

But still, my heart skips a beat when that light goes on and I hear your deep voice come over the phone's speaker telling me to come in.

I stand, straightening my skirt and smoothing my blouse. ""It's just a project,"" I whisper to myself, taking a deep breath before crossing to your door. Pressing down on the handle the dark wood swings in, and I step through. ""You wanted to see me, sir?""

**Status: Closed**

****

Hey, I'm looking for someone to play my father's boss, who has turned his eye towards his innocent little intern. Maybe my father's screwed up and I need to make it up to you, or maybe you just want me to show how much I appreciate this opportunity. However it happens you'll see to it that I'm bent over your desk begging for your cock.

I’m looking for something long term, so take your time getting a reply in, pinky swear I won't pick a partner for at least six hours, possibly 24, we'll see. I'll note when I have. *Please* include some in character writing in your reply, it's important for me to know how you write, though I'm willing to overlook that should you have a decent post history.

You can find an overview of my kinks and limits [here](https://i.imgur.com/44tCjod.png). Further details available upon requests, anything not red I’m happy to do or could be talked into for the right partner."
8zatm6,43,2018-07-16,How to Write More,Gereshes,Blogging,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/8zatm6/how_to_write_more/,"#  Running out of Time

When I started my blog, I wanted to post every Monday. I worried that I might not have enough good ideas to post every week, but that turned out to be the wrong worry. As the weeks went by, my ideas list of articles to write, just like the books on my nightstand, kept growing.

My worry about not having enough ideas disappeared, but in its place appeared a new problem. Not having enough time to write. I was juggling classes, friends, research, and writing a blog. Somehow, I was always just finishing up the blog post the day or two before I was scheduled to post. As the weeks went on, the time between finishing my post, and my scheduled posting time just got smaller and smaller. I was now waking up at 4am to finish my posts the day of posting. The worst part was that finals week was about to begin, and life was about to get a lot more hectic. I barely got through finals week while still maintaining my post schedule and I decided something had to change. It’s at that point I picked up How to Write a Lot by Dr. Silvia.

### How to Write a Lot

How to Write a Lot is a rather short and easy book to read. I went through it in one night. The main takeaway of the book comes in chapter 2; in order to write more, you need to set aside a regularly scheduled and dedicated period of time just to write. This means no more writing just when you feel like it. During that scheduled period of time, you write. No phones, no twitter, no distractions just write.

### My Writing Schedule

I’m a morning person so I decided that the two hours after I wake up will be my designated writing time. I’d brew myself a cup of coffee, fill up my water bottle, start a two-hour countdown on my phone and then toss it onto my bed so that it’s out of reach.

A side note about music and writing. I find I can’t write well with music on in the background, so I make a conscious effort to keep my headphones off. If you can write with music, have some music playing, but I’d suggest trying to write without any music a few times. It may feel more boring and tedious, but I found I’m more conscious about what I write when I don’t have music.

Now, two hours is a long time, and that can make it hard to fill the entire time with writing. Usually, about 10 minutes in I’ve drunk all the coffee, and an hour in my mind begins to wander. I force myself to continue writing even if I can’t think of anything. Sometimes this means just sitting down at a table staring at a computer. Now this doesn’t mean I don’t take small breaks to go to the bathroom or get more water. It just means I don’t let myself take mental breaks like checking twitter. The longer I’ve kept up this schedule, the easier filling the two hours has become.

#### Writing is More than Just Writing

You may ask, “what if something else needs to be completed so that I can continue writing?”. Maybe you can’t write about 12th-century architecture without reading a certain book chapter. I’d respond with, then read that book chapter. Writing is more than just writing, there’s a lot of support activities that go into it. Research, editing, corrections, and reviews are all part of the writing process. If there’s something you need to do to support your writing, do it as part of this time, just don’t get carried away.  Don’t let your other tasks push out all of your writing time. One thing that I like about forcing myself to write for two hours, is that I always get some writing done. Even if there’s a lot of other work, I still have time to write.

One thing that I try to avoid in my writing time is email. They are necessary, and technically fall into the category of writing, but I find email to be distracting. I limit myself to only responding to the most important emails that I know I need to get to from the day before. If there aren’t any email’s from the day before, I won’t even open my email to check it. When I’m done with writing, the business day is just starting, and most sane people will be fine with you responding at the start of the business day to an urgent email that came in overnight.

#### Rewards

When I finish my two hour wiring period I like to give myself a little reward. I’ll brew a second cup of coffee, eat breakfast, and goof off watching videos or reading something fun for a half hour. By doing something fun and enjoyable at the end, I look forward to my daily wiring schedule a little more.

### Results

The above sounds all well and good, maybe a bit harsh and rigid, but does it work?

Yes.

I now generally go from start to finish on a post for this site in two writing sessions. The first is to write down most of the content, the second is to finish writing, edit, and add in/ create any media. Generally, I write 2 posts a week, and sometimes I even knock out a third. It’s been so productive, I’ve started to build up a backlog of posts. This has helped allow me to not worry about writing when I was on trips with friends and family this summer. If this backlog continues to grow I may experiment with posting twice a week

#### An Unexpected Side Effect

When I started this regiment, I was expecting my ideas list to begin to shrink. It hasn’t. On the contrary, it has been growing faster than ever. Because I have been writing more, I’ve been trying out new ideas and formats. These new formats mutate and give me even more ideas to try out. For example, now that I had some time to work on posts a little farther away from my traditional content, I gave book reviews a try. I found that they make a nice post and then decided to do a review for How to Write a Lot. This post was supposed to be a book review but took a rather introspective turn into my process and habits for writing.  That got me thinking about starting a series on how I do certain small things like reading a scientific paper, self-teach from a textbook, search for an internship, etc…

The more you write, the more ideas you will come up with to write about. It’s a feedback loop of the best kind."
8zazhx,42,2018-07-16,Christianity Controversies: 3 - “America is a Christian Nation”,kibretw,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/8zazhx/christianity_controversies_3_america_is_a/,"**Summary:** America is not a Christian nation because God doesn’t have any kingdom in the world. The nation has been good for Christians as they are not officially persecuted, but it doesn’t mean it is God’s nation. The kingdom of God is in heaven and is represented on earth by the Church only.

**1) Can any country be Christian?**

No country in the world can be a Christian country for at least two reasons. One, Christianity is followed by choice and if we make it the rule of the land, then it no longer is true Christianity, but just a regular religion that looks like it.

The second reason is the kingdom of God has Christ as the king, and currently there is no nation in the world that has Christ as a king, president or prime minister. 

**2) Can some nations be more appealing to Christians?**

Most of the world has persecuted God's elect for as long as Christianity has existed, but some rulers have done favors to the Israelites, and later the church. A Babylonian king helped build Jerusalem's walls, a Roman king found Paul innocent, etc. So in short, some nations have been good for Christians. 

As Christianity grew, the Western world (mainly after Roman Emperor Constantine) became a safe place for Christians to live. Many missionaries were based in Europe and America when they traveled to expand the Gospel.

**3) Did the Founding Fathers want America to be a Christian nation?**

The Founding Fathers had a Christian background and most of what they wrote on the law has its roots in Christianity. An example is the freedom of religion, which is consistent with Jesus saying ""whoever wants to follow me"". I have also heard that they rejected monarchy because *only God is the king - which I am not sure if it's true.

But they did not envision America to be a Christian country, as they clearly made the church and the government two separate entities. If they wanted America to be Christian they would have appointed the church as the highest authority in the country.

**4) Did Jesus want the church to rule countries in the world?**

No matter what we think about government and the church, the only thought that matters is that of Jesus.

Remember... Jesus was tempted by Satan to become a ruler of the world, and he rejected it because that would mean worshiping the one who controls the world (Satan). This gives us an idea of what Jesus wanted to have part in, as far as the evil-controlled kingdoms of the world.

Then later in his teachings, he was very clear when he told his disciples what kind of kingdom he is starting. He told them they would be hated, persecuted and killed, let alone become rulers of a nation as they had hoped to be. After he was resurrected, the disciples asked him when he would bring back the kingdom to Israel. Jesus simply answered by saying they would be his witnesses starting from Jerusalem to the end of the world, giving them the blueprint of how his  international kingdom (the church) will grow. He never wanted to rule the world.

**5) Why is it dangerous to think America is a Christian nation?**

There are several problems that will arise from thinking America is a Christian nation. First of all it shows a misunderstanding of what Jesus wants us to do in this world. We are expected to take the Gospel from one country to another to be agents of his kingdom across the world. We can't associate a single country to the entire kingdom of Christ and make ourselves comfortable.

Another issue is that it will result in American Christians attempting to force others to be Christians. Obviously the only thing that we get from this is unbelievers getting the wrong message of Christ. No one in the world should be forced to become a Christian, and it won't even work as you can't change someone else's heart.

It will also hinder our view to ministering in other countries. As Christians, at least some of us are expected to move from place to place to preach the gospel and the rest of us would support that ministry with all we have got. There are many people who should be missionaries and go to some other country to preach, but they don't go and instead do something else here which is not fruitful. Some see missionary as some internship job that you do in summer, while in fact God might be calling us to go and preach and die in China. We should feel the urgency of missions and be ready to do whatever God calls us to do."
8zb4q6,2,2018-07-16,Need Perspective (Education),ScottishElan,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/8zb4q6/need_perspective_education/,"Good Morning/Afternoon,
I am a chemical engineering student and my inquiries pertain to my current situation. I am an incoming sophmore in my university's engineering program with a 3.35 GPA. My issues (other than GPA) are that I have had to retake 2 classes. This is primarily due to the severe depression that I have experienced while in college. As such this will put me at at least one semester behind if not a year.

How much will this effect my track for internships and future careers? Are internships and jobs even possible when they see that I have had to retake courses or experienced questionable academic semesters? Is it possible to recover from a poor start like this or would it be wise to switch majors. As someone who hasn't struggled academically until now I am internally panicking for what the future may hold. 

Any suggestions or guidence would be great and thanks in advance.

8zc2k4,6,2018-07-16,React Redux Architecture,trecluse,reactjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/8zc2k4/react_redux_architecture/,"Hello,

I am having a dilemma with the lead developer at work. I will start off by saying that I am an intern but have been developing with React/Redux for school projects and during my free time for the last two years. The lead developer has never used React or Redux (he's only used angular 1.x). He's mentoring me on how to architect my components but we're having some disagreements.

Were having some issues integrating Redux with react components. In this case, we have a paginated list component that loads more data on demand as the user scrolls down the list. My current implementation has a list eg. `&lt;UserList /&gt;` with the `&lt;PaginatedList /&gt;` component as a child. The `UserList` is connected to the user reducer in the redux store. The paginated list is used like this in the `UserList` component:

    const UserList = () =&gt;
    &lt;PaginatedList
      loadMoreData={this.loadMoreUsers}
      hasNextPage={this.props.page &lt; this.props.pageCount}
      dataSize={this.props.data.length}
      rowRenderer={this.rowRenderer}
      rowHeight={60}
    /&gt;
    
    // connect to redux here...

Anything that starts with `this.props.` is passed in via mapStateToProps in the connect HOC.

Now for his solution. He simply wants a component that handles any type of data. So instead of having a `&lt;UserList /&gt;` component, he wants a component that looks like:

    &lt;GenericPaginatedList
      crudService={this.usersCrudService} 
      rowRenderer={this.usersRowRenderer}
      rowHeight={60}
    /&gt;

So in this case the list could be used for Users or Todos in a Todolist by just swapping out the `crudService` prop.

I have some issues with this solution.

1. How does the redux store get updated inside the `GenericPaginatedList`? - he's not sure since he's never developed using React/Redux. He wants me to find out how or he's okay with this specific component not being connected to Redux.
2. How do you deal with having different architectures for different components? - Now some components are connected to redux, some are not. How do you manage all the state?
3. There are separation of concerns issues with the `GenericPaginatedList` \- Now the list has to worry about fetching the data and displaying it.

My concerns are that React is mainly a view library. Therefore, it's useful to keep business logic outside components. Currently all the business logic is inside redux actions which make calls to services (eg. `UserService`, `TodoService`). These services are only used inside the redux actions. I feel that the solution he presented is not as manageable and removes flexibility of the component.

Is this a common practice to pass a service or business logic executing object to the component? I've tried fighting back on this but due to his seniority, it's difficult to stand my ground.

If this is the common practice, is there a way to make the react-redux `connect` function more generic so that it can support multiple lists without the need for having an explicit `&lt;UserList /&gt;` or `&lt;Todolist /&gt;` component. I'm sorry this topic is very difficult to explain properly and I am exhausted by fighting for what I think is the right architecture. I can clarify more if there are any questions.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
 
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor [sandra](http://i.imgur.com/w5B2CB9.jpg) babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her [the myriad of inappropriate outfits](http://i.imgur.com/PXi5ffR.jpg) she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy [low cut top and skirt]( http://i.imgur.com/hCCRZlB.jpg ) when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

8zddue,52,2018-07-16,Left for good.. Rocking a tattoo and happy,amyo3,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/8zddue/left_for_good_rocking_a_tattoo_and_happy/,"Inspired by /r/mxrtxdina post, I have decided to tell my story. After which, I will give some advice and things I wish I done better. 

I am a Middle Eastern women with an Arab passport. 

As I got older, it became harder to digest Islam and it kept making less and less sense to me. Having doubts in religion scared me and I wished then that I would believe in it. But, I just couldn't. No matter how hard I prayed, I just didn't and couldn't believe in it. I wanted to talk freely about my doubts without being shamed. I was lucky enough to meet someone online who made me feel free. He is now my husband and we are unbelievably happy together.

However, my journey to free myself from religion was not easy. I decided in 2014 to leave my middle eastern home country. The plan was that my husband, then boyfriend, and I would get married a year later and that he was so supportive that he agreed to support me while I continue my higher education. I worked, saved everything, applied to school, got accepted to my first choice, quit my job after saving enough, bought a plane ticket, got on the plane, got married, then... I went back.

I naively went back because I thought my father was sick. That he needed to see that I am ok. That they have no choice but to let me leave again because I am married. That my brother had my back. I had to wait three miserable years to be able to leave again. I had to pretend to be a good muslim girl. I had to pretend that I made a mistake. That I wanted to separate from my husband. Only then, they finally took my on a vacation to a european country. I bought a train ticket and went straight to my husband. 

I got lucky to be honest, my family could have done much worse. 

Right now, I am just happy. My residency process is going smoothly. I am not completely settled but I am getting there. Life is just good. 

--

My advice to anyone who plans to leave:

Before leaving, it is essential to not draw attention to yourself. Do not act out, do not make you family suspicious. Pretend to agree with your family, and if you can't then just limit your contact. 

To prepare for leaving, you need save some money. I worked and saved everything. When I didnt want my parents to know that I was saving, I opened a separate bank account. I took a job and said it was an internship. 

My husband and I tried contacting some organization but they weren't of much help because of my nationality. Instead we contacted lawyers. Many lawyers meet remotely and can give advice on what to do.  

The most difficult part for me was getting my passport. The first time I left, I took it just a day before I left. The second time, we were on vacation. I took it and left immediately. I think the safest option to leave is during a vacation.

Once you leave, do not contact your family right away. Send a message letting them know that you left, and that is it. Nothing good can come out of explaining your position after you leave. If you stay in contact with someone, do it only because they seem genuinely willing to just stay in touch. Make it clear that you are not going back. When I stayed in contact with my family, they thought that it meant that there was a chance that I would go back. It was not good for anyone. 

I hope my story and my advice can help someone or at least give a tiny bit of hope. Thank you for reading

The lady in line in front of us, the Lift driver, the concierge, the waitress... Benign *loves* talking to strangers.

(In hindsight, she may ignore signage in airports because it gives her an excuse to approach the help desk and have a conversation about how *confusing* and *impossible* it is and can't you help poor little her find her way to where she's going, she can't even read the boarding pass it's all so confusing.  Reminder: I am so over her behavior right now, and we hates her, precious.)

I wouldn't mind her talking to strangers - it gives me a break, and that's a good thing - except that she tends to change reality.  And convince herself that her version of reality is true.  And I'm left wondering if I'm the crazy one?

**Example:**

&gt;We have just finished a morning at an outdoor attraction, that is a couple miles from our next sightseeing location.  It was really cool, but it was outdoors and hot and crowded.  Still, we're getting ready to go, and there are some cool things to see along the way.  It is, however, hot and humid, being that we're in the middle of summer.

&gt;Benign asks if we should Uber instead of walking (she says Uber, uses Lift, and only just realized that it's possible to give a tip through the app.  whatever, BEC), seeing as it's hot.  I say ""If you want to, I'd prefer it, but I'm good walking.""

&gt;Benign calls for Lift.  When the car arrives, she tells the driver all about how she knows it's a short drive, but her daughters insisted on this because it's so hot, and isn't she a wonderful, thoughtful mother?

I guess another thing that bugs me about her unreliable narrator schtick is that she frequently uses it to make herself look good, and me/my sisters look bad.  Like, I just wish she wouldn't talk about how *I* insisted, when that's not what happened.  

Or there's another way she does it, in **Example 2:**

&gt;Tuesday, several of the cultural things Benign is interested in seeing are closed.  A lot of things are open, including historical sites, zoos, and cultural things that Sister and I are interested in.  So there are a lot of options for what we can do on Tuesday.

&gt;Benign, having seen two things closed, gets it into her head that *everything* is closed, and therefore the only thing to do is get in Sister's car and drive an hour out of town for \*random cultural experience\*.  Which isn't in and of itself a bad idea; the issue I have is that Benign has made it into this whole story about how there was *nothing* open on Tuesdays, and she swooped in with her spur-of-the-moment idea and Saved The Vacation.

&gt;Like, this is what she said: ""It's so wonderful that there was nothing open, because we got to do this \*random cultural experience\* that we never would have thought of otherwise!""

&gt;My response: ""Well, there was this museum I was interested in, or the zoo that Sister and I are both interested in seeing, but yeah, \*random cultural experience\* was cool.  So it's kind of more like we had a bunch of options, and chose to do this one, and it was really neat, right?""

&gt;*(Because I'm trying to find ways for Benign to not feel like the universe is trying to beat her down all time. Saying that \~nothing is open and it almost wrecked the trip\~ is just finding a reason to be a downer, and Benign really really doesn't need help with that, so I tried to help her see that we had a ton of cool options, and only had to pick one. Yes, I am stupid like that - Benign likes her victim/savior role too much.)*

&gt;Benign's response was to tell me that she prefers her version.  

Of course, there's the fun of sitting in the car with Benign and Sister^Who-Got-To-Skip-The-Trip and listening to the story of how Benign was faced with the insurmountable obstacles of daughters who didn't appreciate the trip (she had an impressive CBF when I mentioned a cool thing I noticed at a museum, because it went against her narrative of ""Daughters didn't care or get involved, but I soldiered on bravely and managed to have a good time"").

But let's look at Sister^Who-Got-To-Skip-The-Trip, for **Example 3** of Benign's an Unreliable Narrator:

&gt;Benign really liked pointing out to Sister^On-The-Trip and I (and any random stranger who would listen) that this entire trip was planned for Sister^Who-Got-To-Skip-The-Trip.  See, Sister^Who-Skipped is in college, studying a subject tangentially related to a museum in \*vacation location\*. *(It's kinda hard to write this understandably and maintain a reasonable amount of anonymity.)*  So, when Sister^Who-Skipped backed out, Benign was a bit miffed. After all, this entire trip was for Sister's^Who-Skipped benefit, after all.  Oh well, Benign will just make sure to take lots and lots of photos, while explaining to everyone in the area that they are for Sister^Who-Skipped, because this is all so relevant to her course of study and it's too bad she backed out last minute.

&gt;So, that's Benign's version.  Wanna know reality?

&gt;Last minute (read: a couple months before the trip), Sister^Who-Skipped got a long-shot but totally cool and career-developing internship.  When Benign was planning the trip, back in *December of last year,* Sister^Who-Skipped told her that she didn't want to make any summer travel plans, because she was trying to line up an internship for the summer.  Benign made the plans anyway.  Sister^Who-Skipped almost cancelled her awesome summer internship because she was terrified of Benign pitching a fit over the vacation that Benign booked anyways.  I pointed out that the confirmation on flights Benign emailed all of us said that the tickets are fully refundable, and that it just means none of us are stuck sharing a room with Benign (that would have been me, as both sisters are significantly younger than me and I am the closest thing Benign has to a Golden Child).

&gt;*Benign's version:* Sister^Who-Skipped is so ungrateful and missing out on awesome cultural experience because she couldn't be bothered to take a week off.

&gt;*Reality:* Sister^Who-Skipped is working on building skills and networking that will serve her really well in the very near future, and regrettably missing out on a vacation that she said she probably wouldn't be able to go on in the first place.

I guess this concludes Part 3 of ""I must've been taking crazy pills when I agreed to vacation with Benign.""  I think there are two more topics I want to cover, so stay tuned for Benign and Vacations: Tuesday (that will likely go up tomorrow)."
8zelgv,0,2018-07-16,Looking for a team - FPS Battle Royale Game,rafamundez,INAT,https://www.reddit.com/r/INAT/comments/8zelgv/looking_for_a_team_fps_battle_royale_game/,"**INSERT COOL INTRO AND TELL ME WHO TF YOU ARE**

Hey guys! I'm working on a new UE4-based FPS BR game. I'm looking to make enough of a prototype to make a kickstarter/indiegogo/crowdfund/etc. from it.  The immediate goal is to have 1 hi-res video demonstrating the early look/feel of the game (along with some small gifs/screenshots) and another video outlining the plan, timetable, features, etc. going forward.  

Me personally: I have a Master of Science (w/ a research-based thesis) in Electrical and Materials Science engineering so while I'm new to UE and game development, I'd like to think I'm a quick learner ;).  I’ve worked on many collaborative research projects, publications, in addition to a patent for multiple world-class University research groups.  On top of this, I worked on a research and advanced development team in a Fortune 500 company with a focus on fast prototyping.  All this basically means is that I have a lot of experience in leadership roles for teams/projects and know what it takes for a project to become successful.  I can talk to you for days about all the different things I've worked on if you want to know more!


**WHY ARE YOU MAKING THIS? ARE YOU BAT****** **CRAZY? WE ALREADY HAVE Fortnite, PuBG, etc. WITH MORE ON THE WAY**

You're right. There is Fortnite, PuBG, Islands of Nyne just hit early access, and Activision+EA are coming out with BR games in a few months too. So why am I doing this?... It’s because I *know* we can do a better job than them. Plain and simple, gamers are fed up with current Battle Royale game’s complacencies and major flaws.  While all of the current battle royale games are fun and I commend their pioneering of this genre, I know that a better one is just around the corner! My pitch for you is that that this will be a game made by gamers, for gamers.

Personally, I also know friends who have many 1000+ hours in BR games.  I have quite a few hours in that genre as well but not quite as high since...well, grad school (insert *heavy sigh*).  I’m aiming to leverage all I've learned about what people are looking for and have a lot of great ideas.  I also have 0 ego regarding ideas and am not afraid to implement anyone’s ideas to make a better game(and give proper credit where it’s due).


**OK, I MADE IT THIS FAR READING THROUGH YOUR OBLIGATORY BS. TELL ME ABOUT THE GAME**

FPS BR made with UE4 with an emphasis on realism. Without getting into too much detail about what the BR game would have and the unique aspects of this game, here is a small list of things it would have: realistic shooting physics (ie. bullet drop, bullet pen, bullet lead, prone, lean, etc.), MMR (tiers and ranks), customization (HUD, reticles, etc.), melee takedowns, vehicles, and much more!

**WTF DO WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL?**

-UE4

-Google Drive (unlimited storage)

-Discord Server

This is all I think we would need right now but if we think we need something else, I wouldn’t hesitate to get it.

**ALRIGHT, COOL. SO WTF ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FROM US?**

-Any UE4 experience is the priority; however, if you are motivated to learn how to use UE4 along with working on the project, I’m all for it too.  I feel like you can never have too much help in this area.  

-C++ programmers for UE4

-We do have 1 graphic designer on-board but the more the merrier.

-Some sort of audio engineer at some point.  We want to have in-game sound compression (no ear-splitting sounds while actually being able to hear footsteps).

From the numerous research projects, publications, patents, etc. I have worked on, my strength lies in what it takes to make a successful project. I’d be bringing all the supplemental work to the project (organization, design, “sales pitch,” etc.) along with learning UE along the way to provide any help I can since (while I’d like to pretend otherwise) I am still an Electrical Engineer at the end of the day.


**MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEEEYYY....MONEEEEYYY**[link]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXE_n2q08Yw)


All my experience with compensation is from grad school, internships, undergraduate research for credits, etc. which is not good with compensation. They are all based on “hey, you get to work on this (cool?) project where you get the chance to learn a lot but you are getting little to no compensation for it.”

In all reality, the first round of the kickstarter/indiegogo/crowdfunding is what will determine this.  If this ends up getting community support to proceed, that is when we would have a frank discussion about fair compensation, project needs, etc.  Before we submit the crowdfunding, we would have a discussion on what we would ideally need going forward (which would include compensation). What I can promise you is that if this project ends up blowing up or being successful, I will *never* ‘Zuckerberg’ you or anyone else. As someone who has been on the other end of it (unfortunately multiple times), I know how unbelievably crappy it is (feel free to ask me sometime about it but I’ll need to grab a beer first and so should you).

Something else you should know…. the goal is to make the game free-to-play with cosmetic microtransactions (*BUT ONLY AFTER THE GAME IS FULLY RELEASED*). Hence the reason that we ideally would get community support.  If we don’t end up having a successful crowdfunding then at that point we would need to have an honest discussion as to what the team wants to do going forward (do we want follow the game to completion?).


**WRAP IT UP DUDE, YOU’VE WRITTEN A BOOK HERE**


TL;DR, LMK if you’re interested in collaborating on a UE4-based FPS BR with an emphasis on realism! The goal is to make a prototype to get some sort of community funding for the game.  Feel free to PM me here, in the comments below, or on discord (Rafamundez#4838) regarding questions, comments, or any inquiries you might have!

8zeuai,137,2018-07-16,I am really concerned and disappointed with the current situation of this project.,Crypto_Req,RequestNetwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/RequestNetwork/comments/8zeuai/i_am_really_concerned_and_disappointed_with_the/,"I am really concerned and disappointed with the current situation of this project. I am worried competition will come and take a huge market share from Request Network and do so fairly easily. The following is a list of concerns I currently have for the team and community. I would appreciate it ""*if""* this gets enough up votes that an actual team member addresses these concerns.

# 

# Roadmap:

The first major concern is the roadmap. In my opinion, this is one of the main reason the price is suffering. The road map has changed since the whitepaper. Understandably, things change but the new “dynamic” roadmap is inexcusable. The roadmap doesn’t show progress, too generic to grab investors’ attention, and hard to tell what the team is really working/focused on. Sure it shows what the team is working on, but where are all those promised items in the whitepaper? I keep hearing that on-boarding PwC took time. But that does not excuse the multiple missed objectives from the whitepaper. The following is the original roadmap:

**Request Colossus: Q4 2017**

\-*Token Launch*

*-First version of Request working with Ethereum on Test Net*

*-Deploy the website to Create/Visualize and interact with Requests*

*-Add Request management of accounting concepts such as refund, credit note and purchase orders*

*-Release the API to create/read/update Requests*

*-Release technical papers about architecture, upgrades and accounting implementation*

**Request Great Wall: Q1 2018**

\-*First version of Request working with Ethereum on Main Net*

*-Deploy management of Crypto-currencies on Request (ERC20 tokens)*

*-Proof of concept: Request Core working with a Bitcoin Oracle*

*-Work on partnerships with Accounting, Payment and Audit firms*

*-Launch the Pay with Request project: an online button which offers an alternative to the traditional Pay with PayPal and Pay with credit card*

*-Outside audits of the Request Contracts*

**Request Stonehenge: Q2 2018**

*-POC of Scaling Request through a Plasma chain with PoS. Request will have to handle a heavy load of transactions*

*-POC of Increased Request Privacy using ZkSnarks20*

*-Add management of Fiat-currencies to Request (USD, EUR, CNY)*

*-Launch the Request and Transparency project. We will work with city halls, associations and government to publish real time information on their budget*

*-Organize discussion groups around Payment Requests with institutions such as World bank/IMF/ECB and the UN*

**Request Colosseum: Q3 2018**

\-*Deploy the Escrow extension to allow the release of funds upon delivery or upon satisfaction of other conditions*

*-Deploy the Tax extension to automatically pay taxes in real time*

*-Deploy the Down Payment extension to specify an amount to pay and a specific date on which to process it*

*-Deploy the Late Fees extension to specify penalties if a Business is not paid on time*

*-Add a Reputation Offchain layer* 

**Request Petra: Q4 2018 and after** 

*-Deploy the governance system (Vote/Token Chat)* 

*-Launch the “Internet of Things framework” project* 

*-Deploy Inter-currency settlement through REQ to facilitate international payments* 

*-Launch the Continuous Payment extension which will act as a Down payment with an infinity of micro payments*

According to the whitepaper roadmap it looks like the team over-promised and under delivered. What would any rational person call this? Would they say we got duped to give them our ICO money? The team is under-performing? Did the team over-promise us just to get the funding they need? I don't know how to feel about this, but the least I expect is an explanation for all the missed items on the whitepaper. Line by line I'd like an explanation. Simply stating, “We are moving to a dynamic roadmap to be flexible in the fast changing crypto world,” isn't enough. What did the team do if they didn't do what was promised? At the very least, the team can provide an explanation after taking 33.6 million dollars from investors with a promise that fell short. Yes, I understand it’s harder than it looks, but why promise it in the first place? And it’s okay to fall short, but we still need an explanation....item by item. And I don't want to hear the team doesn't owe us anything. Yes they do, we trusted them and gave them our money based on the whitepaper.

If there is something the team is working on that they cannot discuss that's fine, but there are ways around this. They can simply say we are currently working on an item that can't be discuss, more news to come in the future. Right now what I see is an overpromised and under delivered project. The team realized that the new dynamic roadmap was not well received by the community, so they said they will update the road map with progress bars…still waiting... and they need to add a lot more than just progress bars. They need to regain confidence in the community.

# Marketing:

Marketing is the second major concern and another reason the price is suffering. I cannot stress enough how important this is. When I tell an outsider about Request Network they are usually really interested. However, if I don't tell them or another member of the community does, then they won’t know. It is not my job or the community’s job to be doing this. Marketing doesn’t have to be expensive. All it takes is a simple active social media account. Hire an intern to do it. Shoot I bet members from the community would do that for free, not that they should. I understand the team doesn’t want to put a face on the project because it’s decentralized. However, currently we have nothing. ETH is decentralized, but Vitalik is very involved in the public eye. He has videos and presentations out there talking and explaining ETH. Request Network has nothing. Not a single video of a team member explaining Request Network on a grand scale. It’s unrealistic to expect everybody to read and understand the whitepaper without further clarifying the objectives of the project. Explain to investors and the average Joe that Request Network is more than a click to pay with crypto button. A video would do wonders.

We have an old and outdated website after being promised a new one in the AMA. I don’t want to hear it’s on the way. It’s either here or not. You claim crypto is fast paced and changing to justify the dynamic roadmap, yet everything you do is at a sloths pace. This new website is starting to sound like a false promise, just like the original roadmap. ""Ohh boy we got all this amazing stuff coming"" a year later and a lot is missing. Are we going to be waiting a full year for the new website...Come on fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... 

Additionally, I don’t want to hear the team is involved with the community. They post once every two weeks. Each update is less and less informative. I want to see engagement. I want to see YouTube videos, I want to see live AMA, I want to see activity. Right now it’s like the team is hidden in a cave and we don’t know what they are doing. I want to see the team with a smile on and confidently say for example “Fiat is coming! However, these are the issues we are facing now.” I don’t want them to hide behind a keyboard anymore.

When Apple releases a new phone, do they wait till the new phone/laptop/iPad/etc. are done to market it? I don’t want to hear, “We aren’t Apple.” We should aim to be a top company, hence, use top company marketing strategies. It’s not the community’s job to spread the word about Request. Shoot didn’t know Apple expected me to go out and market their product when I bought their stock. There are some unrealistic expectations going on. Investors gave money to the team to develop the product and that includes marketing. And I don’t want to hear the team is planning to market soon, because we are already late. And what I’m asking for can be done right now, without much cost. Making a video won’t take money away from developing… 

# Dapps:

Can anybody point me to a list of Dapps on the network? Nope because there isn't one...

I understand developers don’t need approval to build on network, but the team needs to keep track of this and publicize it. It will help with adoptions when people see all the capabilities. No hype around Dapps. Chango reddit has 15 subscribers. Let me repeat that, 15 subscribers. How will we get adoptions with no awareness? We live in an age of social media. How will people know about Request Network if they aren’t active on social media? And I’m not saying post a bunch of hype crap, just do something like post on Twitter about the Dapps. For example, “Chango app is now in the beta phase! Chango is a payment app similar Venmo. Link for more info”

# Price:

We are under ICO price which is inexcusable even in a bear market, but price is a reflection of market perception of the project. Yes, there may be some irrational pricing, but not to this extent. Currently, the price justifies how the team has been performing, plain and simple. If it was valued more the market would value it more. REQ lost 95&amp;#37; in value from ATH. Don’t want to hear that most coins lost this much. Most coins will go to zero. So are we in the crapcoins category now? We lost 60-70 places on the market cap rankings. Clearly that means we are being out performed. And I don’t want to hear there are new coins that pushed us down. That would be a fair thing to say if we dropped a few spots, but interest and volume stayed decent. We claim to be a top coin but all indications are we are just an “average joe” coin.

I don’t want to hear the team doesn’t care about price. They took money from investors, it’s their responsibility to perform. The team owns 15&amp;#37; of the coins, so they should care. I don’t want to hear ""then sell if you aren’t happy"". I can voice my opinion. Most jobs have performance appraisals. This is my view of the current situation. If I’m wrong then it’ll show in the votes and comments. If people feel the same way it’ll show too. I’m tired of this constant “You’re FUDing because you don’t kiss the floor the team walks on” mentality. If you can’t take criticism then this is not the space for you. If I was FUDing I wouldn’t take the time to give an in depth analysis of what my concerns are. I don’t want to hear, “It has only been a few months and this is a long term project.” Yes, this is a long term project; however, each step along the way matters and we have missed a few steps already. I have real concerns and want real answers. I wouldn't be asking the team to respond. Sometimes the team needs a wakeup call. There is always room for improvements. And the items I'm asking for shouldn't take that long to fix/address; however, they should have a huge positive impact on the sentiment around this project. "
8zf3wy,2,2018-07-16,"I just want a ""good job"" or a ""good luck""",vncntvangoth,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8zf3wy/i_just_want_a_good_job_or_a_good_luck/,"This week is the last day of my internship. Every single one of my coworker has been telling me how good my work was, how I will be missed, etc. My boss wrote an awesome recommandation letter, saying I did so much more than what was expected. I'm looking for a job after the internship. I only wrote 10 letters and had two positive response, I'm having the interviews next week. So far, things are good.
But my mother didn't say anything good to me about it. She didn't say ""good job"" when I told her about the internship. She didn't say good luck when I told her about the job interviews. Instead, she goes on a weird rant about how I will never find a job because i have a purple coloration on the tip of my hair, and how she was smarter and wiser so I should listen to her views about the workforce. She then proceeded to tell me that if I wanted to work at her ex-office, she wouldn't hire me because of how I look.

I'm sick and tired of this. She will never validate me for anything. 
From Primary School to now, I was never given a congratulation for a good mark, because it was obvious I would have it. But every little mistake was pointed. It's always the same. i shouldn't care, but I can't. I just my mom to say ""i am proud"" without it being forced or being for the sake of looking good in front of people.

Another topic of discussion is my hair and how I look in general. One day I decided to bleach the tip of my hair and color it. I love it. My boyfirend loves it. My coworkers love it, and the other coworkers in previous intership too. But no. Despite the fact that I found these two interships, and that i'm doing well, she thinks those hair will be me demise. She hates it, and uses my insecurities about employment and society to destroy my confidence with this. One day I had an oral exam to get to a very good school, and failed it. I know what happened : i wasn't sure I wanted to go there, so i didn't really work and failed. But she can't hear this : for here, it's because I had colored hair, and she's sure I was not dressed welle nough, etc. She is also the type to say things like ""if you got fatter, your boyfriend will leave you"", etc. It's a weird thing. For one part, in her mind I am a genius who can't fail. On the other hand, I'm a miserable failure who can't do anything right.
She knows perfectly where my insecurites are and loves to push the button on them. 
And maybe she's right. Maybe it would be harder for me to find a job. BUT SHE DOESN'T KNOW. She never had to do an interview, and even if she had, 30 years have passed. It's like I don't have the right to fail and discover it for myself.

What happens when I fight back ? Well she tells me all about her cancer and depression. Making it seems like I'm responsible for the two of them. Or using them to blackmail my love for her. She also uses money for blackmail. A lot. Telling me she has always provided me with it. She did. I'm guilty about it. But she was also the one to lash on to me if I talked about working during College or during summer, yelling ""But don't we get you enough money, what does it mean, you don't need to do it"" etc etc.

I'm sick of this relationship. I just want a normal mom who helps me and tells me i'm enough. My therapist told me to let her talk and not listen, but it's hard. I see my boyfriend talking to his mother. She's nice. If she desapproves something, she says it, but in a way that is more of a advice than a accusation. I long for this. I have my boyfriend to help, but sometimes even him can't change things. My father is also powerless in this, since his position has always been ""i don't care, nothing is important"". He's the perfect father, loving and caring, but he cannot help on this matter because he doesn't get why it affects me so much.

I don't know what to do. Writing at least helped me get the desire to break something away."
8zf7cx,0,2018-07-16,Dazed and Truly Confused in the Entertainment Industry,joelrose777,LosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/8zf7cx/dazed_and_truly_confused_in_the_entertainment/,"This is all so strange. I feel mad. I got another mediocre review on Black List. Said they couldn’t understand my character’s motivation. You couldn’t? Are you a fucking moron? Atticus wants to win over his family gain their respect, Rumor wants to quit her job and be an artist, Thor wants to act in a play, and Zola wants to have a normal friend. You can’t understand this? Really? A 2nd grader with a severe learning disability could grasp this. 

I can take legitimate, well thought out criticism, but the idea these character’s don’t have wants is crazy to me. I improved this fucking script. And now, I’m told that it still doesn’t convey urgency. Go fuck yourself. The whole thing is bullshit. I now see what this is, a cash grab. There’s no pot of gold here. 

That one guy I met got a table read of his script after putting together something special. Working his ass off for years. All for a fucking table read with some known actors. No pay, no getting produced, no actually doing something that makes him able to feed his family or have a career. Still in IT! This is just one big sham. 

The whole thing is set up to make you think you can make it, and then, you get fucked out of your money repeatedly. But like an abused spouse you cannot leave. You just keep plopping down your money and wasting your god damn time. And the more you invest, the more you want to stay, in spite all evidence suggesting you should leave. Do something else. Anything else. Anything where you’re treated with respect or valued or paid or respected. 

I am so mad at this industry that I’ve given so much time too over the last decade. I’m not expecting fairness, but a win here or there isn’t too much to ask. I’m no genius, but I’m better than some of the shlubs I see succeeding. Sorry I didn’t go to Harvard or am only half Jewish. This whole thing is a crock of shit. I should’ve gone to synagogue like my mother said. You need to be connected. Stop writing scripts, stop honing your craft. Find a way to meet people. That’s the way to do it. The people that get ahead are those who understand how to kiss the most butt cheeks. And then, someday, they can have their cheeks kissed.

Dammnnnnnnnnnn! I hate these readers. They give the worst notes. And then I’ll make these changes. And then they’ll say the same thing, or something contradictory. And the sad part is I want to submit something else. I want to keep submitting. I want to get their approval. And who are they? Former interns who probably work at coffee shops and read scripts for 50 bucks. They haven’t made it in the industry either. This is cyclical bullshit. They're no different than me. They’re equally stunted and failed. 

Everyone says don’t give up, don’t let anyone tell you no, keep pursuing your dreams. At what cost. The cost is everything. I have nothing. I have no family, money, security, future, passion. They’ve taken all of it and didn’t even care. I have so little left. I don’t want a future like this but I feel trapped. 

Maybe I’m not as talented as I think. I think I’m a good writer. I think I’m funny. Maybe I’m not. That hurts, my whole identity is based on being funny. If I’m not, I don’t know what I am anymore. That’s the other thing, when you try to work in comedy, it will take your humor. In the sense that it will be a commodity. No longer do you laugh freely. You laugh for a purpose. You laugh to advance yourself or impress others. But you no longer laugh from pure joy. You don’t laugh just because. 

I can’t believe my comedy career will end this way. I’m in shock. I’m moving out of LA in a week. Always thought I’d make it. Now, not so much. It hurts more than I can express. It’s like the most personal rejection. And now what? My dreams are dead. I’ll have to live in a cubicle for the rest of my life. That hurts even more. Insult to injury. Nothing to look forward too. I’ll be gone from this place. No one will miss me.

And the sad part is I’ll dream of moving back. Because I’m a junkie. We all are. Can’t be happy with or without LA. It’s a disease. Wish I had never come. I’ve seen too much. I’m defeated. I don’t need encouragement. I need a chance. What I wouldn’t give for a chance. 

And the capper is I can’t even get a civilian job. Those chances went out the window. I could’ve been more successful not coming here, wouldn’t be broke. Would have money and a house. Maybe a family. Savings! This is the kicker. I didn’t just fail, but I gave up a ton. People don’t understand nor care. That hurts as much as anything. They’ll just say move on. 

You’ve never been in this position. You’re still in the same hometown. You didn’t dream big. I did. I want to be a success. I want to show those who said I couldn’t do it. Hard to accept that they were right. Don’t want those looks at Christmas. Don’t want them smirking at a loser. Damn it! I don’t know what to do. 

Do I stay and be an Uber driver? Deliver Postmates? Devote more years. There are no guarantees. Not like getting a PHD in chemistry where a great job is waiting. Could just be more sunk costs. Afraid of going all in, and afraid of being out of the game. I’m stuck!

This is really hard. Just got a review from the Blacklist. Another fucking 5. I don’t get it. I made improvements. And still, not good. This really blows. Seems like whatever I write isn’t good enough. Don’t get it. I think I can write. Some others seem to think I can write, and yet, the professional feedback I get from the entertainment industry consists of them just shitting on me. 

I don’t understand. Maybe it’s a sign that I’m not meant to be here. I don’t know. Everyone talks about failure, and how it’s important, how it makes one better. Well, I’ve failed a lot. I’m tired of it. When does the success happen?

I feel like I’m talented, but maybe I’m crazy. Maybe I’m not. Maybe it’s all a fascade. I don’t know. It hurts me to my core to feel like I wasted my time out here. Maybe that’s why it’s so hard to leave. Because I've already invested so much time, and this just makes me want to invest more. A vicious cycle. Maybe that’s what the problem is. "
8zf8re,1,2018-07-16,Is this depression?,756i8r987t,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/8zf8re/is_this_depression/,"Why does everything always have to be the same damn struggle?  
I know I should do something, but a part of me refuses to do it.

So I'm at some point pretty close to finishing my Bachelor's degree.  
I have to pass two exams and write a thesis, then I'm done.

But more and more, I just stop caring. I failed both exams once before because I didn't prepare, and I will fail one of them again next week. And I will fail the other one again in a month.  
I wish I could just say that I am lazy, that I get easily distracted by more fun stuff.  
Instead there is this strong urge to just drive the exams against a wall whenever I think about them, and I completely push them out of my mind otherwise.

I made a schedule back in April including time slots for preparing for the exams. An hour or less every week would have been plenty to easily pass this shit. I haven't kept that schedule for a single day.

---

I called a company's HR for an internship and possibly writing a thesis there more than a month ago, and instead of organizing it to make that happen, I just ignored it.  

Instead of pursuing this matter by talking to the professor right away, I had to coincidentally talk to him first last week - after three weeks - to spontanously bring up this topic.  
That was quite the success, and I had also just held a presentation that was very well received and praised minutes before.  
But the good mood was rather weak. I had to ""remind"" myself that I should feel good about this, and after a couple of minutes my extraordinary good mood had faded.

---

My shower armature is a bit leaky for months now and I just can't get myself to care enough to get it replaced.

I had a bright day yesterday. I managed to clean my apartment for the first time in damn weeks.  
It's disgusting how dirty it got.

My new dentist (it took me four years to go to a near dentist instead of leeching off my mom's checkup appointments that she generously swapped whenever I visit my parents) recommended I should have my wisdom teeth pulled.  
I have all four, and most of them probably won't fit in my mouth. That was seven months ago or so and I have done nothing.

---

I haven't been closer to a woman than ""(girl)friend of a friend"" level for four years.  
Back then I had an online ""girlfriend"" for a year and it ended horribly, with lies and cheating.  
At the same time I have also been scammed out of a lot of money I was supposed to get out of a shady, very successful online service I worked on.  
Before that, I thought I was super smart and playing the game just right and having an awesome roll. That all came crashing down to me being the dumbest naive idiot imaginable, getting baited on virtual vagina and a load of money I never saw.  
I just can't *really* trust people anymore, and not my own gut feeling, either.

I haven't made any new actual friends (that I individually care to spend time with) for 3.5y (when I met the people after that shit show above), and one of the few I have has drifted into ""barely even caring anymore"" on my side - because it annoys me he isn't making any progress in his life at all *just like myself*.

---

I know I should haul my ass to a therapist/psychologist, but I just don't want to go through with it.

At least I don't want to kill myself. I just kind of ""exist"". Sometimes I do useful shit, somethimes I get obsessed with understanding something, sometimes I pass time gaming with my peers, and sometimes I just waste my time eating, wanking, or doing nothing.  
I know I can't go on like this indefinitely, but then again I don't give a shit to change it.

Is this depression?

PS: At least I get to write an awefully long reddit post for once. I usually have to make sure to cut out the bullshit so anyone even bothers to read it.

PPS: There is a whole lot more that I don't even want to write. Mostly more stuff that I haven't gotten around to do yet and my fucked up sexuality I can't fully understand. It all just adds to the frustration.

PPPS: I keep editing small bits before submitting. I'm too fucking self-conscious about mistakes I might make and how my post may be received by others.
Now I'm considering not sending it at all, so DAMN IT.

8zf959,5,2018-07-16,How tough/easy is FINA 3332?,bellagab3,UniversityOfHouston,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfHouston/comments/8zf959/how_tougheasy_is_fina_3332/,"It's looking like I may end up working about 24 hrs a week during the fall semester. So far at UH I've only taken 9 hours each semester. It started out because of uncertainty and then was because of scheduling (you know when a class is full before your enrollment even opens). I got it all sorted out and planned to do 12 hours this semester. I was already worried about it because I haven't done it at UH yet but 3 of the classes are major specific and the other is Fina. I'm not sure how tough it'll be considering I haven't done 12 hours yet, I haven't worked while in college, and I have more personal responsibilities at home I haven't had before. 

I've already talked to a few people about it and basically they all just say to try it and see how it goes. I'm really bad with going into things if I'm not sure how it'll go. I think the internship could be very valuable and help me after graduation. I can technically drop fina without delaying graduation if 12 hours is too much. It would be easier for me to plan this ahead  and adjust now rather than trying to scramble to rearrange things after the semester starts. That's why I'm asking how tough Fina has been for others. Maybe some points of comparison helps so how would you consider it against Stat 3331 or Scm 3301? I felt Stat was doable and not horrendously time consuming but I did have a bad habit of doing the test reviews on the night before the tests which is an easy fix. I thought Scm was pretty easy with minimal review needed in order to do well on tests. I have Piqueira if that changes anything. Thanks guys :)"

I don't have daily contact with these kids, but I do work with them once a week and there are some kids that I see more regularly than others. I've been working with a small group for a few weeks now, and one kid in particular (15 years old) seems strangely attached to me. At first I thought it was kind of flattering that he felt comfortable with me and saw me as an older sister-type figure, especially since teenagers can get very weird/awkward especially with people close with them in age who are in positions of ""authority.""

However, some of the things he started saying later on were kind of weird. I mentioned in passing that I had a boyfriend and he said something to the effect of ""I lost my chance,"" although when I reacted (essentially hell no), he said it was a joke. Another time, I was standing up while they were sitting down and one of the other kids asked me if I wanted a seat, to which he remarked that I could sit on his lap. I shot him down in a humorous sort of way and the rest of the kids in his group made fun of him, but after some thought I realized that that could very easily be sexual harrassment.

I don't feel ""threatened"" by him in any way, and I do believe in giving chances especially to kids which I think is why I haven't felt like I needed to tell him straight up to stop yet. I do think, though, that I will need to if he says something like that to me again. I work with another 20 year old guy in the group who I've talked to a bit about this, and he's offered to talk to the kid if I feel uncomfortable approaching him directly. There are also other ""adultier adults"" who are in charge of the internship program who I can go to if things escalate. What I'm not sure about is how exactly to go about this, or even if I should wait for another incident before bringing it up. I think it may be better to speak with him personally about his behavior rather than going directly to higher-ups, but I'm also not sure if I'm giving him way too much benefit of the doubt.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I've never been in this situation before."

If I accept, I might have to work 6 months from September to March, which I wont have time to do another internship with a private company which according to others if you secure an internship at senior year you are basically hired with that company.

8zfnf2,118,2018-07-16,My mom thinks it's her day. FH put a moratorium on wedding planning for 6 months.

(This is a long one...but I'm wondering if I'm coming out of the FOG?...I didn't think I was even in it in the first place and maybe I'm just projecting.)

I’m going to start this out with what I’m sure is going to cause an audible groan or “Bless her heart” (for those Southern inclined folks reading this)...I never thought that my mom was a JustNo and I still think she’s JustMaybe. (Feel free to correct on the “Just”ness that is my mother.) Since I got engaged to my wonderful DH, she’s been driving me up a wall, inducing panic attacks, and generally making me feel like a shit person/daughter. FH even had to put a moratorium on wedding planning because I was crying at least once a month, if not more. We’ve been engaged for two years now and have one year left before getting married. I don’t know how much longer I can stand how my mother is treating me. Please note that I am still very dependent on my parents and I'm working on becoming independent. I work for my dad and he's paying for my tuition for my Master's degree and pretty much everything else...but I'm not getting an actual paycheck. I just got my first real job (internship) that applies to my degree and future, so I'm making my own money and have something that's reliable!! It's amazing!

Anyways, In order to save for the wedding (at least that's what my parents reasoning was) I moved out of my rental apartment in University town to move 45 min to their vacation home. FH had a chance to live with me for 4 months before/after Army training two years ago. He said he loved living with me, but could not stand my mother invading his/our privacy and got his own apartment for the following school year. I don't blame. I now see the problems. I can't believe it took me seeing her rearrange our kitchen to her liking, using our bathroom instead of the guest bathroom, and reorganizing OUR UNDERWEAR DRAWER to see the problems and boundary stomping. But I digress...wedding planning:

**Issue Number 1**

Wedding dress shopping was miserable. I decided to go ahead and get it done because my mom wasn’t listening to a single thing I said I wanted. How did the first dress shopping appointment go? She managed to say “Well how would it fit when *itsmydamnwedding* lost weight after going on her diet plan for the wedding?” no less than 4 times in one hour. It was so bad and so insistent that my BFF actually pulled me aside afterwards and asked if I was okay. As in making sure I wasn’t starving myself because of how much my mom mentioned me dieting to LOSE SO MUCH WEIGHT! I wasn’t even on a diet. Yes I want to get in shape and lose about 30+ lbs, but don’t say that every time I try on a damn dress!! The second infraction at this first appointment…whenever I was trying on a dress and opened the curtain, she’d be gone from the couch and BFF would have to go and find her in the ocean of white wedding dresses. Any happiness I may have had about the dress I had on was gone by the time she got back. After this awful appointment, I told her how much it hurt me and that I needed her to back off on the weight mentions. She said she was trying to look out for me and make sure the dress would look how I wanted it to if I had gotten it and lost weight. Whatever. We still didn’t even have a wedding date at this time!! I also mentioned going to find a few other stores to try on some dresses while my mom was back in West Coast State (I’m in the South, she’s on the West Coast.) SHE FORBADE ME FROM GOING WEDDING DRESS SHOPPING WITHOUT HER! FORBADE ME!!! So I was just supposed to put on hold such a big aspect of me as the bride to wait for whenever she MAY come back and visit??? 

Hell no. 

I found a wonderful bridal boutique that was so friendly and lovely…and I made a secret appointment with them where only BFF would be present. And...I FOUND MY DRESS!!!! BFF cried a little. She took some photos on her phone and said if I wanted to see them that she would send them via book Messenger so that my mom wouldn’t find out. BFF also brought me grapes and wine and cheeses and happiness for this appointment. I was so happy but so nervous at the same time. I told the stylist that I would be coming back in one month with my mom and I asked her to:

1. Act like she had never met me before. 
2. Hide ALL dresses that were layered, corset, not lace, and over a certain price point.
3. Do her best to make my dream dress, the one I had already chosen, my mom’s idea. 

This stylist was amazing and did everything perfectly. BFF was also at this appointment, as well as my Nana (mom's mom). My mom even ""picked out"" my dress. BUT there was a trunk show two months later where there would be SO many more dresses to look at. My mom wouldn’t say yes to the dress until the trunk show. (Yes, she and my dad are paying for probably 90&amp;#37; of my wedding. I humored her even though I knew this was my dress.) So she flies back to the West Coast and then two months later flies back to Southern State just for the trunk show. We buy the dress I wanted in the first place, at a discount due to the trunk show I will say, and I’m SO HAPPY!! YAY! Still haven’t gotten it fully ordered yet, but it’s on the list and in my profile at the boutique. As a result we haven’t gotten to the alterations portion yet, which has me quite nervous with what she’s going to say about my weight or tell the seamstress I want something that I don’t actually want. 

**Issue Number 2**

FH and I wanted to get married at X Church and have the reception at Y Location by the lake I would visit every summer growing up. It's 45 min away from our University and my parents own a lakehouse there (which I'm living in). Problem is, the nearest hotel is also 45 min away. But FH also grew up visiting his grandparents on a lake, so we wanted to try and make it work.

Y’all.

My family has been at this lake for 15 years. Suddenly my mom decided that she hated every restaurant, said Y Location was not elderly friendly, complained about how she’d have to look after Nana, and said that X Church was too expensive to rent for the ceremony. FH and I offered to pay for X Church and that we would be okay moving the reception to Z Location. NOPE! NOT GOOD ENOUGH! But what is good enough? A SKYSCRAPER IN BIG CITY THAT OVERLOOKS A MUDDY BROWN RIVER AND A BASEBALL STADIUM!!! FH and I hate cities, wanted our pristine blue lake, and haven’t been to a baseball game…ever (other than when we were dragged to them as kids). So I say no. It’s not us. What’s her next suggestion? A NATIVE AMERICAN CASINO!!! Wtf. Their food at this location isn’t that great, it only has slot machines (cuz no fun in the South with gambling), and WHY?!?! I was having panic attacks about pleasing my mom but also saying “no” and wanting our wedding to represent FH and myself. So…I decided to move the location to 15 min from where FH’s parents live in Other Southern State.

Now my MIL can also be a bit JustNo sometimes, but I’ve only cried twice after arguments with her whereas I cry THINKING about arguments with my mom. I recently told my mom that these “disagreements” we were having with her were why we decided to move the location to another state…”But I wasn’t arguing. I love X Church and Y Location! We could’ve gotten it to work. I was just providing options.” She said this after we had just put down a deposit at a reception location in Other Southern State. Well, no changing now!! (This new location is beautiful btw and we also get to have the ceremony in a Catholic Church which is something I’ve always wanted.) But yeah…not her fault we moved locations. 

**Issue Number 3**

There’s a villa on site that’s right next to the reception venue. You can rent it out per room at pretty reasonable prices. My parents will be renting it the Friday before the wedding for my bridal party, mom, Nana, and myself. FH and I would like it for Saturday night so we don’t have to travel far after the reception and could even have a few friends over after the reception for an “after party” and play drunk Mario Cart or MonkeyBall. (It’s wonderful and so much fun.) When I mentioned this to my mom she said indignantly, “So you’re just going to kick me and Nana out of the villa?!” Uhhhhh…well when you phrase it like that. “Yeah that’s not gonna happen.” And then she says how she hates that my dad wants her to stay at the villa as opposed to the hotel where all of her friends are going to be…then go stay at the hotel??? When I told FH this his response was, ""Soooo she's going to kick out the bride instead?"" I told FH to just go ahead and plan for us to go a swanky ass hotel for the time being that we won’t be telling anyone where it will be. 

**Issue Number 4** (Holy cow this just keeps going.)

This happened this morning and I see it happening again in the future. FH and I found a baker that we love. I emailed Baker asking about a 4 tier wedding cake for 125-150 people. My mom made a face when I mentioned 4 tiers and said “Won’t that be too much?? You don’t need all that!” Then says how she wants to be able to take the left over cake home…If we have 150 people and a cake that serves 100 people, how much cake does she think will be left over? And do FH and I not get to take any home with us (something we can eat that’s not the anniversary topper)? Is that weird? What about leftover food from the reception? All other weddings I’ve been at the staff normally packs up a hefty amount of the leftovers for the bride and groom to take back home/to their hotel…but my mom wants it.

What really hurt though is that she made it seem like our opinion was so utterly insignificant that we didn’t even need to be present for the food tastings. I just made an appointment with Baker for the first week of August to go taste cakes. My mom leaves to go back to West Coast on the 31st, so she will not be here for the tasting. I read my email out loud that I was sending to Baker this morning at 5am because I wanted to make sure it sounded like the English language (I was pre-coffee). 

When I uttered the words for the tasting date, my mom interjects with “But I’m not going to be here.”

&gt;Me: Right…but this is the first day FH and I both have available. And we want to book Baker as fast as we can (haha unintentional patty cake reference?) so we don’t lose him like we already lost the photographer I wanted.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: I just thought it would be fun for me to be there.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It would be great to have you *and dad* there, but this is the best time for us to schedule it. And I would like FMIL and FFIL to be able to get some cake to taste too…you know, include them in something, so I was going to get some to-go taster boxes to bring to them and get for y’all when you’re back here.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: Fine.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: For the sake of communication, what’s wrong? Because ""fine"" tells me nothing.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: Well if you want to go with FFIL and FMIL instead of me (notice no mention of my dad???) it's whatever.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Ffs mom. I never said I wanted to take them over you. I said I would get them a taster box. It will just be FH and I at the bakery. I want to kind of make a decision with the man I’m going to marry on what our cake will taste like.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: …  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It’s 5:30am and I have to get to work.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: I just think the baker would like to actually meet who’s going to be paying for the cake and make sure that they like the choices that were made.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *hold the fuck up* Wow. Okay. Yeah. Maybe when he’s got our choices and has a second tasting with what everything will be like, we can have you *and dad* there. But it’s so far out right now and I just want to make sure he’ll be our baker for the day of. 

I called FH (whom I woke up…oops) and fumed to him the guilt trip my mom just tried to lay on me. Told him what she said about the people buying the cake should taste it and he responded with “Fine. I’ll get the fucking cake. And she’ll get to taste it when every other guest gets a chance…and I’m getting my damn strawberries on top no matter what’s said.” 

So. That' my wedding planning so far. We have until October of next year until FH and I are DH and I. I'm applying for a job a week it feels like and getting nothing back. My dad can be JustNo occasionally as well, so he's not much help here. I don't know what else to do to maintain my sanity or to develop my spine more. It's so hard when she can just come visit me now whenever she wants and I can't get away. But hey...at least I'll get to eat delicious cake in a couple of weeks!! I'm not sure what kind of advice I'm really looking for, but I'm hoping someone will have something that I can do to help put up boundaries...or even tell me that I'm in the wrong if it's the truth .

So I’ve been enjoying my internship so far, but I have only had enough chargeable work to keep my busy for about half the week, despite my schedule saying I have close to 40 hours on engagements. With a MTD utilization report coming out today, I looked and saw my utilization is &lt;50% which, as far as I know, is not good if I were a full time associate. 

My question is, does my utilization necessarily matter that much as an intern? I always check in with the seniors/staff on my teams when I don’t have any work, and even have asked around the office with people I have met to find work. Occasionally it works out in my favor but most of the time no one has much for me to do. 

So would this low utilization affect my chances of a full time offer, if my reviews are good?

I started my internship about three months ago as an intern in Career Program A and I find that I am not using any of the technical skills I developed from my master's degree.   

I then discovered Career Program B. This career program seems to be almost a perfect fit for me. I think I can contribute much more value to the Army if I switch to Career Program B.

Is this possible to do as an ACTEDS intern?

8zggkn,2,2018-07-16,My boyfriend [23M] barely communicates with me [20F] and I feel like he sees that as normal,obamanisha,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zggkn/my_boyfriend_23m_barely_communicates_with_me_20f/,"Context: I'm from Northern Ohio on Lake Erie and go go Boston University. My boyfriend is from and lives in the Boston suburbs and is in a gap year between undergrad and med school.

We've been together since about Mid-April, early May. We hit it off super well and on our first date, he slept over at my place but we didn't have sex or anything, which stood out to me because obviously most guys our age would be in it just for that. We just hit it off super well and have been in love ever since. We hung out as much as we could before I came home to Ohio for the Summer, and he always enjoyed having me over and was just always so sweet and fun. 

We always talked throughout the day, not like texting back every 2 minutes, but still throughout the day. As with most relationships, we talked more right at the beginning and then slowed it down a little once we started becoming more comfortable and exclusive. However, I had to come home for the Summer. I broke up with my abusive ex-boyfriend in October (rather, that's when I could get away) so my school year was just really rough, and I wanted to experience an actual Summer without him. I also just wasn't sure where I could stay in Boston. There wasn't really any way around it, but I feel like that's normal in college relationships. 

Since then, he barely talks to me. He only texts me once a day now, when he's at work, and even now it's been a little more than a day since we've talked. He works as an EMT right now, and seems to switch between morning and night shifts. I completely understand him being tired, and that it's not necessary for him to text back all day (my abusive ex would make me text back like every 15-20 minutes and then double text if I didn't respond, I hated it.) But when he does text back, he acts like it's nothing and makes good conversation, is flirty, acts like an actual boyfriend, etc. He even says stuff including the two of us rather than himself (ex: ""we could do this."") But I can't helo but feel ignored and hurt by it. If he's not at work, he's usually gaming all day. I have no problem with that whatsoever, I just feel like he obviously looks at his phone some time.

A small portion of me feels like he just doesn't like me anymore, but I mainly feel like he's just comfortable. Like, he already has me and I'm coming back in a month and a half, so what does he have to worry about? This mainly started one night when he was at a friends and apologized for not really responding, which I said was okay. I feel like that put him at ease, and made him feel like I would be okay with it in general. I can tell that he's loyal, and he's the type to take relationships slower. He didn't kiss me until our third date, and was still always eager about seeing me. We haven't talked about past relationships, but I feel like I'm slightly more experienced than him even though he has 3 years on me. For example, I sent him this pic from twitter as a joke on Father's Day of this childrens book that says ""That's my Daddy!"" and he said ""thanks for the love being a dog father is a challenge."" Tbh the innocence of it made me laugh a lot. I think he's super hilarious and just very similar to me, but also one of those dudes that can be awkward with women. 

I'm just looking for any general advice on this. God love them both, but my one best friend is a little too brutally honest and blunt, and the other is a little reactive. That's also what makes me really nervous about all this. My more reactive best friend went to her home country of Azerbaijan for an internship, and her boyfriend in Boston slowed down their talking a lot and broke up over text, and my previous boyfriend lived in Ohio and said he lost feelings right after I left to come back to Boston.

**TL;DR** My boyfriend in Boston, where we both live, has barely talked to me since I've come home to Ohio for the summer, especially since I told him it was okay for not replying one night. However, his general attitude hasn't changed but it's still making me feel ignored and like he might not like me anymore. What should I think? Is it right to be nervous?"

* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
 
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor [sandra](http://i.imgur.com/w5B2CB9.jpg) babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her [the myriad of inappropriate outfits](http://i.imgur.com/PXi5ffR.jpg) she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy [low cut top and skirt]( http://i.imgur.com/hCCRZlB.jpg ) when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "

I grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

8zhqm2,6,2018-07-16,A few questions,rodrigovaz,mead,https://www.reddit.com/r/mead/comments/8zhqm2/a_few_questions/,"Hello Everyone, thanks for reading this.

Before, I will start saying that I have read the wiki but still have some questions before I invest money into equipment:

I live in Brazil and there's a shitload of ""brewing kits"" for beer and even some for mead but they usually come at some weird sizes so I'd like to get some things straight about fermentation and bulk aging containers:

About fermentation:

The beginner recipes are for 1 gallon output which is aprox. 3.8 liters. I found some food-grade plastic buckets with tap and airlock to buy at an OK price but they only come in the following sizes: 5,5 liters (1,45 gallons) and 11 liters (2,9 gallons). Is the 5,5 liters OK for fermentating 1 gallon or is it too little headspace?

Bucket:

[https://imgur.com/EuZGjqb](https://imgur.com/EuZGjqb)

Knowing that the price of the 11 liters bucket is almost the same as the 5,5 liters, is it ok if I buy the 11 liters bucket and only ferment 1 gallon or can all the free space (oxygen?) inside the bucket do bad to the mead? (I don't want to spend money brewing 2 gallons for the time being)

About Bulk aging:

Something I do not understand is this: in the newbie recipe it says to syphon the mead AFTER it finishes fermentation to a new container while avoiding to syphon the sediment in the bottom. will my mead already be clarified by now or will it clarifiy in the new container? If it clarifies in the new container, won't it create a new layer of sediment in the bottom?

Now, I noticed that for the bulk aging I need to leave as little headspace as possible (fuck oxygen amiright?!) Can I use the same type of bucket to age the mead? Do I need an airlock to age the mead? SHOULD I use a bucket to age the mead? Is the 5 liters bucket tight enough to age 1 gallon of mead or will I need to add marbles/inject gas? I found some 4 liters (1,06 gallons) beer Growlers (I can't find carboys to buy), are they better than buckets?

Growler:

[https://imgur.com/BttCMzw](https://imgur.com/BttCMzw)

Others  and bottling:

Lastly, I'm moving to another town to start on an internship and will start brewing in the apartment there, I will return home every 2 weeks for the weekend, is it ok to leave the fermentation unnatended for just 3 days?

I know this is stupid, but, lets imagine (I swear it's not true ;) ) for a moment that I can't really appreciate a good wine (or mead) and that I'm a very eager person, the newbie recipe says ""the mead should be clear withing a couple of months and very drinkable within 3 to 6 months"". The ""3 to 6 months"" is 3 months AFTER it clarifies or 3 months after I brewed it?

I have a lot of empty wine bottles at home, is bulk aging so superior to just bottle it right after clarification and let it age in the bottle? Would be good to have only 2 buckets for fermentation and keep rotating them while bottling the produce.

Thanks for your patience!"

8zlj2q,1,2018-07-17,[M4F] The Virgin Cumslut: An Anal-Only Life,dpone,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/8zlj2q/m4f_the_virgin_cumslut_an_analonly_life/,"*This is a prompt for adults, by an adult, and is purely fantasy.*

One of my favorite fantasies lately is denying a woman access to her pussy, her primary pleasure center, and training her to prefer life that way - to thank me for it. I want to take that a step further, and groom a cute teenage girl to live this way right from the start. Before she's had more than a first kiss, maybe experimented with touching herself. Her life is to be one of service, but it's joyous, enthusiastic service.

Here are a few ways this could go down.

If you dig incest:

**Daddy's Little Pornstar**: In this world, the age of consent and the age for appearing in adult films have dropped to 14. Whether Daddy or daughter had the idea first, the daughter is going to become a pornstar. But she's inexperienced. Plus - she needs Daddy's permission, and Daddy has one condition. Lucky for her, it's a gimmick that could make her career.

**Fixing Daddy**: You (and your sister, if you like) have watched me over the past few years as I've dealt with the pain of losing your mother. As you've grown, it's become more difficult. You're the spitting image of her, and the increasingly skimpy outfits haven't been helping. After watching Daddy be miserable for far too long, you've decided you're going to make him happy - no matter what it takes.

If you don't:

**The Swallow Salon**: There's a place where men with enough money can go to enjoy service of a specific sort. You're one of the employees of the Swallow Salon, purchased when you came of age and trained to do a particular job.

**The Assistant**: You've applied for a competitive internship at a secretive company known for all kinds of clever inventions. The company's owner, CEO, and lead inventor is known for liking to keep things ""pristine."" You get the job, and find out that he's looking for a certain type of assistant.

~~

Regardless of which prompt you go with - or come at me with your own! - this is a prompt with orgasm denial and vaginal chastity at its core. If you want to take it even further, any of these prompts could lead to your character receiving chastity piercings - cute little heart-shaped locks and a clit shield making sure you never forget what and who you are. Whether you're spending your days sitting and squirming on Daddy's lap or working at the Swallow Salon, you'll be trapped in a needy, horny haze and come to prefer it that way.

This is an ageplay prompt, so I'd want to play with girls aged 14-17. It can be a daughter, twins, a neighbor, I'm open to ideas.

Even if something about this prompt does it for you that isn't ageplay related, I love the concept in general and would love to hear from you.

You can jump right into the RP if you like, but I'd love to chat first - tell me what appeals to you about the RP, what kind of relationship you'd like to play out - that kind of thing.

I don't have the time to do rapid-fire back and forth messages, but I'd love to exchange a few a day, or one really epic one a day. I can do first or third person, and prefer if we have some flexibility over character control but am open to other ideas. Give me some indication that you've read this far!"

My university has a computing security club and we have been using Slack as the platform of choice to communicate, recently a student who is an intern at Facebook recommended that we should switch to Facebook workplace messenger for the main reason of being able to have chat history. 


I see a lot of people in the group are supporting that and am not the most capable person to show why switching to a service owned by Facebook is really a bad dissuasion. 


Can you please help me build my argument and if it exist some sources that supports the points of argument."

------------------------

Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

Zum wiederholtem Mal fordern Sie von mir sogenannte Säumnissgebühren. Da Sie scheinbar nicht in der Lage sind normales hochdeutsch zu lesen und verstehen, werde ich es hiermit auf einer anderer Weise versuchen.

Ich werde meine Rundfunkgebühren weiterhin brav bezahlen. Aber Sie können sich die Säumnissgebühren von einem erfahrenen Proktologen dahin stecken lassen, wo die Sonne nicht scheint, wenn Sie nicht in der Lage sind mir eine Rechnung mit Ihren Forderungen zu schicken. Ist das nun verständlich und kristallklar genug für Sie ausgedrückt?

Ah, es ist zuviel Arbeit für Sie und kostet Sie unmengen an Geld eine Rechnung auszudrücken, in den Briefumschlag zu stecken, frankieren und loszuschicken? Das ist nicht mein Problem. Sie sind ein großes Unternehmen, sehen Sie zu wie Sie solch ein „Problem“ intern lösen.

Für den Fall, dass Sie sich wundern was nun los ist, erlauben Sie mir die Tatsache zu schildern.

Ich habe Ihnen nun im 3 Schreiben mitgeteilt, dass ich Ihre Beiträge nur, und nur mit einer Rechnung bezahlen werde. Ohne Rechnung, bekommen Sie von mir keinen Cent zu sehen.

Eine SEPA Lastschriftmandat erteile ich einem unseriösem Verein wie Ihnen, GEZ, schonmal gar nicht. Weil das nur auf Probleme hinauslaufen wird. Wenn Sie von mir Geld wollen, welche ich zahlen werde, dann schicken Sie mir, und nun zum mitschreiben für alle, Z-E-I-T-N-A-H und R-E-C-H-T-Z-E-I-T-I-G eine Rechnung mit der Summe der Forderung.

In Ihrem Schreiben, welches als Kopie beiliegt, schreiben Sie, dass am xx.xx.2018 xx,xx€ bei Ihnen eingegangen sind. Scheinbar ist ihr Verei inkompetent genug richtige Summen nicht lesen zu können. Anbei habe ich Ihnen auch meinen Kontoausdrück mitgeschickt, aus welchem Sie entnehmen können, dass ich am xx.xx.2018, in der Tat, xx,xx€ gezahlt habe.


Mit nicht so freundlichen Grüßen,

There is about one month left to my internship here. How should I go about finding out what my chances are at getting a second internship? Should I just not say anything and hope they ask me?"

So I have a coworker who is older and I dont work with directly.  I will outline the 3 stories, but none of them are too extreme except maybe the second one.  

I know this part isn't reportable but it is worth noting that this guy gives me that gut feeling.  You know the one?  That feeling that he is undressing you with his eyes.  This alone wouldn't drive me to report him because I could just be wrong.   

Here are the 3 things I know about:

1.  When I first started, I was on an elevator with him and he started on about my red hair and how beautiful it was and how he loves red hair on women.  His daughter has red hair, and it is such a rare beauty.  When I told him I was naturally blonde actually and I dye it, he frowned and told me ""That is cheating"" and sort of stormed off.  Then about a month later, I got engaged and he saw me again on the elevator and said, ""What is that on your finger?"" In an angry way.  I said, ""Uhhh... an engagement ring.""  he then said ""oh."" and walked away.   It was strange and I told another one of my coworkers about it.  I still dont know his name at this point.  She then goes, ""I know exactly who you are talking about.""   
Next time we saw him she pointed him out, and yeah.. it was him.  She then told me the next story. 

2.  She was getting something from a vending machine and in the reflection he was sitting behind her staring at her, openly checking her out.  She turned around and said, ""Uh... Can I help you.""  He then said something to the tune of, ""Nope. I am good.""  It skeeved her out enough that she knew exactly who I was talking about when I told her my story.  
We both sort of let it go and just referred to him as the creepy guy.  Were both young and I don't think either of us thought of reporting it to HR because there isn't much here. 
Then my same friend came up to me today and said that the creepy guy strikes again.  Apparently he walked up to a female intern of my friends and did the following

3.  He started on about how cute her little toes are.  She was in open toed shoes and he keeped saying her little toes were so cute and tiny.  SHE was so skeeved out that she told my friend who then told me.  

So this is 3 of us that have received this intensely creepy vibe/conversation from him.  

I don't know what to do with this.  Is this a whole lot of nothing?  

I dont actually want to open a case against him and certainly not without my other coworkers permission so all of this is pending they are okay with me or us reporting it anonymously.  

My only thought is that I want these to be noted on his file, in case he does something more objectively inappropriate to someone, they do open an official case, and it is their word against his.  I would like HR to be able to say ""well we have these anonymous reports on his file of the creepy stuff he has done in the past.""

I dont want to go to battle about these, the only action I am considering is sort of an anonymous report to HR with no action on their part requested.   Just to have these little notes on file.  Again, with the other 3 women in agreement on my action. 

Am I overreacting?   If it was a different kind of job, maybe I would feel differently.  We just have a lot of office events that involve alcohol and I worry about some young intern getting drunk and getting taken advantage of. He has specifically targeted the 3 of us, the youngest women on our floor.  

**TL;DR:  Creepy guy at our office has done a few creepy things to 3 women that made all 3 uncomfortable.  Want to know if I am overreacting or this is something I/we (depending on the strategy we agree upon) should report to HR**"

A Long fic (Currently the longest running Fic in the MHA fandom, apparently) which focuses on Izuku and Mina’s developing relationship after the Sports Festival, and how this affects the canon story-line/ This fic is generally a butterfly effect experiment, which looks at if Mina took a far more active role than she does in the cannon. Izuku’s awkwardness and anxiety make showing his emotions a struggle, while Mina’s surprising lack of dating experience demonstrates her hidden insecurities.

Set in an alternate timeline, The current cast of Yuuei are among the first generation of people who possess Quirks - While Quirks have been around for a long time, they are only now in the public eye for the first time, the recent surge beginning just before the main cast was born. This leads to heavy discrimination against ‘Quirked’ individuals. Yuuei is built more or less as a prison in the shape of a high school. Izuku, whom holds no ill feelings towards people born with Quirks, desires nothing more than to build a bridge between Quirked and Quirkless, willing to go to any lengths to do so - Eventually donning a mask and becoming the First SuperHero, Maverick.

Ridiculed for six years, Izuku finally breaks down due to his Quirklessness, and begins to believe what everyone around him has been saying - That without a Quirk, he can’t be a Hero. It isn’t until a hyperactive pink girl finds him and yells at him that he doesn’t need a Quirk to be a Hero that he finally rejuvenates himself and remembers not to give up. Five years later, he meets the girl again at Yuuei - Only to find that she doesn’t remember who he is.

While he’s Quirkless, Izuku does possess something unique. He discovers that he’s an Ajin - An immortal being incapable of dying. Additionally, he’s an exceedingly rare Variant, which grants him to an array of unique abilities that only two other Ajin on record possess. Left with nowhere else to go, he joins the Ajin League of Villains, and is exposed to the brutality of the world, before resurfacing two years later, with only three goals in mind. Becoming a Student at Yuuei, becoming a Pro Hero, and Eradicating the Ajin League Of Villains.

8znyf9,1,2018-07-17,M4F Too Wet,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8znyf9/m4f_too_wet/,"Nobody said it worked this fast...

Wet.  It's the slang term for the newest illegal drug running rampant in the world.  It's actual name was ridiculously long and boring, so it quickly took on th name ""Wet"".

Wet had quite a few effects on the human body.  It gave the sensory pleasures and euphoria of ecstacy, the energy of cocaine, the libido of a double dose of Viagra, and the sexual hunger of a rabbit.  Altogether, the name made a lot of sense because it made men harder than a top pornstar and women...well wet.

People took it for the high ostensibly, as the high was supposed to be extremely pleasant, but as it became more commonplace, people began taking it for wild nights with a special friend and then taking it in groups for wild orgies with several special friends.  It worked for both men and women and could even be dissolved in fruit juices.

Cops barely enforced the laws against it, as arresting people high on Wet always guaranteed a fun night in the squad car.  Politicians publicly condemned it, but day after day scandals came to light as more and more elected officials were caught high on Wet and buried in writhing interns.

The hangover wasn't bad for most, but for some rare cases, it caused a psychological addiction to physical contact with that person.  Taking too much Wet and getting your pussy eaten might even give your partner an addiction to your pussy and the same could be said of blowing a Wet fueled erection.

It's mostly harmless right?  So why is it hitting you so hard and so fast....?

Let's create an experience.  You tell me where you are when Wet kicks in and who you're with.  Does it kick in while you're still working?  Does someone slip it into your drink?  Do you give some to your boyfriend as an experiment only to have it become more intense than expected?  How does Wet affect your life?  Let's have some fun with this."
8zo4zc,341,2018-07-17,Wieso lässt man sich an der Uni so viel Scheiße gefallen?,Priamosish,de,https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/8zo4zc/wieso_lässt_man_sich_an_der_uni_so_viel_scheiße/,"Irgendwie hab ich das Gefühl an der Uni immer stärker, dass sich unsere Generation von Studenten viel zu viel Scheiße gefallen lässt. Seien es idiotische Prüfungsordnungen, Dozenten mit Machtkomplexen, die oft viel zu engen Fristen, die an griechische Verhältnisse erinnernden Zustände in der Verwaltung, die Überbelastung bei gleichzeitigem Scheuklappenstudium und und und...

Vielleicht bin ich auch nur naiv. Vielleicht male ich mir die Universitäten in den 1960ern und 70ern einfach viel zu schön, viel zu rebellisch, viel zu freidenkend. Kann gut sein. Jedenfalls hab ich den Eindruck, unsere Generation ist lammfromm, studiert marktkonform und, mehr noch, übt sogar intern Druck auf die Kommilitonen aus. Jemand steht auf und beschwert sich? Statt etwas zu sagen, gibt es nur böse Blicke an den Kommilitonen, er solle doch jetzt schweigen und sich still hinsetzen. Bleibt jemand in diesem System auf der Strecke, wird ihm nicht aufgeholfen, sondern es wird nachgetreten wie dumm man sei, dass man nicht gut genug für das Studium sei, etc. Nach der Logik: Mein Schnitt wird besser, wenn der von allen anderen schlechter wird. Da werden auch mal Bücher in der Bib versteckt, Kulis nicht verliehen, kein Einblick in Notizen gewährt... 

Ich sage das als jemand der bislang durch alle Klausuren im Erstversuch durchgekommen ist und einen Einser-Schnitt hat. Ich verstehe das nicht so ganz. Alle tun einen auf rebellisch, für die Umwelt, für Gerechtigkeit, gegen das System... aber irgendwie nur in der Freizeit und in Bereichen, in denen sie sicher sind, keine negativen Rückschläge zu kassieren. Im Hörsaal wird dann der Bückling gemacht. 

Auch die Verwaltung reagiert da sehr stark. Von unserer Studienberatung und dem Prüfungsamt wird man konsequent wie ein dummer, lästiger 5-Klässler behandelt, nicht wie ein denkender, gleichberechtigter Erwachsener. Vielleicht war das damals auch schon so, ich weiß es nicht. Habt ihr ähnliche Eindrücke? Oder entgegengesetzte?"
8zofgr,3,2018-07-17,"Me [21 M] with my girlfriend [21 F] of a year and a half, how do I help her to open up to me?",bagnastayy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zofgr/me_21_m_with_my_girlfriend_21_f_of_a_year_and_a/,"So a little background on our relationship.

We've been dating for about a year and a half now. We're now getting to the conversation of marriage and I'm super excited to see what the future holds. However, getting her to open up is like pulling teeth with a toothpick. She's told me repeatedly she really wants to be able to open up but just has a hard time doing so. She won't even tell me why she has a hard time opening up, which I guess is opening up in and of itself. I've never done anything to break her trust (e.g. texting exes, being flirty with other women, etc.) nor has she had a previous relationship so I don't believe she's been hurt by someone in the past. 

Our current living situation is a bit unusual. I'm living about 4 hours away for an internship while she lives with my family due to her family living halfway across the world. We see each other about every 2 weeks or so.

I call her just about 2-3 times a day just asking simple things like how was her day, how did she sleep, what was her favorite part of the day, etc. She sends me pictures of her crocheting projects, her watercolor paintings, and I take interest in what she loves to do. I also often ask how her family is doing, if she's talked to her mom and her sisters, and how her brother in the marines is holding up.

Well, last night I didn't sleep well so I forgot to call her this morning. So she calls me on my way to work. Meanwhile, she's asking me about my work, the project that I'm doing, asking me to describe it which I really didn't want to do because it would've taken too long to explain with her lack of understanding of the topic. I wanted to just enjoy my morning playlist and the sunrise on my commute. In my groggy self, I just have short responses. She asks me if I'm annoyed with her, and I respond honestly and tell her that I'm not really in the mood to talk and I can call her later. So I tell her I love her and we end the conversation.

Then immediately after, she sends me a text. Here is our conversation.

&gt;Her: ""Babe, the reason I call you is because I really miss my family and having someone to comfort me. I just wanted you to know and understand...""    
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ""So call your family""  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""I don't think you understand""  
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""What is there to understand? You miss your family so it would be natural to call your family""  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""And I do. But sometimes what I want to hear from you as the person I'm closest to is that you care for me and that you're there for me""   
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""We talk every day""  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""So you think that all I need in life is to talk to you on the phone and hear how each others day was or how the other person slept and that's good enough?""  
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""What do you expect me to do? Drive 4 hours every morning?  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""That's not what I mean and you know it""   
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""So then why are you getting mad at me?""  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""No. Of course not. I just sometimes need to hear in words that you care for me and are here for me when I'm hurting. That's all!""  
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""I tell you every day so what's wrong""  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""I'm sorry I bothered you. Never mind""  
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""Wait, why am I the bad guy now?""   
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""You're not""  
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""You're obviously mad at me""   
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""I'm not mad, I'm just hurt and lonely. I'm sorry. It's my fault that I bottle up my feelings until the breaking point then expect you to know what's going on. That's not your fault. That's mine.""  
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""Why didn't you say something sooner?""  
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""Because I don't know how to""   
&gt;  
&gt;M: ""What would you like me to do?""   
&gt;  
&gt;H: ""Nothing I guess. It's my fault. I'm sorry.""

The conversation continues a bit. Being the beginning of the workday, I tell her I'll call her during lunch. During that phone call, she tells me for the fortieth time how she has trouble opening up. And again, for the fortieth time, I try to be as kind and as gentle as I can be so she can tell me whatever is going on. And yet, she can't. 

I've tried a billion things to help her to open up to me on her terms. I lavish her in gifts. I put off things at work to call her. I call her too and from work. I call her before bed. Whenever we're together, we watch the movies she wants to watch, I take her to go get a pedicure (fellas, I highly recommend a pedicure. They feel amazing) I try my hand at watercolor which I suck at, I cuddle with her the way she wants to cuddle and never make her feel uncomfortable. I make her her favorite tea. I cook dinner for her. I've tried expressing my love for her in all five love languages. I've opened up to her myself telling her about my dreams, desires, aspirations as well as my hurts, struggles, and previous relationships. If none of those above show my care and love for her, I don't know what will.

It's starting to be a burden on me because I'm trying to be available whenever she needs me but then when I want to do the things that I want to do, that's when she calls me and wants to have a 3 hour long Facetime call. And I'll be as straightforward and honest as I can and tell her that I'm tired and want to relax by blowing up stuff in Battlefield. And even still, I'll opt for the 3-hour long facetime call over a Dota match with my guys.

To top it all off, my mother, whom I love very much, is quite religious and hates it when my girlfriend and I have any kind of physical affection (because we're not married) and has let us both know how she doesn't want any cuddling in her house. I've respected that rule to a certain extent when I'm visiting. However, being financially independent of my parents and having lived on my own for 3 years now, I have trouble being dictated by someone who used to \*excessively\* discipline me (another story). My girlfriend, on the other hand, cannot stand disappointing anyone (except me, apparently), especially both of our parents.

However, it's put a strain on our relationship because 1) my love language is physical affection and 2) whenever we do get a chance to cuddle, my girlfriend gets up and walks away whenever she hears footsteps. So in my mind, she's putting my mother's opinion of her above our relationship, which is extremely hurtful. I've even told her and opened up to her about this.

And now she's telling me that she's lonely which I figured but has never explicitly told me and only does tell me through text.

TL;DR: Girlfriend has a hard time opening up, I do everything that I can including opening up my feelings to her which makes me feel exposed with someone who apparently can't trust me, she considers my mother's opinion of her more important than our relationship, and when she does open up it's through text.

So my questions is, is there anything that I'm doing wrong? What can I do to help her to open up? Is there anything that I can tell my mother to let her know that her archaic rules are putting a strain on my relationship?"

I could tell he was younger but I didn’t realize how young. I was 19 at the time and home from college and he was 16, still in high school. We fucked around and flirted at work all the time. And then we both realized we loved to smoke so we made plans to smoke after work and had so much fun laughing. We started to make it a regular thing and I’ve told him more about myself than I’ve told friends and family. We became closer than my friend who I’ve known since 2nd grade. Everyone used to say he loved me, but after all that time he never made a move or even called me pretty, but he used to tell me I can do anything and that I was great. We eventually talked about maybe getting tg and I said he would have to wait til he was 18, but by then I had an internship within corporate America and we rarely saw each other. He is now dating someone who is two years older and proud to show him off which he totally deserves. But I still miss my best friend and being able to go o him for anything and laughing with him all the time. I don’t want to have hope for us down the line bc it will close me off from possibly dating anyone else, but I don’t know if I will feel so comfortable being 100% myself around anyone else. I’m moving away now and I didn’t even get to say a proper goodbye bc he evaded my texts to hangout :( "

DP, I'm friends with 2 people, Blue and Green. Blue and I get along fine, but she suddenly became interested in my culture in a very weird and borderline fetishistic way. She's a white Catholic; I'm a black Muslim. She decided that she was going to convert to Islam and started using Arabic words for herself, and started a popular blog that really centered her as an authority on this religion. This upset me, and when I asked her to back off a little, and not treat my culture like a costume, she refused and blocked me. I'm not exactly bothered by that. I am, however, bothered by Green's reaction. Green is a Chinese Buddhist and has faced similar problems with white people acting the exact same way with her culture. Yet she thinks I'm being too sensitive and demanding of Blue. I'm frustrated. I know I can't ask Green to end her friendship with Blue, but it hurts to see Green share Blue's name and content everywhere. And her taking Blue's side makes me feel like she doesn't care about issues that affect me. Am I being too sensitive over this?

Podcast LW2: Ex next door

DP, Earlier this year, I bought a new townhouse and proceeded to have exquisite, no-strings-attached sex with my very hot single neighbor. His ex had cheated on him and he kicked her out. We went hot &amp; heavy until our interest waned, and it became apparent we didn't have anything in common beyond the physical. We broke things off as friends. 3 months ago, he got back together with the girl who cheated on him and he told her about us.  Now she has made it her mission to mark her territory and make my life miserable. She walks her yappy little dog and lets it defecate in my year. If my neighbor leaves, she plays thudding, bass-heavy music that makes my teeth rattle and claims ignorance when I complain -- his house is the last on the row. My car has been keyed, my trash cans have been flipped over, and my flowers have been ripped up. Then whenever I see her, she acts like doll, and makes very sympathetic noises about my ""troubles."" My neighbor doesn't believe that she's capable of doing this, but I really don't trust his judgement at this point. Our HOA is basically useless for anything but collecting fees. My friends tell me to get cameras and call the cops when she acts out. I'm worried about escalation. I don't want to call the cops, I just want her to leave me alone.

Podcast LW3: What to do about my neighbor's liquid lunches?

DP, I live next door to a person who drinks heavily. Every time I talk with this person I can smell alcohol on their breath. Most evenings, they exhibit more extreme evidence of drinking -- slurred speech and stumbling. Their drinking hasn't affected me in any real way until now. I'm a teacher, so I'm at home during the summers. Last year, my neighbor had a job that was very close to home. They would bike to and from work, and also biked home at lunch. I'm outside on my  porch or in my yard nearly every day, and it became clear that they were coming home at lunch to drink. Drinking and biking is not great, but I've also biked home drunk more than once, and it seems like the biggest risk is for the cyclist. This summer, they have a new job, which is much farther away. They drive to and from work every day, including driving home for lunch. Based on what I've seen, it seems like they've also continued the lunchtime drinking. This person has a history of starting disputes with neighbors, and has very loud arguments with their family, so I don't really feel comfortable talking with them directly. However, if they're drinking and driving on a daily basis, I feel like I have a responsibility to do something. The question is, what is that something.

\*\*\*

Podcast LW4: Bad guy?

DP, my siblings and I didn't have the most stable childhood. Mom was abusing her pain meds, and dad quickly remarried his 22 year old intern. My twin brother and I were 16, and our younger sister was 11. My brother lost himself in drugs, and I was the academic overachiever, counting the days until I could get out and go to college. Our father got full custody since out mother was never  sober enough to remember when to feed us. My sister would cling to me and try to climb into my bed every night if she could, but she often wet the bed. It got so bad that my father put a lock on my door and put my sister under psychiatric care. I left as soon as I could.

10 years later, I have a great career, my brother has sobered up, and my father is on to wife #4. The 22 year old intern turned out to be an interesting woman and a great mother. But after I posted about my trip to see my ex-stepmother and half-sister, I got a long, rambling email from my sister, wherein she lambasted me for being an evil witch who abandoned her to a Cinderella-like servitude. I was the sole cause for all the misery she had suffered up to this day, and how dare I try to ""play the part"" of being a big sister now. I'm not terribly close to either of my full siblings, but we see each other twice a year and occasionally talk on the phone. I never had an inkling that this resentment was brewing. How do I respond to this? Do I ignore it? Do I defend myself? Apologize, despite the fact that I was a teenager? I have no clue what to do. Please give me some guidance.

Podcast LW5: Hitting

DP, when we were in a fierce argument, my girlfriend slapped me across the face. My first instinct was to hit her back, but I didn't. I left the apartment and walked away. I'm twice the size of my girlfriend, and I have a temper. Growing up with 5 brothers, I learned that the only way to stop them from hitting me, was to hit back twice as hard and 3 times as fast. Getting out on my own, I realized that is a screwed up way of looking at the world, but that instinct is still there. My girlfriend apologized to me but I still feel spooked. I could seriously hurt her without thinking about it. We still argue a lot. My friends tell me we need to break up. I love my girlfriend. I have never felt like this before. What should I do?"

Having to be in and living through dynamics that were abusive, heart breaking, and heart wrenching, reductive, full of disregard, leaving us helpless, to our own devices to construct a world inside the pain.

I want to scream! I want to cry all this pain out. Tell the world what happened me was injustice. It wasn't my fault. I was pulled into a relationship that was so incredibly one sided, unfair, unasked for.

I was my mom's emotional partner. She forced me to be. My dad understood better for himself and cut her out so that she can't get to him. She still got to him. He still had to live with her. She emptied him out from the inside. But I digress. She leaned on me to be her emotional partner since birth. She didn't have any brothers growing up and I was the first son born after two daughters. She named me ""the found one"" but she might as well as have named me ""the blinded crutch"". The crutch whose eyes have been poked out so the crutch can't see for itself - can only be utilized in any direction by its master.

This is the life I've lived for 30 years since birth. My other parent didn't step in to look out for me. They had an implicit deal. ""Have the boy, spare me"". ""I'll have the boy contribute on my behalf, keep my ass covered in the eyes of the world"". That was the deal. Unbeknownst to me. She kept me limited, blinded, at her level so that I can't outgrow her. She wanted me to fulfill the role of the crutch, the same role that was perhaps pushed on to her by her mother. She told me she vowed to herself to be the boy of her family amongst the five sisters and an army dad who wanted nothing more than to stay away from his wicked wife, my grandmother.

Back in 2018, every day, I wake up with a heavy heart. A broken heart. As if I am getting over the longest heartbreak I've ever known. Saddened to the brim. My face forms a smile in pictures being taken but my eyes refuse to lie. To the camera, to the world, and even me. I've only started listening to them recently.

That fucking bitch. She betrayed me. She backstabbed me. And her useless husband, my supposed father, let it all happen. It made his life easier. She wouldn't lean on him. But she still emptied him out. The sorry son of a bitch refuses to admit it for himself. But he's complicit too.

30 years of life, constructed, ""lived"", inside the boundaries of that initial rejection. By Her. Refused to accept me. Refused to embrace me. But prodded me like the cattle I was meant to be for her. Pushed me to do all the things that she needed out of me. To bring home the bacon for her. Never mind the original sin, this is the Original Pain.

It was all so squeaky clean. Especially on the surface but also to my poked out eyes. That was part of the plan. Don't let the boy clue in. And the boy didn't. Lived my life at the emotional and mental level of a toddler. Went through all my schooling like that. Didn't retain anything for myself. Had one fragment of my psyche to live in and never the full range of my own humanity. MY humanity. Never asked them for a dime. Paid for my own schooling. Worked at my own university part-time while studying full-time to get my Bachelor's. Did co-op and internships to accumulate $60,000. And handed it all over to my ever-loving and ever-caring parents so they could put on a decent wedding for a sister who is 4 years older than me. So that they could make a dent in their house's mortgage. A house I've ostensibly paid 20% in to but don't have any legal or emotional rights to. They say it'll all be mine one day anyway - ""when they die"". ""But I'm living now"" I plead to myself and to a lesser extent, them. But their lines are drawn for themselves.

I can't expect a phone call from them on my birthday but I have all the relatives either joining them in shunning me from family events or hounding me to be a support for my dad. They understand about the mom enough to not even mention being there for her. They go straight to the dad. ""At least do it for him"". ""He's complicit"", I tell them. ""He made his choices"". They don't understand. They'd rather not.

Longest heartbreak and I've only started going through it. The heart is already damaged and mangled and squashed but getting ever closer to opening my eyes fully and let myself feel the weight of it all. In my heart - where it matters. "
8zq4g1,1,2018-07-17,How do I (23M) learn to stop thinking about my toxic ex (21F) and let go of the past?,upyoursize,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8zq4g1/how_do_i_23m_learn_to_stop_thinking_about_my/,"This is a long ass story, so this is a slightly abridged version of events.




TL;DR: My ex-gf broke into my house to steal back gifts, lied about it, and didn't have to answer for her actions. I still think about her daily 6 months later, but it's killing me inside. I desperately want to close this chapter in my life and move on. What are some constructive methods or ways of analyzing my situation that I can use to move on from this event, even without closure?




I started dating my ex S (F21) in the January of 2017, just a few months after another breakup with a girlfriend. S and I dated for about 9 months, during which I saw numerous red flags that I should've acted upon. On top of the gaslighting and guilt-tripping, she had tons of body and self-esteem issues that were a sore spot in our relationship. She would have dreams that I was cheating on her with my lesbian friend (lol), refuse any sort of compliment from me, and berate herself constantly. Despite my reassurance that I was faithful and she was wonderful, she continued this behavior throughout our relationship. In October I decide that I was done, and I eventually dumped her. S and I still had 3 classes together, which made things difficult, but eventually we started talking again and made up.




It was at that point that S started talking about sex. She wanted to continue our sexual relationship (FWB), and I agreed. That lasted until December, right before Winter Break. The FWB situation was not working out; it felt too much like we were still dating. She had come over to my house to give me back a book, and I explained to her that we couldn't see each other anymore (#1 reason being that she was not on birth control). She then begins to cry and get angry with me. She starts screaming at me and pointing fingers. She demands that I drop out of the class we have the next semester. I refuse because I needed it to graduate on time. She continues to berate me until I threaten to call the police. I left for home the following day. When I return to school for NYE, I discover that the posters she had given me were missing from my room, along with other gifts. Unfortunately my roommate had left the house unlocked when he went to work and S snuck in. 




I contacted the police a few days later, and after speaking to a detective he asked if I wanted them to contact her. I declined because I didn't want to escalate the situation. In the meantime, I began meeting with the Assistant Dean of Students, and she arranged a meeting between the three of us to discuss the situation. In addition, she also established a no-contact order. S couldn't look me in the eye as I presented my case. I told S that all I wanted was for her to admit that she did it and I would drop the case, but she denied everything. S left the meeting and the dean and I made plans to escalate the case to a student conduct meeting. The dean asked if I would drop it if S apologized, and I agreed. The following week I was contacted by the dean who told me that S had signed a document claiming responsibility for entering my house. The no-contact order was still in effect however, so I still couldn't confront her. Thus, she never had to admit it, or apologize. As far as I'm concerned, she got off scot-free.




I just graduated this past May and I'm living at home again. I'm hundreds of miles away from her, I have an awesome summer internship and a great full-time job, I live in one of the most beautiful places on Earth and somehow I can't stop thinking about her every day. I really truly loathe this girl and want to move past it, but the lack of closure that I got from the situation is a huge hurdle to my happiness. I have started lifting again, and have made serious progress in my downhill longboarding skills, but these activities aren't distracting me like I had hoped.




I would wholeheartedly appreciate any input, advice, or constructive methods to help me move past this.

First let me give you some background so you guys can better understand my situation.  

I am a mechanical Engineer Major who is also doing a minor in Computer Science. I came on as an intern to an existing project that involves an control system.  This Control system is controlled by an Allen Bradley and has a Maple System HMI panel attached to the system. I am tasked with creating a web based HMI so that a computer connected to the same network as the control System can be used as another monitor. 

Prior to this internship  I have no experience with PLC. Please correct me if I am failing to understand something. This is how I was seeing this project after some initial research. 

 I focused on creating an OPC Server first since that will allow me to read/get values from the Allen Bradley so that I can get them into a database so that  my web interface can access. I was using NI OPC Servers 2016 since I had access to the software.  However it seems that the Allen Bradley ControlLogix 5564 is not supported with NI OPC Server 2016. 

(http://www.ni.com/white-paper/6417/en/#toc2) 

This blew up my whole plan.  I was going to set up an OPC Server using NI OPC Server 2016 and use LabVIEW DSC module but I am abandoning that idea. I am currently lost as to what to do next.

Question 1: is there any free OPC Server alternatives that I can use?

Question 2: Is there a way to create my own OPC server and if there is are there any tutorials that I can learn from?

Request: Any advice outside of my given questions will be greatly appreciated.

I arrived in Canada just under a month ago as a new permanent resident. Have to firstly say your country is great and so is your city! Though it's damn hot. My wife says to appreciate it and not complain because it will be 60 degrees colder in the winter :)

Anyway, I have a bachelor degree in information technologies from my home country and I hope some of you can provide me with advice in looking for a job in this sector. 

I searched through this sub and found some older posts with good info on companies, so I looked those up and I'm checking every day to see if they have something that I could apply for. But I thought asking wouldn't hurt and maybe there's more updated info people can share. 

I've updated my resume, have been applying for jobs for three weeks, and I know I have a long way to go and have to be patient, but **I was wondering if anyone could tell me if they have had success in finding a job in IT with a foreign degree? I'm worried that having a foreign degree is putting me at a disadvantage.** 

Because I recently graduated I don't have a lot of experience, and I'm stuck because I'm finding either internships that require you to be in school or positions that ask for more experience than I have. I've recently been looking at Algonquin College programs but I'm a little late to apply for the 2018/19 school year. 

I am open to part-time, contract work, and work including data analysis, database management, whatever...I just need something to get started. If anyone has any volunteer work related to IT I would love to help! I am going to look at any volunteering opportunities soon because I just need to get out of the house. 

Experience/interest is in software development, app and web development, and network security. I'm CCNA and MTCNA certified as well. 

Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance!"
8zr7zw,4,2018-07-17,[rant] I think my thoughts are borderline anorexic.,intowl6,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/8zr7zw/rant_i_think_my_thoughts_are_borderline_anorexic/,"Mods, feel free to remove if this should be in a rant thread or something.

Where do I even begin. Today has been a terrible day.

Let me preface this by saying that I was doing fine two weeks ago - until my family and I went camping. I had been meeting my CICO goal of 1200 calories a day and had lost five pounds in two or three weeks. However, when we went camping, I decided to ""cheat"" a little and eat as much as I wanted in those two days.

Bad idea.

I've been having so much trouble following my diet since then. I must have broken a habit or something, but also the place I'm interning at has a lot of free food so I've been trying to take advantage of that as well as stay within my limit, which has been really hard.

I'm probably on the edge of a breakdown today. I had two eggs for breakfast and a 280 calorie sandwich for lunch at noon. It's been six and a half hours and I haven't let myself eat yet, because I felt that saving the 700ish calories I had left for dinner would be the best idea. (I am a teenager still living with my parents so they're making dinner as I type this)

It's been horrible. I was feeling extremely hungry at around 3 or 4 hours after lunch, but I got over the hump of hunger. However, I've been in a really bad mood since then, probably because of the hunger, and I was messaging my boyfriend about this. He was suggesting that maybe I bring a granola bar or something as an afternoon snack at work, and I said that a granola bar was 100 calories and I was trying to save all my calories until dinner or later. He then made the point that it shouldn't be making me physically uncomfortable, and I thought, well if I was doing fine before, why not now?

However, he did make the point that he was worried I would become anorexic, that my words were borderline anorexic already. I'm not overweight, but I see myself as fat, and if my Asian relatives saw me they'd definitely think so, too. My fat hangs off my thighs in such an unflattering way, especially while I'm looking down at them from my height, but also just in a mirror. Part of me wants to listen to him and loosen up a little - and part of me just wants to give this up altogether, because I only have this internship for one summer and I want to take advantage of all the free food and just be able to eat whatever I want. However, another part of me will feel like I'm giving up and betraying myself.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just so done with this. I don't know what to do."

Pittsburgh Area.,osomabinsemen,internetparents,https://www.reddit.com/r/internetparents/comments/8zrcjk/im_trying_to_put_my_life_togetherneed_some/,"Some background information:  I don't have parents and live with my brother and sister-in-law.  They won't be living here much longer as they just had a baby and they'll want to move and get a bigger house.  I have about 29k in inheritance right now minus student loans.  I have a car as well that'll probably be another 8-9k after this next year.  I'll be graduating college (I'm 21 now) in 2019 with a film degree, but I'm not sure this is what I want to do now.  
  
I currently work in an office setting as an intern making pretty decent money. I've been working there for 2 years going part time during school and full time over the summer.  This summer, however, my hours have been cut down to 2-3 days a week.  I've been using the other days to write (Ideally I'd like to make this my career but recognize that I will need a job to sustain myself).  
  
The office setting is debilitating as I have a tendency to want to be actively doing something which really hurts my work ethic while I'm there.  I recognize that this experience would look good on a resume but I don't actually know if I could do this any more than I do.  I actually had some motivation/depression issues last summer while working full time there.  I have found that 2 days a week is a good life/writing/work balance and I'm happy for the first time in a while.  I do not mind working physically or being on my feet for long hours.  I'm also open to weird hours/nightshift/etc.  
  
I'm basically trying to put this all together.  Do I move out and try to find writing gigs?  Do I move somewhere cheap and get a job to sustain myself while I write?  I'm really struggling to figure myself out.  I guess I'm just asking what others would do in my situation.  
  
  
I guess what I'm looking for is:  
  
What would you do with the inheritance?  
What jobs are available that would let someone sustain themselves half decently?  
I've never really lived by myself other than on campus with other people.  How do I even live alone?  
  
Sorry if this is too much of a rant, I'm just really freaking out and am kind of confused as to my next step.  "

I just learned about this forum a couple weeks ago by some acquaintance.   


I'm not even sure what I should write here. I am a med student, and I'm currently following a internship in the infectology department, together with a team. Up to this point I have experienced a lot of things on this career.

But today I lost someone. This is the first time I've witnessed death ever since I enrolled in medschool. I don't even know what to do. The sweetest lady I've ever met, she came in with a complicated infection and did not resist the treatment.   


I was not the one responsible for the case. That would be the resident + doctor responsible. But I was part of that team. I had contact and interacted with her more than a couple of times. She was there for a couple days already. But, when the responsible made the call. My mind shattered. I went to the bathroom and cried. I haven't cried in year. But I cried like I never had before.

This woman, her family. Everything around it seems to tighten around my heart. I'm feeling like burning iron going down my throat. 

I just need to let some of this out.   
I am sorry. I truly am. "
8zrfux,3,2018-07-17,Dating a coworker,realthrow11,dating,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/8zrfux/dating_a_coworker/,"I'd like to hear your advice!

There's this girl I've been working with for about two months who I'd like to take out on a date and get to know her better, but I'm skeptical about how the dynamic of work could change if something goes wrong (things might get awkward depending on how we handle it).

We get our work done, but we have also have some pretty good laughs too. I get a subtle vibe that she may also be into me, but at the same time could just be acting friendly because we're at work. We've gone out with our other work friends before, but in a group setting she's pretty quiet, so it's been hard for me to really get to know her personally.

We're both interns, and our work rotation only lasts for about another month, and since I've only known her for a couple of months, the unfortunate reality is that we'll go back to our respective schools and lose touch afterwards if I don't get any closer with her. In an ideal world, I could wait until after we're done work and ask her out, but I'm afraid that will be too late with the way our schedules are.

Part of me says ""there's a million fish in the sea"", and I should just move on and forget it, but the other part of me says ""there's a million fish in the sea, but these two particular fish really seem to understand each other well."" We've got that we have that mutual ""I get you so well"" look.

Some additional details/snafus: I like to think I'm a pretty observant person when it comes to sensing feelings. That being said, I'm not seeing most of the usual ""girl likes me"" body language, but that could very well be because we're in a work setting. The other snafu is that she may be into someone else that we work (distantly) with, but I could very well be overthinking it.

Should I try to ask her out, or should I just move on? If I go for the date, I don't intend it to be all that romantic, that's more something I can gauge down the line.

Thanks!"

8zrqed,42,2018-07-17,"[Effortpost] Just move lol: Why those living in rural areas who can move to a city, should.",_Aether__,neoliberal,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/8zrqed/effortpost_just_move_lol_why_those_living_in/,"I got in an argument with my friends about not having sympathy for people who choose to stay in declining rural areas and then lobby for their coal and manufacturing jobs to save their towns. So here's what I wrote up. [Links and general improved readability (including italics) are in this google doc
](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLuIJ1UYYkAGNIHk-HOcCuaTcdhV9MMe3yk-CDSYrwo/edit)

**Introduction**: You had a coal job. That’s gone. Should we then divest in renewable energy and subsidize coal power so you keep your job? No. You had a manufacturing job. That’s gone. Should we tariff our close allies (or tariff anyone at all) to subsidize your work so you can keep your job? No. Now there aren’t any jobs left in your town. Should we subsidize your town so you can continue to live the same way of life you’re used to? No. 

**Thesis**: Yeah, you got screwed. Don’t screw your kids. Don’t screw the rest of the country. People who live in these dying towns should move to cities. If they can’t, their kids should. I feel like this is not a controversial argument. 

**Body Paragraph 1**: Actually, most people did. Most people did move: there’s a reason the towns are dying. Populations are shrinking, towns are dying, because people are moving. Most people are moving! Again: this isn’t a controversial idea. It’s already played out. It’s not like there aren’t jobs in cities. Unemployment rates are crazy low, there are tons of jobs in cities. Yes, housing is expensive (and for some people could be prohibitively expensive, but again, not to many, because many people did move). But prohibitively expensive housing is due to stifling government over-regulation, it is not an inherent quality of cities.

**Body Paragraph 2:** Cities are great. They’re much better and more efficient than either rural or suburban places. First of all, cities are hubs for innovation and progress. Second, they are more environmentally friendly than either suburbs or rural towns. Third, inner city schools (the worst schools in a city) yield the same outcomes as rural schools. Fourth, health outcomes in cities are significantly better than those in rural areas, in part because emergency response time is quicker; obesity is also lower. Fifth, those who live in rural areas are more likely to be living in economically precarious circumstances (just above the poverty line). This is compounded by the fact that since there are less jobs to go around, losing your job in rural places is worse than losing your job in a city. Sixth, while there is conflicting evidence, people in cities tend to be happier than those in suburbs, or at least the same. I could go on, I’m sure there’s more evidence, but I don’t think there are many other ways to measure outcomes than the ones listed.

**Body Paragraph 3:** Let’s say someone stayed around and got left in a ghost town because the jobs that sustained the town are now defunct. Maybe they actually couldn’t move for some reason; maybe they made a bad bet; maybe they’re just dumb. I am willing to admit that not every single person can move. It’s hard to move. That being said, it would be vastly more efficient and beneficial (to both theirs and the country’s well-being) to provide incentive programs for them to leave. China is right now in the process of forcing 250 million people into cities for this very reason (I should note I am against forcing people like this). At some point you have to stop pumping water out of a sinking ship and get on the lifeboat.

**Conclusion**: You have to remember where I’m coming from. This is the best way to help these people and their children lead better lives. I want to help them. They are not in an enviable position, and I want to help them move to improve their lives. That’s why so many people took the leap and did move. But if someone refuses to move (even with incentive programs)? If they continue to rally for their defunct jobs? No, I don’t have sympathy for them. That’s my point. I want to help them. If they don’t want to be helped, well, the incentive is still there. I’m not stopping them. But I don’t have sympathy for them.

**Parting Thoughts**: Here’s a question: what else should we do? How do you actually want to help the small minority of people who couldn’t or didn’t move? What will make them happy? Their jobs aren’t coming back. How else would you even help them? Improve education? Sounds good, but how are we going to get teachers out there? How are we going to get high speed internet connections out there? What about internships? Social capital?

* Status threat, not economic hardship, explains the 2016 presidential vote

* “Well, why don’t people just leave?
That question is actually surprisingly easy to answer: They did. After all, 80 percent of McDowell’s population, including my grandparents, cleared out of the county to seek opportunities elsewhere during the last half-century”

* Ok. Interesting. So it turns out a lot of the time farmers self select into the profession based on their intelligence. Even then though, even though they aren’t smart, there is still no economic downside to moving to a city

* In terms of well-being, men without work are suffering to such an alarming degree that the authors argue the enormous social costs of non-employment suggest fighting long-term non-employment is more important than fighting inequality.

* General statistics about the urban rural health/economic outcome divide

* Less and less people in rural places

The distance has caused a few problems, and we have been having a little trouble as of late. Despite this we've been working on things and are trying to be better to each other. We still love each other very much, and don't want to lose each other.
Tonight my SO called me drunk out of his mind, and I didn't react very well. I hadn't heard from him for a few hours and was worried about him. I admit that I didnt react the best to the situation, and I think my frustration hurt him. So he said didn't care about me or my feelings and that he doesn't love me all the time.
I know he's extremely drunk, but it really hurt. He passed out so we aren't able to talk anymore. 
I'm unsure of how to talk to him about this tomorrow when he's sober. I don't want to say anything I'll regret, and I don't want to hurt him. I love him so much, and I know he loves me too.

Tldr: My SO got extremely drunk and told me that he doesn't love me all the time. I'm very hurt and I'm unsure how to talk to him about it tomorrow."
8zsn7z,142,2018-07-18,"Tell me, why Satan should have bowed down to Adam?",What_R_YOU_Doin_Here,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/8zsn7z/tell_me_why_satan_should_have_bowed_down_to_adam/,"It doesn't make sense. Why should Satan bow down to anyone but his creator? 

Allah forbids man to bow down anyone but his creator, Allah. At the same time, Allah demands Satan to bow down to Adam. 

Adam didn't create Satan. Adam is just another new toy made by Allah. 

Allah claims that Man is superior to jinn, angels and other creations, and that's why Satan should prostrate before Adam and also because Allah said so (coming to that in a moment). 

In what aspect is man superior though? Physically? Nope, man is too fragile compared to jinn. Mentally? Who knows? 

What I do know is that the full extent of their (Jinn) mental prowess is unknown, but they are not retards or like a robot. The jinn are also given free will. So, men are not better in that aspect either. 

So, is it about worshipping Allah? Satan praised Allah for a very long time without going insane from that repetitive task. He didn't become the leader of the Angels by slacking off. He certainly did worship Allah longer than any man ever born and did it better than any Angel. 

Last of all, Allah and his nifty little tests. He commanded Abraham to sacrifice his only child and then basically said, ""It's just a prank, bro."" He also tested every other prophet. Many times the prophets passed, but sometimes the prophets failed. For example, Prophet Zakarya was cut in half. Zakarya asked help from tree, so he can hide. Zakarya didn't ask help from Allah. He was cut in half while he was inside the tree. Allah, didn't send Zakarya to hell though. 

On the other hand, Satan did exactly a single mistake and he has been destined to spend all the eternity in hell.  Such mercy from the one who calls himself, The Merciful. Islam says, Satan was proud and that's why he didn't bow down to Adam. Shouldn't he be proud of how Allah made him? Doesn't Allah forbid mankind from complaining about their own physical features and altering them? 

Also, Allah makes Adam. Shows him off to Angels and Satan, and tell everyone to bow to him as Adam is superior. 
Adam hasn't spent an hour praying to Allah. On the other hand, Satan has probably spent millennia praying to Allah. This is like going to office and finding out that the inexperienced new intern is the CEO now.

Regardless, there's a different interpretation to what actually happened to Satan. It's from Sufism. 
Sufis see Satan as the paradigm of love and the perfect lover. Despite the traditional interpretation of Satan's fall from Grace as an act of excessive pride and rebellion against God, some Sufis see it as an act of self-sacrifice for God's love. Satan refused to bow down to Adam out of his uncompromising monotheism and devotion; he refused to venerate anything or anyone but God. 

Al-Ghazali, a well-known medieval Sufi Muslim theologian, narrates:

Encountering Eblis on the slopes of Sinai, Moses hailed him and asked, “O Eblis, why did you not prostrate before Adam?” Eblis replied, “Heaven forbid that anyone worship anything but the One. […] This command was a test.” [49] [50]

Satan believed that God ordered him to bow down to Adam to test his love for him. Satan should maintain his love for God at any cost. So, even if the cost of Satan's refusal to prostrate before Adam is falling from Grace, he should proceed with it out of his unconditional love for God.[50] Abdul Karim Jili, a Muslim Sufi saint, believes that after the Day of Judgement, Hell will cease to exist, and Satan will be back to the service of God as one of his cherished angels.

8zt0sr,3,2018-07-18,NDad flipped out when I wanted to take a $3 uber back home,kasselmcg,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8zt0sr/ndad_flipped_out_when_i_wanted_to_take_a_3_uber/,"I was visiting my friend who works at Starbucks near the place I work and I told my dad while at work. However while he texted me back about what time I’ll be home but my phone was on silent so I didnt see the text until 2 hours after. When one of my friends left to go home I texted my Ndad that I’ll be taking an uber if that’s ok. He FLIPPED OUT. 

http://imgur.com/bubc4b5
http://imgur.com/5dqSIfy
http://imgur.com/bQONxUv
http://imgur.com/51O7lB7

Texted me paragraphs of just random rants. He has a history of being an alcoholic so I wasn’t sure if he was drunk. 
He had church at 7:30 and told me to wait until 9:15 to pick me up when I was done by 6:30. No thanks rather take a $3 uber home. (Uber was having a huge sale that day). I’m 19 and don’t drive yet but even if I could drive I wouldn’t have a car. 
Which is why I rely on uber or lyft a lot. But I use it under my dad’s credit card. I’m thinking about making the switch to my debit card once I get a job on campus. (My Nparents specifically want me to get a job on campus bc it’s safer I guess). 

Not only did my dad sent a text rant he yelled at me the entire car ride home making me cry. He gets really verbally aggressive when doing a rant of anger. He took my phone threatening me saying I’ll get a flip phone. Called me childish and a baby how I’m never going to grow up and I’m going to turn into my mom who still relies on her parents for financial support. (I rather have her rely on my grandparents than my father who thinks by providing financial support to the family is an excuse to keep drinking alcohol even though to avoid divorce my mom made him agree to never drink inside the house and do couple therapy. He’s clearly an unstable source for financial wellbeing). He even exposed how he almost made my brother not go to college because of his f**king fits over normal human mistakes. He even threatened me about not seeing my BF for the rest of the month before he leaves for a 3 month internship in August. 

When we arrived at Church he told me I could either walk home (5 mile walk) or come to Church with him. My eyes were still so red from crying and I didnt want to my humiliated further by my church so I told him I’m walking home. When I started walking he changed his mind and said actually I dont want you to walk all the way home it’s unsafe and I rather have you sit at the Coffee Bean on the corner and wait till 9:00pm to pick me up. So I literally walked to coffee bean alone and still tearing up a little without any cell phone. (the logic right?? it’s unsafe to walk alone back home but its safe to walk alone in the evening without a cellphone 2 blocks away and wait 2 hours until you show up) 
To lift up my mood I shopped in some cheap store there and got cute earrings and a white tee. Then 15 min later he picked me up at Coffee Bean. 

Also what is it with with Narcs being the biggest religious hypocrites?? They go to church and come home doing the opposite of what they preach? 

The day before I was out with my BF and we were eating udon and my phone died out of nowhere but I had keys back to my house so I wasn’t worried and I told my dad about my plans. We went to an art museum after then went to see a movie then after that my dad texts my BF about when I’ll be home. The funny thing is that my BF is not used to NParents. He wouldn’t let me see the text and was like chill out its just your dad and he’s just asking when you’re gonna get home. Hahaaa It’s not just my dad it’s my dad and my coffin waiting for me at home. I freaked out and was like oh he’s so mad at me and literally had a wave of anxiety take over my body. My BF tried to calm me down. 

The day after the whole fit over the $3 uber he gave me my phone back and apologized. I never said I forgave him. I just said ok. But he always does this it’s like a cycle. Get’s mad and verbally abuse. Realizes how shitty that was for all of us. Apologizes expecting us not to be traumatized by that and return to being a “happy” family. 

It’s weird when you catch yourself in those moments like why do my parents still control my emotions and my mental health so much. 

TDLR: Visited friends at their work after work. Wanted to take a $3 uber home and Narc dad flip out and went on text rant."

Wij zijn van Twirlbound, een game developer in het mooie Breda. Momenteel zijn we bezig met Pine, onze eerste grote titel voor PC en consoles. We zijn opgericht in 2013, deden veel kleine projecten, een iOS game en opdrachten, en pakten onze kans in 2016 om een afstudeerproject naar een hoger niveau te tillen door middel van een kleine overheidssubsidie, later crowdfunding en momenteel in samenwerking met een uitgever. De komende uren beantwoorden we met veel liefde en plezier ál jullie vragen!

Inmiddels zijn we een team van 7, nauw samenwerkend met een aantal freelancers voor audio ([Ratchet Audio](https://ratchetaudio.com)) en extra art, en met onmisbare support van een aantal stagaires. Voornamelijk aan het woord is @MatthijsL, creative director, co-founder en business-go-to van het team, met als ondersteuning voor technische vragen @marcpeyre (technical director, co-founder) en @Lukas_St voor animatie en art, mocht het erg druk worden. Maar het hele team zit in de buurt om zelfs op de állerspecifiekste vragen te reageren.

Pine is waar we momenteel nog steeds hard aan werken, na een lange weg van bijna drie jaar. Een succesvolle Kickstarter campagne vorig jaar stond ons toe met ons relatief grote team door te ontwikkelen en zorgde voor betere kansen bij uitgevers voor verdere financiering. Hoewel we geen specifieke release window mogen noemen, weten we wel dat de laatste fases van ontwikkeling zeker in zicht zijn. We vertellen we graag over het bedrijf, het project, onze positie in de industrie en meer. Naast onze Twitter is hier veel info te vinden:

--------------------------------

Hey Redditors!

We are Twirlbound, a game developer based in the lovely Breda in the south of the Netherlands. We are currently working on Pine, our first big title for PC and consoles. Our company was founded in 2013, starting with lots of small projects, an iOS game and freelance work, as we grabbed our chance in 2016 to take a graduation project to the next level through some government funding, later a crowdfunding campaign and currently in cooperation with a publisher. In the next few hours we’d love to answer any questions you might have!

At this point we’re a team of 7, closely working together with a few freelancers for audio and additional artwork, and with indispensable support from a few interns. Mostly speaking will be @MatthijsL, creative director, co-founder and business-go-to, with support for technical questions by @marcpeyre (technical director, co-founder) and @Lukas_St for animation and art, in case things get crazy. In any case, the whole team’s on standby to answer even the most specific questions!

Pine is what we’re currently working hard on, after a long road of roughly 3 years. A successful Kickstarter campaign allowed us to keep development going with our relatively large team, as well us giving us better chances with publishers for additional financing. Even though we can’t mention a specific release window, we do know that the last phases of production are definitely within reach. We’ll gladly talk about the company, project, our position in this industry and more. Check out the links above for information on us and the game!

It's well paid, interesting and rare. I am very lucky to get the question.
I have also been offered an internship abroad through an NGO. It will last for 4 months. I think it's really intersting and I have always dreamt of working/studying abroad at some point. And now I'm 30 so I feel stressed that it will never happen. That this is my only chance.
However, I have my doubts about it. It could be an amazing experience, but it could also be the opposite. I have a long history of mental illness. Depression, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, self harm and ocd. The last year I have mostly felt great and accomplished a lot. I mostly feel strong, but I am scared of what those 4 months could do to me. The country is poor, and it has been said that there is a risk of loneliness. It might be the best experience of my life, but it might also set me back years in my growth. I don't know what to do since I am afraid that this is my last chance to go abroad, and eventhough I am happy to get the job in my hometown, I am still tired of the place and I'm longing to leave.
Any suggestions?"
8ztvzx,1,2018-07-18,11 Types of Business Contacts with International Import and Export Companies,BellaQi,u_BellaQi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BellaQi/comments/8ztvzx/11_types_of_business_contacts_with_international/,"You can find international business partners for your products in a variety of ways. It's not as difficult as other people think. Hard work definitely takes time, patience, and sometimes money. There are 11 traditional and unconventional tools that you can take to promote your company to an international destination.

I.Foreign students: the most overlooked potential customers and market information sources are through communication with your foreign students. Keep in mind that these foreign students are representatives of foreign market consumers, a source of cultural and market information, and may be able to connect you to their home markets. Your business can even offer summer intern opportunities to achieve mutual benefit for your business, interns and participating schools.

II.Get a list of leads and take advantage of export management companies: You can buy export leads from international leading suppliers, or you can use international trading companies to sell your products overseas. Some exporters provide fees and/or percentages for direct contact with foreign agents.

III.Visit foreign markets: If your company is financially capable, you can send your sales staff overseas for business trips. Face-to-face meetings with different companies will enable you to make educated choices about who should represent your business, foreign market conditions, what your competitors are doing, and many other valuable insights.

IV.Advertisement: An advertisement in an internationally distributed magazine about your company, such as a publication on an international flight or in a target market, attracts the international community's attention to your product.	

V.U.S. Department of Commerce: for each country, the U.S. Department of Commerce has a national desk officer. This is the source of useful information. They can find the U.S. Department of Commerce website search.

VI.National Trade Data Bank: Many American embassies around the world have monthly reports about their country. These reports provide information on new laws, market research, upcoming projects, exhibits, business-critical contacts, and companies looking for American products. These reports are provided in a government database called the national Trade Data bank, which can be accessed online and provided in CD format.	

VII.International Trade Association: There are many international trade and exporters associations in every country. These associations gather in them the treasures of an experienced international businessman in each location of the world. Joining them will certainly increase your international business and provide you with valuable data on your major markets and other opportunities around the world. They are often also visited by trade delegations, where you will have the opportunity to meet face-to-face.

VIII.Industry-specific associations: Joining associations associated with your particular service or industry may increase your international opportunities. Many associations have foreign members you can contact and many foreign companies to contact them to find business partners.

IX.Overseas exhibitions and exhibits: participation in your target foreign market held by exhibitions and exhibits is a direct and very effective connecting producer. You can contact your embassy in China and ask them to provide you with a list of upcoming trade shows that match your interests.

X.Your local trade exhibitions and exhibits: large trade fairs and exhibits in your country are often attended by foreign companies, looking for products to buy or represent. Select the exhibits you should attend by studying their attendance statistics.

XI.Online Import Export Committee: There are many online forums (some are free, other fees) that you can join, and be able to post trade leads, your business, and interact with hundreds of overseas companies.

   TradeSNS through the analysis of a large number of data, we discover the logical relationship between people, company, product and custom data. And combine it to develop a powerful engine to achieve one-click search. Enter the keywords in the TradeSNS, you can search for all the people, companies, products, and custom data that are relevant to them, and then sift through the multi-dimensional conditions to find potential buyers.

8ztx42,1,2018-07-18,How should i approach my No Contact Situation,capn123,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/8ztx42/how_should_i_approach_my_no_contact_situation/,"Hello guys, i recently broke up with my Girlfriend due to being in a Long distance relationship, ill try to explain things shortly, since in my head i could write a book about it, we were in a relation ship for 3 years and 9 months, 9 of this months we were apart due to me studying a masters abroad, we talked about the whole situation and after suggesting a lot of alternatives (she joining here to also study, internship to join me, etc, etc) we BOTH agreed (upon her input) that the best was that she should stay at our home country developing her career. so then when i finish my masters in 1 year, i could join her and we both would find a way to have a happy life (with both her and my goals in perspective). 

5 months into the masters program i went home to visit her for 1 month, then i returned here, things were going perfectly, seeing her during this month strengthened our feelings towards each other, communication improved, etc., 2 months were like this then during this past month, she switched jobs to a new city, she started being less and less communicative, until it gets to a point where we only say good morning and good night, i try to be understanding since she might be very busy with her new work, but after 2 weeks it is impossible, so i request a Skype meeting to just ""hang out"", i bring up the recent lack of communication, she suddenly explodes, saying that she is tired of feeling lonely, missing me, and feeling trapped of not being able to do things with her life cause i have to finish my masters first; i try to address the issue and start suggesting solutions, i tell her that many LDR's try to make plans so they feel that there is light at the end of the road, she says that she doesn't want to do that cause she would feel even more compromised and trapped, she wants to be with me but she really needs me now, that she feels like shit due to me not being there and that she thinks that the only way to feel better is to breakup, but that she either doesn't want to do it online or that it might not be the best solution, i comfort her telling her that i will be visiting in a month (to stay 2 months there), and since i am almost done with my program it will be easier for me to be closer to her from now on, heck i could also write my thesis in our home country and cut down 6 months of the whole thing, leaving only 6 months left of distance. we dont arrive to a SOLID solution but she says that she will find a better way of dealing with her feelings, that she loves me a lot and that we both will do our best. 

things improved since then, but after 2 weeks the lack of communication reappeared, i didn't say anything cause there was only 1 month left till we saw each other and i was on exams, so i thought i would deal with it in person, then one day she asks me ""what are you doing today"", i replied ""i am going to eat with some friends cause its my bday"" she forgot about it, i didn't want to create a drama about it, she only replies ""hahaha im the worst honey, happy birthday"" i only reply, ""thank you very much"" and try to enjoy the rest of the day without this bothering me, the next day i went to a concert, the environment there was too much for me, everyone there was crazy, high, etc etc., so i felt a little bit alienated and lonely (since i also went alone to that concert) so i did a mistake by texting her ""hey i do feel a little bit bad that you forgot my bday, and when i reminded you, you didn't even try to say something nice"" THIS IS WHERE THINGS EXPLODED, she said that she just didn't feel like saying anything cause she still feels trapped and like shit in this relationship cause i am imposing her ""my plan""... that she wanted to breakup but not by text, since the words she used really hurt me i said, no need to care how you do it, if you want it, we are done, she agreed. 

if i recall we have had many arguments like this, every time i complained about some behavior that was offensive to me (i can swear that i was pretty chill, but there are occasions were you need to speak up), she would say something like, ""we should have broken up a while ago"", but since i was there physically i could address this kind of problems in a better way until things cooled down and we solved the issue, she has a really immature behavior cause she was raised very differently their mother made her believe that a guy will give her her 1000% percent, he would leave everything for her and make her his main focus, that he would pay for everything, treat her like a queen, give her a million dollar ring to marry her, etc etc., She really resisted the mindset her mother imposed her, but sometimes she really acted like she was taught. In some occasions she told me that she felt resentful that i left, or jealous that i was enjoying living abroad and she wasn't (i dont enjoy that much really since i am studying most of the time), so negative feelings had been cooking up inside her during the last months.  i also have NEVER cheated nor would i cheat, i always sent her letters, flowers, gifts, and things that made her feel loved. 

when i was there, living with her, things were mostly great, so this really makes me miss the relationship, now after the breakup we haven't even talked for 4 days, normally we would apologize moments later and fix things, but distance makes it impossible now, and me reaching back would only make things worse, since we actually broke up (we never broke up in an argument before) and she actually feels pressured and she has been thinking that breaking up is the only thing that would make her feel better for a while, i don't know which kind of no contact scenario is this, due her different way of processing emotions, she might feel that it was the best thing to do, cause she wont feel like shit missing me, or like having to follow a plan (i had no plan tbh, i just wanted to finish the masters and live with her). STILL i plan to go no contact 1 month, see if her pride lessens a bit during this month and see if she reaches out, if not i think the best thing would be to move ahead, but at this moment i really want to talk to her in one month to see if she wants to talk about things.

After the first girl he had an affair with flew back to her home country he went out partying two days later with his friends and made out with some random chick (he was wasted, and told me he ""drank to forget"" which I find a bit hard to believe). This all happened during his exam period which was a period of 3 weeks (he was lonely, stressed, confused, horny and insecure I am assuming). Basically what he did I felt it was a rebound. He eventually came clean about his actions and told me he regrets everything and he is not proud of what he did, he thought the grass was greener on the other side and apologised (I kind of had to ask for it, but he apologised again a couple days later). He wants me back but I think he has no clue how to make things better, I eventually gave him a second chance.

We're cool now. BUT! I have from time to time a feeling of confusion and regret for taking him back because I have had awkward moments with him when I have thoughts of what he did. I love him and he says he loves me a lot (tells me very often). He says he has no interest in the girl he had an affair with, I don’t know if I should believe him (he proposed to go on vacation with her a day after she left but he told her that he can’t promise it). I don’t even know if it was just pure lust or something romantic. I am leaving in 2 months for a 6 months internship abroad so it makes the situation for me even more complicated because I don’t know if I can trust him while I am away, he fears that I will go on to have an affair. He really doesn't know to be alone anymore it would seem.

UPDATE: We had a little argument last evening and a hours later his grandfather passed away. Since then he has been very distant hasn't text me much (at all rather). I feel that I am the one who again who has to put in effort to make this relationship work. I haven't seen much from his side since we got back together.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Will any of the bigger or even smaller software companies that recruit at the Engineering Career Fair consider someone like me for a developer job, or would I have to get a Masters in CS? I'm leaving the option of getting a Masters open.

Hey Reddit! 

We are Paladin Studios, based in The Hague, founded in 2005 and with a team of 45+. Our goals is to make games with a spark. They feel great to play, have beautiful art, and with a quirky innovative twist or two. 

**Some of our recent games include:**

* [Stormbound: Kingdom Wars](https://www.paladinstudios.com/stormbound/) - a tactical CCG for iOS, Android, Steam and Web. Winner of the Dutch Game Award 2017 - Best Game Design.

* [Momonga Pinball Adventures](https://www.paladinstudios.com/momonga/) - our first big commercial title, released in 2013. Can a little flying squirrel take on the forces of evil?

My name is Stein. I started as an intern in 2013, just after the release of Momonga, and got to experience the growth of the studio from up close as a rookie. These days I focus on marketing and hiring, and support business development and the development teams.  I will answer some of the questions myself, but will get most of the questions from the team directly.

I chose BMOS for the accounting and marketing courses (+ econ) as those were the courses I was most interested throughout high school. However, recently, I am seeing that diversity in pre-ivey is recommended. In my new internship I work with a lot of engineers/coders and have picked up learning coding by myself.   


That being said, I wanted to look into transferring/taking cs courses first year and declaring CS as my major in second year at SAO. I was wondering one thing;  


**How hard is it to get the 80% avg requirement + extracurriculars in CS, given NO computer science experience before?** CS has about 15h of classes a week so I see that as a lot of time in between for me to grind and really try to clutch it. I was a strong high school student but I don't think that is a strong indicator of anything in university.   


Above all I want to maintain my AEO status and get into HBA as that is my main reason for choosing uwo over queens, uoft, etc. but I feel like I may always regret it if I don't try going into CS especially bc its taking over the world atm. "

8zvzna,41,2018-07-18,Creepy lady at the tram,Drowningdutchman,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/8zvzna/creepy_lady_at_the_tram/,"So, let's start a bit of a set up.

I've been interning at a hospital in the south of The Netherlands for the last two years of my education. It's required and the small amount of internships cause me to have to travel  about 70 km to and from this internship and as a true Dutch person, I use the train. The whole journey takes about an hour and thirty minutes from my house to the hospital. I start at 8 in the morning and because of my general paranoia when it comes to the train system because of its reputation I always make sure to be there early so I leave home at about 6 in the morning. my shift ends at 16:30 but I get to leave a bit early because otherwise I have to wait 30 minutes for my next train, which is nice. It still causes me to get home at around 18:00. Which means I am on my feet for 12 hours a day and because of me not being able to sleep before midnight, I only get about 5 hours of sleep a night. I'm also a not very social person and at my internship I have to talk to a lot of people a day. Normally this isn't a problem because generally during my trip back I get left alone enough to just get a little bit of rest.

So, now we get to the story and it's a pretty short one to be honest. I'm taking my ass over to the tram in my light jog and I just miss the one I needed. Great, that's a tram 9 minutes later I will have to take. So I just stand at my normal place to wait for the tram. My hoodie has fallen partway off my shoulder because I was nearly home and couldn't be bothered to pull it up. I check my phone to turn on some different music and just generally see if someone's freaking out about my whereabouts when suddenly I get well aware of someone coming my way. I live in a big city, so I put my phone away because there is always a place someone will snatch your phone and haul ass. So I just look in front of me, when suddenly I feel two hands on my shoulders pulling at my hoodie.

I wish I had done something cooler, but I jumped and turned around to see just what the fuck was going on. A woman was staring at me. This woman had just touched me out of nowhere and I didn't know who the fuck this was. I must have looked  so pissed, but then again I was pissed. We'll call  her crazy lady.

**Crazy lady: ""I was just trying to fix your hoodie because you would get cold.""**

Now mind, this wasn't an older grandma lady who you'd slightly excuse this from. This was just a late 40's lady with long greasy hair which was flecked with grey and who just looked tripped out.

**Me: ""You don't just touch strangers like that, it's just creepy.""**

**Crazy  Lady:""Well you get mad easily""**

Now she was trying to turn me into the bad guy. People were looking at us. Now mind I'm a stout (well more like fat) 21 year old who's on the short side of dutch people even for a woman.

**Me: ""No you just don't touch people, who you don't know, in public.""**

No one said a thing, but under a stern look from me the crazy lady walked away. I was confused. This situation milled in my head for so long that I started to believe that I was in the wrong. This woman must have just been nice. Although I believe 100% that if a man had done this to me he would have been decked by someone.

It was to me just a creepy situation and at this point, I am fairly certain I prevented myself from being pickpocketed by my shiftyness.

Just to make sure, it's not okay to touch strangers in public for any reason (unless you're saving their life of course.) .

So crazy lady who decided to fix my clothes at the Tram, let's not meet again."
8zw1hc,1,2018-07-18,Whh don't product based companies list their prices?,imdone999,NoStupidQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/8zw1hc/whh_dont_product_based_companies_list_their_prices/,"This is mostly in regards to technology companies.

I'm an intern who has been assigned the task of researching various kinds of high end sensors for potential use in my company's solutions. Among the points to consider is price. However nearly every site does not list a price for a given sensor or even an estimate, it always refers to contacting their salespeople.

 It seems ridiculous that for a product that can be shipped in a box the size of a breadbox, arrive at my doorstep in less than 5 days, and is already a finished and plug and play product that they would need to do this. It also seems like it would greatly discourage companies and potential customers from buying from them. So why do it then?"

Intern here so bare with my ignorance. One of the projects we are working on is moving our repositories to the cloud from TFS. My team is trying to move one folder within the repository into VSTS.

I see OpsHub as an example but do not know how much it can cost and I read it can be quite costly.

Any way to go about this? "

8zwxet,24,2018-07-18,Amway this is what happens when you try to recruit the wrong person,lalaraikkonen,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8zwxet/amway_this_is_what_happens_when_you_try_to/,"tldr: I unknowingly wasted Amway worshippers' time and money when they tried to involve me when I was young and stupid. I got a free facial from them, some meals and bounced without knowing they were a pyramid scheme. Everything about me made me a terrible and unlucky choice for them to approach.

When I was a college sophomore interning in Taiwan I had some Amway people approach me at a mall. Lets call them W (for the woman) and M (man). They first complimented my purse and then said stuff like oh you'd make a great model and showed me photos how they were part of some club where they do hairstyle model sessions and cosmetic stuff. I was really naive at that time, honestly mingling with strangers even if one was a woman like me was not a safe thing to do. Nevertheless it seemed like a fun and interesting thing so I ended up exchanging numbers with them.

They scheduled with me and we went out to eat. At first they were more interested in asking me questions about myself and what not then M started to talk about some company he's part of that's really great. He actually told me it was part of Amway. He tried to sell me on how amazing Amway was in terms of giving everyone the opportunity to work and that it would set you up for life and whatnot. I didn't know what Amway was and while he made it sound life changing I was also confused. Too much fluff in addition to my professional Chinese vocab not being the best. 

 This is the satisfying part only in hindsight cause now I understand the situation. I went to their ""club"" event which was legit. They had the Amway cosmetics products there and they would exfoliate and moisturize your skin for you for free. I actually felt great afterwards. They tried to convince me to buy the products saying it's a must need for young girls my age. Looking back I feel quite sad for the people there. At the event on the walls were portraits of whoever is above them on the pyramid. They were like worshipping these people that were actually shafting them. M and W did reiterate how everyone was like a family but for me it rang the first bell in my mind that whispered cult. But anyway back to my satisfaction. I got a free facial and refreshments and bounced with no purchase. 

Keep in mind I still wasn't aware that they were attempting to loop me in on their scheme so I met up with M another time thinking we were friends. He tried to hype up Amway again, how I can grow a business effortlessly. I got a free meal out of it and food is great anywhere in Taiwan. 

Afterwards my internship ended and I hauled ass back to the states. It's only these recent years that I realize what kind of business it all was. I was lucky to have met not the most aggressive Ambots. W and M were really unlucky. I was a terrible and dumb choice. My career path was pretty defined at that time. My Chinese wasn't good enough to fall for their fancy vocabulary. They tried to sell me with the facial products because I had good skin but the reality is that the only thing I do is wash my face everyday and do a face mask once a blue moon. Their products are useless to me. And while I was dumb and naive enough to engage with strangers, I am a skeptic and knew if anything was that amazing, everyone would be doing it.

I believe M and W were genuine kind people that were brainwashed and thought they were part of something really great. But unless they showed me the actual glamor straight up, in my mind they were delusional the whole time. Had I know what Amway was I would have cut them off early on as it occupied time (though I probably wasted more of their's) but all is not lost when there's free facials and free food. ;D"

I know that I'm only a week in and that it takes months to build a habit (especially of studying 7 hours each day), but I oscillate between feeling really motivated and waiting for the moment where I take a short break from studying.

I actually like to study for the sake of it - I love learning more about the world, getting new ideas into my brain, studying what I want to study (computer science) and especially studying to get an internship and then later on earning a good amount of money while doing what I find interesting, *however in the process of studying itself I struggle and oscillate between loving it and hating it*.

*Ultimately, I think I just need to hang in there and get used to 7 hours of studying a day, but is there any good material on getting me more motivated/more emotionally pumped up for learning? I mean if it is going to be this tedious all the time then my happiness levels in the learning process ain't going to be huge.*

Got an internship last summer that keeps extending my contract until graduation in December. After I get out of school, I plan to work full-time as an hourly IT employee with this company until I can find a salary job. I make about $2400 a month currently when I work 40 hours a week.

I have about $75K in private loans from Sallie Mae and about $25K in Federal loans. What's the best way to go about paying this off?

I already have plans to pay AT LEAST $1K a month (hopefully $2K if I can swing it) since I still live with my parents. 

But, should I consolidate my loans? Will that lower my credit score? (Which is about a 685 right now). What's the best way to go paying off this debt, besides paying the most that I can each month?

NOTE: I understand that I have a very high loan amount but my parents never went to school so they didn't know how to apply for loans, and I was stuck without a dollar for school, so I did what I had to do and got a loan."
8zxgum,0,2018-07-18,The reason I am considering stopping ranked games and probably league.,fastboyzK,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8zxgum/the_reason_i_am_considering_stopping_ranked_games/,"I'll begin this by saying that I am no where near good at the game. So my voice might not be as loud as a challenger elo player, but I think what I have to say is still important, as it touches the masses IMO.

So, with that out of the way, I have been playing since 2012, and have been through all the changes in the game, all the reworks all the changes in game play, the goods and the bad. Like most people here I have watch the[ video Doublelift made](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhI-QLG_DJU), and I think it helped me finally understand my position towards the game. 

Like I said, I am not the best LoL player, my highest rank was Gold 5, and I think it was 2-3 seasons ago, I was when the blue EZ was a thing. I was mostly playing EZ - ADC or ekko in the jungle that year. I was slowly getting better at the game that year. But in the between the seasons, they nerfed Ekko jungle power, they nerfed the blue EZ build, at 1st I was at loss, but then I picked up Zed and other assassin champs, and relearned the game. I moved from the bot/jg to the mid lane. It was not the easiest thing to do, and in the beginning I remember losing alot. But I pulled through and ended that season Siv 1 or 2.

Since then, things just go worse, the assassin class got nerfed, the power moved to tanks, and so I moved to the top lane, trying to adapt. When I was starting to get comfortable, the power shifted again I think I was towards the mages, I went back to the bot/jg but both had changed drastically in the last 2-3 years, but I had better knowledge of some champions, so I took kha, kayn into the jungle, and cait, Ezreal and Lucian in the bot lane, thing were looking good, Kai'sa came out I was happy because she was fun to play.

Then the mid-season happened, and yet again things changed, and now the jungle in owned by the funnel strat, the bot is a place for mages, and I am lost in the game. I remember the 1st time I lost to a taric/karth comp, I was in disbelief. Since the mid-season I think I have not played much ranked games, I mostly play Arams or the game mode or the week. Each time I want to start a ranked game, I just don't know what to play, what to do and end up going to Rocket league, because I do love a competitive game, but this time , this changes, they feel like too much.

And don't get me wrong, I am not like I want the game to revert, because I understand why these changes are/can be a good thing the LoL in general, But I have spent 6 years on this game, back then I was in high-school, I had more time to play. Now I am in University, I don't have as much time, and my summers are usually filled either with classes or with internships. I can't as much time as I used to do, just to adapt to the new meta, but I still need my dose of competitiveness. So I think it might be time to change game? I really don't know I have invested so much time in this, I feel conflicted. But it's the right thing to do I think, I'll start by stopping ranked game for now, I'll take a break, then i'll check back to see if I can still do this.

Anyways, sorry for the long post xD. Have a good day.

TLDR: The game changed too damn much, and I can't play anymore, So I am thinking about stopping."
8zxucn,21,2018-07-18,How to approach negotiating a salary increase from an internal promotion?,cm141,sales,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/8zxucn/how_to_approach_negotiating_a_salary_increase/,"Hi All,

I've been working as a BDR at a SME SaaS company for the past 18 months and recently got told by my boss that I'll be moving into field sales/account management in the next few months.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J88-RdWnNT0

Naturally, given that we work in sales it would be poor form from me to simply accept the first offer put in front of me, however I'm curious how to go about negotiating a salary increase from an internal promotion, given that they are aware of my current salary and commission scheme. 

Has anyone got any tips on how to approach this?

Note that I have consistently exceeded my quarterly target and everyone is well aware of how well I've performed in the role + I've generated significant new pipeline for the company (all information I have to hand). This is also my first job after graduating from college, although I did a previous year-long internship in a supply chain position - not sure if this is relevant though.

Would appreciate everyone's thoughts on this, thanks!"

8zysdf,0,2018-07-18,tips for interviews?,xxoxoxox,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/8zysdf/tips_for_interviews/,"Hey all, 

I was thinking about applying for an internship this year. I was hoping if anyone can provide some advice on what I should be wearing, things I should say when asked or even questions that I can prepare for.

I currently have exam P/1 FM/2 , IFM/3 which I did last week (still don't know if I passed or not) and hopefully MAS-I on October. Undergrad in ActSci/Math program with a solid GPA. I also have a background in math and English tutoring (not sure if it's relevant). 

I'm not quite skilled when it comes to interviews. I'm usually overly nervous when it matters the most, while having no trouble for the casual chit-chat.

I’m sure this can also benefit others like me so any kind of help is really really appreciated. 

Thanks"

Thank you for your insight, and enjoy! 

 Kelly was apprehensive about her first day as an intern at Fierce Fashion. The owner of Fierce -Samantha Sanders - was a stylist to the stars, and rumor had it that she was a demanding boss. Kelly's first day was going well, and late in the afternoon, it got even better. One of the firm's top clients-movie star London Hyatt-called. He was supposed to make a promotional appearance at a club that had just opened up, and he wanted something new to wear. Samantha assembled some outfits quickly, but she had to catch a flight to Cabo, and didn't have time to take them to London herself. Her regular assistant was out shopping with another client, and only Kelly was left in the office. ""This is the biggest job of your life,"" Samantha told Kelly. Take these clothes to London's house, and get there fast. He wants them within the hour, and it's like, at least, an hour away."" ""Don't worry,"" Kelly assured Samantha, ""I've got a lead foot."" Kelly hopped in her convertible and hit the road. She couldn't believe she was going to London Hyatt's house. As she pulled onto the highway, she pulled out her cellphone. She just had to post a picture about this. She opened up her favorite app, Snapchat. Snapchat' s speed filter lets users record the speed at which a photo was taken, and it prints that speed on the picture when it is posted. Kelly revved her engine, as she wanted to hit triple digits. She smiled when she thought up the caption: ""When you have a date with London Hyatt, you drive fast! 100 mph fast!!!"" There weren't a lot of cars on the road yet, and Kelly was cruising. As her car reached 100 miles per hour, she held up the phone to take the selfie. Just ahead of her, Wendell Williams was about to switch lanes, so he could pass the car in front of him. He checked his mirrors, and he saw Kelly's car, but he misjudged how quickly she was closing the distance between them. As he entered her lane, she clipped the left side of his rear bumper, and his car spun out of control before crashing into the highway divider. When Kelly hit Wendell's car, she was driving 107 mph. The posted speed limit was 55 mph. She never saw Wendell's car; she was too busy looking at her phone. Wendell wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and he was partially ejected from the car. He survived, but his injuries were devastating. He suffered permanent brain damage, and even after five months in the hospital, and many more months of physical therapy, he requires a walker or wheelchair to get around. His doctors doubt that he will ever work again. His wife, Betty, who was a nurse at the hospital where Wendell was treated, was traumatized too. She was on duty in the emergency room when Wendell arrived, and she saw his broken body wheeled in. Betty has since quit her job because she has flashbacks every time she enters an emergency room. Kelly was a good deal luckier than Wendell. She broke her arm in the accident, and she had lots of cuts and bruises. But she didn't suffer any serious injuries. In the hospital later that night, she put a bloodied selfie on Facebook, with the caption, ""Another Torts 580 Page 3of7  accident means my parents won't ever let me drive again. And I bet I'm going to lose my dream job. Worst day ever!"" Kelly did, in fact, lose her job. Samantha fired her as soon as she came back from Cabo. She had three angry voicemail messages from London Hyatt, demanding to know where his clothes were, and a fourth message, saying he'd never work with Fierce Fashion again. And it wasn't just Fierce Fashion that lost business. The dub where Hyatt was supposed to appear-Rick's American Cafe-had spent days tweeting about the special celebrity guest that would be at their opening. Hyatt skipped the event, since he didn't have anything new to wear, and the patrons that had paid hundreds of dollars to attend the party at Rick's were not pleased. The crush of bad publicity killed interest in the dub, and it dosed within a month. Snapchat absorbed a lot of bad publicity as a result of this episode too. This was at least the fourth serious accident caused by a teenager trying to take a selfie while recording a triple digit speed on the app. Snapchat's publicist pointed out that its terms of service, which every user agrees to when signing up, say: ""Do not use our Services in a way that could distract you from obeying traffic or safety laws. And never put yourself or others in harm's way just to capture a Snap."" And when you open the speed filter, you see a warning: ""Do NOT Snap and Drive."" The company notes that passengers can safely use the app. But the public outcry was so significant that Snapchat disabled the speed filter shortly after this episode. 

1. Who, if anyone, should Wendell sue? What should his complaint say? What do you expect the defendant(s) to argue in response? What damages should he seek from each defendant? If you are pursuing multiple defendants, how should the judge instruct the jury on allocating fault? Briefly, what result do you expect and why? 

2. Briefly: does Betty have a viable tort claim against anyone? Why or why not? 

3. You are an associate at a firm that represents the owners of Rick's American Cafe.

8zzojp,4,2018-07-18,Advice For First Job After Graduation,JawaBoot,supplychain,https://www.reddit.com/r/supplychain/comments/8zzojp/advice_for_first_job_after_graduation/,"I’m graduating December this year with a degree in supply chain management and am looking for advice as to which role would be a good fit.

I’ve been in an internship at a natural gas utility company since May of last year in the quality assurance department. Although I’m grateful that my internship has been continuously extended, I’d like to join a larger company with a position that provides me with more supply chain exposure. 

I’ve had trouble when attending supply chain career fairs last fall and this spring. The majority of recruiters seem to be focused on procurement and when I tell them about my experiences in quality assurance they immediately lose interest. While quality assurance isn’t solely focused on supply chain I have had a few projects that relate (developing a sampling plan and creating a product recall process) but I feel as though my internship hasn’t proved to be as beneficial as I’d hoped. 

Which positions within the supply chain would I be able to utilize my experience and education best in? Currently I’m looking at planner and analyst roles but they seem to require at least 2 years experience.

Thank you."
9001zm,2,2018-07-18,Should I Prioritize Top Surgery or New Job?,noeinan,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/9001zm/should_i_prioritize_top_surgery_or_new_job/,"I'm trans, and I'm also disabled-- I have been bedridden for 4 years, and after starting a new medication have just started walking again. I've been out as trans for over a decade now, but honestly I couldn't get up the courage to start the physical aspect of my transition until I had to quit working due to disability. I didn't even ask for pronouns, I just insisted that people not use gendered nouns for me.   


I feel like I wasn't able to really be myself at work because I was constantly worried about how my asking for basic things would cause conflict at work. I am a very work-oriented person, it's safe to say my personality leans towards work-a-holic, and when I was working I prioritized work over everything, even my health. I didn't leave until I literally collapsed at work and they almost called an ambulance. (Luckily, I woke up before they pressed call.)  


So obviously, when I got on this new medicine and it hugely helped my symptoms (I'm not at 100%, but I'm at 60% where before I was 10-20%) my first thought was ""I need to get a job"". I went to the office of Disability Vocational Rehabilitation Services and applied, but the intake process takes months, so I was continuing to keep an eye out for jobs. I found several good part-time jobs at once and applied to three. I just had the first interview today and it went really well! (This is the job I favor over the other two.) I have another interview tomorrow, and the last job likely won't do interviews for a few weeks because it just closed applications.   


I have been on HRT for 2 years now, and finally, finally the time for my top surgery has come. I've been on a wait list for a really long time, and they gave me a date-- August 6th. I spent months last year collecting letters so that I could get insurance to cover, I have more letters than they even need. I was on waiting lists for months with various doctors I needed letters from. I had to teach several how to write letters for transgender surgeries for insurance because I was their first trans patient. I have put an immense amount of work into getting this surgery set up.   


And now, just a few weeks from my surgery date, my surgeon's office called and tells me that my insurance denied my claim, said it's ""elective"", even though they do cover transgender surgeries and I more than meet the qualifications. They are sending in an appeal, and say it may just barely make it before the deadline. They won't go through with the surgery until my insurance pre-authorizes it-- they can't do the surgery and figure out the paperwork later. If I need to reschedule, I honestly don't know if it will be soon or if I'll have to wait months again. I'm doing everything I can to make it work, and rescheduling would be a huge hardship on me and my spouse, since we've already got train tickets, hotel stay, and he took time off from work for the surgery and to help me recover.   


And here's where things get more complicated. In the job interview, they asked if I could start right away-- with my surgery up in the air and me panicking about how to deal with the situation, I just said yes. I didn't know if the interview is the right time to even bring up a potential surgery, I don't even know if the surgery will still go through on this day. They want me to start work basically the week before my surgery, \*if\* I get the job. (But honestly, I do think that it went really, really well, so if someone else gets the job over me it's because they were just even more amazing.)   


The job is an internship that lasts up to 14 months, but basically it's project based-- if the project finishes early so does the job. This position is basically perfect for me and I'm just in that sweet spot of overqualified to the point that I'm very competitive but not to the point where they don't want to hire me because it isn't cost efficient. They said in the interview that they are hoping to enter the first phase of the project in September, so if I started working in early August that gives me a month to a month and a half to get caught up and in the swing of things.... Unless my surgery conflicts with that, in which case I'd need at least 2 weeks to recover.   


I feel like the first few weeks of a job are really important-- if I went to work for a week, had surgery, was off for two weeks, then had only one week of work until September, I worry that is just not going to work. If I just delay starting until after I recover, that would work better, but I worry it won't work with their schedule. And then, what if I need to reschedule my surgery in general? If my surgery gets moved a week, a few weeks, a few months in the future?  


My disability income isn't enough to get by, and my not working has had a huge negative impact on my spouses finances, and our household in general. Having a job would really help, and this job makes a few dollars per hour more than the other two. This job is more in my field of expertise compared to the other two. But it's also a temporary position, lasting only a year. However, with a 4 year gap on my resume, it would do wonders for me to have a job in my field that is more recent. If I end up with one of the other jobs, it will likely be a more permanent basis and it will be even more difficult to break back into my field later on. But maybe that's okay, since my condition is lifelong and incurable, and most jobs in my field are full-time and I may honestly never be able to do that again?  


\*\*tl;dr\*\* Just finished an interview for a really useful job in my field, but the likely start date conflicts with my surgery date. My surgery may end up needing to be rescheduled anyway, but I have no idea yet. I may have an unhealthy attitude towards work, and I have been waiting on this surgery more than ten years. How do I prioritize this situation?  


Sorry that this is so complicated, I'm just feeling conflicted, anxious, and confused. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated!"
9007pc,30,2018-07-18,On making excuses for the behavior of men,[deleted],GenderCritical,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenderCritical/comments/9007pc/on_making_excuses_for_the_behavior_of_men/,"Logging into an old reddit account to post a little story here... usually I just lurk offline and I can't remember if I've posted here on this account (I have so many at this point, throwaways and such, who knows). Anyway, I can't think of any other sub I'd want to post this on, and I don't really have any people to talk to about it, at least this particular perspective. Sorry in advance for the long post.

I quit my very first full time job after 6 weeks because of my boss. I recently graduated, and my work history is a string of internships and temp work, so I was very excited to land a full time gig and as a result I wasn't as scrutinizing as I should have been during the interview process. The professional reason I quit is because the job they had me doing didn't match what I was hired for.

The unprofessional reason: I found out a few weeks in that my boss founded this company with his partner of 7 years, and he cheated on her. With an employee. Who was half his age. (He's around 40, she was about my age, 25). Needless to say, she left his ass and left the company. It's useful to point out here that this allegedly happened more than once, according to my coworkers.

Then, two weeks later, my boss springs a project on me at the very end of the day, around like 4pm, needed by early the next morning, for a project that could rope in a lot of money. I do the best I can to get stuff done and go home, and then, at 8:30 at night, I get a text from him (he was very fond of texting at odd hours to have conversations. 10 at night, 6am...), asking if I could come back in to the office to make changes. In case you were wondering, the office is his house. I of course say no, that it's 8:30 at night, I can fix it in the morning. He then backtracks in response immediately, saying oh he didn't really mean that, he was just asking me to come fix it some time, and then he told me to come in an hour and a half early to do so. This turned into a whole big argument, basically. I had mentioned to him that since this was such a big project, I would have liked to have known about it a bit sooner so I could do my best work for it, but I would be in on time the next morning to make any changes. His response was to accuse me of not knowing what was going on (Of course, this was accurate. I had no idea this project existed or was so important until 4pm that day), not caring, not understanding, that he works long hours, had a difficult upbringing, he went on and on during texting for an hour and a half about things like this until I said I was going to bed and stopped checking my phone. (Admittedly, the text conversation wasn't my best professional moment, but that's not really the point of this story).

I realized, thinking all this over, that when I recounted the story to others I glossed over the fact that he asked me back to his house. Instead, I said he wanted me to come in early the next morning, and that he was upset because of my job performance. I used the backtracked reason he gave me, as opposed to his original text. I even took some of the blame for it, saying that I overreacted and could have held onto my temper better. I don't know why I felt compelled to do this, because it isn't accurate. I didn't imagine that text, it happened. He definitely asked me back to his house at night. And he backtracked as soon as I called him out on it, leading to an argument.

I ended up quitting a few weeks later, because after this incident (one that, the next day, he wouldn't let go because he ""still sensed some fight in me"" if that isn't the creepiest thing a boss has ever said to me. He just kept talking to me about it, even after I said how about we work towards a solution... anyway...), he froze me out of office communications, and then continually assigned me to do manual labor. (for reference, this was a landscaping company, also for reference, I was not hired to do manual labor). The whole incident was awful, and it really made me realize how conditioned we all are to make excuses or just gloss over behavior like this. It also made me realize how difficult it can be to overcome that conditioning. I consider myself reasonably smart and assertive, and I still had a hard time with it. I still feel like I'm not making any sense when I explain it. Anyway, it's not a perspective I think a lot of people would get, but I feel like this sub might get it. "
9017ih,1,2018-07-18,End of the Road?,allyson10500,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9017ih/end_of_the_road/,"I [20F] have been dating [22F] for 4 years this August. We got engaged last August and decided to get married next July. We met in high school and both thought it was love at first sight. She had a TERRIBLE family situation, so my parents generously let her live with us. (Parents have no clue we're gay). We both go to the same university and are roommates there, as well. 

She got an awesome summer internship about 2 hours away and they provide housing, so this is the first time we have been apart since we started being friends nearly 5 years ago. I went to visit last weekend and she drops the bomb that she has decided to go to New York for a week with her roommate (who is from the Bronx). I am extremely uncomfortable with that and so I said so. 

She said, ""It doesn't matter; I have already decided to go."" I protested, but let it go because ultimately I trust her, but I am scared of her driving to new york with a stranger (she is a god-awful driver) and I am concerned for her safety.

The next day she says she wants to break up because, ""I want to know what it is like to be single, and I will always regret it if I don't find out."" She said, ""You are a safety blanket that is so comfortable that I would never want to leave,  but I don't know who I am or what I want."" 

I begged and pleaded, and she finally agreed to a ""break"" with the condition that we will not date or have sex with anyone else, but in all other ways are single. I never saw this coming in a million years. My heart is absolutely broken, and I just can't seem to get warm or stop thinking about her. I was and am still so certain that she is my soulmate. She knows I am waiting for her to figure herself out, and that I believe in us.

If you've read this far, I am truly greatful. Do you guys have any ideas how to help her figure out who she is and what she wants? I love her and I want this to work so badly,  but I'm dying inside. 
So far I have given her complete isolation and silence because I'm hoping she will miss me and change her mind. 

We used to talk for at least an hour on the phone everyday when I commuted home from work. I am having trouble keeping myself together especially during that time. Do you have any recommendations? I just feel like all the joy has been sucked out of my life, and nothing could make me happy. "

I've always been extremely skinny but in the past year or two I've started to gain a little belly fat while maintaining my skinny frame. This summer I got an internship and decided to really focus the whole summer on bulking. I started about 8 weeks ago and it has really been working. I started at 154 lb and am now at 173 lb so I have had a net gain of 19 pounds (I am about 5'11). Essentially I have just been eating like crazy, having a ton of mass gainer, and workout almost every day. The first few weeks I was looking much better but recently my belly fat has really been getting out of control. I still have a fairly skinny frame but I strongly feel it is time to start a cut to get rid of my belly fat. Because I want to maintain my muscle and still grow my frame I was wondering by what method I should cut. I don't know if I should continue weight lifting every day or do some cardio. How many carbs should I take out of my diet (one daily serving of mass gainer is about 250 grams of carbs). I would love hear what the Reddit community suggests. "

901rop,25,2018-07-18,So who is the story group and what are their main functions?,TheMastersSkywalker,starwarscanon,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarscanon/comments/901rop/so_who_is_the_story_group_and_what_are_their_main/,"Something I did for another sub since people don't really know who they are and what they do but when the canon wipe came they were sold as being the key to the NEU. So what is the purpose of the story group,who are they, what do they do, and what have they done before?

The Lucasfilm story group was created in 2013 by Kathleen Kennedy and Lucasfilm VP Kiri Hart with the goal of abolishing the canon hierarchy and is responsible for determining what is canon and noncanon for the star wars universe.  Or to use the Vanity Fair quote

&gt;Part of what makes Lucasfilm’s new system work is that Kennedy has set up a formidable support structure for her filmmakers. Upon her arrival, she put together a story department at Lucasfilm’s San Francisco headquarters, overseen by Kiri Hart, a development executive and former screenwriter she has long worked with. The story group, which numbers 11 people, maintains the narrative continuity and integrity of all the Star Wars properties that exist across various platforms: animation, video games, novels, comic books, and, most important, movies. “The whole team reads each draft of the screenplay as it evolves,” Hart explained to me, “and we try, as much as we can, to smooth out anything that isn’t connecting.”

But what they do and how they do it, and how much power they have over what happens seems to differ from interview to interview. In the now well known vanity fair interview RJ says their was no mapped story for TFA and that he was given a lot of leeway. In fact here is the full quote 

&gt;What the story group does not do, Hart said, is impose plot-point mandates on the filmmakers. Johnson told me he was surprised at how much leeway he was given to cook up the action of Episode VIII from scratch. “The pre-set was Episode VII, and that was kind of it,” he said. If anything, Johnson wanted more give-and-take with the Lucasfilm team, so he moved up to San Francisco for about six weeks during his writing process, taking an office two doors down from Hart’s and meeting with the full group twice a week

(https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cover-portfolio) and when questioned on that and the fact that it conflicts with what KK said he doubles down on it https://i.redd.it/rou03k7aad0z.png .

But that is just the movies. What about the rest of the universe? The books and comics?

Well according to one of the earliest interviews by CRB we learn this about the story group

&gt;However, the purpose of the Lucasfilm Story Group goes far deeper than simply streamlining canon. At its core, the group is much more about developing new stories, by coordinating efforts in all related media to create a more unified and satisfying meta-story, or as the title of the panel states, “One Big Story.” Still, after decades of stories that occasionally contradicted each other, (resulting in a five-tiered approach to canon, ranging from “established history” to “not real”) some fans were skeptical as to whether even a coordinated effort between Lucasfilm and Disney would eventually result in a similarly chaotic continuity. Also known as “Keeper of the Holocron” and Lucasfilm’s resident “Star Wars” expert, Chee merely said the group doesn‘t anticipate that problem. Hidalgo assured, “We won’t fall back into past practices.”  https://www.cbr.com/swca-reinventing-the-star-wars-universe-with-the-lucasfilm-story-group/

I could speak about about the ""teirs and contradictions"" but that is not the point of this post. This post is simply about what the story group does. So it says that they are there to make the universe one big story and that everything fits. 

In fact Kathleen Kennedy described them as a ""star wars writers room"" and says that ""Ideas are being plotted out for projects though 2022"" along with comments by Matt Martin saying that Lucasfilm is ""committed to a shared continuity"". https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/04/entertainment/star-wars-may-the-4th/index.html

And a second quote from KK

&gt;
“We’ve thought this all through. The story group has put together a very carefully thought-through strategic plan for how we’re developing the stories and what those stories are and targeting filmmakers. We’ve looked at it up through, I would say, 2019, Episode IX.” http://collider.com/star-wars-episode-viii-story-kathleen-kennedy-george-lucas/
Also from Pablo we get this gem about how they work with authors

&gt;While the term “Story Group” may make it sound like they are dictating the story, that’s not usually the case. In most cases, authors or filmmakers who are hired to work on Star Wars properties, are given the oppurtunity to come up with their own stories and ideas. While doing that, they work closely with the Story Group to make sure the stories are authentically Star Wars (for example, Darth Vader doesn’t dance or something) and also fit into the larger plan. Hidalgo said they’ve heard pitches from people who have great ideas for characters who are then told, “Come back in six years.” That’s because the story they’re pitching would fit in better with a character at another point in the future. https://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-story-group-star-wars-canon/

We also get stuff from other interviews talking about ""Pablo Hidalgo and Leland Chee spoke about fact-checking the tiniest of canonical details for public consumption. Their biggest hits are the “visual dictionaries” of photos and illustrations from the movies,"" which in hindsight because their are multiple problems with the how the TFA and Solo visual dictionaries connect. https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/star-wars-celebration-lucasfilm-story-group/

So it sounds like the Story Group are the final line of what is canon and in charge of the story going forward. But at times we also get the idea that they don't have that much power or at least don't exercise it as much.  

We have a interview where Pablo comments that "" It is a common misconception that the Story Group exists to ensure continuity between the various media in which Star Wars stories are being told: films, novels, comics and video games..."" http://eleven-thirtyeight.com/2016/08/europe-2016-a-celebration-of-the-lucasfilm-story-group/

He has also stated in tweets (that he has since deleted) that the word canon actually means very little to them when coming up with stories. But thats ok because while he may have deleted his tweet we have a interview from another member of the story group on how they feel about canon. Basically that their is no truth in the Star Wars universe and that everything can be changed if they so wish https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/13/15290994/star-wars-celebration-continuity

We also have Chuck Wendig saying that "" ""I had a lot of freedom to develop and shape the story; guidance from Lucasfilm was about sharpening that story and bringing my vision in line with the storyworld at large. It was pretty much the ideal relationship, and I never felt stifled or managed"" 

OR Claudia Grey saying """"I thought, when they came to me, they were going to tell me what to write, but that was very much not the case. I had a lot of freedom. The outline had to be approved, but it was my outline and they really let me tell the story I wanted to tell. It was wonderful.""""

We also have John Jackson Miller a Legends vetran say that it was more """"not so much a matter of content flowing in our direction as the authors, but like 'Hey, here's a character you should name-drop.'"" For example, when he was writing his short story ""Bottleneck"" (which appears in The Rise of the Empire), he was asked to insert a character who would later appear in Alexander Freed's Battlefront: Twilight Company.""

""Oh, so much freedom. It is absolutely the book that we wanted to write. I would say, there's not really oversight, but there's guidance, and that's really an editor's job. And [our editor] did a really terrific job with it"" Says Ben Acker and Ben Blacker http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-star-wars-authors-work-with-lucasfilm-and-earn-creative-control

So basically that the Story group lets them do what ever they want as long as their are no major contradictions and that they are just there to add in little wink and you will miss it shout outs to other stories. 

So that is their stated purpose. They are there to curate the canon (but at the same time don't care about what is canon), are there to put in little wink and you will miss it shout outs and guide the writers (but at the same time give them lots of freedom), create a outline of the galaxy for the next ten years (but let the directors do what ever they want). 

I'm not sure if that made it clearer or muddier. Not to mention the fact that their are already a number of canon mishaps in the universe, contradictions between VD's and what we see on screen, and a comic writing a young reader book out of existence. I really like the idea of a story group but I think they could do with a group of interns who can keep up with everything that is being published and make sure the new book or comics are going to contradict things. Yeah the comics and books have good editors but with the amount that is being put out a large team may help. 

The next question is who are they and what do they do?

The story group is made up of 11 people

The first and former member of the story group was Kiri Hart http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kiri_Hart who is the VP of development for Lucasfilm and the Development lead of the Story Group

She has been given producer credits on Star Wars Rebels as well as co producer credits on Star Wars The Last Jedi and Rogue One. And a executive producer credit on a movie called Strange magic. However being a producer doesn't mean she was part of the creative team. It just means her job is to bring in writers, actors, finance, etc for the project. And as head of the Development division is in charge of all of those projects.  
 
However she is one of the few members of the story group to have writing credits to their name. She is credited for writing one episode of Rebels (Family Reunion..and Farewell) where she is one of eight writers on the team for that episode. One episode of Crossing Jordan called (Perfect Storm) and one episode of a show called 1-800-Missing called (Thin Air). She has no other writing credits, has published no novels or comics, and has no previous work in Sci-fi or Fantasy

The next person on the group is Carrie Beck http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Carrie_Beck who serves as the VP on animation and the Director of Creative Content.

She was in some way involved in the SWTOR: Galactic Star fighter expansion. She is also given Producer credit on the ""canon adjacent"" Lego show called Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures where her duties seemed to be working with the creators to keep it in line with canon. Sort of a go between between them and the story group. 

&gt;    ""We work with the Story Group, and we work with a woman named Carrie Beck, and she has this smile... and when we pitch things to her and she smiles and says, 'You can't do that,' we know that we've stumbled into Rogue One, Episode IX -- who knows what. But seeing The Force Awakens before we started, I was like, 'Oh, that's why we couldn't do that one story!'"" 
    ―Bob Roth responding to an interview on IGN

She is also given Executive producer status on the Forces of Destiny. An EP is concerned with management accounting and/or with associated legal issues and may or may not work on set.  And finally a producer on a TV movie called (Ghosts/Aliens)  which is at least a Sci-fi project. She has no writing credits nor has published any books or comics.

Third is Rayne Robers http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rayne_Roberts who is the creative executive for Lucasfilm. Another producer she is given credits as that position for every star wars visual media project. Her job as a creative executive means she is tasked with reading scripts and finding source material which can be turned into motion picture content. So either looking at previous stories, reaching out to directors and writers and that kind of thing. She was also given credits as the assistant to the creative executive on (The Haunting in Connecticut 2) and (Life as we know it)

She as well has no writing experience nor has she published any books or comics. 

Next is Diana Williams http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Diana_Williams who is the Producer of Franchise Synergy. She is of course given production credit on Rebels like everyone previously and is some how connected to Galactic Star Fighter. She also appeared in a TV series called (Science and Star Wars)

I have no idea what a Producer of Franchise synergy does but she has no production or writing credits to her name nor has she as far as I could find published any books or comics.


Next is Leland Chee a legends veteran, Lucasarts game tester, and the keeper of the holocron (basically the official Wookieepedia) http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leland_Chee

While he has no writing or production credits nor has produced any comics or books he is possibly the most qualified to be on a committee called the Story Group as he has been in charge of keeping the lore straight for a long time. 

Next is Pablo Hidalgo http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pablo_Hidalgo who has been involved in a number of star wars projects such as the internet content manager for Lucas Online, some fan groups, and West End Games RPG books and serves as the Creative Executive in story development. 

And next to Chee is probably the most qualified to be on a ""Story group"" (Though personally I would switch him for Jason Fry). Pablo has written 37 Reference Guides, Webstrips, short stories, and magazine articles. He is the only member to have published a book and/or comic.

Next is Matt Martin http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Matt_Martin who is a creative executive for Lucasfilm and the manager of digital content and community relations. Basically get on twitter and talk to fans and answer their questions. 

He has a degree in Visual Communications which basically means he has a degree on how to interact with people though media and sell ideas. He has no producing or directing credits and has no published a book or comic. 

Next is Steve Blank who does not have a wookieepedia page or a IMDB page or a good reads page and whose only appearance was during Celebration Orlando during an interview. 

After that we have James Waugh who is also a ghost.

Josh Rimes who according to Chee has something to do with animation https://twitter.com/HolocronKeeper/status/870138261129224192. Josh Rimes is one of the more experienced members of the LSG having worked as a producer on Bojack Horseman and The Booth at the End in 2010 and 2014 as well as working as a ""logger"" and ""production secretary"" for Curb Your Enthusiasm and a series called Smith in the 00s. At least this guy had some notable experience in the entertainment world before joining the LSG. He also wrote 1 television episode of a show called Stranger Adventures in 2006. This makes him the only other member of the Lucasfilm Story Group who has actually written anything besides Kiri Hart and Pablo Hidalgo. 

After that is Stephen Feder who likewise has no information on him other that he works on the story group and that his twitter is private. 

and finally we have Cara Pardo who is invovled with Battlefront II in some fashion. I think from what I can find as a sort of go between between the story group and the designers for the game. 

So thats its. The 11 members of the story group. OF which only 1 person on there has published a book or comic and only two have any actual writing credits (with only one being in star wars). For a story group their are no story tellers on it. The two that come close are both people's whos job is to take the lore other people created, slice it down into small digestible bites, and publish it. 

TLDR: So what did we learn? They are there to curate the canon (but at the same time don't care about what is canon), are there to put in little wink and you will miss it shout outs and guide the writers (but at the same time give them lots of freedom), create a outline of the galaxy for the next ten years (but let the directors do what ever they want). And The 11 members of the story group. OF which only 1 person on there has published a book or comic and only two have any actual writing credits (with only one being in star wars).

My own personal opinion is  why not grab someone like John Jackson Miller, Zhan, Luceno, Claudia Grey, etc and put them on the group or at least have them rotate in from time to time so what we can have people who have written books and comics and for video games in what is supposed to be a writers group.

For example, when he was writing his short story ""Bottleneck"" (which appears in The Rise of the Empire), he was asked to insert a character who would later appear in Alexander Freed's Battlefront: Twilight Company.""

""Oh, so much freedom. It is absolutely the book that we wanted to write. I would say, there's not really oversight, but there's guidance, and that's really an editor's job. And [our editor] did a really terrific job with it"" Says Ben Acker and Ben Blacker http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/how-star-wars-authors-work-with-lucasfilm-and-earn-creative-control

So basically that the Story group lets them do what ever they want as long as their are no major contradictions and that they are just there to add in little wink and you will miss it shout outs to other stories. 

So that is their stated purpose. They are there to curate the canon (but at the same time don't care about what is canon), are there to put in little wink and you will miss it shout outs and guide the writers (but at the same time give them lots of freedom), create a outline of the galaxy for the next ten years (but let the directors do what ever they want). 

I'm not sure if that made it clearer or muddier. Not to mention the fact that their are already a number of canon mishaps in the universe, contradictions between VD's and what we see on screen, and a comic writing a young reader book out of existence. I really like the idea of a story group but I think they could do with a group of interns who can keep up with everything that is being published and make sure the new book or comics are going to contradict things. Yeah the comics and books have good editors but with the amount that is being put out a large team may help. 

The next question is who are they and what do they do?

The story group is made up of 11 people

The first and former member of the story group was Kiri Hart http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kiri_Hart who is the VP of development for Lucasfilm and the Development lead of the Story Group

She has been given producer credits on Star Wars Rebels as well as co producer credits on Star Wars The Last Jedi and Rogue One. And a executive producer credit on a movie called Strange magic. However being a producer doesn't mean she was part of the creative team. It just means her job is to bring in writers, actors, finance, etc for the project. And as head of the Development division is in charge of all of those projects.  
 
However she is one of the few members of the story group to have writing credits to their name. She is credited for writing one episode of Rebels (Family Reunion..and Farewell) where she is one of eight writers on the team for that episode. One episode of Crossing Jordan called (Perfect Storm) and one episode of a show called 1-800-Missing called (Thin Air). She has no other writing credits, has published no novels or comics, and has no previous work in Sci-fi or Fantasy

The next person on the group is Carrie Beck http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Carrie_Beck who serves as the VP on animation and the Director of Creative Content.

She was in some way involved in the SWTOR: Galactic Star fighter expansion. She is also given Producer credit on the ""canon adjacent"" Lego show called Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures where her duties seemed to be working with the creators to keep it in line with canon. Sort of a go between between them and the story group. 

&gt;    ""We work with the Story Group, and we work with a woman named Carrie Beck, and she has this smile... and when we pitch things to her and she smiles and says, 'You can't do that,' we know that we've stumbled into Rogue One, Episode IX -- who knows what. But seeing The Force Awakens before we started, I was like, 'Oh, that's why we couldn't do that one story!'"" 
    ―Bob Roth responding to an interview on IGN

She is also given Executive producer status on the Forces of Destiny. An EP is concerned with management accounting and/or with associated legal issues and may or may not work on set.  And finally a producer on a TV movie called (Ghosts/Aliens)  which is at least a Sci-fi project. She has no writing credits nor has published any books or comics.

Third is Rayne Robers http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rayne_Roberts who is the creative executive for Lucasfilm. Another producer she is given credits as that position for every star wars visual media project. Her job as a creative executive means she is tasked with reading scripts and finding source material which can be turned into motion picture content. So either looking at previous stories, reaching out to directors and writers and that kind of thing. She was also given credits as the assistant to the creative executive on (The Haunting in Connecticut 2) and (Life as we know it)

She as well has no writing experience nor has she published any books or comics. 

Next is Diana Williams http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Diana_Williams who is the Producer of Franchise Synergy. She is of course given production credit on Rebels like everyone previously and is some how connected to Galactic Star Fighter. She also appeared in a TV series called (Science and Star Wars)

I have no idea what a Producer of Franchise synergy does but she has no production or writing credits to her name nor has she as far as I could find published any books or comics.


Next is Leland Chee a legends veteran, Lucasarts game tester, and the keeper of the holocron (basically the official Wookieepedia) http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leland_Chee

While he has no writing or production credits nor has produced any comics or books he is possibly the most qualified to be on a committee called the Story Group as he has been in charge of keeping the lore straight for a long time. 

Next is Pablo Hidalgo http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Pablo_Hidalgo who has been involved in a number of star wars projects such as the internet content manager for Lucas Online, some fan groups, and West End Games RPG books and serves as the Creative Executive in story development. 

And next to Chee is probably the most qualified to be on a ""Story group"" (Though personally I would switch him for Jason Fry). Pablo has written 37 Reference Guides, Webstrips, short stories, and magazine articles. He is the only member to have published a book and/or comic.

Next is Matt Martin http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Matt_Martin who is a creative executive for Lucasfilm and the manager of digital content and community relations. Basically get on twitter and talk to fans and answer their questions. 

He has a degree in Visual Communications which basically means he has a degree on how to interact with people though media and sell ideas. He has no producing or directing credits and has no published a book or comic. 

Next is Steve Blank who does not have a wookieepedia page or a IMDB page or a good reads page and whose only appearance was during Celebration Orlando during an interview. 

After that we have James Waugh who is also a ghost.

Josh Rimes who according to Chee has something to do with animation https://twitter.com/HolocronKeeper/status/870138261129224192. Josh Rimes is one of the more experienced members of the LSG having worked as a producer on Bojack Horseman and The Booth at the End in 2010 and 2014 as well as working as a ""logger"" and ""production secretary"" for Curb Your Enthusiasm and a series called Smith in the 00s. At least this guy had some notable experience in the entertainment world before joining the LSG. He also wrote 1 television episode of a show called Stranger Adventures in 2006. This makes him the only other member of the Lucasfilm Story Group who has actually written anything besides Kiri Hart and Pablo Hidalgo. 

After that is Stephen Feder who likewise has no information on him other that he works on the story group and that his twitter is private. 

and finally we have Cara Pardo who is invovled with Battlefront II in some fashion. I think from what I can find as a sort of go between between the story group and the designers for the game. 

So thats its. The 11 members of the story group. OF which only 1 person on there has published a book or comic and only two have any actual writing credits (with only one being in star wars). For a story group their are no story tellers on it. The two that come close are both people's whos job is to take the lore other people created, slice it down into small digestible bites, and publish it. 

TLDR: So what did we learn? They are there to curate the canon (but at the same time don't care about what is canon), are there to put in little wink and you will miss it shout outs and guide the writers (but at the same time give them lots of freedom), create a outline of the galaxy for the next ten years (but let the directors do what ever they want). And The 11 members of the story group. OF which only 1 person on there has published a book or comic and only two have any actual writing credits (with only one being in star wars).

My own personal opinion is  why not grab someone like John Jackson Miller, Zhan, Luceno, Claudia Grey, etc and put them on the group or at least have them rotate in from time to time so what we can have people who have written books and comics and for video games in what is supposed to be a writers group.

902v3a,30,2018-07-19,FAQs for job seekers,kimbercules,Wastewater,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wastewater/comments/902v3a/faqs_for_job_seekers/,"Hi there!  I happened to mention the wastewater treatment industry in a random askreddit thread and was thrilled to see a ton of people PMing me with interest in the field.  To answer some FAQs I received, I thought it would be cool to post here and direct them to this thread/sub for my thoughts as well as all the other awesome WW folks here!  Post your own Qs and As and let's help introduce these folks to our hidden gem of an industry!!

For funsies, I did a '1-second/day' video a while back during my shifts as an operator:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y0SZf2OMxI

**Average Salary**
Depends on your position, location/state, and size of plant.  Operators tend to make somewhere in the 35k - 50k range depending on experience/location/size of plant.  Lab analysts are similar, maybe slightly higher, but tend to escalate in salary with promotions more so than ops.  I can't speak to other positions, maybe folks can answer here (or a googlin' will help) - but benefits are always pretty exceptional, and it's flippin' recession proof, yo!

Also, there is possible/definite OT potential and night differential (for the love of cheese toast, if you are a night owl and need a new career, JOIN US IN OPERATIONS!!  We need night folks like crazy, we will pay you well and will shower you with appreciation!!)

If you're in a big plant, job diversity, department hopping and promotions are SUPER common.  Small plants let you wear lots of hats and have their own advantages too.

**What are the education requirements?**
Depends on your location quite a bit!  Here's what I know:

Operator:  HS diploma + interest/motivation + demonstration of mechanical/scientific/general learning aptitude + willingness to git'r'done.  Some places require state license prior to hiring, but many plants allow you to get this once you start as a trainee (ours does this).

Lab Analyst:  Bachelor's degree, ideally in a natural science (chemistry, biology, env. sci, etc.), lab experience a plus.  If you're lucky you can find loopholes like 'lab asst.' to get your foot in the door, or a BA/BS may be desired but not required.  Depends on the plant.

Everything else I think is typical - IT you're gonna need normal IT requirements.  HR = HR.  Finance = Finance.  Electricians, you get the picture.  Great position to get your foot in the door is Field/Grounds Maintenance or seasonal laborer.  Doesn't sound exciting but you need el zilcho for experience and if you get to know people and absolutely kick ass at your job, you have a huge leap over other candidates.  In Ops, we hire from FM quite a bit.  Did in lab too for someone who worked to get their BS while working.

**Why do people like their jobs in wastewater?**
There's something amazing about wastewater in particular.  Here you have an industry that is hands-down CRITICAL for a well functioning, non-cholera-epidemic rampaging, clean and happy watershed enjoying, modern civilization.  Tons of pride at the end of the day.  We don't make widgets, we don't program freemium apps, we don't sell people shit they don't need.  We make civilization possible without ruining the environment and spreading disease.  It's tangible.  It's critical.  It's a hard day's work that you feel fan-frigging-tastic about at the end of the day.

Next, you have the challenge.  Most folks don't know that wastewater treatment is insanely technical and utilizes some real cutting edge technology.  Also, it is primarily biological/biochemical in nature.  We have to harness the power of physics (gravity settling, hydraulic flow patterns, centrifugation), chemistry (coagulation, metal precipitation, sulfide binding), and biology (nitrogen removal, fermentation, methane generation).  Most everyone in the plant will have to have a basic knowledge of a lot of fundamental science to know their field.  It's challenging and it's cool as heck. If you're a science or nature fan, wastewater will interest you.

Third, there's opportunities in almost every kind of profession hidden within (usually big) plants.  I've mentioned a few, there's so much more.  PR, legal, HR, records mgmt, regulatory, water quality, lab, farming, trucking, maintenance, electricians, operators, senior management, communications, engineering, R&amp;D, interceptor inspections... and on.. and on...

Also, it's everywhere!  Everyone poops!  Wherever you live, or want to live, you will have a marketable skill you can put in your pocket.  Unless you're off the grid and pooping in a hole, you'll probably have a treatment plant somewhere nearby.

Lastly, there is a sort of magic comeraderie in this field for being in something like a secret society that deals with the nasty bits many people couldn't handle, don't want to handle, and sometimes don't even want to know about.  We're a bunch of very real, down to earth, fun folks.  We have a laugh at ourselves all the time, and love our toilet humor.  We have battle stories of our first 'baptism' in poop (for field workers), and are very closely knit.  It's always a family on your team.  We have our own 'olympics' (Operations Challenge) and compete nationally at our giant 20,000 people yearly conference.  It's so wonderfully absurd and I love it.

**How do I get into the field?**
Lots of folks with degrees in ES, bio, some finance, etc. have messaged me.  ES is like the magic key into WW - you can apply that to nearly any entry level job (except specialties, like engineering may require a PE and degree and stuff, and electricians need special certs, etc.).  But you can get into most any position, since it applies to the industry.  In particular, lab analyst, chemist, water quality (lots of field work if you like the outdoors), operator, regulatory, pretreatment, etc.  Similar for biology or chemistry or any other hard science really.  If you have a non-science major, like finance, there's probably a spot for you at most medium to large plants, as we too have payroll and some massive wonkin budgets to muck through.

How to find the jobs?  Search places like indeed.com with keywords with your area of expertise and the word 'wastewater'.  Also check governmentjobs.com - big place for good ww job postings for sure.  You can also go to your city's website and check their site for jobs if you're interested in a particular location.

Pro tip:  call up your local treatment plant (find numbers on city websites) and see if you can schedule a tour!  We give tours allllll the tiiiiiime and I love it!  Especially when people are genuinely interested.  If there aren't open positions at the time, and I've met someone through a tour, I totally keep them in mind if they give me their contact info.  Plus, if you apply to an opening and you already know the people and have a sense of the plant and job, you have a huuuuge advantage!!

**What is your background?  How long have you been in the field?**
I actually don't have a related degree whatsoever, but I had previous lab experience from a college internship.  Got a job as a lab analyst, got a couple promotions and wound up doing more R&amp;D kind of work.  Worked more and more with operations and decided I really wanted to broaden my experience outside the lab, and made the switch to being an operator.  Got all my certifications and worked my way up the ranks in Ops.  It's been just over 10 years now, and I will forever be a wastewater worker.  I love the industry, and it has treated me very well.  We have a big plant with tons of opportunity at every corner, and a diverse, wonderful group of people (400+ employees), and I wouldn't trade it for anything.

**Schedules?**
Ok so no one asked this but I have to point out - wastewater doesn't stop.  Ever.  Some small plants can go unmanned briefly at night, but most facilities are manned 24/7.  That means we need night shift or on-call for several jobs (operations, electricians, control systems IT, maintenance, etc.).  Depends on the plant, some have better schedule options than others, but usually you have to go through some unpleasant shifts, particularly in operations.  Or if you're a night owl, well goodness golly please join our ranks!  Our plant runs 12 hour shifts, with rotating days off, but our days are days and nights are nights.  No swapping back and forth, that is really rough on people.  Works well, and the rotation allows for some short weeks and some long weekends, and most folks adapt well.  Even lab has to run rotations since analyses have to happen every day of the year.

That's all I've got for now - please check out the sidebar of this sub for some good certification-by-state information, and feel free to ask more questions of us wastewater folks here!!

902v7m,40,2018-07-19,"UPDATE: Boyfriend's Mom and Odd Conclusion-- False Alarm, For Now Anyway. Sort of?",LilSurferGrl,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/902v7m/update_boyfriends_mom_and_odd_conclusion_false/,"First I'd like to thank everybody that replied to my other post for reassuring me that I'm not just being oversensitive about some things like I thought I was. 

Previous post:   
[https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8y6m31/boyfriends\_mom\_drew\_odd\_conclusion\_am\_i\_in\_line/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/8y6m31/boyfriends_mom_drew_odd_conclusion_am_i_in_line/) 

Update: Rather than all three of us sitting down, OH just had the conversation in his ""I don't get worked up about anything until it's worth getting worked up about"" way and figured out what the hell was going on with that email since we were both confused and a little worried. Turns out, she's thinking of moving, but doesn't want it splashed around at work. She's been kind of miserable for a while, BUT since she was likely ""half in the bag"" (OH's words. {RED FLAG!}) reading and replying to the email, she didn't articulate herself very well about all that. 

Apparently she thinks that OH and I would pay less in rent and bills if we just took over her lease, which seems pretty true at first brush. I'm sharing a 3 bedroom house with 2 other people, all utilities etc. included. OH doesn't know about what utilities are included in the rent at their place, but he knows it's only about $200 over what I'm paying by myself now. Idk what he's contributing toward his living situation either and we didn't have much time to work this out.

SO, yeah, maybe kind of a good idea if we're ready for the whole ""move in with me"" thing, which is a talk we sort of started and agree on... if this idea isn't just ""pie in the sky"" from his mom. BUT, I'm still seeing some vermilion in the air here because she didn't actually bring any of this up with OH before blurting half of it out by email, to someone she's spoken to maybe 10 times in the last year. What I'm concluding is that common sense and boundaries she's not so good at, but her heart seems in the right place.

What I'm taking from this is that I need to continue to be crystal clear with OH about \*everything\* so he doesn't have the double burden of deciphering what the two important women in his life may be thinking but not saying. Luckily most of the time I'm too dumb to be dishonest. (Seriously, I \*can't\* lie. I have a glass face, I can't remember what I'm supposed to say, and the second someone gets the least bit upset with me or stern, I just change the subject. I've gotta work on that ""how to disagree articulately"" part, maybe not so much the lying.) 

So, I'm calling the forecast chances of JNMIL with a possibility of storms on the horizon. (If this gets ""white dress, yellow nursery"" kinds of serious, I'm not having my kid babysat by somebody who's salty that she hasn't had her first cocktail by 5:01, you know?)

OH! About my name! I just noticed this today when I ran into her with a group of interns-- she switches between ""Leah"" and ""Leann"" seemingly at random. She's also got a reputation for being absent-minded, horrible with names, but excellent with faces and she \*always\* says hello with one of those variants when she sees me. She might simply be using whichever comes to mind first because I haven't acted bothered by it before this (or because she's not functioning well b/c of the drinking) so that's an awkward conversation for a future date. 

For now, I'm just glad to not see passive-aggression and drama llamas lurking where none need be. Poor communication we can deal with way better than jealousy or territorial crap. She may not be a venomous, boundary-stomping control-freak. (Just a sad, lonely, unfulfilled problem drinker? Yikes...)"
9037vb,11,2018-07-19,"I'm still learning git as an intern, do I need to do a merge commit when I pull from a development branch?",Chieve,git,https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/9037vb/im_still_learning_git_as_an_intern_do_i_need_to/,"One time as an intern one of the full timers pointed out I had a ""sneaky merge commit"" I think there was 2 but I dont remember the issue as it was over 6 months ago.

So anyways I had to revert my changes because they want a clean git history. 

So.... 

Lately when I pull from development, it wants me to make a merge commit, but I just ""q!"" out of it because everything merges regardless and I didn't see the point of having that merge commit when I'm just updating my development branch. I do a ""git checkout - b feature name"" 

However the issue is when I brach off of development it had a git history from developmentment, and I'm not sure how it got there.it was showing changes I did on a hot fix branch and cleanup branch. 

So I was asked to store my files somewhere and revert the changes so it wasn't there on that branch.... Im wondering if the issue was from needing to do a merge commit?

The only other thing I can thing of which was different than normal is when I started this feature branch, I was having some things asked of me. So I would work on the feature branch, stash those changes because I wasn't ready to make a commit of them, then make changes to the hot fix and/or cleanup branch, commit and push, then go back to the feature branch and apply the stash to work on that more as I wait to have my code in the hot fix and cleanup branch to be reviewed."
903gy1,224,2018-07-19,The most justifiable pacing I can see for Season 4.,HokageEzio,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/903gy1/the_most_justifiable_pacing_i_can_see_for_season_4/,"Because of the length of the Overhaul arc and the amount of chapters within the raid itself, the pacing would have to be sped up to justify a 24 episode season assuming no filler (which, I really don't think there is any time for filler in Season 4 anyway).  So, that being said, the most likely pacing I can see is speeding up the raid so that it is 3 chapters per episode instead of 2 (considering it's mostly just action).

Season 3, making an assumption based on the episodes left, [will end with the Big 3 debut.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lBwrejvtBWM/WHfDszIDMLI/AAAAAAAAddU/h4YW4UyczqQs_ntHfJWTmG2kZd8_y-sFQCHM/s16000/0122-018.png)  Because otherwise, I don't really see how it would justify Mirio getting a theme unless you include the scene where he's talking with Izuku with only his face sticking out of the wall (and the theme is silly enough for that to fit in perfectly).  Seeing the back of his head doesn't really justify that.  As far as I see it, the stipulations for the next season are:

* It needs to be 25 episodes (one, that's the time slot; two, there is no possible way you could finish the internship in 13 episodes without massively rushing or cutting things)

* It needs to have the entire internship arc (duh)

* It needs to have the Gentle arc (because that's the only way you're filling 25 episodes without filler and because it wraps up the Eri storyline)

* It needs to end on something big (meaning it needs to go *through* all of the stuff with Gentle, not end with him getting arrested)

* The fights that happen need to be in one episode, unless they're obviously way too long for that (most of these fights are not fights that could extend between episodes without the timing getting awkward)


That would make the season the following (if I were producing it anyway):

---

1. 123-124: Big 3 introduce themselves, midcard is Aizawa saying Mirio is closest to number 1, ends with Overhaul and Shigaraki meeting

2. 125-126: Overhaul attacks the VA, Izuku meeting Nighteye, Mirio meeting All Might

3. 127-128: Nighteye testing Izuku, Izuku meets Eri

4. 129-131: Izuku and Mirio talking to Overhaul, All Might's flashback, girls fighting monsters, ends with Shigaraki meeting Overhaul

5. 132-134: Shigaraki's conversation with Overhaul, Unbreakable, ends with the students meeting each other at the operation meeting

6. 135-136: Operation meeting, ends with Eri talking about Izuku's hand

7. 137-139: Team on standby, Izuku crying at lunch, ends with Overhaul sending out the Precepts; [midcard](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R6fHja5k35U/WRSF-9solSI/AAAAAAAAl8k/-oUf9k22HRkxbI53TwsIbrbHxPwX8XXXACHM/s16000/0137-019.png), floor falls out from underneath them, episode ends with Tamaki saying he'll fight alone

8. 140-142: The entirety of the Tamaki fight, Bubble Girl talking with the goons, ends with Fatgum and Kirishima getting split off

9. 143-145: Kirishima's whole backstory and the fight

10. 146-147: midcard of Overhaul talking to Two-ga, ends with Twice squaring up with Nighteye

11. 148-149: Shigaraki talks to VA in flashback, Overhaul talks to Twoga flashback, finishes with Mirio catching up to Overhaul; [this has end of an episode written all over it, that's just obvious](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Cdp0d7ESneM/WZWsl0VWZnI/AAAAAAAC3Ew/5C0baOoBJqMdFb9OiPMELRHcfUsCUSo0QCHMYBhgL/s16000/0149-015.png)

12. 150-152: Mirio's entire fight, midcard is him catching Eri, ends with Izuku busting through the wall

13. 153-155: midcard is Izuku going 20 percent, ends with the girls going through the roof

14. 156-158: Girls flashback, Overhaul fusing, Eri activates her powers, episode ends with Izuku punching Overhaul in the face.

15. 159-161: Ends of the raid part, midcard of Shigaraki on the truck, attack section, episode ends with Nighteye's death

16. 162-164: Gigantomachia reveal, Shiketsu students meet UA students for training, Endeavor asking what is a symbol of peace

17. 165-166: All Might and Endeavor conversation, students squaring up to ""fight"" the kids, ends with Shoto showing his fire to the little kids

18. 167-168: Endeavor says he's proud of Shoto, Aoyama in Izuku's window as the midcard, Aoyama and Izuku talk

19. 169-170: Gentle attacking the supermarket, seeing Eri in the hospital, ends with Gentle walking out of the supermarket, midcard is Gentle on the laptop

20. 171-172: Izuku practicing the flicks, ends with Eri showing up, midcard is Gentle saying he'll break into the school to get famous

21. 173-174: Walking around the festival, Izuku gets ""fired"", Gentle goes over the plan

22. 175-177: Izuku gets his gloves, fight happens, midcard is Izuku saying leave the school alone, ends with La Brava saying she'll use her quirk

23. 178-179: Lover Mode, La Brava backstory, Gentle backstory, finish with Izuku saying he's not laughing

24. 180-182: St. Louis Smash, end with Izuku showing up at the concert, and you could honestly probably squeeze in the actual musical act in since that is only a couple minutes tops, just make it the credits instead of the ending for the season (next episode blurb comes after Mirio starts crying)

25. 183-185: Festival ending, Gentle being given a fresh start by the cop, end the episode with Endeavor getting crowned as number 1 and meeting the top 10 heroes, Endeavor says ""watch me"", end the episode with High End being shown

---

Footnotes:

I don't see any room for the girls to get filler (and if they do it wouldn't be much).  Unlike with the manga, when they do flashbacks they play an entire clip (long or short) rather than it being one panel.  That means they have to squeeze in Overhaul's flashback to meeting Eri, Eri's flashback to Mirio, Nighteye, and Izuku's injuries, Izuku's flashbacks to him meeting Eri, Izuku's flashback to Mirio asking what type of hero he wants to be, Izuku's flashback to the New Hampshire smash and destroying the robot, Overhaul's flashback to his backstory (which is half a chapter), and you have Twice and Toga explaining their plan to the Compress clone.  All I'm saying is if it's set up like this, it's a tight squeeze *at best*, and not happening at worst.  Don't get your hopes too high expecting a big fight for them, is all I'm saying.

---

This pacing isn't really rushed, at least I wouldn't say so.  But they have to keep it constantly moving if they want to squeeze in 62 chapters into something that would normally have at worst 55 chapters in a season.  But this is the only way I could see them getting through everything they need to get through without ending on something lame like Gentle asking for black tea.  Wrapping up all the Gentle stuff, meeting the top 10 heroes, and Hawks asking if you remember the Noumus before TotallyNot!Dabi talks to High End is a pretty beastly season finale if you ask me."

Currently enrolled in the Summer Internship at Telenor in Oslo. I have been actively looking for the full-time position as junior developer/software engineer for a while but without much of a success. Can I ask you for some help or advice on this matter?

9059fi,15,2018-07-19,Officer vs. Enlisted with College Degree,fluffy_stingray,newtothenavy,https://www.reddit.com/r/newtothenavy/comments/9059fi/officer_vs_enlisted_with_college_degree/,"I’m 22 years old and a recent college graduate. I’m looking into becoming a officer in the Navy (preferably, but I’m open to other branches.). Specifically NFO/SWO/Supply.

General background:
- B.A. Mass Communications 3.56 GPA
- Currently working in the adverting industry but not very happy with it and want a more meaningful career where leading and serving others is paramount.
- I have had 2 internships previously in the business world and volunteer experience.
- Former NCAA D1 Cross Country Athlete

I guess some of my questions would be would anyone be willing to share their experience as an enlisted person with a bachelors degree? Because I’ve also considered this.

One of my concerns is that my B.A. would hurt my chances of being an officer. Has anyone had experience/been accepted to OCS with a BA? Did it make things more difficult for you?

As I write this, my mind is tumultuous. A billion questions are racing in my mind, and the only reason I write this down is to calm myself down, and to give myself a chance to think calmly and clearly.

So what is on my mind you wonder? Well, many things. What the future holds, where am I going to end up, and so on. I look back at the last two months of my life, and I know I haven't achieved much. ""What meaningful thing have you achieved today?"", dad daily texts me from office. And then I ask myself that same question. ""What have I done? Is there anything that I did today that will leave a lasting impact?""

These thoughts are what plague my mind, for I haven't done anything today. But my vacations was not wasted in my opinion. I met a lot of friends, and met some new ones. Just yesterday, I met a lovely girl called Anitha, and she's fun! :D So I don't regret anything like my last vacations. I am having fun, and I am happy. 

But let's get back to the achievements part. So far, I have been treating this as a checklist,""have I achieved so and so?"". But that's the thing, I shouldn't be doing this. As of now, all I do is compare myself to others. ""Did I do an internship like her?"" or ""Did I write a paper like her?"" and so on. I compare my life, at every instant, with the people that surround me. I let myself be compared to others, thinking of what I could have and what I haven't done so far.

But that has made me realize one thing, that if I compare my life at every cornerstone to others, I LOSE MY LIFE. Let me repeat that again, because I CANNOT overstate the significance of what I am saying. EVERY TIME I COMPARE MY LIFE TO SOMEONE'S, I LOSE CONTROL OF MY LIFE.

I'm not going to let someone else control my life. I am not going to chase the things that other people have achieved just because they have achieved it. I am going to take control of my life, and I am going to make it count. I might be behind in many areas, probably most of them. That doesn't mean I am going to give in. I am going to fight and I am going to live life on MY TERMS, and I am going to do only the things I WANT to do. I am no longer going to do things just because others are doing it. I am going to figure out my future, MY WAY. And I am no longer going to laze around, just because I don't want to do the things someone else wants me to do. That was the reason I was wasting my time. Now, I am going to do the things I want to, and I am going to make it count.

So what do I have in mind? What are my future goals, you ask? Well, so far I have realized things NEVER work out according to plan. But for now, I am going to study for GRE. I am going to give those internship interviews, and I am going to work on my resume. I am going to slowly, and steadily work towards some project or some work that I want to do and that will help me in the future. Over the next year, I am going to try and work on projects. I am going to start studying for GRE. Scratch that, I start today. And from now on, I'm going to stop being so hard on myself. I am going to accept me for what I am, and I am going to love myself. I am going to forgive myself for my flaws, and I am going to work on them. I am going to stop being lazy. 

I also wish to continue having a thriving social life. I will meet more people and I will have fun with friends, that is something I WON'T compromise on. And, maybe, just slowly, I shall try and learn how to play the guitar. Pick it up again.

I know I will fail again, but that's okay, I will pick myself up and try again. I've got this. I CAN DO THIS.

Good day, my friend. "

9060to,49,2018-07-19,Why ESPN hates us so much,AMontyPython,miamidolphins,https://www.reddit.com/r/miamidolphins/comments/9060to/why_espn_hates_us_so_much/,"As some of you know, the main ESPN Dolphins beat writer, James Walker, left after this past season. I was glad. He clearly hated his job and the Dolphins. Every thing he would write about the Dolphins, no matter the article would always say something like ""...but that's not how the Patriots would do it!""

Apparently, ESPN has yet to hire someone to fill his shoes. Doing some research all articles for the Dolphins since are written by 2 people. 1 .ESPN staff writers, meaning a random person just trying to make content, and based on the writings doesn't follow the team that closely.  2. Mike Rodak, listed as a staff writer, who was a former writer for the Patriots, and ESPN Boston. In articles where the writers for the rest of the AFC East division ""talk to each other"" there is no Miami Dolphins rep there. (I will give some credit to Mike Reiss, the actual Pats reporter. 2-3 times he calls out a couple good players for the Dolphins. I think Howard scared the shit out of him after that MNF game)

I've read through every article posted under the Miami Dolphins page on ESPN for the offseason and here's what I've noticed. In any list of power rankings of teams, Miami is in the bottom 3. The most recent article which set me off to write this was their ""Ranking of teams with the best 3 year window"" and the Dolphins were dead last. Every power ranking article has one of these things written in some form: *""Tannehill is damaged goods, and not that good anyway. They got rid of Landry, Suh and Julius Thomas. They added a bunch of old guys and are one of the oldest teams in the league. They had Jay Cutler last year. They are in a division with Tom Brady""*  To me this is a clear sign that whatever intern is writing these articles has 0 clue about this team, and who they are. Anyone who watched 5 mins of Dolphins games knows Thomas is a bust and has been for 3 years. Sun was expensive and Landry was getting expensive. We added Gore on the cheap, and Sitton an amazing guard. And Cutler was one of the only legitimate choices after Tannehill went down. 

There is very much a war on this subreddit about ignoring or being pissed off of what the media says. Some people here say ""Ignore what the media says, Who Cares?"" But I don't think some of you realize how many people use sites like ESPN, their radio stations and other generic places to get their NFL and sports information solely, and when that happens and all they read is how shit the Dolphins are, well you can get pissed off. When you live and die with a team, it flat out sucks when the national media shits on your team, and you have to defend yourself and your team from those morons out there who couldn't care less. "

906h6v,3,2018-07-19,Story from about 6 months ago (my first trip of a lifetime / bad trip),Blendy69,LSD,https://www.reddit.com/r/LSD/comments/906h6v/story_from_about_6_months_ago_my_first_trip_of_a/,"I needed to share my first experience of 250 ug to this relatable world on reddit. It has been so long since this happened but I remember it all so clearly, which I feel is a factor for all of my trips after my first. This certain trip produced trauma that I wasn’t ready for and trauma that I might have deserved. I am going into my senior year of high school and I started to experiment in the middle of my junior year as a way to rebel off my parents I would say. I started to smoke weed with friends and was very open about it, I eventually thought that I should try LSD because it was so physically harmless, this was my biggest mistake and ultimate learning lesson of my life so far. The story starts in the middle of january:

A druggie at my large school had tabs to buy that were 250 ug each and I was very unaware of dosage because I had never tried it before. I wanted to start out big because I was stupid and immature, I feel like I have changed so much from then that I can say that confidently. We have just gotten out of school and I had contacted him the day before for tabs knowing how much I am getting but not knowing how much that dose does. It is about 3:30 PM and I meet up with him with another friend and he cuts the tab for me with scissors that he asks for from some other kid. I am just about to go to a gaming lounge with more than 10 of my friends for a goodbye party to my friend leaving for Washington DC trip to do an internship for the Senate. I stand with them and a circle saying “Do you know what this is?” and they reply with no obviously. I tell them that it’s pure LSD and I might just take it because I have nowhere to put it. They all become curious and I eventually pop it in my mouth right in front of the school. I had no idea what to expect and I thought that I might have some contrast change in my vision and a more positive attitude based on what I had seen about it. I was not expecting a life changing experience and ego death based on my ocd and adhd brain on the same day. We are walking to the gaming lounge and I’m talking to an exchange student who goes to our school and everything is completely normal. We get there and I don’t want the issue to be concentrated on me because my friend is leaving and I want him to be the main attraction. I am definitely not acting normal at this point and I’m saying that I did acid and I love them all so much. Most are laughing and some don’t even believe me which is understandable but very frustrating when I am trying to get understanding from them at this unexpected time. We get our computers and my vision is conpletely in fractals and visuals branching off of specks of dust on the monitor that is turned off. I turn to my friend sitting next to me and tell him about the girl I like at school for no reason (this is very important for later in the story). She’s in our class and I say that she’s a nice person and really pretty and stuff like that. He eventually says “Isn’t she jewish?” and I reply with I don’t think so (she isnt). And I go on to talking to other friends, with them telling me that ill be okay and consoling me. At this point I don’t think that this is real life and I start to perceive the concept of human speech in such weird ways with everything everyone said sounding factual even though they would be joking sometimes. It was so hard to understand sarcasm. I felt trapped and scared. My friend who was there was kind enough to let me sleep over and we eventually left after we took some pictures and I said my goodbyes. I didn’t want to leave for so long because I didn’t want this drug to ruin the time I was having. We went back to his place and I was in a better state of mind since I had a person to talk to one on one to express what was happening to me. I opened up a lot to him and luckily he didn’t record me doing anything stupid which I felt like I did. The time when we get to his house is about 7 pm I would say. I am still completely in trippy land by this point and I try to avoid his parents as much as possible. We go upstairs to his room and he lets me do whatever I want on his computer to please me (lol). I play on his computer for a while talking about how yellow is such a happy color and somehow make it through dinner with his family. It is about 11 pm and I feel like this is where I started to peak and was more aware than I was throughout the whole trip so far. We are sitting in my friend’s room talking about life and I get this thought in my mind that all of this feels so fake and cartoony. I feel like everything is being drawn right in front of my eyes like a movie. I begin to thought loop over this and convince myself that I’m in a simulation and all my actions are planned out. My friend jokes around saying that we could be in a nazi simulation, and right when he says that his face turns into a devilish being. At this point I can’t talk to anyone else but my friend and I am totally scarred. I am crying my eyes out completely aware that I am in a nazi simulation with me having this “jewish girl” that I like (i remembered this) that is the only comfortable thought I can lay back on. My friend tries calming me down saying things like “Lucky you didn’t jump in front of a car” and “I’m happy you didn’t do anything too stupid” and this only made it worse because I couldn’t understand sarcasm, and I thought that he was a devil at the moment laughing sarcastically because I did do something stupid like that and I killed myself. It is dark but I thought I died and I feel like this was my ego death phase. He told me that I would go to sleep and it would be all better in the morning. He did comfort me when I was crying so I thought that he turned into a god of sorts. My thought was that since I was dead the “simulation” had messed up and the higher beings showed me something I wasn’t supposed to see in the world and I would go to sleep and get my memory wiped or something because they weren’t just going to kill me off. Such a strange mindset I know... but so freaking scary. I tried going to sleep for the next few hours not knowing that no matter how hard I tried I wouldn’t be able to go to sleep because this was a stimulant. I would close my eyes and see laughing emojis and I gave up on trying and I thought that I would never be able to go to sleep to have my “mind erased” or I would never go to wherever the next phase of afterlife was. I felt so lonely like I was the only person alive and I needed to speak to someone so I got the courage up to ask my friend to talk to me. I felt like when I asked him a question he would give such open ended answers. My friend tried to stay as peaceful as possible through this and he was still resembling a god to me. I started asking questions about the universe and he started giving open ended answers which were not fully answered. I was sure I was speaking to god. Some more time went by and I somehow realized I was in real life again after calling my parents to see if they could pick me up (i thought that phone calls wouldnt work for so long since i was “dead”, the last thing I wanted to do during this experience was be on my phone). I got picked up by my parents at 3-4 AM and went back home. I told my parents what I did and they weren’t mad, just happy I was okay. 

This was obviously a bad trip but so interesting to me and so interesting that I remember it. I might share some other trips eventually but for now this was my first time. I am so much better now. I have had good trips after this one too. Be safe and start small is my advice to everyone who wants to try this."

New on reddit, just read some interesting posts in this sub. So I decided why not create an account and share my journey. I'm currently in university and starting an internship in 2 weeks! So I thought why not use this free time to properly water fast? I've done a 5 day fast a few months back which went pretty well... expect for refeeding/ my diet after that fast... I gained all the weight back.

Now I'm at **74,6 kilos** at 1,60cm (Female, 20 years) and I definitely do not feel well!!! (Heaviest I've been) I hope this will kickstart a new lifestyle for me since I am also moving out of home for my internship so I am more in control of what food is nearby.. Overall my goal is to be more mindful, healthy, fit but also to lose some fat! Feeling very depressed and self-conscious in my body. (Worst year of my life!!) 

So thats it! I've been fasting for about 18 hours now and plan on fasting for 14 days in total (until my internship starts). I will be sharing my progress every few days on here and hope that some of you can give me tips in regard of refeeding after my fast because that will be my biggest issue. I also plan on adding pink pink himalayan salt to a glass of water every morning as I did last time during my water fast. I also have multivitamin tablets but they have 1 calorie each so I am not sure if that will mess up my fast? 

Also, I plan on doing light cardio (slow walking / biking) everday for about 30-60 minutes and very light weight lifting to keep my muscles stimulated. Is that alright?

Happy to see your responses!

9 months since I left an abusive narc boss. Trying to move on and find a new  job, however- out of curiosity/boredom I checked ex-bosses website and see that she has posted pictures of herself with what looks to be a happy glowing team of mostly interns (3 of which I had trained) ... I had worked for her small HR-less company in 2014 right out of college and watched as employee after employee left until there were only 2 employees left, her business was stagnant, she had reduced my hours so low that I required another part time job - and had started paying her remaining employees in cash. 

Then I moved and she couldn't pay  me in cash while working remotely and said she would pay me through direct deposit. She done that in the beginning but at this point she just stopped paying me and kept telling me lies about ""it will be there next week"" while she kept asking me for work. Yea, got real tired of jumping through her hoops so I decided not to play that game anymore. 

Throughout this she acted as though nothing was wrong with her company and the people who left she'd gossip about and call them ""dead weight, untalented losers"" and then of course, act nice to your (my) face, like this was a normal thing to do. They really left due to her incompetent management, micromanagement,gaslighting, lies, gossip, catty, toxic unstable workplace and bullying, but she would of course, deny that.

Still angry about how I was treated there, I had stuck it out and tried my best to be a ""good employee "" but she never valued her talent in that way, and it's strange that so many people like her exist. 

She maintained the illusion of ""come work for a fun company!"" for way too long.  My mental health had gotten so bad from working here I eventually had to just leave with nothing to show for it. But that was her intention, all along of course.

My ex boss was a wealthy woman who would complain about her underpaid employees being ""overbudget"" while she'd brag about all the expensive  vacations and other expensive things she'd do, while telling us ""you have such a great job!""

She would say one thing  and do another. Would act like she was above drama but would constantly create it. Had a false ""nice"" let's be friends! Persona but also had 56 other personalities ready for other people.

She loved to play divide and conquer with employees, and would purposely isolate me from everyone. I got the feeling she didn't want her team to be friends with each other, because she would work so hard to keep everyone apart.

I keep thinking ""was it just me?"" Was I just a bad employee?  And it's kind of messing me up.

Example of her (their) abuse:

-------------------------------------

This happened when I was a couple weeks on the job. It was a very small team and we would often eat lunch together.. my boss would buy us lunch. So my boss and another female coworker were (both around in their 50s)..and I'm newly hired in my early 30s. No one else was around us, just me sitting across from them.  I'm a quiet person, just minding my own business and eating a sandwich.  My boss and this woman were talking about something and I wasn't really paying attention. 

So...just randomly, out of nowhere my (now ex) boss just came out with ""you know..there is this island called fat girls island."" While they were both looking directly at me.

And, the woman next to her- this woman I had never spoken to and didn't even know, said ""I know! Couldn't they have named it something less disgusting?!"" And, in the moment I said nothing, because I refused to believe that two grown women were actually bullying me. My boss said nothing, as if she condoned this, and it went on like this toxic, catty atmosphere. There was no HR. My boss was HR... so. It would go on like that until this awful woman who always had a mean spirited passive agressive comment for me, left 11 months later. My boss was still there and kind up ""picked up the slack"" for the departared coworkers abuse.

 I finally had to leave because the damage to my mental health was so damaged and I had to be put on depression and anxiety meds and see a doctor for PTSD. 9 months since I left that job and the damage is still there. I believe both my ex boss and that coworker were narcissists  - and the entire time I couldn't complain to anyone because there was no HR and I didn't show that they were bothering me, at the time I ""grey rocked"" them even before I realized what they were. That was the only way I knew how to survive there. And this is while my boss kept saying  ""this is a safe space!"" And would openly berate and bully people in private after clients left. I hope every day karma gets her..both of them.

I have became to come to realization that when i am older my bond with my parents and how much I trust them to help me financially will be very scarce. Though possibly a bit exaggerated I can definitely foresee myself have a huge financial responsibility starting the moment I turn 18 and amplifying the moment I start college. I want to be prepared for the world once I finish college (i know they'll support me to some extent until I at least get out of college unless of course I decide to force them to stop)

With my job and little expenses (currently just gas money to get to school and work, plus one last payment of $200 I have to take care of) I have myself with a lot of excess money and that will probably remain partly true during college.

My goal is to save $1,000 at the minimum every school year and invest that at the end of the year. From now until I graduate college; then using any profits to turn around and pay off as much as my student debt as possible with those investment. 

Note: I'm going into an affordable state school, with a few minor scholarships already guaranteed (applying for more) and I'm going into a marketable major that requires just a bachelors to get into the field (computer science) I also plan on doing paid internships and co ops and saving as much from those experiences to pay off debt as well. 

Is this a solid plan or would investing 1,000 every year be too minuscule or possibly ill advised for someone as young as me.

I know this post will probably give off some ill-vibes however I just really don't trust my parents to help me professionally or financially. Do not get me wrong I love them just they have by no means proven themselves capable of giving advice on either of those fronts (my life has been filled with bad credit, unpaid loans, moving, renting, house foreclosures, dozens of jobs, and divorce) and I know it'll be something I need to think more about as I get older but I can really see myself cutting financial and professional ties with them as soon as possible."

I currently am in college studying IT and now am in my last year of school that for 70% of the days exists out of internship.
Problem is though I am having mixed feelings about my internship and any IT job I could do. I just dont enjoy IT that much, I never have but I dont know what other job to take. The only reason I do IT is cause my parents always thought I am the perfect IT guy (Playing games, sitting on reddit and watching anime is not the same as someone messing with virtuel machines and who cares about those kind of things, but I wish I told them that in high school)


The office I work at is not necessarily bad, most people are friendly and helpfull. But still I have no real motivation to make a carreer, I just want to go home at 4.30. What does not help here is that I dread 8 hour days, I even have 8.5 hours with 30 minutes of mandatory unpaid breaks. 8 hours 5 days is just to much for me. I wish I could say 1 day only 4 hours or even better, only 4 days a week. But the problem here again is that doing a low end IT job does not pay that much.



And whenever I feel down, dread the next 8.5 hour workday or feel a bit depressed I always end up thinking about my high school years witch I loved. Ironicly I even worked 44 to 46 hours a week since I had a side job in a supermarket (witch I ended actuely enjoy doing) the job was filling shelves but the colleages were great, I know what I needed to do and how to do it and I was not depended on anyone. And I loved those times, high school was alot of fun, the low end supermarket job was something I ended up liking. And now I am stuck doing IT cause others said it would be right for me and its not actuely feeling that right for me. I also have no idea what I will do after I have my IT diploma, will I get used to the office envirement, will in 1 year or so I end up liking it or will I just keep on thinking about the old days witch seem much more happy then now.....

I realy needed this off my chest, so who ever readed through this thank you......"

Lurker here, I check in everyday but barely post or participate. 

OK -- so, thing is I just finished my B.Com (2 years program).

Now I've made up my mind, I want to go to China to learn the language, I've already done a 4 month basic Chinese course in Pakistan - and am well aware of the scope it has. 

I'm looking for the best, most cost effective options I might have. 

Currently I have 2 options.

Option # 1 is a 1 year diploma in a vocational college, in a somewhat rural area in the Sichuan province. I'm personally not in favor of this option because, I want to experience China in a big city where I can make some connections/links, and learn the ropes. And as some of you may know, rural China is worse than Pakistan in some ways. 

Option # 2 is a paid internship in a 5 star hotel (not sure where), depends on where my agent gets me a placement. This option, I personally prefer, as I already have a 6 month diploma in Hospitality (Professional Chef) and plan on opening an authentic Asian (Chinese) restaurant when I come back to Pakistan - so this experience would benefit me greatly. Plus I get paid anywhere from 1000-3000 RMB, and the food + accommodation is on the house. This would be very cost effective, and I can achieve my end goal in a much better way.

SO, I need a neutral opinion from you guys, as to what option I should opt for? OR if there's any better option any of you guys might have in mind. Very confused right now. 

Please help me clear my vision.

Looking forward to hearing from you.    
Thanks!!  "

908wom,17,2018-07-19,[Manga Spoilers] Personal Complaints About Ochaco's Progression,ThirtyYearsWar,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/908wom/manga_spoilers_personal_complaints_about_ochacos/,"This post will discuss Ochaco's progression in the manga; however, this post will discuss mostly what I feel has been a lack of development for her character during the recent arcs. I'd note that the contents of this post are my opinion and I am not trying to state my opinion as the objective truth, but I would accept any form of criticism to my argument. Before I get to the body of this post, I'd like to note that I do not hate the character of Ochaco. On the contrary, she is one of my favorite characters in the manga (best girl). This post is written from the perspective as a fan who has been disappointed with the recent developments of the character rather than a person who outright dislikes the character they are discussing.

The best place to start the discussion is Ochaco's rule early in the manga. This will include her first appearance in the manga to her actions in the Sports Festival Arc. This section is the part of the manga in which Ochaco was arguably most prevalent relative to the other characters in the manga. Ochaco was the first future UA classmate (other than Bakugo) who Izuku interacts with, and Horikoshi displays a dynamic between the two characters by allowing the two to save each other during the practical exam. I think that one purpose of this interaction is to display that the two characters are equals, which is unlike most other shonen where the relationship between the main character and heroine is one-sided: the main character will save the heroine but not vice versa. After Izuku and Ochaco are both accepted and placed within the same UA class, they quickly become best friends along with Iida. This can be best seen when she changes the perspective of Izuku's nickname of Deku from a derogatory nickname by Bakugo to a name that he is proud of. Ochaco's character during the first chapters of the manga could be viewed as shallow initially. One could view her as only being a cute girl with the role of being the love interest for the main character, with her personality being written to sync well with Izuku's. However, this perception changes when she begins to explain her motivations for being a hero: gain money to help her relatively poor family. Some could view this motivation as simplistic and not unique, however I believe that the motivation is understandable, realistic, and gives a new layer to her characterization. It is her role in the sports festival that I believe to be the peak of her character at this point in the manga. Her drive to win the festival, epitomized in her fight against Bakugo, displays her dedication to follow her dream to help her family and unforeseen aspects of her personality, such as her strategy during the fight. These actions displayed that she was not a simple character and also displayed the amount of potential she had as a character.

The second section will discuss her role from the Hero Killer Arc to the Hero License Exam arc. This part saw her interactions with Izuku begin to become more internalized and less interactions between the characters take place, however it still saw her character developing. During the Hero Killer Arc, she learns her lessons from her fight against Bakugo and trains with Gunhead to increase her combat ability. This decision further reinforces her drive to become a become a great hero. After the Hero Killer Arc ended, the Final Exam Arc began. The Final Exam Arc saw a pivotal change in her character in which she realized that she had feelings for Izuku. During her fight with Thirteen, Yuga is able to deduce that she is trying to imitate Izuku (I'd note that I don't subscribe to the Imitation is the Sincerest Form of Tragedy theory) and suggests that she has feelings for him. Although Ochaco manages to win the fight, the suggestion that she might have feelings for him causes her to have conflicting emotions during the next 3 arcs. This moment in the manga has been divisive, with some people believing that it helps the development of her character while others believe it has forced her into a role as the love interest. One could argue that she does not have true feelings for Izuku, but has developed this attitude because she sees his motivations as noble and heroic while she feels that her own motivations are shallow in comparison. During the League of Villains raid during the Forest Training Arc, Ochaco gets into a fight against Toga. Although Ochaco manages to use Gunhead's tactics to pin Toga, Toga manages to distract Ochaco by suggesting that Ochaco wants to become Izuku and allows Toga to get blood from Ochaco. This interaction could display that Ochaco wants to become a hero like Izuku, but does not realize this yet. During the Hero License Exam, Ochaco realizes the nature of her feelings for Izuku, and decides to push them down so that she cannot be distracted from her goal. In my opinion, I could understand why some people could view her character during this time as simplistic, with nearly all of her appearances concerning her feelings for Izuku. The decision she makes to push down her feelings to become a better hero could have been a more important event in her character, but I do not think that she has developed enough at this point in the manga to justify this character arc. I feel as though Horikoshi might have wanted to have Ochaco have feelings for Izuku in an attempt to eventually create a relationship between the two, however he might have realized that both characters needed to develop before a relationship could form, but still used her realization to allow her to decide to pursue her goals.

The third section concerns the Overhaul Arc to the Cultural Festival. It could be argued that Ochaco serves the role as an important side character rather than a main character during this section. Her interactions with Izuku had been sparse during this section and she receives less screen time than the earlier sections. The Overhaul Arc had allowed both Ochaco and Tsuyu to intern for Ryukyu and be involved in the Overhaul case, however the girls were overshadowed by the boys involvement. The largest moment of development for Ochaco was in chapter 163 when she realizes that she wants to become a hero to save people, which gives her a motivation that she might view as heroic. Ochaco also has a sideline role during the Cultural Festival Arc with the main focus of the arc focusing on Izuku's fight against Gentle and his desire to protect Eri. This section is what some people argue about when they state that Ochaco has had a lack of critical development recently. This can be attributed to Ochaco receiving a smaller role during these arcs than previous arcs and Horikoshi focusing on introducing new characters and developing side characters. I personally feel as though Ochaco has lost relevancy during this section and as a result the perception of her character has suffered, with people claiming that she is lost potential. I feel as though she will eventually return to a main character role and get her own arcs where she will develop on a larger scale.

This paragraph will discuss what I want to see for the future of her character. I will mostly be talking about her relationship with Izuku in this paragraph, since I view it to be an important aspect of her character in the future of the series. I will state that I am a follower of the Ochaco and Izuku ship, due to their interactions and chemistry with each other during the manga. It could still be argued that despite the lack of recent interactions between the characters, they could still be considered mutual best friends. I personally want Ochaco to continue to grow as her own character before a relationship can form, since I do not want her character to be defined solely off her relationship with Izuku. This includes her continue to improve herself and forge her own motivations and paths to becoming a hero. I also want to see the roles between the two characters to switch. During the manga, it has been noted that while there is mutual respect between the two, Ochaco takes a lot of inspiration from Izuku while Izuku does not take as much inspiration from Ochaco. Right now, it would feel as though the relationship would be one sided. I think one way to accomplish this would be for Izuku to admire her will to become her own hero and follow her own path, despite the fact that she has had to work hard to accomplish her own goals. Overall, I wish to see both Ochaco and Izuku to develop before any romance takes place, since a rushed romance can ruin characters since they might begin to lose characterization in order to keep the romance relevant. However, I do not want to romance to be delayed until the very end, since a relationship done well can improve the development and characterization of the characters, and last second relationships usually leave more unresolved than not.

TL;DR

Ochaco is a character who has a lot of potential for great characterization, but recently her role and development has stalled in the manga. She will more likely than not receive more attention during future arcs of the manga. In my personal opinion, I would want her to continue to develop before developing a romantic relationship with Izuku"

On the other hand, I could get a maxed out 13"" MBP for much less than the 15"". Some may suggest buying an external display but at that point the cost becomes almost the same if you get a higher end display.

My ex cheated on me with one of his interns who apparently had had a major crush on him from day one of working there, despite knowing about me. For months she pursued and flirted with him, and on her last day interning before she moved an hour away for a job, while they were all out having beers and getting drunk, she decided to hit on him and he cheated. 

I found out because I went on his phone (no passcode, had been on his phone millions of times but never looked at messages) to send myself pictures of his dog so I could send them to my parents. When I opened his iMessage, I noticed that she was the top message, and I can’t remember the exact message, but it was all suspicious enough for me to look at them and find out something had happened. 

I confronted him and he lied through his teeth while I had a panic attack. I believed him. But I’m not dumb, and confronted him two days later where he finally admitted to cheating. I proposed a break, and we both agreed it would be a break to work on ourselves, not pursue anyone, and rebuild our relationship. For the next three weeks, he continued to lie and manipulate me about what was going on with the girl in order to keep me around while pursuing her. He lied about pretty much everything. 

I hate admitting it, but I still occasionally deal with guilt and blaming myself over it. What did I do to make him cheat? What was so wrong with me that he left for another woman? A woman who multiple people who know her have told me is off her rocker crazy and desperate. Who (and I realize this is shallow and mean) is veryyy much a downgrade appearance wise. I gave that relationship every damn thing I had, until the very end when I told him I couldn’t deal with the way he was treating me. 

He tried to put the blame on me, because I had looked at his messages and found out on his phone. That was the first and only time I’d ever looked at messages. He also tried to blame me by saying that when his last GF cheated on him (twice) he was understanding and nice about it, and I wasn’t. He mocked me and tried to make me seem like I was crazy at times. I know he’s a massive douche canoe, but I can’t help feeling this way sometimes.

There’s absolutely nothing impressive that I’ve done so far, I’m still a freshman I know, but I’m aiming on not taking a gap so I feel like I fucked myself over this summer, especially when all my friends are doing internships, shadowing, jobs, summer classes, etc..

I’m wondering if I should apply for research/shadowing during the school year, and I’m honestly pretty scared. Taking orgo, physics, and calc II so I was hoping to use the extra time to study on those pretty rigorous classes. 

I do know some people that are in a lab or shadow on top of school, but they always seem busy, and never have time to do normal college things, and I’m afraid I’ll end up like them. Is it common for a lot of premed’s EC to come from fall/spring? I used to think it was almost exclusively in the summer.

So basically sacrifice a bit of my GPA and life for more EC hours, or get a better GPA and better lifestyle but no ECs.

He always comes to my office throughout the day and asks me if I need anything. At the end of the day, he loosens his tie and rolls up his sleeves. I try to find excuses to rub his forearms and touch his shoulders. 

One of these days I would like to keep him after hours for a project in the copy room. When everyone leaves I will take off my bra and panties and wear my button shirt and tight skirt. As he helps me with the paper copies, I will bend over and flash my ass and shaved pussy. I will act oblivious and turn around letting him see down my shirt. I will make sure my tit is exposed as I keep squatting underneath him and pretending to pick up papers. 

I want to catch him looking at my tits and see him blush. As he tries to look away real quick, I stand up and grab him by his tie. I pull him to me and we start making out. I start rubbing the outside of his pants and feel his cock get harder. He kisses down my neck and starts opening up my shirt. When he starts licking down my boobs and starts sucking my tits I unbuckle him and pull down his fly. He isn’t wearing any underwear and his cock flops out. He is about 7inches and his dick feels thick. He is cut and I can see a little bit of precum glisten from the head of his cock. He moans as I pull on it and breathes heavy. 

I begin unbuttoning his shirt but leave the tie on him. He is tan and has a semihairy chest. I start sucking his nipples as he strokes his cock. I use my tongue to lick from his neck down to his happy trail. I unbutton his pants and they fall to the ground. His cock is so hard that it curves up a bit. I gently lick the head of his cock and let the precum moisten my lips and then rub the head of his cock on my hard tits. He oozes more precum and I start rubbing his cock between my boobs. He breathes harder and I see sweat coming down his brow. I make him sit on some boxes and start sucking the head of his cock. I use my tongue to gently lick around the head. Then I slowly suck from his head down to his shaft. His cock tastes a little salty and I can smell his testosterone. I am rubbing my clit as I suck and the smell is making me wet. After sucking and gagging on his cock for a few minutes I stop. He has trimmed pubes but smooth balls. They are pretty big and look full of tasty cum. I suck on each ball and let it roll in my mouth. I also stroke his cock and feel the precum dripping out each time I suck. 

I move my tongue down to his taint. I lick the smooth area and hear him moan louder. I also lick around his inner thighs and see his legs begin to twitch. He gets so close to cumming he has to pull my face away. He starts making out with me and picks me up. I feel is long finger inside me and he starts fingering my pussy. I get wetter and start to moan. He then picks me up and sits me on the copier. I can see the vein on his bicep bulge and more sweat from his forehead. He flashes a smile, winks at me and sticks his tongue in my pussy. I immediately get wetter and let my pussy relax. I feel his stubble rub on the outside of my pussy and start curling my toes. He keeps licking and sucking and I rub my boobs and tits telling him to nibble me. 

He complies and I force him to sit down on the boxes. He tells him he is not going to last. I hush him and tell him to fuck me as hard and long as he can. I face him and start sitting on his hard cock cowgirl. I see his eyes role back and I can feel his cock fill up my entire pussy. I gently rock back and forth and feel his cock getting thicker. I let him breath a little and then start riding him faster. As I bounce harder on his cock he grabs my boobs to keep them from bouncing. I lean forward and he begins to suck each tit. I start getting wetter and can tell he is close. I ride a little faster and start grinding my pussy forward. I squeeze my pussy and can see his eyes get big. He gasps but can’t say anything. I keep riding and can feel the warm cum fill my pussy. I keep riding and he can finally moan. I can feel him shoot inside me for over 15 seconds. 

We are exhausted and covered in sweat. He said he never came so much in his entire life. I tell him I know based on how much cum was dripping from my pussy. He immediately grabs some paper towels and helps clean me up. We get dressed and he gives me a long kiss. He tells me he we be happy to work late tomorrow. I tell him the same and head home for a nice bubble bath. 

This is something I keep fantasizing about happening at work soon. Hope you interns keep your eyes open for us horny work gals. We have a lot of stress to work off! Would love to chat with some sexy interns out there sometime 😍"
90bln6,1,2018-07-19,M4F My Ditzy Bimbo Milf Neighbor,Lastofthealts,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/90bln6/m4f_my_ditzy_bimbo_milf_neighbor/,"* I like to set the scene before giving the general idea of the story so if you want, just skip down to the last few paragraphs *
      
“Oh my gosh thank you for coming over so fast Ben, I just texted you ” my new neighbor sandra babbled happily as she opened the door for me. She and her husband bob hand moved in a few weeks ago, and she was already my favorite neighbor if you know what I mean. At first I had thought she was just like any other smoking hot suburban milf, but she had soon disavowed me of that notion. The first giveaway was her the myriad of inappropriate outfits she as always wearing. She didn’t seem to have a sense of propriety, and she thought nothing of wearing a skimpy low cut top and skirt when she had me, the 18 year old neighbor over. 

The second thing that tipped me off was the fact that she was always having mishaps with men. Like that one time she explained that her husband didn’t let her come to his office anymore because the interns had convinced her that they had to feel her tits to prove they were real. 

“I just wanted to prove to them that their boss had a naturally hot wife, I don’t know why he was so upset. It’s not like they were trying to feel me up or anything” she had explained. Or that time she called me over, frantic because she was convinced the mole on her inner thigh might be dangerous. Now, that’s not a totally unreasonable request, but she was wearing crotchless panties when I came over to take a look. It had been pure torture as examined her, my head between her legs, the musky scent of her pussy wafting into my nostrils. 

Finally, she just wasn’t too bright all around. Like now, she had called me over because the TV wasn’t working. All it needed was to be plugged into the wall, but she didn’t realize. 

So, she was a Ditz, plain and simple. I hadn’t even tried to take advantage of her as of yet, maybe being late to puberty may have had something to do with that, but the ideas had been steadily building for the last  few weeks, and I knew I didn’t have the self control to stay pure much longer. 

*end of setting* 


Hey all. I think the general idea I’m going for is pretty clear, but I’ll do my best to explain as best I can. I don’t like the typical description of bimbo on her. It’s usually used to mean a cock hungry whore, but that’s not really it. A bimbo is a woman who is perfectly capable of enjoying sex like everyone else, but she’s a bit gullible. She loves her husband, and she recognizes the usual signs of sexual activity. For example, when someone is trying to take advantage of her she’ll usually say something like “oh, but won’t my husband be mad?” But she’s usually easily placated. So I’m looking for someone willing to play that role. If that sounds like something you’d be up for, I can wait to talk. "
90bmdt,0,2018-07-19,My (23M) good friend (25F) appears to upset with me because I met up with her ex-boyfriend (27M) even though I told her I would,PreviousEntrepreneur,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90bmdt/my_23m_good_friend_25f_appears_to_upset_with_me/,"Hey Reddit I kind of need help with this,  

\*\*TLDR\*\*: My good friends Steph and James broke up a while back. I stop hearing from James and my friendship with Steph goes downhill a bit. She starts dating someone new immediately after her breakup. A year later James wishes me a happy birthday and asks to go out for drinks. I ask Steph if she’s cool with it and she looks uncomfortable but says yes. James and I meet up and I find out that their relationship ended because Steph likely cheated on him (she told me something else). At a later date I told steph that I met up with James and I felt that she was starting to resent me. Now she won’t reply to any of my texts, did I do something wrong?  

So I’ve known one of my best friends, we’ll call her Steph, for almost 4 years. I had originally met Steph through her now ex-boyfriend and one of my good friends as well, we’ll call him James.  

Steph, James, and I hung out a lot during the first 2 years that we knew each other. We all worked together, partied together, went camping, and so on. I had so much fun hanging around these 2, they really did make the earlier years of my undergrad exhilarating. But something I do need to note is that I noticed that Steph and James would have a bit of arguments during this time. There would be times where I’d go see Steph and she’d be crying because of a minor disagreement (in my opinion) with James. Then there would be times where I’d see James and he’d be furious because of something Steph did without telling him. But despite these arguments, most of the time they seemed like they were doing okay.  

Fast forward a bit, I ended up having to move to a different city for a year to pursue an internship. When I moved back home, I invited all my other friends along with Steph and James to come out for dinner/drinks. Apparently while I was away, one of my other friends told me Steph and James were getting into even more arguments and stuff, and at one point they had taken a break from each other. And you know what I wasn’t really surprised at all.  

Fast forward 3-4 months, they broke up (they’ve probably been dating for 3 years). Ever since they broke up, I haven’t heard from James at all but I still see Steph on a regular basis. This is just because I still worked with Steph and had school with her at the time while James had already graduated and was working in the real world. Once they broke up, Steph changed a lot. She started going out more with her other friends, partying a lot with the Frats, hanging out with Sorority girls (she’s not in the greek system), doing a bit of party drugs and what not. When I asked her about her break up, she told me that the reason they broke up was because she felt that she was suffocated in the relationship. By that I mean, she felt that she didn’t’ have the opportunity to live her life and make her own friends because she was always hanging around James and his friends. I should also note that for a brief period of time after the breakup, my friendship with Steph changed as well. We didn’t hangout as much and she would blow me off for her new friends. We still worked together, we just weren’t as tight.  

As summer was approaching, I was preparing to move to a different city again to pursue a summer internship. While I was away, one of my close friends told me Steph was already in another relationship (about 1 month after their breakup). It was kind of shocking to me that she would just jump into another relationship like that but whatever.  

Once summer came to an end I moved back home and was getting ready for my final year of University. Strangely, I started reconnecting with Steph again because we would work the same shifts at my university job. Our friendship was kind of looking at how it used to which made me really happy. She’s an important person in my life even if we disconnected for abit because she’s been there for me through all my peak and low moments at school. She actively celebrated with me for every single achievement I’ve made and that means the world to me. She came to my graduation and even met my family, it was wonderful.  

Now here’s where it gets tricky. She wanted to celebrate my birthday with me and my other friend so we did. We went out and had dinner &amp; drinks. But during my bday, I get a text from James wishing me a happy birthday. Not hearing from him for over a year, I started texting him back trying to catch up with him. Eventually he asked if I wanted to go grab drinks with him later on in the week. Since Steph was with me, I asked her directly if she had any problems with me going to grab drinks. She was hesitant, but she said go for it but I could tell she was uncomfortable. But given James was also one of my good friends, I decided to just ignore that and go meet him.  

I met up with James a couple days later and we grabbed a couple of drinks. After catching up, he wanted to know how Steph was doing so I told him how she was doing well, shes in a new relationship, etc. He was absolutely shocked that she was in a new relationship. I was kind of shocked myself that he didn’t know because his brother still follows Steph on social media and she posts about her relationship at times. Also his close friends frequently attend my workplace so they often times see Steph and her new boyfriend together. Anyways after learning about how she started dating someone 1 month after they broke up, he just got really sad. He starts telling me about how she really hurt him during their relationship. Without telling me directly, I felt that he was pretty much saying she cheated on him. That night ended up being a huge clusterfuck. He told me about all the times she would go see other guys behind his back and what not. I had no idea. Also important to note, I didn’t tell anyone I was going to meet James that night besides one of my good friends (so Steph had no idea that I actually committed to this).  

A week later, Steph me and one of my other friends decided to go hang out. Towards the end of the night we grabbed some drinks at a local bar. As everyone’s finishing up, I decided to just tell Steph that I met with James the other night. I wanted to tell her first because I didn’t want to withhold this from her/lie to her, and I didn’t want her to hear that we hung out from someone else. I told her we caught up and that he’s doing well etc (I didn’t mention any of those other details). The moment I told her that, she was extremely uncomfortable. She didn’t say much and I don’t know but I felt that she was beginning to resent me.  

That was about a week ago, and I’ve sent her maybe 3-4 texts in that time frame asking if she’d want to hang out again but I haven’t heard back. I know she’s seen those messages because shes always on her phone and she still views my snapchat stories and what not. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but was it wrong of me to go meet with James? Should I apologize to Steph? I’m moving to a different country soon for school so I’m trying to hang out with my close friends as much as possible and I really don’t want to leave on bad terms with anyone.   
 

I apologize if things sound incoherent, I typed this quickly on my phone.  
 

Cheers

90byu9,3,2018-07-19,BEGINNER'S Undervolting/Thermal Guide for MSI GS65 (via personal experience) &amp; review!,JJQ77247,laptops,https://www.reddit.com/r/laptops/comments/90byu9/beginners_undervoltingthermal_guide_for_msi_gs65/,"DISCLAIMER: As the title says, this is all based on personal experience. Take what I say with a grain of salt: what worked for me might not work for you, the conditions I am in are probably different from you, etc. ALSO, I am not experienced in moding computers or doing things like this at all (Most of my life = Macbook User lmao) so this is completely from the perspective of an uneducated newbie doing trial and error as well as using the information from online research to the best of his ability. If you guys have better suggestions, please post below to help me as well as others! I have done a lot of research on ways to cool this thin &amp; light gaming laptop, and here are the best results I am able to get based on my personal ability, needs, and resources.

Background: I have the 8RE version (GTX1060). The laptop is usually sitting on an elevated stand and hooked up to a Thunderbolt dock which has Keyboard, Mouse, Headset, and monitor. Room temperature is usually hot (75-79F) cause I am poor after buying this comp.  I ONLY run EZ Non-hardcore/AAA games: Fortnite, League, and Overwatch. I didn't want to physically open up the back b/c of the flipped motherboard, too cheap for all the paste and tools, and I am too scared.

System Settings:

Go to Power Options, Change Power setting on whatever plan you are on, go to Advanced Power settings, go to Processor Power management, and limit the max to 98%. This helps limit the Max CPU speeds

Fan Settings:

Go to Msi Dragon Center, Go the Current (or a New Profile) and change the fans option to Advanced. Configure the speed of your fans however you would like, but the best results I have found were from another post on Reddit: [https://reddit.com/r/MSILaptops/comments/8kinhj/msi\_gs65\_hot\_games\_cool\_temps\_and\_you\_crosspost/](https://reddit.com/r/MSILaptops/comments/8kinhj/msi_gs65_hot_games_cool_temps_and_you_crosspost/)

CPU under-vaulting:

From what I have read online, it seems like the purpose is to reduce the amount of power that is delivered to the Processor which inevitably reduces the amount of heat it generates from running. The 2 go-to programs people use are Intel XTU or Throttle Stop. After using both, ThrottleStop definitely allows the user to configure more things, but I am not intelligent enough to feel confident about using TrottleStop, so XTU is now my go to. I have achieved a -.150mV on the Core Voltage Offset and Disabled the Turbo Boost Short Power Max. 

**Here is the Trial &amp; Error**: I was still getting 90F temperatures and thermal throttling when Stress testing, so I played around with a couple of other variables. I lowered the Turbo Boost Power Max down to 20W. I have no idea what it does, but now I have limited the MAX Core freq. to 3.6GHz from 3.8GHz, and the average Core freq. is lowered from 3.88GHZ down to 2.9-3.2GHZ. This was able to keep my temperatures at 68-75F. 

Results: [https://imgur.com/a/5djbH6x](https://imgur.com/a/5djbH6x)

Now, the computer is Power Limit Throttling instead of Thermal Throttling. I do not know if this is good or not, but it seems to lineup with the purpose of ""undervolting"". Nevertheless, my computer is stable, and the temperatures are great when I am gaming. The CPU speeds are not terribly crippled either.

GPU under-vaulting:

Apparently people are using a program called Msi AfterBurner. I tried it. I had no idea how to use the program. I gave up. My GPU temps never crossed into the 80F range @ default settings, so I was more willing to ignore making improvements by undervolting the GPU. I watched YT tutorials but still had no clue on what to do. w/e.

Review: 

I am a pre-med student, primary use of laptop involve MS Office, Chrome, traveling, light gaming with the homies. I needed a computer that was thin &amp; light so I could bring it to class, internships, etc., Something powerful since I hate lag, and my old MBPro annoyed the hell out of me when MS office would lag, and something that runs games well. This laptop fit all of my criteria, and I haven't had any major issues with it... yet, at least. I have owned this laptop for onyl about 2 weeks.

PROS: The 144hz screen is truly awesome. I didn't believe the reviews, but now I am a believer. The Steele Series Keyboard feels good. It is similar to the butterfly switches on my MBPro, and it has a really cool audio visualizer effect &amp; other unexpectedly helpful visual effects. Battery Life has been really good when not plugged in. Under-volting the CPU is expected to help it even more. Fans, after making all the above changes, are really not that bad. If anything, just wear some headphones, and it will be totally inaudible. If you are worried about being in public (e.g. Library) with the fans going crazy, then do not worry. Fans rarely come on when doing simple tasks like MS Office, Chrome, etc. and only come on when you are gaming, and I personally don't game in public (unreliable Wifi, unreliable location of Power Outlets, I don't bring a mouse, etc.)

CONS: Just like all the other reviews you have probably seen already, the build quality is truly lacking. Coming off a Macbook Pro, I understand that Windows Laptops can't compete in this field, but the Msi GS65 is really lackluster. There is flex when you pick it up from one side, the hinge design makes you feel uneasy, and worst of all: CREAKING. Flex is one thing, but creaking introduces another sense that makes you EXPERIENCE that terrible building quality. Moving your palm around to type on the keyboard makes you hear the creaks on both sides of the palm rest. I heard this can be fixed if you re-seat or re-wrap the the battery, but I am not willing to open up the internals. However, for the price we are paying for this product, I do not believe this quality standard is acceptable for a laptop that is otherwise absolutely amazing.

Overall: Great pick for me/anyone who fits my profile. It is thin, powerful, and the thermal limitations can be fixed with software modifications and even more if you are willing to re-paste! The build quality is the only thing that I wish was improved on my the design team and manufacturers.

If I am doing something wrong or you guys have better tips, just post and let me know!"
90byy6,3,2018-07-19,Under the Glass - 1,AliciaWrites,AliciaWrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/AliciaWrites/comments/90byy6/under_the_glass_1/,"I barely saw my mother when I was a child. She was always locked away in her workshop crafting snowglobes. She was a woman obsessed and I thought her selfish to never care for anything or anyone but them.

Occasionally, my father would let me visit her in the workshop. She’d always looked disheveled and unwashed. I thought she was crazy. Her work was beautiful though. I’d slowly walk along the shelves father had custom-built for her prized artwork and gaze at the miniature worlds she’d created. It never seemed she paid much attention to me unless I were to reach out to touch one.

“Don’t!” she’d shout. “Never touch them.”

As the years passed, I visited less and less. My mother was like a ghost to me. She existed only in my memories and continued to fade after I’d finally moved out.

I attended college and forgot much about my past and especially about my mother. I was given opportunities beyond my wildest dreams, climbing that corporate ladder at my law firm. What started as an internship became a partnership, and I had gained so much from living this life outside my childhood home.

An otherwise unremarkable day, the day my mother died was still a memorable one. My father had called to give the news. It had been years since I’d heard either of their voices, but something inside me broke at the sound of his. I thought I was over it all, but it turned out I was just fighting the yearning of a normal, happy family.

I finished the week of work and went home for the funeral. My father seemed almost catatonic as people I considered strangers spoke about my mother fondly. I watched him, I waited for his tears, I waited for my own. None came to either of us.

I drove my father to his home, my old home. Of course, he invited me in, but I wasn’t ready for company, least of all his. After seeing him to his door, I drove off in the direction of my hotel, noticing in my rear-view mirror that he watched as I left.

I lay in the firm, but unsupportive, bed and stared at the ceiling. I let my thoughts flow freely and my mind wandered to the most unexpected of places. I wondered about her craft, what had her so obsessed with those globes. I was curious at what inspired them as I recalled they were quite beautiful and detailed. The scenes all seemed so real, so believable. 

I was sure sleep wasn’t happening any time soon, so I decided on a bath. I ran the hottest water I could bear and poured in the salts provided by the hotel. The room took on a warm rosy scent, instantly relaxing me.

I slid into the water, my skin instantly reddening, and lay back and closed my eyes. The scene before me seemed so real, but I knew it was just a memory.

I was on one of my visits to my mother’s workshop, admiring her beautiful pieces. There was sawdust everywhere on the floor that made my every step scuff more loudly than normal. The room was cool and goosebumps covered my arms and neck as a draft chilled me. 

I opened my eyes. Why was there a draft? The workshop had no windows and only one door. I suppose it could have just come from upstairs in the main house. I sank deeper into the water, enjoying the pruning of my fingertips and toes and inhaling the salty steam. I noticed there were jets, so I searched for the switch and set them on to massage my stressed out body.

A chill caught my knees and face and made me wake with a start. The water was still warm so I couldn’t have been out for that long. I decided to wrap it up by washing. The soaps bubbled in the water after I’d rinsed each section I washed. It became mesmerizing to watch the swirls of bubbles flow around me. In my hypnotized state, I grabbed a handful of bubbles and lifted them to my face. I studied the oily swirls on the surface of the bubbles for what I imagined was far too long and then blew them out of my hand. One bubble didn’t fall back to the water but continued floating and began to glow. I assumed this meant it was time for me to finally go to sleep. It had been a hard day.

I put in eight hours yesterday and thirteen today, working with two other software engineering interns to build something great. When we started we had no idea how far we'd get. Now we're almost done, and I couldn't be more proud of what we've built. 

But the thing we built doesn't even matter that much. The greatest part for me has been the experience. It has reminded me why I fell in love with coding in the first place. I have been able to set aside my normal work responsibilities and let the creative juices flow. I've pushed through hunger and tiredness and discomfort because I wanted to finish a feature more than I wanted to eat or sleep or stand up and stretch. It might sound crazy, but it's a really great feeling.

This Hackathon is with my company, but I've seen them at schools, libraries, and more. Wherever you are, you can find likeminded people who are interested in dedicating time to building cool stuff. I hope you all have the opportunity to throw everything you have into a project, even if it's just for a few days.

Thanks for reading, and happy hacking."
90cons,4,2018-07-19,I [21M] have feelings for my best and only true friend [22F] at my summer job and I don’t know if I should tell her before we leave.,27363728182727rel,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90cons/i_21m_have_feelings_for_my_best_and_only_true/,"Throwaway account for safety. 

I met my friend, we’ll call her Liz, at the beginning of this summer when we both started interning for the same company. I moved states away to do this job for the summer and knew literally no one down here. However, I had a really rough last semester when it came to dating, so I came down here with the intention of not getting involved with anyone because I knew I needed to take some time to be independent and work on myself. 

From the very beginning of the internship, I got a long with Liz way better than the other two interns, who also happen to be my roommates, and really shitty roommates who don’t pull their weight, at that. We got to be friends pretty quickly as our desks were right next to each other so we talk a lot, we eat lunch together, and she lives in her own apartment in the same complex as me and the other interns so I often go over there to hang out since I don’t really do anything fun with them. With not a lot of other people around, we hung out more and more just the two of us and ended up becoming really good friends. However, it remained platonic for the longest time. We both had crushes on other interns who were flown in for intern camp, but when they went back to their permanent locations the possibility of either of those relationships happening died out. We gave each other advice on how to talk to our respective crushes, and I honestly thought nothing more of our relationship than just friends. 

Now I’ll say that I have always thought that Liz was a very attractive girl for many reasons. As far as physical attraction goes, she is pretty tall for a girl and has a very unique orangeish-Red hair color. But she is also incredibly smart and has a great sense of humor, and I have always found that combo to be hard to find in girls. Despite always thinking that, it wasn’t until recently that I actually started developing feelings for her. It wasn’t until one night about a month ago when we were sitting in her apartment, in our pajamas, watching reality tv while she was wearing a face mask. And I had this moment where I thought, “wait a damn minute, I’m in a relationship without the sex.” Now I am in no way trying to imply that I believe that she owes me sex because I am nice to her, but I just realized I had never spent more time or gotten more personal with a girl who I was not romantically involved with. That following weekend, she invited me to go to another city to see her mom. I’m not from around here so she was trying to give me the chance to see another city, plus her mom lives alone so I think she just wanted some company. We went and we had a great time, most of it spent with her mom who I also really got along with. But that entire time, it really felt like I was a boyfriend meeting one of the parents. Maybe that was me getting in my own head, but I was even more confused after that trip. 

I considered telling her how I felt or asking her out, but I came to the conclusion that I could not screw up the one true friendship I have down here because I cannot be this far away from all my other friends and family and do this job alone. So, I tried to bury my feelings and find things I didn’t like about her. I convinced myself that she partied a little bit too much and our religious differences would be too much but honestly that is bullshit because I never think that about anyone. Last week, I went to another city with some friends and Liz did not come with us because she had other plans. And after the weekend was over, it was the longest I had gone without seeing her since I met her and all I wanted to do was see her. Since I had these feelings I was more hesitant on what I would say to her and how much I would ask her to hang out, but she still texts me a lot like she always has and still asks me to hang out a lot. The other night, she asked me to go get dinner so we went to this sushi place we both like and we ended up having a long talk about dating. She told me that she has had a couple long term boyfriends, but she complained that she had never been asked on a real date, and that all of her past relationships had just evolved from friendships and they would just “hang out” as opposed to actually having date nights. She said guys never ask her out and she is afraid she is going to die alone, which is obviously hyperbole but I cannot for the life of me figure out why she doesn’t get asked out more. She is smart, beautiful and funny and an overall wonderful person. If guys don’t like that, then idk what’s wrong with them. This is not the first time she has told me this, so some people might say this is her hinting for me to ask her out. But, she also does a lot that I don’t think a girl would do in front of a guy she liked, such as burping extremely loudly and demonstrating how she trims her nose hairs with her fingers. I think that’s all super endearing, but it just doesn’t seem like the norm.  When we got back to our apartment complex, we talked about our relationship baggage from the past and she talked about how she is terrible with words of affirmation. So I sat her down and I told her how I moved down here during a really rough time in my life and how she helped me get out of that. She said she didn’t know how she helped but I told her she did everything just baby being my friend. She teared up a little bit and she told me she loved me and I told her I loved her too. We hugged and I told her I just needed her to know how much she meant to me, because I’m 3 weeks I move back home and we will be going to school 1,000 miles apart. 

Ever since that night, I have been wanting to ask her out. I’ve thought, if she has never really been asked out before, maybe I could, and I would definitely show her a really nice time. However, if she is totally turned off my that, it could ruin our friendship and make my remaining time down here absolute hell. It would make it awkward at work and I feel like I couldn’t hang out with her in the same way anymore. While we are moving apart in 3 weeks, we both really want to come back and work for this company when we graduate. The catch is, she graduates in the fall and I graduate in the spring. Meaning she would start full time before me and placed in a different location than I would be in once I graduate. So now, I am stuck between not wanting to risk our friendship, and not wanting to risk missing out on a person who I have a great connection with and could seriously see myself ending up with. Liz is my best friend and I care about her so much, that’s all I have ever wanted in someone.

I have no clue what to do. There is a huge part of me that just wants to casually ask her out tomorrow. I’m not going to “profess my love”, but maybe if I just suggest one friendly date, she might say yes and we could go and see how things feel. Again, however, I run the risk of losing her as a friend, and that would be awful. I’m just afraid that if I never try, I will always regret it because she is truly one of a kind and it will be a long time before I find anyone else like her. Please tell me what to do. Do I ask her out or not??

TL;DR: I have feelings for my best friend at my summer job but we are going our separate ways in 3 weeks. I don’t know if it’s worth it to tell her or not.

I'm working on the first part of the guide right now and will post a link to it when I finish :) )

Hi all,

I'm a rising senior thinking of writing up a guide to majoring in Computer Science at W&amp;M. 

Haven't completely worked out what to include in this--initial thoughts are I'd write up advice on classes, research opportunities, personal programming projects, and internships.

Thoughts on whether there'd be interest in this? If so, what other sections should I include (what would you have liked to know about CS at W&amp;M before starting here)?

Thanks!"
90d25u,3,2018-07-20,Job Interview: Ask These 6 Questions to Find a SuperStar,xmio,BlockchainStartups,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockchainStartups/comments/90d25u/job_interview_ask_these_6_questions_to_find_a/,"Hiring people is always a stressful but interesting process. Hiring good employees is mostly hard. There are lots of flags that can show if you will be able to work together productively and for a long time or not. Outside of the standard interview sessions, test tasks, etc. never forget about your gut feel . If something doesn’t feel right or you’re not absolutely sure about hiring a person, then say no, just do it.

&gt;*It will take longer to hire the right employees, but you want to build a company full of people that are right for their roles and are interested in the project, instead of people that came along at the right time.*

So, how how to tell if you’re hiring the right people? Ask these six questions:

### 1. What do you like about our business? If there’s something you don’t like, how’d you change it?

This question shows two things. 1. It gives you insight into how candidates will describe verbally things they don’t like. Will it be the fast answer or not. Will he/she talk about problems too much or just the right amount of time. Always look for people who talk just a little bit about the problem and mostly about the solution.

### 2. Which book are you currently reading?

It’s a great question to check if the person is interested in reading at all (we live in the era where it’s a questionble). Moreover, it shows which books the person likes the most (if a candidate thinks too much — the answer probably won’t be honest). Passionate people tend to read books or listen to audio books to improve their skills. Whether the books are specific to a skill such as sales, front-end development, etc. or they’re reading a book focused on self-development doesn’t matter, it’s a good sign.

I’m all in with fiction books but if a candidate hasn’t read an educational book for a while, that’s a bad sign. Superstars are always looking to improve their skills, find out more useful information.

### 3. Tell me about a problem you were tasked with solving in your previous job. What did you do?

With this question you’ll be able to see problem solving and creative thinking skills or lack of it. Was the approach thoughtful or did they pass it on to someone else?

### 4. What’s the one thing you’ve accomplished in your career that you’re most proud of?

This gives you insight into how they define success. If they were promoted several times in their previous role during a two-year period, then you may have met a potential superstar.

### 5. Have you played any team sports before?

You all know what is it about. Be aware of which role the person plays in a team is crucial for businesses. People who play team sports such as basketball are driven, focused on achieving goals and physically fit, which helps keep their mind in peak condition. Generally, they will also be great communicators, cope well under pressure and perform well during team events.

### 6. What do you do for fun?

Balance is an important part of success, and physical fitness, relationships contribution, travelling, and learning are important too.

As an example, if someone goes to the swimming pool two days a week, volunteers on Saturdays and is learning French “just for themselves,” then it’s fair to say they value achievement, goal setting and are continually looking to improve themselves. This will translate into their job.

All in all, look at every aspect of candidates’ lives to see what they like to do and what they hate — and decide whether these factors matter to your business or not. Pay attention not only on the words they say, but on their behaviour during interview too: calm and appropriately relaxed voice and posture can say a lot.

### Where to find great specialists?

There are actually much more options than usual Linkedin posting. For modern and proactive people who have their hands on the pulse with technology and are ready to take the next step in their careers we created [Aworker](https://aworker.io/) — the platform that helps to find the most suitable company and job position based on their professional background, work-related skills, and achievements. Aworker users are no longer tied up to one job, company, city or even continent so all your connections from all over the world will be counted. The catch here is that you have to prove the data you write about by attaching certificates or other verifying documents.

Anyone can get a reward by recommending a friend or acquaintances for open positions (they’ll be rewarded even if they won’t get a job after the interview). All your acquaintances from internships, part-time jobs, webinars, and other professional events will be able to prove your skills and achievements at work. To find out more about the project, visit [this page](https://aworker.io/).

I wish you all to find your Superstars. If you are the one — you’re awesome! Keep improving!

I also remind you that Aworker Private Sale #4 is live right now. For further details visit [aworker.io](https://aworker.io/)

90e3x6,3,2018-07-20,Are treatment records always kept following termination regardless of treatment setting?,TwinPurpleEagle,TalkTherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/90e3x6/are_treatment_records_always_kept_following/,"I saw a school based therapist back when I was in high school for both my senior and junior year to cope with a bad home life and high functioning depression. I just graduated from high school in May and plan to move out for college in the fall.

I terminated with my therapist back in February. I was doing fine for a while, but now I'm experiencing some trauma symptoms and I think my depression may have come back. 

It occurred to me that it might be a good idea to ask for my treatment record since I definitely plan on seeking out a new therapist (someone off campus I can see long term) when I get to college. I'm also not too fond of having to retell everything I've been through as it's quite extensive. 

Had it been a traditional treatment setting (private practice, group practice, mental health clinic, etc) I would go and ask for it without hesitation.

But I'm not sure if my high school will still have my treatment record on file. I do know that the therapist at my high school was an MFT Intern who was directly employed by the school district. I'll definitely try calling my high school and/or the district office to see if I am able to receive a copy of my treatment records, but I'm afraid people will think I'm a lunatic.

Also, I was 17 back when I was seeing my therapist but I've turned 18 now. I'm assuming since I'm not a minor anymore, I'm able to ask for my treatment record of my own accord (before I turned 18 my parents had that right), correct? I live in California if state laws make a difference. "

And I know I should not. I know there’s no reason for this. I keep on damning Pascal for the most banal sentence he could have come up with, the heart knows reasons that reason does not know, and it is as if I am still believing as Aristotle in the heart as the central core of  human soul. I know I should not utter this ridiculous sentence. But I miss you. Strangely enough, I say this transitively, in a language which is not mine. Transitively, as I were projecting the action, but I am not missing, i’m here, there is no lack of me. There’s lack of you. You are missing, intransitively en français I’d say tu me manques, you’re missing to me, you are the lack that I have, the absence I cannot not feel. 
I really should not address these words to you. Our deal was clear from the beginning. We knew already it had to be temporary. I know you’re going back home where someone is already waiting for you, you in your super modern relation which even to me that i don’t know what monogamous means any longer seemed too intense. I know that for you this was nothing more than an adventure, away from home, living in a sort of parallel reality, a virtual hub compared to the more-than-real life, out there, just in pause for the moment. While I’m trapped in this server, a self-imposed exile who has forgotten his own native language. I don’t have any other life to come back to. This is the only one left. 
If I am here writing these unsendable words, it’s not because I am get swallowed by the sadness of the end of something that already had an expiring date, it is only because after years of absconding myself from feelings, after hiding behind the mask of open relationships, I was there, on the verge of sensing something undefinable which was turning into stomachache. And abruptly I realised when i started deferring all my decisions to you. to stay with you for most of the time we still had. And I know you realised as well and got scared by the tourbillon of feelings I was pouring into you. But the problem is not you. 
I am emotionally tired. I thought this could have been the way, never getting attached, no jealousy, having maybe three relationships worth half the effort of an exclusive one. But then look at me, I closed all of them because they were impeding me to see you. I laugh. I don’t know if i want to keep playing this game, adapting to this liquid society which unsettles us and forces us to never settle. We need to be precarious in every aspect of our life. We will get fired once again, we will need to change place once more, we will have to change job, find an unpaid internship, change housemates, partners, start anew, recount yourself again to a new other, get to know this other, repeat the same exact words, replicate the same exact gestures, maintain the same routine, but change the practices. As De André was singing tu, ma con gli occhi di un altro colore, you with the eyes of a different colour. The same, but different. I don’t know why this thing saddens me, my life goes smooth — but i know that complaining is a ontological requirement of Being. 
But this discourse is so far from you. Your first year abroad, a temporary period where to experience the entire falsity of this brand they’re trying to sell, the global citizen. And it’s incredible how to all the people who really need to become global citizens, children of the war and not voluntary exiles as myself, this right is denied. But we are still here, sharing on the interconnected collective consciousness images of human sufferance to portray ourself as social justice warriors for a like or two. But now I am going astray.
I wish the best to you. I hope one day we will find ourself under the same piece of sky and interweave again."

&amp;nbsp;    
   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Bent u bekend met het artikel ‘Gemeenten gaan huurders van boerenschuren screenen’? 1&amp;#41;  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 1  
&amp;nbsp;    
Ja.  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 2  
&amp;nbsp;    
Wat vindt u van dit initiatief? Welke bijdrage kan het leveren aan het voorkomen dat ruimtes veranderen in bijvoorbeeld een drugslab of wietkwekerij?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke rol kunt u spelen in het uitrollen van dit initiatief door het hele land, zodanig dat particuliere eigenaren huurders op criminele antecedenten kunnen screenen?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 2 en 3  
&amp;nbsp;    
De versterking van de aanpak van ondermijnende criminaliteit is voor dit kabinet een belangrijk doel. Lokale initiatieven die kunnen bijdragen aan de aanpak van ondermijnende criminaliteit moedig ik dan ook aan. Het initiatief waarover wordt gesproken in het artikel betreft een concept-initiatief. Gemeenteraden moeten nog goedkeuring geven aan het initiatief. Het is aan individuele gemeenten te bepalen of zij dit initiatief volgen.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 4  
&amp;nbsp;    
Herinnert u zich in dit verband het pleidooi &amp;#40;bijvoorbeeld tijdens het debat over de Begroting Justitie en veiligheid 2018&amp;#41; om een zogenaamd ‘stoplichtenmodel’ te introduceren, waardoor particuliere eigenaren gewaarschuwd kunnen worden tegen potentiële criminele huurders?   
&amp;nbsp;    
Vraag 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Welke stappen heeft u inmiddels gezet om dit te realiseren? Wat mogen we van u verwachten op dit punt?  
&amp;nbsp;    
Antwoord 4 en 5  
&amp;nbsp;    
Het zogenoemde stoplichtmodel zag op een samenwerking tussen enerzijds politie en anderzijds autoverhuurbedrijven en makelaars. Indien een autoverhuurbedrijf of makelaar twijfelde of een potentiële huurder het te huren motorvoertuig of de woon- of bedrijfsruimte zou aanwenden voor criminele activiteiten, nam diegene contact op met de politie. De politie gaf vervolgens een advies om wel &amp;#40;groen&amp;#41; of niet &amp;#40;rood&amp;#41; met de potentiële huurder in zee te gaan. De Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens heeft de korpschef in februari 2017 gevraagd naar de grondslag voor het verstrekken van politiegegevens aan autoverhuurbedrijven en makelaars voor dit doel. Nadat uit intern onderzoek bleek dat de juridische grondslag voor het stoplichtmodel ontbrak, besloot de korpschef te stoppen met de uitvoering van de stoplichtconvenanten.  
&amp;nbsp;    
In februari 2018 heeft de Minister van Justitie en Veiligheid de Actie-agenda aanpak ondermijning naar uw Kamer gestuurd. Bij brief van 11 juli jl. is uw Kamer geïnformeerd over de voortgang van dit proces.   
&amp;nbsp;    
Het gegevensbeschermingsrecht biedt geen ruimte om een doorstart te maken met de uitvoering van het stoplichtmodel. Wel doe ik momenteel onderzoek naar de aard en omvang van het probleem dat een huurder het door hem gehuurde motorvoertuig of de door hem gehuurde woon- of bedrijfsruimte aanwendt voor criminele activiteiten.

Before, I thought it was the work, but now I've realized it's just her. I'm so incredibly on edge at the place that I don't know if she's either gonna joke around or yell at me for doing something harmless. She's the only CPA there, everyone else is an ""intern"".

Yesterday I woke up feeling depressed over a current friends situation. Went about the day just trying to make it through and for whatever reason just had the weirdest feelings about everything. 

After my morning routine I get a call from the ex. We talk about the apartment situation and I tell her it’s hers I have to stay with friends for my own mental sake. Whether things work out or not I’m gonna need my space to process whatever may happen. We talk and both break down over our friend and her grandpa (love her family) who also is experiencing cancer. She asks me to stay in the apartment and hints at sleeping in the same room with her (red flag alert). 

Get a call from my dad 2 hours later saying it looks like a I got an internship for one of the biggest sports events of the year. My joy goes through the roof. It’s a huge boost to my future resume and I am so excited to help with the event. Then proceeds to say as well he seems to think we’ll reconcile. Didn’t want to talk about that stuff. Back to weird emotional state again. Lol. 

Her mom calls me late afternoon to check up on me and make sure I was doing well and tell me they still love me. (Very close with her family) she proceeds to reiterate what my dad had said about us. Really didn’t want to hear it again because I’ve been moving on with no hope. I don’t think hope is good for me to have right now. Trying to not let this cloud my judgement or my expectations. 

Yesterday may have been one of the biggest emotional rollercoasters of my life. I have been really good about no contact and managing these emotions. Only time the ex and I talk is about the apartment we were supposed to get together. I told her I just needed my space to be me and live my life the way I’m wanting to be. I still feel surprisingly good. :)"

*Some background:*

I met this girl, we will call her L, in the second month or so in college (currently going into my third year). Prior to meeting L, I had solely relied on my mother, an extremely compassionate, caring, and emotionally intelligent person, to help me through those painfully awkward teenage soul-searching years, and I didn’t think I would ever find someone else to understood me as well as my mom did.

Well, L and I hit it off almost immediately when we started getting to know each other. The first night we kissed (about a week after we started talking), I stayed in her dorm. No, we did not have sex until the third month together. I then continued to stay in her room every night except for three for the rest of my first year. Yes, I know that’s a bit unprecedented but I hope you can understand that we were addicted to each other. We had the exact same communication styles, handled conflicts in a complimentary way, had the same degrees of compassion and shared many similar opinions (sans politics). No matter what issue we encountered, we were never nasty to each other, we simply talked it out and found a solution and moved on. It felt like a match made in heaven at the time, and so we spend almost every moment we could together for a year. What made us work was that we told each other *literally everything* about what was going on in each other’s lives because we knew the other would listen without judgement and do their very best to understand with love and compassion. And that’s how it happened time and time again.

Fast forward to the summer after that year, and we were apart for over a month for the first time in our relationship. We both knew it was going to be hard but we’d agreed that we could survive a few months apart. Remember how we told each other everything? Well, let’s just say I did something I completely regret and have since sought help for. I’m not going to elaborate further because it is irrelevant to the story, but the end result when I (stupidly) told her was that she felt like she could no longer be with me and still respect herself. So we broke up and spiraled down separately. She was a few states away in an internship and I later learned she’d essentially walled herself off from the rest of the intern group for the remainder of what had started as a promising opportunity to grow for her socially. I kind of threw myself into videogames and spent about $700 on racecar simulation equipment.

The next fall semester was pretty terrible for both of us. We had tried to reconnect but it was too painful for me. I had told her that I needed some time to heal on my own, but she couldn’t be apart from me for more than two weeks so I began trying my hardest to heal quickly so she could heal too. As you can imagine, I cut corners in my own healing process which led to the problems I’m having now. We developed a friendship that was superficial by our standards, and eventually she gave up on me (because I still couldn’t be vulnerable enough for her to feel close to me). That was fine, I really needed time to try to work through the emotional shitstorm I had bottled up for a few months. December sucked a lot, but it felt like I had got through a lot of my feelings that month. (A bonus was I discovered Dance Gavin Dance)

*The leadup to the fall:*

I never properly processed that we had broken up for three reasons; 1) I had distracted myself with videogames that summer and rebounds that semester because every time I tried to think about it, I just lost myself completely in the pain of her absence, 2) I had stopped what little progress I was making to try to be friends with her before I was ready, and 3) she and I had made a pact while we were together that if we were still single at 26 or 28, we would reconnect and, if things were right, try again. The corner I cut to speed up my healing process was to tell myself we would be okay in the long term because of the pact we had made. It worked as I had intended, and I felt like I was okay with reconnecting with her again by the start of Spring.

Spring semester rolled around and she felt like she had made progress too, so we started rebuilding again. Initially it was really hard so we established boundaries like no discussing intimate relationships (because I would get too jealous, again because of my shortcut). The boundaries worked really well that semester and I even let myself feel like things were returning to normal again. By the end of the semester, we had come to rely on each other for our emotional crises, including when she was diagnosed with BPD (yeah, it explains a lot I know but that analysis is for another subreddit).

Summer of this year rolled around and I broke up with my rebound at the time (I had two that year, one that lasted about a month and the other directly following that lasted from October through June. I refused to call it a rebound though because I had told myself I had ‘healed’). By that time, L and I had grown close enough to somewhat resemble what we shared a year previously. In June, I had to go to her hometown for an unrelated reason (had other options but I saw the opportunity to visit her) and it turned out she would be in town on that day. We spent the entire morning together, going to a local landmark, talking, getting lunch, and just generally having a good time. It was like time travelling backwards a year, and it gave me hope for us in the future.

*The fall:*

We didn’t talk every day, but it was close to that, and the frequency increased after I visited. L is graduating in December and planning on moving out of state after that and I’m studying abroad next semester and won’t be returning until after her graduation, so we decided we wanted to meet up once more while we still could. We were like brother and sister after all. 

She drove up to my hometown and it was my turn to show her around. I’m not usually someone to get super anxious, especially when meeting up with people I’ve known for a long time, but I fucking changed my clothes 3 times before I went out to meet her. Well, we met up and had a pretty good time as always, then she came back to my house because my mom had invited her over for dinner and to stay the night (otherwise it would have been a near 5 hour drive back to her house at night on a Sunday). Things only felt like they got better when she was around my family; she connected with everyone, had a great time talking and chatting and cleaning up with my mom, and we had walked on the beach together while we were waiting for dinner to cook, during which time she asked if it was okay to hold my hand. It felt like things were coming together again. We have a guest room, but she’d never seen Pulp Fiction so I offered to stream it on my computer in my room. We eventually fell asleep in my room together, and it was the best I’d felt for over a year. We woke up the next morning cuddling together and though we didn’t have sex, we went as far as her anxiety would let her. She had to leave shortly after that to make it home in time for something and I had work so it was fine.

I texted her later that day to make sure she got home okay and we started having a conversation. I sensed she was being distant and asked what was wrong. She said she needed some time to reorient herself after that weekend because she was so shaken up about how good it felt for her to be with me again. I had seen it coming and gave her space as I always had when she asked for it. In my mind though I was certain she felt the same way about me and would come to the same conclusion that we were meant to be together. We had always been on the same page, and I had seen no reason why this time would be any different. (DGD fans – “Turn Off The Lights – I’m Watching Back To The Future Pt. 2” and “Count Bassy” describes this limbo perfectly)

She texted me on Wednesday asking to talk and I obliged. She called me crying about another anxiety attack regarding STDs, that she felt like she had gone too far with me, that she was out of control; she popped a xanny for the first time (totally not like her, she’s always been risk averse because of her anxiety), and that was super afraid that she’d contracted something because someone she hooked up with on Tuesday had focused on the same body I had on Sunday and now it was a bit irritated. Yes, the girl I had always felt like I would spend my life with, the girl I had always counted on to feel the same as me, had basically just hopped from one intimate moment to another. And she just dropped that bomb as casually as I have made it seem.  I didn’t really hear anything she said after that. I was too busy observing the explosion of my world happening in my head. At the end of the call I told her I needed a few weeks to myself to think and she understood. It may seem like I’m overreacting to a small hookup an friend had and told me about it, but that was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. I finally saw how attached to her I still am when I died a little after hearing that. (DGD fans – “Shelf Life”)

I took the rest of that day and yesterday to think about what would be best for me. I concluded I had to be able to live my life wholly and completely without her playing a main role anymore. I sent her an email telling her that I don’t know how much time I need away from her, but I won’t be reaching out to her until the urge to reach out to her is long gone. I think I need a year from yesterday, so that’s the date I’ve set in my head.

I feel so lost. I need to heal independently, but I don’t know how to do it. I can try to meditate more, but my workplace isn’t the best environment for that so progress is slow. I tried distracting myself the first time around and that just ended up temporarily burying how I truly felt. I don’t want to numb myself completely, but I can feel myself becoming a shell. I don’t want that, but it’s the only way I have found that allows me to function on a day-to-day basis. I feel like I’m at an extremely critical point in this part of my life and I want to emerge as healthy as I can, but I’m so afraid that I won’t be able to find myself again. Its day 1 of the year I’ve mentally set aside for myself without her and I just feel so alone. Normally I’d go to my mom, but the only advice she’s giving me is the ‘it’ll get better’ line. I’m scared, Reddit. How do I start the healing process without hitting rock bottom? I did it last December but I don’t think I can do it again. I know I’ll numb myself into a shell before I’ll go through that ordeal again. I watched a TED talk explaining how helpful making a list of how she wasn’t right for me can be, but it doesn’t help with losing a best friend at the same time.

If you’ve made it this far, I truly commend you on your patience and willingness to feel for others. May your love for others bring you happiness and fulfillment in life. Any anecdotes on coping healthily, advice on how to survive without a best friend, and/or kind words are very appreciated."

So far, I have a very decent grasp of using RapidMiner since spring, and I really felt a passion with working with data as a marketing person. 

I also have a year+ experience in sales.

This summer, I landed a summer internship as a sales analyst for a Fortune 300 company and so far they only work within Excel. I think it's at least good to show that I have experience with Excel functions through this job.

Looking forward, I thought about learning Python to increase my edge over the competition when I am applying for entry level jobs. Thoughts?

Also note: I have a basic understanding of SQL, recently won multiple awards in a digital marketing competition at my school, and plan on getting my basic Tableau certification very soon. I've worked on a semester report using only Tableau and did pretty well with cleaning up the data in Rapidminer and then transferring it to Tableau and moving from there. 

So how well do you think I would fair against entry level competition when applying to be a marketing analyst? Should I be applying for a different type of job? 

I appreciate all of you reading this! 

Edit: Also have had positive experience in social media marketing for a small business in my area. "

Catching you fucking your intern was the best thing that ever happened to me. In your position of power, the idea of you fucking around with a minor would have ruined your carreer. She is 17, but the media would tear you apart.

I smiled as I opened up my present. The bracelet was nice, but I couldn't wait to see what you had for me in this one. The bag was from a designer fashion store, only the finest for me.

I open the bag and find the most sheer dress. Low cut, see through, that would barely cover my ass. I hold it up and smile. ""I'm going to look so good in this. I don't know if I should wear it for you, or for my boyfriend""

I smile and give you a hug and a deep kiss as your hands roam over my body. ""I really should be getting home. I've got a lot of homework tonight, and my boyfriend is probably going to be stopping over"" 

I pick up my things and toss them in a bag. ""I can't wait to see what you get me tomorrow""

I'd like to play this out from here. Basically you buy me nice things and I don't tell anyone that you are fucking your intern... My best friend. I've got a boyfriend, so there will be a cheating aspect. Maybe you decide to fuck me, maybe I make the move on you... Or maybe you just buy me all the nicest things because you want to keep fucking her sexy little body.

I've got no limits. A big preference will go to guys who send pics of the things they are going to buy me... Preferably more outfits :)"

So I am a veteran returning to school for a second bachelors in Civil Engineering.  I have two years remaining and my first degree was in Anthropology.  I don't have any debt from my first foray into college however this time around has been a little different as I am married with two children trying to support my family while also attending school.

This summer I have been working a full time internship which has been sufficient to make it month to month.  My wife is also going back to school for a post bacc teaching certificate.  She has a Masters in Anthropology as well (I know we have made great choices).

We will both be working part time while going to school which is about as much as we can do. I'm using the GI bill and also receive VA disability and have accepted both my subsidized and subsidized loans for the year.  My wife is at her subsidized/unsubsidized limit but is receiving a couple of scholarships which will cover her tuition.  We have trimmed all of the fat off our budget as much as possible. What I am worried about is our budget is still red by around 500-600/mo and that doesn't account for any sort of emergencies and unexpected expenses.

I have been doing as much research as I can but it seems my only logical option is to take out a private loan and make every attempt not to use the money.  Which would be better than using CC's for emergencies.  I have considered just quitting school due to the financial strain. I am not even sure what I could do that would make the efforts I have already put forward worthwhile and be financially reasonable to pay back what I have already borrowed.

I applied for scholarships but received none, my GPA is a 3.6 but there just isn't much available for a second bachelors.  My wife could be eligible for the pell grant as it is a teacher certification program, even with a masters according to what I have read but financial aid pretends like this isn't a thing after we have talked to them multiple times.

We have a home which we are renting out in another state but cannot take any money out against that as we aren't quite at 25% equity as it was originally purchased with a VA loan and a low down payment.

I am just kind of at a loss.  Is the private student loan my best and only option?"
90h0wb,9,2018-07-20,WSU Vancouver Pros/Cons,dereksurfs,vancouverwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/90h0wb/wsu_vancouver_proscons/,"Hello,

I am wondering if anyone has any experiences with WSU-V either directly or via friends, family, coworkers, etc..? If so, what are some of the pros/cons in your view? I've heard very mixed reviews online. But I would like to get the perspective from those local to the campus.

Basically, what I've heard is that while it's an ok school, it tends to be somewhat of a step-child of the main Pullman campus. Meaning it is so far removed from the main campus, its more difficult to share resources, instructors, etc... like the UW Satellites which are closer - UW Bothell and UW Tacoma. It also lacks the funding to increase needed resources including adding new undergraduate and graduate programs as well as conduct research. In addition, and probably most importantly, the school does not have as many internships or ties with local businesses which makes it harder for recent grads to find gainful employment in places like Portland.

Does anyone have any direct or indirect experiences with the school? Do you know folks who have either gone or decided not to for various reasons? I hear the campus itself is in a beautiful setting.

Thanks,

Derek"

I've been looking online to see if there's any places which offer internships in Computational Chemistry; however, I have had no success so far. I'm a chemistry major that will be graduating next Spring. I plan on taking a year off to figure out what I want to do specifically within chemistry, and Computational Chemistry is something which appeals to me, as I've recently learned Python and enjoyed coding.

Does anyone have suggestions/ideas of where to look for internships in this field? Thanks!"
90i639,38,2018-07-20,[FM] Seducing the male intern,chickrunner,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/90i639/fm_seducing_the_male_intern/,"I’m stuck in the office and am so sexually frustrated! I am almost 25 but I really miss having random sex with hot frat guys and college athletes. It is how hard to find a hook up with a sexy guy. 

I’m the office there is a 19 year old intern. He isn’t super built but is a runner and has a nice lean body. He also has incredible eyes and a sexy smile. He is quite but I know he isn’t shy. He always comes to my office throughout the day and asks me if I need anything. At the end of the day, he loosens his tie and rolls up his sleeves. I try to find excuses to rub his forearms and touch his shoulders. 

One of these days I would like to keep him after hours for a project in the copy room. When everyone leaves I will take off my bra and panties and wear my button shirt and tight skirt. As he helps me with the paper copies, I will bend over and flash my ass and shaved pussy. I will act oblivious and turn around letting him see down my shirt. I will make sure my tit is exposed as I keep squatting underneath him and pretending to pick up papers. 

I want to catch him looking at my tits and see him blush. As he tries to look away real quick, I stand up and grab him by his tie. I pull him to me and we start making out. I start rubbing the outside of his pants and feel his cock get harder. He kisses down my neck and starts opening up my shirt. When he starts licking down my boobs and starts sucking my tits I unbuckle him and pull down his fly. He isn’t wearing any underwear and his cock flops out. He is about 7inches and his dick feels thick. He is cut and I can see a little bit of precum glisten from the head of his cock. He moans as I pull on it and breathes heavy. 

I begin unbuttoning his shirt but leave the tie on him. He is tan and has a semihairy chest. I start sucking his nipples as he strokes his cock. I use my tongue to lick from his neck down to his happy trail. I unbutton his pants and they fall to the ground. His cock is so hard that it curves up a bit. I gently lick the head of his cock and let the precum moisten my lips and then rub the head of his cock on my hard tits. He oozes more precum and I start rubbing his cock between my boobs. He breathes harder and I see sweat coming down his brow. I make him sit on some boxes and start sucking the head of his cock. I use my tongue to gently lick around the head. Then I slowly suck from his head down to his shaft. His cock tastes a little salty and I can smell his testosterone. I am rubbing my clit as I suck and the smell is making me wet. After sucking and gagging on his cock for a few minutes I stop. He has trimmed pubes but smooth balls. They are pretty big and look full of tasty cum. I suck on each ball and let it roll in my mouth. I also stroke his cock and feel the precum dripping out each time I suck. 

I move my tongue down to his taint. I lick the smooth area and hear him moan louder. I also lick around his inner thighs and see his legs begin to twitch. He gets so close to cumming he has to pull my face away. He starts making out with me and picks me up. I feel is long finger inside me and he starts fingering my pussy. I get wetter and start to moan. He then picks me up and sits me on the copier. I can see the vein on his bicep bulge and more sweat from his forehead. He flashes a smile, winks at me and sticks his tongue in my pussy. I immediately get wetter and let my pussy relax. I feel his stubble rub on the outside of my pussy and start curling my toes. He keeps licking and sucking and I rub my boobs and tits telling him to nibble me. 

He complies and I force him to sit down on the boxes. He tells him he is not going to last. I hush him and tell him to fuck me as hard and long as he can. I face him and start sitting on his hard cock cowgirl. I see his eyes role back and I can feel his cock fill up my entire pussy. I gently rock back and forth and feel his cock getting thicker. I let him breath a little and then start riding him faster. As I bounce harder on his cock he grabs my boobs to keep them from bouncing. I lean forward and he begins to suck each tit. I start getting wetter and can tell he is close. I ride a little faster and start grinding my pussy forward. I squeeze my pussy and can see his eyes get big. He gasps but can’t say anything. I keep riding and can feel the warm cum fill my pussy. I keep riding and he can finally moan. I can feel him shoot inside me for over 15 seconds. 

We are exhausted and covered in sweat. He said he never came so much in his entire life. I tell him I know based on how much cum was dripping from my pussy. He immediately grabs some paper towels and helps clean me up. We get dressed and he gives me a long kiss. He tells me he we be happy to work late tomorrow. I tell him the same and head home for a nice bubble bath. 

This is something I keep fantasizing about happening at work soon. Hope you interns keep your eyes open for us horny work gals. We have a lot of stress to work off! Would love to chat with some sexy interns out there sometime 😍"
90i7z0,53,2018-07-20,"PSA: What to do if your account was hacked and/or you lost items or Robux, and how to prevent it from happening again",ScorpionGamer,roblox,https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/90i7z0/psa_what_to_do_if_your_account_was_hacked_andor/,"I've seen a lot of posts about Roblox accounts being 'hacked' and people losing thousands in Robux and items. This post is to help all those that fall victim to this and want to get their Robux/items back.

**Step 1: Recognize that you've been hacked.**

Is anything missing from your account? Robux? Limiteds? Maybe your page shows that you played a game when you know you were offline. Or maybe it'll be more obvious than that, like your password was changed.

**Step 2: Lock down your account**

Change your password,^[1](https://i.gyazo.com/58f87501f4d1974733735876c0154be6.png) enable 2-step verification, and enable the Pin.^[2](https://i.gyazo.com/f0706986bda8a2ed45ff9f6c1d1a7093.png)

Finally, sign out of all other sessions.^[3](https://i.gyazo.com/1c109436f594bd2a2ea85f97fbc85521.png)

If you have the option, add a cell number as well.


***If you did not lose items or robux, end here. If you did, continue on.***

**Step 3: Contact Roblox support**

I find that going through their help page is faster than email them directly. Go to the cog icon,^[4](https://i.gyazo.com/1820ca9a7da81b7e6c6e65ca329e69aa.png) and click ""Help"". You will then be brought to another page.^[5](https://i.gyazo.com/fa1688cbdac3350c56553a104588f400.png) Click on ""Account Security""&gt;""My account was hacked"", and scroll down to the bottom of the page to ""If you lost items or currency on your account"".^[6](https://i.gyazo.com/6d204bc80b7e0732f44337eb4baf01b3.png) Read this section thoroughly, then click their ""customer service"" link. This will bring you to their customer support form.^[7](https://i.gyazo.com/d672cbfb24b9e42798ddface62fa802a.png) Fill it out with relevant information.

**Step 4: Request an account restore**

Within a few days you should receive an email prompting you to change your password, enable 2-step verification, enable the pin, and log out of all other sessions. If you have already done this, skip those steps, and keep reading through the email. Included in the email should be steps on what to do if you lost robux and/or items. Follow those steps. When taking screenshots, go to the ""Trades"" tab, and click on ""my transactions"".^[8](https://i.gyazo.com/1595e0afaf4a70032b4946ff4bd89e8b.png) If you had Robux stolen, it will likely be through the hacker buying a t-shirt with the exact amount of Robux you had. Take a screenshot of your trade history, and *underline* the unauthorized transaction using a paint program (paint-dot-net is my favourite, but MS Paint works too). Attach the edited screenshot to the email. Also provide the link to wherever your Robux went; Someone made the t-shirt, whether it was a group or a single player. Your transaction history will have a link to it. Add it into your email.

If you lost items, it's a bit less likely you'll be able to get them back, just with how difficult it is to track them down. But not impossible! 

Go into your ""Trade"" tab again, but this time click ""Trade Items"" and set the dropdown menu to ""completed"".^[9](https://i.gyazo.com/2b82460e37da6179c956086e79f2520b.png) Here you will see a list of all the trades that occurred from your account. Screenshot all the unauthorized trades, underlinethem, and include that in your email. Next, click on the ""view details"" button on each unauthorized trade, and screenshot the trade details.^[10](https://gyazo.com/a04182b1b137f228f452e14dc1107afa.png) If you hover over each item, some may show a serial number. Screenshot all the serial numbers you can, and send those too. The more details, the better.

Once done, send the email, including any explanations you feel are necessary, and wait. If all goes well, you should receive an email saying your Robux and/or items have been restored.

**Please note: You are only entitled to *one* account restore per email, and *only* if you submit a ticket within 14 days of the incident**


**How to prevent it from happening again**

The roblox account restore is a one-time thing, so if it happens again, you're screwed. You can't get those robux back. Here's how to prevent that from happening.

1) Make sure you have a strong password. Make sure it is, at the *very least*, 10 characters long. Also include a mix of upper and lower case, numbers, and 'special' characters (,./!@#$%^&amp;* etc). Your password doesn't have to be 47 characters long, and a quote from some poem^SubtleReference(TM) , but it should be strong enough that it can't be guessed, or brute-forced.

2) Make sure 2-step verification is enabled

3) Make sure the pin is enabled. And don't use something stupidly easy to guess, like ""0000"", or ""1234"". You have a choice of 10^4 different combinations.

4) Make sure your email hasn't been hacked. You can use the site https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see if your email was leaked. It will tell you if it has, and also if the password was leaked as well. If the password has not been leaked, you're probably fine, but I would suggest changing your email password anyways, just in case.

5) Don't download any shady Roblox-related browser extensions. Roblox+ is ok, but not much else is. It should also be noted that there is apparently a Roblox+ V. 2.0. That will hack your account. Make sure you use the real Roblox+ if you wish to use it at all. If you're unsure whether an extension is malicious or not, it's probably best not to download it.

6) Don't download any roblox-related third-party software (again, with the exception of the real Roblox+) if you're not sure whther it's malicious or not, *especially* those ""free robux generators"".

7) There's a scam/hacking technique going around that has you take a screenshot of something in 'Inspect Element'.^[11](https://i.gyazo.com/0a8b0b0f068d4adf498af48fad49ec0a.png) Usually these hackers pose as Roblox admins, or ""interns"", and say they need to make sure you still own your account. Simply ~~delete~~ archive their message, and forget about it.

8) Don't share your password. Ever. It should be common sense, but it has to be said anyways.

**End of PSA**

If there is anything else you would like to point out, please comment it. I will be pasting this link for anyone who posts about getting their account hacked, so I want it to be as correct and up-to-date as possible."
90if6h,0,2018-07-20,Did I [23F] Start Dating My Boyfriend [28M] Too Soon?,encomiumpilot,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/90if6h/did_i_23f_start_dating_my_boyfriend_28m_too_soon/,"Recently, I took my boyfriend home to meet my dad for the first time. I've been seeing bf for almost a year, and I'm really happy with him. We've been friends for about 4 years, and to me, it just makes sense that we got together. Anyway, a couple days after leaving my dad's place, he calls me and tells me he doesn't like my bf. My dad thinks that I started seeing him too soon after my last relationship and he thinks this is just a rebound situation. He said my bf is too shy for almost being 30, he thinks he's rude, entitled, etc. Apparently he got all of this just from spending two days with him... I'm honestly shocked because my dad and I have always been really close and he's always welcomed all of my boyfriends, friends, whoever he meets because of me. But he was rather rude to my bf while we were there (didn't talk to him much/didn't try to get to know him)

To give some background from my previous relationship, I was with a guy from 2014 - 2016 (2017 ish?). We had known each other since we were both 14 and we were very close in high school. We were kind of on/off throughout college though. Most likely due to long distance (went to schools in different states). We broke up in the summer of 2016 and I was devastated. I probably laid around wallowing for at least a month straight. He was my first real love, so it hit hard. Later on, I got an internship in his state that I planned on doing throughout my Spring semester of college. We probably shouldn't have tried again, but we ended up kind of seeing each other shortly from December - January ('17). I think we were both just curious to see if the relationship would work out in close proximity. But we decided that it wasn't going to work out. For me personally, I didn't feel the same way about him after the break up in the summer (hurt me too much and that's all I could think about). The spark just wasn't there anymore. I think we fooled around a bit until February. But our romantic relationship was completely ended by early February of 2017.

Fast forward a couple months, I came home around May. I started hanging out with my friends a ton, esp my bf (although we weren't dating yet). He was going through a hard time, so I tried my best to cheer him up, take him out, check up on him, etc. Then come June, was the first time he kissed me and confessed feelings. I wasn't entirely sure if I was ready for a relationship yet. But we still hung out a bunch and were kind of casually seeing each other. Then in September is when we became ""official"". Something just told me that I had to try and see where this goes. Obviously, it's been over a year later, we're still together and we're both very happy. However, I'm just dumbfounded that my biggest support (my dad) is so against my bf. The amount of times he told me that he thinks my new bf is a rebound for my old one is getting to me and making me wonder if it's true? Feelings wise, I don't think it is. Anxiety wise, my head is all over the place lol. I'm really bummed out that he doesn't trust my judgment on someone who's been really great to me, even before we started dating. Does anyone have any advice? Should I just ignore my dad's judgments/opinions? Or is he possibly right? Any opinion/advice is appreciated! 

TL/DR: my dad hates my new bf, thinks he's just my rebound from my previous ex. Time in between relationships: roughly 6-7 months? Did I start dating my new bf too soon after my ex bf?"

90iygq,4,2018-07-20,7 Essential Interview Questions to Prepare For,pushfar,Career,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career/comments/90iygq/7_essential_interview_questions_to_prepare_for/,"Interviews can be nerve-wracking moments, you never know exactly what to expect, could it just be basic info about you or might they ask you how to put a giraffe in a fridge. That’s why we’ve put together a list of 7 questions you should be prepared for, along with a little help.

1. **What are your strengths?**  
This is definitely something you should prepare for and the best way is to sit down and start brainstorming or asking people who know you well. You don’t want to be vague or play yourself down, be confident in what you say and make sure it’s relevant. Also, always try to give some reasoning or examples of your strengths in action.
2. **What are your weaknesses?**  
For this, we would suggest finding something which you are working to improve. Maybe you’re nervous about public speaking and presentations, as many people are, then also mention the fact that you’ve attended many Ted talks, signed up for a public speaking course, entered lecture competitions or even applied to give a Ted talk yourself. They love to see that you realise it’s a weakness and are doing what you can to change it to a strength. Alternatively, tell them about a weakness that can be played as a strength. Maybe you can be too determined, “I almost died because I was so determined to swim 5 laps underwater.”
3. **Give an example of you working in a team.**  
This is a crucial question as they want to see how you might fit into the company. Try and give recent examples as this shows you best, maybe you had an internship where you were working alongside 4 others and needed to come up with solutions to difficult situations. It’s important to show how you took the lead, but just as important showing that you’re able to listen to others and collate the ideas. Try setting it out well by starting with the situation, how you handled it and finally what you learnt.
4. **What is your greatest achievement to date?**  
This is your chance to really show yourself off, so make sure you’re both prepared and comfortable bragging about yourself. It’s best to prepare several different stories which you can tell that are interesting, impressive and relevant to the position you’re applying for. As above, when telling the story, the STAR approach is a good structure. You start with the situation/task, followed by the approach you took, and finally the result.
5. **How would your best friend describe you in 3 words?**  
The best way to find some answers to this is to ask your friend and family how they would describe you in 3 words. Write down what they say and then pick your favourite three, while keeping them relevant. Try avoiding things like bright and perfectionist, while words like loyal and selfless go down well.
6. **Why do you want to work for us?**  
You should already have thought about this while you were applying for the job, otherwise you probably wouldn’t have applied in the first place. Do some research about the company, do they offer interesting staff benefits and have high satisfaction levels? If you can, try asking someone who works there and ask why they enjoy their job. Don’t say things like, I like the salary, or I saw there were open positions, as this won’t make you seem interesting. Try and find some recently published articles of theirs which you can talk about. Bringing up that you read something which focused on women in STEM and it really motivated you to do well in your degree and now you would love to join them, this can only go down well.
7. **Why are you looking to leave your current roll?**  
Be honest and look at how your new job would be different, if your new job would require you to work 9-5, sitting behind a desk at a computer, don’t give this as a reason if it was why you left your previous position. Did your old job not feel challenging enough or do you think they were holding you off from your potential? Maybe your new position would give you an opportunity to show yourself off, use the skills which you’ve learnt and make more of an impact.

You can prepare yourself for an interview by reading through articles or giving yourself a mock interview, so you have all the answers you might like prepared, but the best way is to find a tutor who gives you a new unbiased view and has been through many an interview.

90j0p2,29,2018-07-20,Afraid of new inbox messages. Does it end?,Downthedrain747382,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/90j0p2/afraid_of_new_inbox_messages_does_it_end/,"I am writing this to vent, I don’t know how to verbalize everything to people. I have a therapist, but I’m too ashamed to share everything.   
   
.


Perhaps prefacing my past would give context. I was sexually abused by an older man throughout pre-teen and teenage years. My parents are distant, and I have no close immediate family (no siblings). My sense of trust an is probably off.   
   


.

8-9 months ago I found out my (ex)BF had been cheating on me for 5 out of 6 years of our relationship. With multiple women who were my ‘friends’, that I introduced him too. At the time, I was just entering grad school.   
  
.


I found out because one woman messaged me on FB. She said she was sorry, but that while knowing I was with my ex she met up with him multiple times, messing around with him, often having orgys. He would take her and other women (who I knew) on vacation, even going abroad. She had pictures from some of them. She told me the approximate dates, number of women, and locations. Times include my birthday (the year he forgot about it), the week I began college, while I drove his car across multiple states to be helpful. Their deal was he would fund things for her and others, if they kept quiet to me. She told me he had similar arrangements with others, giving specific names.   
  

.

I checked the second woman’s FB, and found public pictures from 2013 of them in Vegas. The pictures included multiple of my friends. A FB post indicated the girls had wanted to go to Vegas, contacted my ex, and within 48 hours were there together.   
  

.

About two weeks after that 2013 trip, my ex told me I needed to loose weight because I was fat. To put in context, I’m 5’8” and 120 lb. at the time, I was MAYBE 135lb, not skinny, but not obese. For the years after, Whenever we saw eachother he would subtlely comment on my weight (“your so skinny! I like it!” Or “a bit pudgy!” While sequeezing my hip).   
  

.

Hindsight I knew something was fucked in 2015. I had an internship in another city and became friends with an awesome chick. One night my ex, her and I went out to party and got super hammered. We were in the same room, separate beds. She was asleep. My ex wanted drunk sex with me but I was too messed up to get in to it. My memory is barely there, but I remember him getting up and going to the side of her bed. Then my memory is blank. A few days later she said that night she woke up to my BF trying to get with her. She told him to fuck off and he did. I confronted him, and he said she was attention seeking and ‘he didn’t want to deal with that situation’. He advised me to fake be friends with her for the summer and then drop her. I was devastated but believed him over her, so I did what he said.    
  
.


Also in 2015 (before the above), my ex and I went to a nice dinner and drinks the night before traveling to our home city. I met some girls that were super fun, I ended up getting really drunk - more so then everyone else. One of the girls suggested a foursome, and I was totally in to it. When we got back to the room, though, the girl and my BF had sex while the other girl sat guarded, super not in to it. I tried to engage her, but she wasn’t feeling it. When I tried to turn attention towards the BF/other chick, they ignored me and pushed me away. I went to the bathroom and cried. Eventually ex came into bathroom asking what was wrong and that I was upsetting the other girls. I was drunk and hysterical. I calmed down after a while and we had to leave for travel. I was hungover throwing up the entire way back. When we got back to our city, he told me I should have handled it better, stormed off at the station, and I went home alone.    
  

.

On the other hand, we had great times together - at least they felt great. We used to go to movies, cook dinner, go to fairs, walks on beach, watch bad tv shows together... sometimes we would sing songs and learn every word together. I thoroughly enjoyed his company and thought he liked me too. He told me he loved me. A long time ago, he would treat me so well. He was so kind, giving, and loving.    
  

.  

I confronted him via phone call when I found out. He denied and denied at first. Then finally said “ive done some things you shouldn’t do in a relationship. I’ve held on to you for too long” and dumped me.   
  
.  


The next few weeks I was a mess. I could not function. I’m surprised I made it through winter.    
  

.  

The whole time, though, I was speaking with my ex. He never admit what he did, but would listen and talk to me. At first He said he could not give me a good reason, and said it was so long ago it shouldn’t matter.    
  
.  


We decided to reconcile. We spent New Years together. The time felt so wonderful and open, we were actually communicating again. We talked about even the bad things, but felt like a team. We talked more than we had in ages. The morning I was leaving, I had an anxiety attack. That was the last time I saw him physically.    
  

.  

A few weeks later he said I should be over it already, it was so long ago. He didn’t want me, just wanted to be friends. I was heartbroken again. We continued to support eachother emotionally. he still never came forward with details or any truth.    
  

.  

That’s been our reality for the past 6 months. He doesn’t want me but has helped try and support my healing. He has genuinely apologized, and takes blame for cheating.    
  

.  

I’ve started therapy, new hobbies, moved. I saw he started to change as well. 
Over a month ago, we were talking on the phone. He accidentally said he loved me.     
  

.  

Two weeks ago, we talked about what he said. He said it was a Freudian slip. I said I needed space.    

  
.  

About a week ago, another woman sent me a message on FB with new details. Previously, ex said nothing happened with her. He had denied details that she gave me.    
  


.  
I’m feeling sick to my stomach all over again. I would rather know the truth from him than get messages from random women. I feel so worthless and disrespected. I know the information will hurt, but it will be easier to hear it from him than someone else. I don’t want to be afraid of opening my message box.    
  


.  

 I feel like giving up on myself. I’m so ashamed that for over half my life men lie to me, use me, and don’t care about me at all.    
  

.  



Thanks for reading this. I’m not sure what I’m looking for, support I suppose. Thank you for giving me a voice.

90jbta,4,2018-07-20,[RF] Bad Decisions,Bohler-Books,shortstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/90jbta/rf_bad_decisions/,"Have you ever felt like every decision you’ve ever made was wrong? Like literally every one of the millions of microdecisions you make every day is somehow always the worst possible choice?

I have. 

I’ve pondered the concept that for every decision anyone has ever made, a new universe is born for each possible choice. I’ve contemplated that I might be the unlucky bastard that is stuck in the one universe in which my choice is always wrong. Someone has to be that guy, right? Every story has some basis in truth, even the story of Job. 

I felt like I might actually be the unluckiest man in the universe, until last Friday.

See, I’m a Trucker, it’s the latest in a string of jobs that each ended in a bad decision. I never thought this is where I’d be. 

My first car got totaled by a distracted driver that rear ended me while I was stopped at a red light. It was less than a mile after I fueled that car for the very first time. 

At my first job, the company shut down unexpectedly a month and a half after I started. 

After a few more jobs, I decided to get a degree. I went to a technical school that got shut down a month before I was set to graduate because the degrees were worthless and the credits wouldn’t transfer. 

Then I got a job selling cars. The dealership I worked at had major road construction all around it, and traffic was super low. I wasn’t able to make any money, and had to find something else. 

I got into a job that was pretty much just physical labor, and I did well in it. I made decent money, as was able to build up some savings. 

Have you heard of Bernie Madoff? Yeah, I got in on that sweet deal, and lost everything. 

Then I had some back problems that made it so I couldn’t work; at least not in my current job.

I decided to go back to school. I made sure it was a good school this time. I took what little savings I had left, and took out massive student loans, and started on my degree. I was very careful to pick a field that everybody said was booming, and that would definitely be a useful degree.

I met a girl in my first semester, and we fell in love. Things were looking up. 

In the end of our Junior year, she got pregnant. She chose to leave school to take care of the baby; I was going to take care of all three of us when I graduated and got a good job. I was never able to land an internship, and after graduation, I couldn’t get a job in my field. Everybody wanted many years of experience.

The only work I could get was the same crap that I could get before college, working way too much to earn way too little. 

I got my bartender’s license, so that I could at least approximate decent money, and I landed a gig at this small bar downtown. I wasn’t making enough to support us, but I was at least making enough that we were going into debt very slowly. Well, I was, until the place got shut down for serving minors. 

Over the next few weeks, I applied basically every place; I never heard back. My wife got tired of being broke and left me; she took our son to go live with her sister and said she wasn’t coming back. 

So there I was, jobless, broke, and alone. That’s when I decided to get my CDL. Might as well. That actually might have been the first good decision I ever made. Don’t get me wrong; I still made plenty of bad decisions. I got stupid tickets that were easily avoided, I wound up losing money because I took a wrong turn. I even got mugged one time because I was trying to help out a god damned hitch-hiker. But you know what? I have a place to sleep every night, in my truck, and I have steady income. Anyway, that brings us back to last Friday. 

Last Friday was the first time I decided to stop here. I’ve come through this part of flyover country at least half a dozen times, but I’ve never stopped here until that day. It just kinda worked out. I needed to do my 36 hour reset, that’s when federal law requires a trucker to take at least 36 consecutive hours off duty if they’ve been working too many hours lately, and I figured this would be a good place to do it. After all, it’s nice to sleep in a motel once in a while, and take a shower without having to take a number in a truck stop. 

So anyway, it was like 4:30 in the morning when I decided to stop here for my reset. I figured they’d make me pay for an extra night, since I wanted to get to bed pretty soon and check in probably wasn’t until the afternoon, but it didn’t seem like an expensive motel, so I thought it would be worth it. 

I grabbed breakfast here at [Jo's Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/bohler-books), an omelette and a piece of Orange Whiskey cheesecake that was just amazing, and then I checked into the motel. The lady that checked me in was kinda awesome; she said since they had an open room, she was just going to check me in early for that night, so I’d only have to pay the one night. See, it was 5 am on the 13th, so 24 hours would be 5 am on the 14th, and another 12 would put me getting back on the road at 5 pm on the 14th. It couldn’t have worked out better - spending an entire 36 hour reset in a motel room, and only paying for 1 night! 

And it’s the damnedest thing! See, ever since then - and yeah, it’s only been a week, but for me, that’s pretty much forever - I haven’t had a single thing go wrong. 

So, Jo, I’m sorry for rambling, but this note was really just to say thank you. I don’t know how or why you did it, or even if you really had anything to do with it at all, but it seems to me like your little act of kindness has turned my life around, and brought my endless cycle of bad decisions to an end."

But I finally got that entry level IT job I been searching for since graduation a year and a half ago. It's cool, small company with about 100 users across a few states and a great learning environment almost like on the job training. However, I can't help but to think that I don't share the same passion that I read from other people's posts. Studying for certs, while the information is interesting, its not enjoyable an I find it more of like a chore that I have to do to get better. I just think that drive should come natural and be something ""you want to do"" instead of ""something you should do"". I also studied engineering for 3 years in college before getting an internship and quickly realizing this is not what I what to do. I've been taught all my life to peruse something technical, hence my education and potential career choices, but I'd rather pick something up and move it. I jump at any activity that involves being active or require some kind of labor. The big 30 is creeping up in a few years and I want to make a decision sooner than later. I'm not sure if I should take a leap of faith and do something something I think i'm naturally better suited for or be like so many other people and do a job just to pay the bills. Stress and anxiety have really started an i'm only in an entry level support position. The current low pay is the stress and the anxiety is the unknown future of to do and how much to do to get where. I liked helping people with their computer issues but this doesn't

90jxqt,6,2018-07-20,"I thought things were getting better, but Nmom just showed me she hasn't changed.",jessicaat123,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/90jxqt/i_thought_things_were_getting_better_but_nmom/,"So, recently, my relationship with my mother has been okay. We call and talk every few days, I'm living 3 hours away, and we haven't had any arguments.

Stuff happened though, and I might not be getting scholarships for college this coming semester because of tax/FAFSA issues, so I probably won't even be going. My mom was actually really helpful in trying to get everything sorted out, but I probably won't be able to get stuff submitted on time.

Literally THE NEXT DAY after I found all that out, she calls me to ""make sure I didn't think everything was fine"" and ask about what my plan B is. I don't have a plan B, it hasn't even been 24 hours since I discovered I might not be going to school. And why the hell would she think I thought everything was fine?

I told her that I'll probably try applying for internships, but I'm not very likely to get one because of my lack of experience. Plus, I switched majors and haven't taken any classes in my new major yet. I said if that happens I'll just work full time somewhere else. The pay might be less, but I'd manage.

She told me ""If you can't get an internship then you'll have to come back home and live here, you can't just work full time at a grocery store."" This is literally the same argument that we had before I moved out in the first place. I was questioning the abuse for a while since she had been nice, but now I realize she hasn't changed at all. I guess I'll have to prepare for another argument in like a month... but at least I'm already moved out.

I put together a budget too, and I CALCULATED that I would be able to afford rent and food if I worked full time at my current job. I would also be able to pay for my insurance and phone bill, which my parents pay for now. It's given me some peace of mind that I can, in fact, survive without them :)"

We all went to different colleges but still chatted when we could and hang out a ton whenever we're back in our hometown. There's about 20 of us, and of course we all have varying degrees of closeness with everyone else, but in general, there's a group of about five people that serve as the group's center (e.g. events are usually at our houses), since we were friends with each other first and sort of brought others in after. This central group of five includes me (became friends at 15, now 22) and ""Ben"" (became friends at 17, now 24). 

As will happen in groups of friends like this, a few couples have formed over the years. Some are still together, some have broken up, it's awkward for a bit but we've always managed to deal with the fallout.

Until now, of course.

Ben has been dating ""Emma,"" (21F) who is one of the people I brought into the friend group when she was 16 and I was 17. They had feelings for each other for a long time (4+ years), and finally, much to the relief of the rest of us, got together about eight months ago. It went really, really well for a time. They had so much fun together and really brought out the best in each other. Emma is still in college away from our hometown, so they had to deal with a LDR about 50% of the time, but managed that well enough (Ben does a lot of travel for work and could make excuses to see her a lot). 

About two months ago they hit a rough patch over communication issues (specifically, Ben not initiating conversations) and broke up. We were all really surprised because the issue seemed really minor, and they were usually good at figuring out small disagreements--but we also know that Ben folds very easily in high-pressure situations, and at one point during their chat Emma had said something like ""Maybe we should break up""--a mistake on her part--and he panicked and took that as a definite. They were both super upset about it, we all encouraged them to take some time to themselves and secretly suspected they might get back together again.

A month ago, they did. Kind of. Ben invited Emma over and they had a heart-to-heart. He said he understood how much his communication issues had been affecting her, said he tended to be a bit closed-off but didn't want to be that to her, emphasized how he had never been that close to anyone (which as an outsider--seems true. He tends to keep to himself.), and decided that he was going to make a plan of calling her once a day and initiating conversation more often. She was happy, he was happy, friends were happy, and she went back to school for a month-long internship.

He never contacted her again. Not the next day. Not the next week. Not the next several weeks. And still hasn't. 

He very clearly stalks her Instagram (accidentally liked and then unliked one of her photos--she blocked him when she realized) and views her Snap story, but avoids groupchats that she's in, and about ten days after their heart-to-heart we overheard him telling one of our group member's parents that he wasn't in a relationship.

She's devastated, but picking up the pieces. She never reached out either, and just wants to forget. I'm horrified that someone I thought was nice could do something so callous. He also has said NOTHING to the rest of us about Emma, or about the relationship. I think what he did is unspeakably cruel, and I'm undoubtedly on Emma's side, as is everyone else in the friend group who knows what's going on. Ben has dealt with depression and anxiety for a lot of his life, which is what I kinda assumed this ghosting stemmed from, but it's certainly not an excuse.

I guess what I'm wondering is, what's my course of action now? Emma asked me not to talk to Ben about what happened, even though I'm itching to confront him. Is this something where I should end my friendship with him, or at least cut contact down a lot? Should I take a more compassionate angle and check in with him about mental health, even though I know he's private and we don't really have that kind of friendship? I haven't seen him for a while but I know I will soon, and I can't imagine acting like everything is normal. And what does this mean for our friend group? Does he get cut out from events? It's so messy and complicated, and I just wanted an outside perspective on what I can do--if anything.

**TL;DR: One of my friends completely stopped talking to his girlfriend after a six-month relationship, right after having pledged to communicate better with her. I've been friends with him for a while but am also close with her, and am wondering what my best course of action is.**"

Hello all, I don't know if this is the right place to post this but : it is going to be a very long post. (TL;DR at the end)

I have always been close to my sister, we were always together and I’ve always thought we had a good relationship. But last year I moved away (for reasons I will explain later), things are different ever since and I began to realize things never really were that good.

First, let me introduce us. I’m 26 and my sister is 28 but people always think I am the big sister, and I have to admit I do feel that way too.

When I was a kid I remember we were really close but there where times when she would make fun of me endlessly until I had to be violent, that is when she would go to our parents and say I was mean to her. I remember when I was a kid I had an important allergic reaction, my whole body and face doubled in volume. It was traumatizing cause I couldn’t breathe and I thought I was dying. It took me weeks to go back to normal. During that time, she insistently called me fat, ugly and a « potato head » (which I know sounds stupid, but as a kid, and because of the circumstances, I didn’t like being told I looked like a potato), I think this traumatized me to some extent because I’ve had really unhealthy eating habits since that I am still working on today.

Once, she showed me messages exchanged with a friend of mine (she kind of had a crush on him) and I saw that she said bad things about me (again, that I was « mean »). This made me wonder what else she could have told other friends we had in common. During our teen years we didn’t fight a lot but it was always about the same things : she stole my clothes and I never managed to make her understand I took it as a lack of respect. Now, I have to say that she and I are completely different. I’m introverted when she is more sociable, I prefer to have a small circle of great friends when she can not stand to be alone, I’m responsible and she can be... forgetful, I always was a good student when she had to repeat a grade (making things so that she ended up being at the same level that I was in high-school). Overall I feel like my parents put more pressure on me because I always had to be the bigger person and was « expected » to succeed/be wise/understanding...etc When we were preparing for our A-levels, my mom put us in so much pressure that I cried, later that day she went to my room to apologized and said that she was actually worried my sister wouldn’t get the exam so she was giving both of us a hard time to avoid being hard on my sister only. It made me feel like shit for my sister and even more pressured to get my exam. After that I went to a different city for studies that actually weren’t good for me and ditched two years later. I went back to my parents for a year and the feeling of failure made me feel really low, I felt very depressed for a year which my parents never understood. Around this time, my sister came back home for a few days, she was living in London and told me to come with her. As I was feeling useless here, I accepted. In London I slowly managed to turn things around, decided to study again and got my Degree there. If living with my sister was fine at first, it got more and more difficult.

The first year of my studies, I didn’t have a job (new studies, foreign language, I wanted to focus on that) but my parents gave me enough money to survive the month. She would insist I come party with her, saying she’d buy me drinks but she would always bring that up anytime we argued saying she payed for everything and was doing everything. The second year I struggled to find a part-time job and she made me feel like shit for it until I found a stable job.

Overall, I was the one in contact with agencies that rented us the different places we lived in. When signing the contracts, the full responsibility was mine, when it went badly with the realtors I had to take care of it myself as she claimed to « not understand these things ». Same for the bills, providers and broadband. If we had any issue, I automatically was the one who had to call. I managed to take a few things off my shoulders when we rented the last flat we lived together in: I only gave my sister’s contact to the landlady. She was always late paying her taxes and one time she got a trial because she ignored the warning letters even I told her she needed to take care of that. Guess who had to go to the Council and fix it ? In spite of all of this, she would sometimes complain that I was a burden and she was taking care of everything, the only one cooking or the only one cleaning... totally not acknowledging what I was doing or that I had work to do too. I forgot to tell you: we were sharing a one bedroom flat. Most of the time I would sleep on the couch in the living-room when I wanted more privacy, but there was always a point when I would miss sleeping in a bed. My sister, also always invited people to sleep over at our place. Once, she went out and I stayed at home as I had to go to Uni in the morning. She came back late with a bunch of people, came in my bedroom with a girl and told her she could sleep in the bed with me and the others would sleep on the couch. I was just shocked and really mad ! That night I told her her behavior was not okay and I didn’t feel respected. I made her promise this would never happen again. But she kept inviting people over, and hosting friends who came from abroad all the time even though we didn’t even each have our own space. She kept doing it and I kept accepting it for a while until I was fed up again but she wouldn’t hear me. We fought more often about this and her overall disrespect. She would often retort I wasn’t easy to live with either and when I asked her to tell me what I was doing wrong so I could change it and make her feel better she would say she doesn’t have an exemple in mind. One time she said she didn’t like the fact I left my empty glass on the table.

Around that time last year, I was sick as hell and as she was gonna go out that day I told her I didn't want to contaminate her and I'd be sleeping on the couch. She rang at the door at 3 in the morning because she forgot her keys (because, yeah, this happened from time to time also...). She had also brought a friend of hers who didn’t want to take the bus home. At this point it was really too much (we had different people over for months, she was basically treating me as if I was an appliance in her flat), I was tired of having the same conversation over and over, so the next morning I told her we needed to have rules : we don’t tell people they can stay over until we both have our own room and we try to be considerate to our roommate. She said I was being annoying for always bringing up something that happened one time two years ago (referring to the first incident when she brought a girl in my bed in the middle of the night) and that what we really needed was bunk beds (where did that even come from ?).

My sister only ever says sorry this way when I confront her really hard about being disrespectful to me and this time added she can’t change the way she is anyway. That’s when I realized she really didn’t give a shit about me or my wellbeing. Following this conversation, she avoided me for days. I was the sickest I had ever been (didn’t even go to work) and I was staying on the couch all day, when she came back home she would go straight to the bedroom. When I started to feel better, I went to the bedroom while she was at work and found empty snack bags (going to the kitchen would mean she had to see me, so potentially talk to me). When she got back home, I told her this needed to stop, she said I was the one ignoring her. I said it was crazy how she could never admit her wrongs and she didn’t give a shit about me, cause if she did she would have checked on me when I was sick or at least asked how I was feeling. Again she said « well, sorry I’m that way » to which I replied didn’t mean anything if she wasn’t doing anything to make things better. I told her I was tired and afraid I might end up hating her if she kept doing this to me and I really don’t want that.

A few days before, I had received an offer for an internship back in my hometown, considering the situation I felt like nothing was holding me back in London. I accepted but only announced it to my sister about a week later saying I was out of here by the end of the next month. Once when we were out with friends, she said (in front of me this time) that I was mean and I never let her do anything. It was around that time she also met a guy on Tinder and things got moving pretty fast. One morning, I was falling asleep (I had worked the night shift) when I heard someone come home. I knew it wasn’t my sister because she was at work. I heard footsteps and started to get scared, so I went to the bedroom door and asked who was here. It was her new boyfriend and he had a few boxes with him, it looked like he was moving in. I was puzzled but didn’t say anything as I thought my sister would have told me if a guy I didn’t know was moving in. Anyway, the next time I saw my sister (different working hours) the guy was still home so I took her aside and asked what was going on :

Me: What’s happening, is he living here ?

Her: I don’t knoooooow... like

Me: Well, I think it’s simple. Either you told him he could move in or he decided he could. Now you need to tell me which is which so I can react accordingly.

Same answer from her: she doesn’t « knooooow ». At this point I just go silent, there’s nothing more to say or do and I know I’m moving out in a week anyway. She came to talk to me a few days later saying she wanted to talk to me. She asked what was wrong because she felt like I didn’t like her boyfriend. I told her the problem was her, not him and we already talked about it but she just ignored it. She basically ignored it every time I tried to ask her to be more considerate.

Since I moved out, I’m so relieved and I feel like a huge burden has been taken off my shoulders. I wasn’t feeling like myself anymore, I think my sister’s behavior forced me to be more serious and responsable, I had to give her attention and support her all the time and fix her mistakes when I felt like I was on my own. Now I feel like I can have more fun and focus on me. The only problem is that I still love her, she's my sister and we did have good times but she pushed me to the edge and now I feel resentment to the point that I sometimes want to be mean or belittle her. I know it’s petty, and I know I shouldn’t but something between us broke before my moving out. I don’t want to hate her, I know we are better off apart, that’s for sure, but our family is still very close and I’m scared this whole thing will destroy us. It's been a year I moved out and when she visited recently I was surprised that I still feel anger. I don’t know how to make things better or if it’s even possible. Maybe I need therapy.

Thank you for reading and any advice or suggestion is welcome.

TD;LR: After three years living in a one bedroom flat with my sister, I realized our relationship is not perfect but toxic. Even though I love her, one year after I moved away in bad terms I still resent her for treating me the way she did. My family is close and I'm scared to destroy us all for something that should be in the past."
90l06d,835,2018-07-20,Woeful Wendy got mad when I did what she asked.,Libida,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/90l06d/woeful_wendy_got_mad_when_i_did_what_she_asked/,"This story takes place a few years ago. We are still NC with her, FIL (Storyterller on justnoFIL) and SIL1 (Trelawney on justnofamily).

After the birth of First I did not like Wendy at all. But I had no problem with FIL. I'd seen bits of his crazy but I had also seen many moments of a man trying so hard to overcome his illness. That I can respect and work with so we didn't have an issue. This was also before the Great Family Shitstorm where I learned about his abusive past.

SIL2 was on the other side of the country on an internship and was coming home. Wendy was going to fly out to her and they would drive home. They plotted a route for site seeing so it'd take them about a week. FIL did not want to go because he couldn't handle being cooped up in a car for that long. Wendy of course went around telling everyone how concerned she was for him. He could barely take care of himself. During a few of our visits she kept stressing to u/Faux_the_penix how he needed to drop by and see how FIL was. She just didn't have anyone else to rely on and they were family. At this time I believed this. FIL definitely came across as fragile in many of our visits. 

I asked Faux if he planned on seeing his dad at all to check in. He said no. He said FIL would be fine. He didn't want to go out of his way to go visit him on his drive home from work. Which I was more than understanding of. Faux didn't owe his dad or mom any of this. I figured he just felt overwhelmed. Faux didn't convey what Wendy was like so I didn't know what utter bullshit this was. In hindsight, he should have relayed this information to me and I wouldn't have gone. However, I didn't know and I worked three minutes from their home I decided to stop by after work. It did cut into our routine but I'm good with being flexible if someone is in need. 

I showed up with First and FIL happily greeted us. He got some toys for First to play with. We talked and as the visit went on it appeared he was totally fine. There was no need to worry about him at all. I stopped by once more and he was still doing just fine. It was clear what Wendy was doing when she was pestering Faux. Just more manipulation.

When SIL2 and Wendy arrived home they had a party. Or should I say Wendy made FIL have one for them. SIL2 had been gone all summer so we all got to see her again. Since they were running behind too they arrived about a half hour after the party started. When they pulled in it was the usually pleasantries. It was an enjoyable party. 

Then FIL made a comment to Wendy about how I had stopped by to visit. He mentioned how cute First was with a particular toy. Wendy face went from ""oh look at me being admired by all the people who missed me"" to serious/pissed off. She turned and glared at me. I ignored this because again, I really fucking hated her and didn't give a shit if she was mad and made another comment about how much First loved the toy. Soon after Wendy found a way to be alone with me and asked why I had visited. I told her she had asked for someone to drop by and check on FIL. She said she asked Faux too. I said, and I sincerely meant this, that Faux couldn't find time so I did. As Faux's family he could rely on me to help him. Wendy looked like she wanted to claw my eyes out. I had no idea my honesty was such an effective MIlimination tool. She then said she wanted to have two visits to make up for the visits she missed. I said I needed to discuss plans with Faux first and I'd let her know. Then I walked away.

The funny part was she tried to get people to be mad at me for it. Unfortunately it was all FILs family and they thought I was being very good to both Faux and FIL. It was fun watching her turn her own homecoming party go sour for her. As well I got the bonus of being praised for being caring and kind. "
90l4nl,16,2018-07-20,Looking for a bandwidth/capacity calculation tool,Rob729,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/90l4nl/looking_for_a_bandwidthcapacity_calculation_tool/,It seems as though I’m in the right subreddit to ask this question but if not please guide me to the right one. I am currently in the military and have taken advantage of a program that allows me to intern for a local company 6 months prior to my retirement. I am learning the intricacies of being an RF Transport Engineer and am looking for some type of tool that would calculate network bandwidth across my microwave shots. The idea would be that if I increase bandwidth on a link I would like to know how it affects bandwidth on my other microwave links in succession so to know if I could add customers to the original link. Or better yet it could turn “yellow” or “red” to show that I am reaching capacity on my further links before reaching the drain. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
90l5d8,1,2018-07-20,22 And Making Some Of The Bigger Adult Decisions In My Life,Crogers16,TrueChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/90l5d8/22_and_making_some_of_the_bigger_adult_decisions/,"I am a 22 year old guy and I'm having a hard time with one of the bigger decisions I've had to make for quite a while. It may not seem big, but to me it's difficult and I'm looking for guidance. For the past 2 years I've been working in recreation ministry and after these 2 years I genuinely feel that God has called me to follow this path as a career. I am also employed as an intern at my church to run Audio/Visual things and I LOVE the technical side of things, but I feel that it is more of a hobby.

In a couple months, my pastor has encouraged me to go to a worship conference where they will teach all about the audio/visual aspects of leading worship from behind the scenes. He asked me to call my boss in recreation ministry and ask for the time off (about 4 days). This would be the only vacation I would take all year so I didn't think it was much of a big deal. When I called me boss, he surprised me and didn't say he was going to give me permission. Instead, he insisted that I make the decision on my own. When he said this it really impacted me that he trusts me enough to make the decision and find someone to cover my job for a few days. However, he also mentioned how I should be seeking God's wisdom for whether or not the conferences I decide to go to will benefit my career in recreation ministry. The conference would be very interesting to me, and it would be a lot of fun, however Audio/Visual ministry has very little to do with Recreation Ministry, so while I want to go I'm having a hard time seeing if it would be worth taking the time off. I've never had an experience where a boss has put the ball in my court like that, and it helped me to realize that as an adult in a career, I need to start taking hold of my career with passion and make some life decisions around my career and balance my career with some more important life decisions as well.

I do enjoy Audio/Visual but I'm not sure if it would be worth taking off 4 days of work only to come back to my career in Recreation Ministry with nothing that I can realistically apply to my career. It would be more for selfish/personal reasons. Is this okay to do? Or should I reconsider wanting to go to this conference?

I am also asking for prayer as I ask God to lead me in this decision."

I just found this amazingly supportive subreddit so I figure I'd share what I posted to r/depression earlier today. Because of that, I realize a lot of the behaviors I'm describing are pretty common for BPD, but please treat me as the newbie I am.

I  feel so lost. I need to heal independently, but I don’t know how to do  it. I can try to meditate more, but my workplace isn’t the best  environment for that so progress is slow. I tried distracting myself the  first time around and that just ended up temporarily burying how I  truly felt. I don’t want to numb myself completely, but I can feel  myself becoming a shell. I don’t want that, but it’s the only way I have  found that allows me to function on a day-to-day basis. I feel like I’m  at an extremely critical point in this part of my life and I want to  emerge as healthy as I can, but I’m so afraid that I won’t be able to  find myself again. Its day 1 of the year I’ve mentally set aside for  myself without her and I just feel so alone. Normally I’d go to my mom,  but the only advice she’s giving me is the ‘it’ll get better’ line. I’m  scared, yall. How do I start the healing process without hitting rock  bottom? I did it last December but I don’t think I can do it again. I  know I’ll numb myself into a shell before I’ll go through that ordeal  again. I watched a TED talk explaining how helpful making a list of how  she wasn’t right for me can be, but it doesn’t help with losing a best  friend at the same time. *Will I ever be able to rebuild with her?*

For those who wish to read, here's the whole story:

*Some background:*

I  met this girl, we will call her L, in the second month or so in college  (currently going into my third year). Prior to meeting L, I had solely  relied on my mother, an extremely compassionate, caring, and emotionally  intelligent person, to help me through those painfully awkward teenage  soul-searching years, and I didn’t think I would ever find someone else  to understood me as well as my mom did.

Well,  L and I hit it off almost immediately when we started getting to know each other. The first night we kissed (about a week after we started  talking), I stayed in her dorm. No, we did not have sex until the third  month together. I then continued to stay in her room every night except  for three for the rest of my first year. Yes, I know that’s a bit  unprecedented but I hope you can understand that we were addicted to  each other. We had the exact same communication styles, handled  conflicts in a complimentary way, had the same degrees of compassion and  shared many similar opinions (sans politics). No matter what issue we  encountered, we were never nasty to each other, we simply talked it out  and found a solution and moved on. It felt like a match made in heaven  at the time, and so we spend almost every moment we could together for a  year. What made us work was that we told each other *literally everything*  about what was going on in each other’s lives because we knew the other  would listen without judgement and do their very best to understand  with love and compassion. And that’s how it happened time and time  again.

Fast forward to the summer after  that year, and we were apart for over a month for the first time in our  relationship. We both knew it was going to be hard but we’d agreed that  we could survive a few months apart. Remember how we told each other  everything? Well, let’s just say I did something I completely regret and  have since sought help for. I’m not going to elaborate further because  it is irrelevant to the story, but the end result when I (stupidly) told  her was that she felt like she could no longer be with me and still  respect herself. So we broke up and spiraled down separately. She was a  few states away in an internship and I later learned she’d essentially  walled herself off from the rest of the intern group for the remainder  of what had started as a promising opportunity to grow for her socially.  I kind of threw myself into videogames and spent about $700 on racecar simulation equipment.

The next fall  semester was pretty terrible for both of us. We had tried to reconnect  but it was too painful for me. I had told her that I needed some time to  heal on my own, but she couldn’t be apart from me for more than two  weeks so I began trying my hardest to heal quickly so she could heal  too. As you can imagine, I cut corners in my own healing process which  led to the problems I’m having now. We developed a friendship that was  superficial by our standards, and eventually she gave up on me (because I  still couldn’t be vulnerable enough for her to feel close to me). That  was fine, I really needed time to try to work through the emotional shitstorm I had bottled up for a few months. December sucked a lot, but  it felt like I had got through a lot of my feelings that month. (A bonus was I discovered Dance Gavin Dance)

*The lead up to the fall:*

I  never properly processed that we had broken up for three reasons; 1) I  had distracted myself with videogames that summer and rebounds that  semester because every time I tried to think about it, I just lost  myself completely in the pain of her absence, 2) I had stopped what  little progress I was making to try to be friends with her before I was  ready, and 3) she and I had made a pact while we were together that if  we were still single at 26 or 28, we would reconnect and, if things were  right, try again. The corner I cut to speed up my healing process was  to tell myself we would be okay in the long term because of the pact we  had made. It worked as I had intended, and I felt like I was okay with  reconnecting with her again by the start of Spring.

Spring  semester rolled around and she felt like she had made progress too, so  we started rebuilding again. Initially it was really hard so we  established boundaries like no discussing intimate relationships  (because I would get too jealous, again because of my shortcut). The  boundaries worked really well that semester and I even let myself feel  like things were returning to normal again. By the end of the semester,  we had come to rely on each other for our emotional crises, including  when she was diagnosed with BPD. As I stated previously, I neglected to really do any real research into the illness or how it affects loved ones, so here I am now.

Summer  of this year rolled around and I broke up with my rebound at the time  (I had two that year, one that lasted about a month and the other  directly following that lasted from October through June. I refused to  call it a rebound though because I had told myself I had ‘healed’). By  that time, L and I had grown close enough to somewhat resemble what we  shared a year previously. In June, I had to go to her hometown for an  unrelated reason (had other options but I saw the opportunity to visit  her) and it turned out she would be in town on that day. We spent the  entire morning together, going to a local landmark, talking, getting  lunch, and just generally having a good time. It was like time  traveling backwards a year, and it gave me hope for us in the future.

*The fall:*

We  didn’t talk every day, but it was close to that, and the frequency  increased after I visited. L is graduating in December and planning on  moving out of state after that and I’m studying abroad next semester and  won’t be returning until after her graduation, so we decided we wanted  to meet up once more while we still could. We were like brother and  sister after all.

She drove up to my  hometown and it was my turn to show her around. I’m not usually someone  to get super anxious, especially when meeting up with people I’ve known  for a long time, but I fucking changed my clothes 3 times before I went  out to meet her. Well, we met up and had a pretty good time as always,  then she came back to my house because my mom had invited her over for  dinner and to stay the night (otherwise it would have been a near 5 hour  drive back to her house at night on a Sunday). Things only felt like  they got better when she was around my family; she connected with  everyone, had a great time talking and chatting and cleaning up with my  mom, and we had walked on the beach together while we were waiting for  dinner to cook, during which time she asked if it was okay to hold my  hand. It felt like things were coming together again. We have a guest  room, but she’d never seen Pulp Fiction so I offered to stream it on my  computer in my room. We eventually fell asleep in my room together, and  it was the best I’d felt for over a year. We woke up the next morning  cuddling together and though we didn’t have sex, we went as far as her  anxiety would let her. She had to leave shortly after that to make it  home in time for something and I had work so it was fine.

I  texted her later that day to make sure she got home okay and we started  having a conversation. I sensed she was being distant and asked what  was wrong. She said she needed some time to reorient herself after that  weekend because she was so shaken up about how good it felt for her to  be with me again. I had seen it coming and gave her space as I always  had when she asked for it. In my mind though I was certain she felt the  same way about me and would come to the same conclusion that we were  meant to be together. We had always been on the same page, and I had  seen no reason why this time would be any different. (DGD fans – “Turn  Off The Lights – I’m Watching Back To The Future Pt. 2” and “Count  Bassy” describes this limbo perfectly)

She  texted me on Wednesday asking to talk and I obliged. She called me  crying about another anxiety attack regarding STDs, that she felt like  she had gone too far with me, that she was out of control; she popped a  xanny for the first time (totally not like her, she’s always been risk  averse because of her anxiety), and that was super afraid that she’d  contracted something because someone she hooked up with on Tuesday had  focused on the same body I had on Sunday and now it was a bit irritated.  Yes, the girl I had always felt like I would spend my life with, the  girl I had always counted on to feel the same as me, had basically just  hopped from one intimate moment to another. And she just dropped that  bomb as casually as I have made it seem.  I didn’t really hear anything  she said after that. I was too busy observing the explosion of my world  happening in my head. At the end of the call I told her I needed a few  weeks to myself to think and she understood. It may seem like I’m  overreacting to a small hookup an friend had and told me about it, but  that was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. I finally saw how  attached to her I still am when I died a little after hearing that.  (DGD fans – “Shelf Life”)

I took the rest  of that day and yesterday to think about what would be best for me. I  concluded (on my own, wow I guess I was right about NC) I had to be able to live my life wholly and completely without  her playing a main role anymore. I sent her an email telling her that I  don’t know how much time I need away from her, but I won’t be reaching  out to her until the urge to reach out to her is long gone. I think I  need a year from yesterday, so that’s the date I’ve set in my head.

If you’ve made  it this far, I truly commend you on your patience and willingness to  feel for others. May your love for others bring you happiness and  fulfillment in life. Any anecdotes on coping healthily, advice on how to  survive without a best friend, and/or kind words are very appreciated."
90lama,9,2018-07-20,"Just a ""little"" update",dudugardner,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/90lama/just_a_little_update/,"46 days ago I went right back to my rock bottom, after a long period relapsing from the use of various substances. I decided to leave my restrictions aside and went back to Narcotics Anonymous meetings and along with that I also decided to quit smoking cigarettes. Yes, I took the bandaid all at once.

In the first few days I contemplated self-extermination, was super angry and having strange thoughts, but at the same time somehow I felt a huge relief at finally admitting to myself that there was no chance of being successful using drugs. Any of them.

Things have improved a lot since then. I feel more focused and relaxed and less angry and depressed. I'm discovering new hobbies (I bought an amazonian forest for my house and discovered that I like to take care of plants. I'm reading more books, I'm exercising regularly and mainly I'm trying to be more compassionate and affectionate to myself). I also got an internship in an office that I always admired and I'll start on August 1th !

Some days have been better than others and from time to time I still feel a little lonely (not to say that everything is beautiful) and life has presented itself as it is, full of ups and downs, but I feel that today I no longer have to manipulate the way I feel. I just accept that I'm a human and that I experience fear, pain, anxiety and that's ok. That won't kill me, drugs will.

I had the impression that being at bars and nightclubs filled with people I wasn't lonely, but inside I was as lonely as one can get. It was just an illusion. 

Well, sorry for my english skills (english is not my first language), but I wanted to post this update on how I'm doing.

Once you make the decision of stop using and accept the consequences of it, is one of the best things that can happen in your life. I know I don't have a lot of clean time under my belt but I do not intend to go back to that life I was living NEVER again, just for today. If someone is going through something similar and want to talk send me a message, I'll be happy to help! We're in this together and this is possible!"

She sauntered through Oslo, shaking her hips, bikini halfway to falling off, clearly the master of seduction.

Hell, even her scales were polished to perfection.

“You sure this is going to work?”

The intern sighed at his frantic, slightly terrified colleague’s apprehension.

“Yeah. Checked it myself.”

“Why should I trust you?”

“Because I built the fucking death ray, and not even Briusky can tell you otherwise. Just watch.”

“Watch? Watch it fuck somebody?”

“Yeah.”

“...L-let’s just move on. Why… why are we here?”

“Because the one thing the old seal didn’t account for was it being able to express lust towards Miz ‘Fuck Sex’. Now shut up and let it work the magic.”

The diplomat was still rather concerned, confused, apprehensive, and many other feelings besides, but voiced no further objections for fear of what other horrors best not known would escape the intern’s mouth.

Besides, what would likely come in the near future would be enough to fuel his nightmares for centuries to come.


To pointedly and tastefully move away from the scene for a moment, there will be a brief segment on the plan our poor viewpoint character is undertaking.

Bert and Olaus, through heavy application of SCIENCE and a meeting with famed dragon biologists, found a way to ensure all fluids produced by the dragon would be fertile. As Norwegians favor the exotic while not really understanding it, they will likely bed the dragon if given the opportunity. Regardless of gender, if all works out, pregnancy will be achieved, assuming the other partner is fertile.

Nine months after bedding, Dragon-Human hybrids will appear all throughout Oslo, and will likely be kicked out. Alienated, confused, and betrayed, they will come back, twenty years later, ready to pillage those who ruined their life.


“That was… disgusting.”

“Too bad. You’ve gotta be here to supervise. It’s your dragon, after all.”

An expression of horror flashed on the diplomat’s face.

“I…I’ll never sleep again…”

“Toodle-oo. Have fun with your little voyeur-ship exercise.”

“Uh…W-wait!”

“What?”

“Uh… how will you sneak out? We only got in here through posing as shipbuilders…”

“Oh, I’ll just build ‘em a ship, claim my buddy died of a stroke.”

“Build a ship? Just like that?”

“Well, yeah. It won’t work, duh, but it’ll look snazzy.”

“…Just like that?”

“Yeah.”

“That’ll take twenty years!”

“Which means I’ll know if this plan works or not.”

“Y-you… you’re insane.”

“True. And we haven’t even gotten to the part where I escort you out in a coffin.”

“…I’m going to have to stay here for twenty years too?”

“Yep. Have fun, try not to get discovered, the usual.”

“B-b-but… wait, hold on…”

90lrtw,1,2018-07-20,"I feel pent in and stuck, no matter what I do I can't change my situation",UnableCamel,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/90lrtw/i_feel_pent_in_and_stuck_no_matter_what_i_do_i/,"I'm writing this here because I have no one to talk to in real life. My dad's dead, my mom gets angry if I complain about anything about myself despite one of the things I need to vent is how much I hate the habit of complaining I picked up from my family. 

So a bulk of my self-problems come to a shit tier genetic pool, with familial maladies such as early balding, gallbladder failure, bad joints, asthma, severe allergies (I was the only one in my entire family who won't die if I eat something I'm allergic to), cone dystrophy, depression, schizophrenia, heart disease, etc. 

So I couldn't join any military, despite a push from my grandparents to join like they did and my cousins did. Because my asthma kicked in often, despite cardio. I couldn't play any sports either after a bone disease gave me a tragic backstory; the only reason the bone disease was a problem? My dad refused to let me see a doctor, and instead I had pieces of my leg bones flaking off and getting stuck in my knee... while being an active midfielder in a travel league. Two years of that; got diagnosed right at the end of 8th grade. I'm now 19, boutta be 20, now have arthritis but can finally run again. 

On top of that, familial depression lucked it's way into my life. Only I didn't know that existed because my familial culture, Polish on one side, Irish on the other, all Catholic, meant NO ONE TOLD ME MY UNCLES, GRANDFATHER, AND FATHER ALL TRIED SUICIDE. Mental health isn't allowed to be talked about. The blatant alcoholism is just hobbies, the schizophrenia and bipolarism just quirks. So I had suicidal idealization, still somewhat do as it's the only escape I can find, and gradually tried some attempts in high school. All while being told how you can't talk about that, it's shameful, how pathetic people are that have that, they're going to hell for rejecting God, etc. (I kept it hidden from family, but after I got antidepressants for treating migraines, people in high school said I looked depressed all the time so they avoided me? all until I looked happier, of course) 
So that was fun.
And then I got an eye disease, cone dystrophy. Again, a beautiful inheritance. No cures, until gene therapy gets better. And I can't join any groups for it, as it's so rare; and the only ""Going Blind Club"" is for more actual-have-something-to-complain-about people, or old people going blind due to age. 

So the cone dystrophy's been slow, only 20% of my cones are dead so far, yay. But I get migraines unless I take strong medication, even with the medicine I have extreme light sensitivity so I can't enjoy things like pools or beaches or sunny days; my color-vision sucks; all of which means I can't enjoy my favorite thing- the outdoors- alone. If I want to go climbing at a bouldering gym, I need a partner to show me which rocks are on the route since all the routes are color-coded. If I go on long road trips, the only way to get to the outdoors in New York State, I need someone to A. Be there in case my eyes go out (it's happened before) B. In case something goes wrong with my shitty truck as I know nothing about cars and didn't get a license till I was 18. 

So that brings me to I'm incredibly god damn lonely. This I can't change. I've tried. My parents moved to the house they could afford- I'm grateful overall, I've had a good family overall- but since there were no kids in the neighborhood, I didn't get sent to camps, youth programs, or daycares, and was forbidden from leaving the backyard, I never had a childhood friend. Just picked up weird social habits from old people and books.

So in high school, this meant I had social anxiety and a severe dependence on whoever let me stuck around with them. This meant I was friends with the social asshole nerd group- the kinds of people that chime in ""Well, actually"" and bully people not on the High Honors List. Imitated them in lack of my own personality; after the suicidal times and my father's passing showed me they weren't real friends (being alone and friendless during the death of a father is, admittedly, kinda rough), I had to re-invent myself.

So now I'm 19, boutta be 20, go to morrisville state, a meh college, and a awful program. And I've re-read ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" multiple times, and I'm still awful at social interactions. Every girlfriend I've had has dumped me after they find out about my anxiety and additionally cited the eye disease; I try to hide it, but eventually it leaks out when I have to explain why I can't find a blue car or see in the light. Usually, any people I meet casually and start flirting with me, end up turning me down due to the eye disease.

So I have bad social habits, a lack of anything to relate with normal people- no one likes a tragic backstory in reality- and bad health, that's only going to get worse. 

Well, I can get a good job and make up for it that way, right? 

Welp, thats what I thought. But I never got a real, over the table job in high school... Always was too late or got turned down. Now, years later at home for break, I still have no job as no one wanted to hire a college student. Best I got was maybe after I graduate the associates program, they'll hire me. 

These weren't just internships or design firms turning me down. Even Harbor Freight said we'd like someone who could commit to a six month time frame. 

I've tried for years and years, reading self help book, working out daily trying to fix my knee. The most I got was dropping fifty pounds but still 'rocking the dad-bod'. Even when I did the whole 1 gram of protein for lean body mass, working out every day with cardio. I've turned around socially, I now feel somewhat comfortable selling my woodwork in public, but I still have no close friends...I thought I had outdoor friends, but everyone bailed on me. So now I have a month left in break, I have nothing good to say about the summer. No camping, no trips, nada. 

I'd go solo-travelling, but even then, where in the fuck can I find wilderness in New York? I live in fucking Rochester. The Adks are six, seven hours away and are crowded in summer. Maybe the catskills? And is the outdoors really fun by yourself? 

What's the fucking point in continual trying to grow as an individual if years of attempting still have me daydreaming of dying tragically so I'd get a sympathy funeral?

 No amount of learning how to interact successfully with people will result in me having a close friend, or getting a healthy family. No amount of working out is going to fix my eyes, my knee, or my dad bod. 
I'm about to be 20 and I've already failed in life. No job, no car skills, nada.

90m98h,2,2018-07-20,Flight School and Decisions,BondanrGaming,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/90m98h/flight_school_and_decisions/,"Hello. I am looking into going to flight school after I graduate college. I am unable to find people to talk to about the subject. It was my dream when I was around 10 years old to be a pilot. I got lead to believe my uncle could not be a pilot because he did not have natural 20/20 (I also don't have natural 20/20). I found out early last year this was not the case and it only referred to the military back when he left the National Guard. I only know one person who is a pilot and they don't communicate with me that much and its left me lost on the whole subject.

I am in my 5th and final year of college. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration. I haven't had a job as I am trying to focus on college. I did have an internship during the summer between community college and university. My grandmother never wanted me to go to university even. She kept stating I needed to go get a ""trade"" at community college and then go to work. I knew I would eventually go to college and wasn't afraid to take the hit financially. But now that I know I potentially qualify to be a pilot I am wanting to take my chance and to go to flight school as soon as university is over so I don't miss out on years of potential flying.

My big issue is wondering if I would be able to get the funding go to flight school. I do want to attempt a flight school that does not drag it out for two years. I have considered ATP but have had no real opinions given to me on that school either. But I also have my college loans out and I am unemployed so that makes me worry about my chances. Its also not an official school when it comes to FAFSA so that is not an option. The airport near me has 3 different flight schools I could chose from (I might have to double check that number).

Anyone have any advice they can give? I really do not want to go to work full time or part time as that is seriously going to drag out the flight training more than I would like. I prefer to be done with it in 1.5 years. Any advice given right now is helpful. I can't find anyone who will give advice rather than control my life."

No longer the skinny little twig of a barely-teen, I had grown into a...well...slender adult. Not everything was in complete proportion, and the delight of various girlfriends had given me more than enough confidence for my age. You might even say I was more than a little cocky at times.

I'd had a bad crush on you all those years ago, masturbating my teenage cock furiously. Multiple times a day whenever you came over to take a dip in our pool, or even something as innocent as you simply visiting. It's not like going boys need much encouragement. 

You had cemented my desire for older women, and I had never forgotten it. So when you moved back, needing a place for the summer until you had your own place I encouraged it. I already wasn't going on the yearly family trip due to an internship I'd landed, and while I didn't necessarily think anything was going to happen just the thought of your delicious female flesh so close for an extended time was thrilling. Enough so that I had to spend an hour draining my balls before picking you up from time airport so I would not have a massive tent.

With the parents gone, the house and you were all mine, and if there was any chance I wasn't going to waste it.

Hello everyone, thank you for reading. I was envisioning an effort consensual or dubcon scenario, either way my character would be the sexual aggressor. 

I left a lot of details out, such as age of the aunt, marital status, and even personality. Make her your own so I can do the same. 

I tend towards the more.. intense scenarios and kinks and submissive partners, so please let me know what you are comfortable with.

I look forward to the conquest."

Looks like a beautiful [ZT 0920](https://imgur.com/a/8nnUV39) Now this girl has seen a bit of use, but trust me when I say that she has more curves than my 5th grade math teacher! And trust me when I say I remember Mrs. Campbell, I had to repeat that class at least 3 times!
Now let me get down to the nitty gritty. 
She’s got a bit of a gouge right on the lanyard hole. Teehee. Not sure how this ever happened but unless you’re some sort of aesthetic pansy, it won’t affect a thing. The next thing is a very faint hairline scratch on the blade. If ya ask me, it adds character! Lastly, the anodization on the clip ain’t perfect and has a few very minor trails! That’s knife people speak for “it ain’t that perdy no more!”
Now with all that boring stuff out of the way, let me just you, this action is beautiful. I haven’t taken her apart but a good lube would make it shine! 
Hold the phone! Maybe it’s just the Applebee’s happy hour catching up to me but I can’t believe this price, Dianne! Can you double check this price for me?!

90nkls,1,2018-07-21,The Book of Job,kpn_911,Horror_stories,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/90nkls/the_book_of_job/,"Job’s life was in near perfect order. The alarm went off at 3:49 AM every morning. He had a glass of orange juice and an apple, shit, then went on a five mile run along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade. He’d come home to his brownstone, shower, dress, drink coffee, eat a hearty breakfast cooked by his nanny, and kiss his daughter before stepping out of the door at 6:00 AM.  He’d take the 2 or 3 train to Fulton Street and enter his building between 6:30-6:45 AM at the latest, depending on train delays. The doors of the elevator would open and the clock above would never be late. His days were like the second hand of the clock, fluid but mechanical — beats per minute that were always building toward a peak that remained elusive.

He never had cause for complaint. He was grateful for everything that he had. It all took work and he earned it. There were many years when he was broke and lonely. He rose through the ladder of the company to get where he was now. He’d worked his entire life for his current position. When he started as an unpaid intern, no one could remember his name. He was practically invisible. Now, his name preceded him. Of course, it came with a cost. Mainly, his time.

Which didn’t help his marriage. Lately, his work ethic had created a division between he and his wife Diane. There was a growing space between them. Few words, even less eye contact, and virtually no intimacy. Job approached their relationship the same way he addressed everything else. It was work, a task, an obligation that he adhered to and was happy to do.

It never was easy for Job, but his persistence produced breakthroughs. Take for instance how he met his wife, Diane. There were many postponed dates before he finally convinced Diane to finally accept his proposal. She didn’t show much interest, and it was a horrible first date. He felt like it was a pity meet and greet. Afterwards he called, hoping for a second date, only to get rejected. It wasn’t until years later when she ran into him on the promenade that her interest finally emerged. Running became a retreat for him so his chub was then gone. Shyness and insecurity had transformed into confidence and a pleasant outgoingness. He was a different man — to her.

Their daughter Basil was the easiest task of them all. She was born with down syndrome and that didn’t stop her from being the light of his life. Everything excited her and a smile rarely left her face. She was just so sweet and innocent. Of course, there were difficulties that were mainly rooted in his ego. He couldn’t help but think that her condition was somehow his fault despite all of the doctors who assured him otherwise. Maybe he shouldn’t have gone through that cigarette phase when he was a teenager. Maybe his sperm was abnormal. Maybe he would fail in raising such a precious spirit. He was paid very well for his analytical mind, but sometimes it got in his way more than it helped him.

One of his main beliefs was that there was always a way to resolve a problem. With enough work, even the direst of situations could turn around. Take for example where we find him now. An important client was going to leave the firm for a partnership with a young start-up. Job assessed the risks, ran through the numbers, and prepared a presentation that killed. This latest victory was months in the making. Preparing, practicing, and eventually executing. He was the last in the office again, basking in his success. The view from his office’s window overlooked Manhattan. The Empire State Building. Chrysler Building. Times Square. George Washington Bridge in the distance. A crescent moon dangled like a hook over the Jersey cliffs. The entire city was his in this moment. He had never felt prouder.

The clock hit 9:11 PM and finally Job rose from his desk. The picture frames surrounding his computer were lit in a dim golden light. He smiled and flicked off the green banker’s lamp. The faces of his wife and child were veiled by shadows and his footsteps left the room in silence.

He was waiting for the elevator when he heard an impassioned voice booming from the corner office.

“I’ll make you eat the flesh of your children you little fuckin’ rat,” came from the office. Job treaded lightly closer to the door. It was the office of the founder and CEO of the company, George Owen Dowe. Job’s father always told him to never trust a man with two first names. Rarely was George seen in the offices. Usually, there were only rumors that gave him life. \*He’s in Senegal right now, tomorrow he’ll be Austria, oh -- did you see his pictures from Saint Tropez?\* He was more of a myth than a real person. Job had seen him only from across the room every now and again but even that made Job nervous. George inspired an entire generation of financiers. His name was synonymous with success. He lived at an echelon of stature that few would ever inhabit. By now, George Owen Dowe’s money infiltrated every trade across the board. He owned a piece of everything.

“Try me,” George bellowed, “and the only job you’ll be able to get will be shoveling shit.”

George slammed the phone on the base and Job shuddered. The elevator dinged and the doors opened. Job turned to leave and drove his face into the chest of a pale beastly man wearing a three piece burgundy suit. A sly smile slithered up his cheek. Job knew the man, Luc Milieu, and was just as sure that he was the last person you’d expect to find in this building. The door swung open and George stood there scowling. Job was wedged between a feud that had been boiling in each man’s blood for over a quarter of a century.

“Job,” George said.

“Sir,” Job was shocked that such a man as George knew his name. “I— uh—”

“Were just leaving,” George said as he shot the thin man a hateful glare.

“Yes sir,” Job bowed and slipped out from between them. The elevator doors were closing, and he raced over to stab his hand and hit the censors. The doors reopened and he hurried inside. He watched the two men enter the corner office with the utmost intrigue. Why would they be meeting after all these years? The elevator doors closed on the men. George stared out of the window with his back turned to his guest.

\_\_\_

“Think of the devil,” George said as he looked out of the window, “and he’s already found you.”

George watched the city glisten, looking through the reflection of his adversary. The sky line had been altered by their investment. Skyscrapers with their names lit up the night. Their signature was written in permanent monoliths of steel and concrete. Midtown. Flatiron. Central Park East. Luc lingered by the door and had a different view. He saw all of the windows sprawled out across the city, and wondered of all the pain and suffering hidden by the curtains. The world was a wicked place — and he’d seen the worst. No thanks to the abrupt expulsion from the company that he co-founded with George.

“Old friend,” Luc said with venom. “It’s been a while.”

“Yes, a good while too.”

“May I?” Luc motioned to the chair.

“If you must,” George said as walked over to the liquor cart. He poured two twelve year old whiskeys, neat. “To what do I owe this sudden intrusion?”

“I was just in town and thought I’d check in on our business,” Luc said as he sat gently into the leather chair and folded his leg over his knee. He took the glass from George and they solemnly clinked glassed.

“Our business. That’s funny,” George walked around the desk and sat back in his luxurious seat, not a trace of laughter was on his solid sunken face. “Where have you come from?”

“Everywhere and nowhere really,” Luc laughed wickedly and stroked his pointy goatee, “your workers are certainly dedicated if they are willing to work so late.”

“I don’t ask them to,” George smiled serenely, “They do so because they believe in our mission here.”

“Or they fear you,” Luc said. “That man was too terrified to speak.”

“Job? He’s one of our finest workers,” George boasted. “His faith in this company is unparalleled.”

“Is that so? It’s hard to be discontent when you have everything.”

“He’s earned it.”

“Wouldn’t it be a shame if he were to suddenly pursue a better offer from a competitor?”

“He would never,” George cleared his throat, falling into all seriousness.

“Are you so sure?”

“He looks up to me as a mentor — his idol if you will. While you’ve been off galavanting around the world, I’ve been here — building this empire.”

“And whose decision was that?”

“Job is satisfied in his current position.”

“Is he now?”

“He obeys with absolute devotion — never a question asked.”

“Oh?”

“Works holidays, is the first to arrive in the morning, and the last to leave at night. Hell, he even missed the birth of his daughter. His allegiance to me is unbreakable.”

“Everyone has a breaking point.”

“Not this one.”

“How much would you be willing to bet?”

“A man’s life is not worth a wager.”

“Say, if his life wasn’t the wager? More, his \*devotion\*.”

George leaned back in his chair and examined Luc’s interest, “What’s in it for you?”

“The real question is, how much are you willing to gain?”

“And how is that?”

“What if I were to tell you that I’d be willing to sell you my remaining shares? You’d have complete control over your \*little kingdom\*.”

“I’ve been trying to convince you to do that for decades. Why the sudden change in heart?”

“Nothing gives me greater joy than proving you wrong.”

“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”

“Ah yes,” Luc raised his glass and took a swig.

“So what are you proposing?”

“There is no perfection in this world. Nothing is pure. Nothing is sacred. It’s all a mess — utter chaos. A tree can only withstand so many storms before it bends.”

“And?”

“Allow me to test Job’s faith. I promise you that if he loses everything, he’ll turn against you without question.”

George laughed heartily while holding his belly. He then leaned with his forearms on the desk and the light cast a shadow across his face, “alright then, all that he has is in your hands, but don’t you hurt him.”

Luc smiled and kicked his leg off his knee. He rose and extended his hand, shaking with George.

\_\_\_

Most mornings were met with the kick of a high hat as Job plummeted out of his feverish dream of falling from the top of a skyscraper. The descent always lasted long enough for the panic to be replaced by a calm awareness of certain death. He accepted it and that’s when his phone alarm would spare him of this repetitive torture. Today, the pavement stayed away and he fell and fell and fell to no quick relief. Perhaps he wasn’t falling but flying. If there were no end, then he was suspended from the heavens. An extension of the universe. He felt free.

And it was with this ease that he floated back through the window like a feather on a gentle breeze. His body was released onto his memory foam mattress and down comforter. His eyes fluttered open and he yawned at the sun. \*Why was the sun up? What time was it?\* He checked his phone but the power was off. He pressed the power button but only got the image of a drained battery with a red bottom. \*How could—\* He checked the wire and it was cut, split, and frayed in the middle. The cat never chewed wires before. \*What the hell got into her?\*

He rubbed his eyes back into focus, 7:15 AM. Shit. He struggled to get dressed — every piece of clothing felt tight over his spasming muscles. He tried to get comfortable but nothing fit right. He didn’t have time for comfort. He was late for the pitch.

Job entered the kitchen in a frenzy, “Why didn’t you wake me up?”

He looked around an empty family room. Then he checked the bathroom, Basil’s room. No one was there. He bent the blinds and saw the street sweeper barreling down the block. Their car wasn’t double parked like usual. His wife must’ve already taken their daughter to school.

As he jogged to the subway, Job tried calling Diane but it kept going to voicemail. He tried again while standing at the top of the steps as outgoing traffic from the arriving train spilled out from the burrow. He was checked by a man wearing a red checkered button up and grey slacks. He turned to shoot a dirty look and was met by a deathly scowl. The man was his age, handsome with a square jaw, icy eyes, and light hair. He was everything that Job was not. He may have lost all that weight years ago but he was far from symmetrical. Job pocketed his phone and descended into the subway, too timid to look back.

The subway was crammed with people during the morning rush. This is why he like to travel earlier, to avoid that cattle car feeling. He waited for the next train to arrive behind a crowd of people. It wasn’t for another half hour before it came chugging into the station. He pushed to the front of the platform and the train stopped with him standing halfway between doors so he got boxed out. The doors open and the people squished together. No one got off. They were all heading to the city for work. Job tried to pry through the others waiting in line but couldn’t manage to get to the door in time. The doors shut and train moved on.

The trains heading southbound were coming back to back but there was no sign of movement down the tracks heading in his direction. He waited and the crowd got thicker. Finally, a train dragged itself into the station and Job positioned himself in front of the door. He forced himself on, probably accidentally committing sexual assault in the process. There was no way to get into the city without snug full body touching these days. They were nearly into Manhattan when the train came to a screeching halt. The conductor announced that there was a medical emergency at the Fulton Street station. Job’s back was throbbing and his arm was going numb from holding onto the overhead bars. An itch burned on his back but there was no where to squirm.

Things didn’t improve at work either. The doors of the elevator opened to chaos. A frenzy of excitement echoed off the walls. The workers hurried around the hive like ants after being doused with gas and lit on fire. One of his co-workers rushed up to him with disheveled hair and his dress shirt halfway untucked. He clumsily shoved his glasses back up the bridge of his  sweaty nose.

“Where the hell have you been?” Phil said as he tucked in the back of his shirt.

“My alarm didn’t go off,” Job said wearily.

“You picked a hell of a day to not show up.”

“What’s going on?

“The Sorbos deal fell through.”

“How could it—”

“You didn’t show up so they walked.”

“…but we agreed to terms.”

Phil shrugged, “Yeah, well — they’re gone.”

The rest of the day was spent reaching answering machines or no answers at all. The constant sound of the ringing phone battered Job’s frontal lobe. The calls were always from some confused soul in the building and not the people he was hoping to hear from. \*Why would they back out?\* Just yesterday they sat in the boardroom with smiles on their faces. There wasn’t a hint of doubt in those plastered smiles. They didn’t need him there to finalize it.

By lunch, rumors were beginning to spread. Job didn’t have time to eat but needed coffee to combat his heavy eyes. He scratched his forearm and listened to Zoe and Billy’s conspiracy theories. The rumors were flying around with the fury of a tornado. Zoe had it in her mind that the folks at Sorbos were tipped on some insider knowledge. She believed that the company was going down fast. Her division was responsible for the budget so she was one to know. Billy maintained that George’s arch rival, Luc Milieu, had returned to take back what was rightfully his. Luc was starting with their biggest account and would soon own them all.

Sure enough, they were both right. Clients started closing their accounts despite the massive breach of contract fees. The numbers might have looked good for one time transactions but weren’t sustainable for the weeks ahead. The overhead for an entire skyscraper needed constant revenue to be pouring in. As if by a flip of a switch, the money stopped flowing and a drought set in almost immediately. The stocks plummeted and the panic in the office settled into a somber realization of how bad things could become.

No one smiled that day. Job’s entire retirement plan was wiped away by the drop in price for each share. His planned progression in life was interrupted by an unforeseen obstacle. Surely, he would overcome it. He could defeat any foe — box with any opponent. Even if that opponent was George Owen Dowe himself. It wasn’t going to be easy if no one would answer their phone or call back. He felt like he was screaming into a void that went unheard. All he had to do was make the effort. Pull up his boot straps and put his head down. Keep his soul to the grindstone, chipping away piece by piece. Yet, without a response — there was nothing he could do.

There was a light rapping on the door and finally Job looked up from his computer screen. Phil stood in the doorway, his shirt stained by sweat and a sad exhaustion to his demeanor, “After today, drinks are in order. We’ll be at the White House. You coming?”

Job scratched his neck and sighed, “As good as that sounds, I need to figure this out.”

“Don’t kill yourself,” Phil said as he slapped the door and left.

The overcast sky was getting dark and the same view that looked so promising the night before was now dreary and ominous. Job resigned to defeat for the day and decided to head home early. The only thing that could cheer him up was his baby girl. The commute home was just as packed as it was in the morning and the car he entered reeked of a homeless man hidden behind a wall of misery. All he wanted to do was lie down in his bed and sleep forever.

The windows of his brownstone were dim when he arrived. His sore ankles stumbled up the stoop and he fumbled his keys. They clanked on the ground and he strained himself bending over to pick them up. He limped up the stairwell to the second floor and entered the living room. His daughter was sitting in front of the television.

“What did I tell you about sitting too close to the television?”

Basil’s face lit up with happiness. No matter what, she glowed when she was around her father and waited everyday for him to get home from work. If it was past her bedtime, she’d stay awake and prayed that he’d return. \*Please, please, please\*. She would have to pretend she was sleeping when he came in to give her a kiss because she didn’t want to get in trouble. She was an angel, lit by the dancing blue of the television.

“Hey baby girl,” Job hugged his sweetheart tight and strong, “Oh, I missed you.”

“I missed you too Daddy.”

“You’re a sight for sore eyes.”

“Why are your eyes sore?”

“It’s an expression, baby girl.”

“An exprection?”

“Yes, hunny,” Job looked around but there was no sign of his wife, “Where’s mommy?”

“She’s upstairs with her friend.”

“Upstairs? Which friend? Trudy? Melissa?”

“No, Steve.”

“Who the fuck is Steve?”

“Ooh, Daddy said a bad word.”

Basil’s giggle fueled his rampage up the stairs. A moaning escaped from behind the closed door at the end of the hall. Her voice. Her laugh. It was a stab to his abdomen and he keeled over in agony at the landing, balancing his weight on the bannister. He listened to her whelp. Her enjoyment. His grunting. The headboard slapping against the wall and her pussy clapping his balls. His chest tightened and he clenched a fist. He burst through the door and found his wife riding someone like a wild cowgirl.

“What the fuck are you doing?”

Diane turned and smiled at Job with a malicious firmness as she continued to grind on top of this stranger. The sight of Job seemed to be what pushed her over the edge and she lapsed into a shivering orgasm. Her toes curled and her leg locked up and shook. She rolled off of Steve, bumping into each ab on her way down.

“Who the fuck is this?”

“I’m Steve,” Job recognized his face. It was the man from this morning who bumped into him. He was filled with rage but didn’t know what to do with it. He’d never been in a fight, and from the look of this guy Steve it wouldn’t be a fair match. He could toss Job around like a dog rips apart a stuffed animal.

“He’s Steve.”

“You brought another man into our bed?”

“Our bed? When was the last time you slept here? When was the last time you fucked me in this bed?”

“You can’t just—”

“I can do whatever the fuck I want,” Diane barked. “You do.”

“And you bring him around our daughter?”

“Don’t pretend to care,” she laughed.

“Don’t pretend to— Don’t pretend to care? You’ve gotta be kidding me.”

“Does it look like I’m kidding you?” she said in a cold brick tone as she grabbed Steve’s semi-hard dick and wiggled it around.

“What did I ever do to you?”

“Oh, please. Don’t give me that bullshit. You did this. You care more about that company than you do your family.”

“Diane, that’s not true.”

“Oh? Then where were you when I was pushing your precious daughter out of my vagina? Huh? Where were you on her first day of school? Or her seventh birthday? You’re never here. You’re always working. And I get lonely.”

“Maybe I should—” Steve began to rise naked from the bed.

“You should,” Job foamed from the mouth. “Get the fuck out of my house.”

“No,” Diane grabbed Steve’s wrist.

“I don’t want to cause any—”

“He caused all the trouble,” Diane said. “So you’re going to stay and he’s going to leave.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” Job growled defiantly.

“Sleep in your office tonight,” Diane said, “or go kill yourself. I don’t really care. Just go.”

\_\_\_

The White House was drunk with revelry. It was Friday night and all of the financial bros were in full pig squeal. The corner of the bar was calm compared to the rest of the rowdy patrons. Job pushed through the crowd and came across his co-workers’ booth. They all hung onto their empty glasses in despair. A bottle of tequila was propped up between them. They barely acknowledged Job’s arrival, but Phil scooted over and instinctively poured Job a shot which sat untouched. Zoe noticed that Job was worse off than the rest of them.

“Look at this sad lot,” a voice shouted out from the Top 40 playlist booming from beyond the crowd. Job look up from his glass and saw Arthur Bernstein standing over them. He dropped a tray of glasses onto the table. The glasses had been used and one even had lipstick smear on the rim. The taller of the glasses had a yolky loogie floating at the bottom. Job went to Cornell with Arthur and has always despised him.

“Courtesy of Milieu Industries,” Arthur grinned and slid the tray in front of them, “We offer you the bottom of the barrel.”

“Fuck off Bernstein,” Billy shoved the tray at Arthur and the loogie splashed out and splattered on his chest. The table erupted in laughter. Billy rose from his seat and got in Arthur’s face. Arthur took a reluctant step back.

“You think that you can’t be touched,” Arthur growled, “but you’re not special. You’re nothing.”

Billy didn’t let up and Arthur was pulled back by his goons. They faded into the reflective style of button ups and khakis and Billy sat back down in a gust of anger, “Fuckin’ asshole.”

Job stared into the glass, sniffed the whiskey, and thought about that old proverb on the fullness of a glass. If he saw the glass as being half full, he’d be a optimist. If it were empty, he’d be a pessimist. If he saw it as both half full and half empty he’d be a realist. He didn’t even see the glass anymore. What the fuck did that make him? \*Job\*. He stared into middle space. His house was on fire. His wife was dead. His daughter fell in love with an asshole like Arthur. He got fired. Had nothing. He was a failure. \*Job\*. It didn’t matter how hard he worked, it was all bullshit anyway.

“Job,” Zoe said and he looked up from the glass with tears streaming from his eyes. His co-workers were watching him nervously, “it’s not that serious.”

“Yeah man,” Phil said, nudging his shoulder. “It always works out.”

“My wife cheated on me,” Job muttered.

“Oh,” said Billy and Zoe.

“Shit,” said Phil, “I’m sorry.”

“What’s the point?” Job was nearly sobbing. “You work your ass off your entire life for what? You’re going to lose it all anyway. So what’s the fucking point? Life is nothing but wind.”

“You can’t blame yourself,” Phil said.

“Who else can I blame? Huh?”

“She’s the one that cheated,” said Zoe. “Blame her.”

“She said I work too much. I’m never there. I don’t— I can’t—”

“If anything, you did everything you could.”

“It wasn’t enough,” said Job. “It’s never enough.”

He rose from his seat having never touched his alcohol, and left his friends without so much as a second glance. He slept on the subway that night. He awoke as the train emerged from a tunnel and rose up over Brooklyn. The sun was breaking over the horizon and a burning itch spread up his wrist. He scratched it with no relief. He slid his sleeve up and saw a rash spreading across his inner forearm. The city was getting farther away. Everything he ever knew was slipping into the dark clouds of an impending storm.

\_\_\_

Job entered the lobby of his work an hour early. He slept for an hour on the couch of the break room before the buzz of the office awoke him. He was still wearing the same suit as yesterday and smelled like liquor. Everyone shot him glances of disapproval. He didn’t care. He went to the bathroom, wet his hair, and combed it back with his fingers. His eyes were bloodshot and hugged by swollen lids. He looked like shit. \*Fuck it.\*

He was intercepted by Phil on his way back to his office, “The big man wants to talk to you.”

“He’s in today?” Job was surprised.

“Yeah,” Phil whispered, “and he’s pissed.”

\_\_\_

There was someone else sitting in front of George when Job entered. The man turned and the sight of him punched Job in his pride. It was Steve. \*He fucked my wife\*. The room spun around him. His skin burned. He was unable to move, petrified by shock.

“Job,” George said leaning back, “Please have a seat. This isn’t going to be easy to hear.”

“Wha—” Job choked. “What?”

“Have a seat,” George barked.

Job stepped forward, his vision never leaving the smirk on Steve’s face. His beating heart was about to break a rib. His hands trembled and his eyes filled with tears. His feet moved without thought and he sat gently into the seat next to Steve. They stared at each other with enough poison to destroy an ecosystem.

“This is Steven Hendrix,” George said with nonchalance, “He’s here to right your wrongs.”

“Excuse me?”

“Is that the tone you wish to use in approaching this?” George said calmly.

“No, I— I just don’t understand.”

“It’s pretty simple. You lost our biggest account. That is unacceptable.”

“Of course, I—”

“Steven here has come highly recommended from Luc Milieu. He’ll be supervising the Sorbos account from here on out and you will report directly to him.”

“But—”

“There’s only one response I want to hear and that’s yes sir.”

“Yes, of course — sir.”

Steve’s glaring pride nearly got his throat slit. Job eyed the letter opener on George’s desk. It would be a simple task, really. Just thrust upward and through the Adam’s Apple. He’d bleed out and die in minutes. He’d suffer. That’s all that Job could ever want. He wanted Steve to suffer. Steve extended his hand, “I look forward to working with you.”

Job shook his hand, and would forever regret it.

\_\_\_

Around lunch time, Job had to leave the office. Steve wouldn’t stop hounding him over every little detail that was missed. Every time he saw the man, he’d see his naked wife grinding. Thrusting. Fucking. Dirty and primal. He’d hear her moans. She orgasmed while looking at him. The day would end in murder, he was sure of it. He developed a fever and his rashes were aflame, spreading across his skin like a wildfire with a wind. He tried to make it to the elevator but his head was lightheaded from rising too fast.

The doors of the elevator opened and Steve exited. There was no way to avoid him. Steve approached and placed his hand on Job’s shoulder, “How’s it feel to get fucked?”

\_\_\_

The soft fluorescent lights met Job’s blurry vision. He groaned and slipped in an out of consciousness. His daughter stood before him, crying. \*Wake up daddy, wake up\*. His wife made out with Steve, who held up a middle finger. Luc Milieu studied him, purely entertained by his pain. The doctor and nurses trailed around him in a blur. He was paralyzed.

He finally emerged from his coma four days later. He was alone and no one except doctors and nurses visited him. The right side of his face was paralyzed and he couldn't feel his legs. The doctors would only dip in every now and again and didn’t seem to do anything for him. They’d examine him, grunt, and leave.

“What happened to me?” Job asked.

“You had a stroke and hit your head,” the doctor said.

“A stroke? I’m too young for a stroke.”

“No one is too young to have a stroke.”

The doctor left while the nurse stayed and filled out his chart.

“Miss,” Job said to the nurse, “Could you please reach my family?”

“They’ve been contacted,” the nurse said without a smile.

It was another week before Zoe knocked on his door. He almost slept through her visit but awoke just as she was about to leave.

“Zoe?”

“Hey,” Zoe smiled. “I heard you woke up.”

“What happened?”

“You freaked out and assaulted Hendrix,” Zoe said. “He’s not pressing charges but George fired you personally.”

“Fuck,” Job whimpered, “All I wanted is a little recognition. Is that too much to ask for? No, destroying me would please George too much.”

Zoe, “Maybe it is your fault. You did it to yourself. We all fuck up. Learn from it, suck it up, and throw yourself back out there. You have no right to question George with all he’s done for you. Wrath kills the foolish men, and envy kills the dumb ones.

“Yet, I’m still here.”

Zoe looked over Job with pity, “I’m sorry there’s not more that I could do.”

Job nodded and Zoe backed up to the door, “Take care of yourself, would ya?”

She abandoned him in that hospital room and it was at this point that Job Stein gave up.

\_\_\_

They called Job a taxi when he was released from the hospital and he had no where else to go but home. When the car arrived, they took the wheelchair from him and he limped with the help of the cane to the back door. It was a struggle to get it open. His dominant right hand had become stiff.

He arrived at the brownstone just after sun set and the windows were dark. It seemed as if no one was home. He limped up the stoop and struggled to slip the key into the slot.

He entered the darkened living room and listened. The buzz of flies and skitter of rat claws. The old structure creaked on it’s foundation and the radiator popped and sizzled. A horrid stench clouded the air. He flipped on the switch and collapsed against the bookcase in shock.

“No,” Job gurgled, “No, no.”

Blood was spread across the walls and the nanny’s body was slumped against the fireplace. Her hand was boiling on the burning logs and her caved face hung with agony.

Job raced upstairs and found his wife lying face down with a bullet hole through her temple as if she was executed. Steve was seated at the vanity facing the mirror. The back of his head had a crater from a bullet and his brains slipped out of his chinless gaping mouth. \*How's it feel to get fucked?\* He only cared about his daughter. He stumbled down the hall and  dropped his shoulder into her door. It opened just slightly but was jammed. He kicked violently and the door eventually shoved the mass forward into a pool of blood. \*No\*. He scrambled for his daughter and lifted her limp body into his arms. He held her and she felt so light. As if she were made of air. \*No\*. He clenched her against his chest, heaving in hyperventilation. \*No, no\*. A peaceful smile was spread across her lifeless face. \*No\*.

\_\_\_

The police held him in a small interrogation room. He leaned in a chair across from two other chairs and a small desk. He waited for hours before the detectives entered and grilled him. There was no better suspect. Job knew that. The detectives knew that. There was no way around it. He had to find a way through to them. Homicide detective Miles Saunders wrote down on a yellow legal pad while Trent Rosetto was empty handed.

“What time did you arrive at the apartment?” Saunders said.

“I was discharged from the hospital at six o’clock,” Job hummed in thought and searched his memories, “so around six thirty.”

“Were you aware that your wife was having an affair?” Rosetto pushed.

“Yes.”

“How long did you know?” Saunders asked.

“I found out last night.”

“Last night?” Rosetto laughed. “Whoa.”

“I’m sure that would make you pretty angry,” Saunders led.

“Of course,” Job said, “but I would never—”

“How did you find out she was cheating?”

“I caught her.”

“Ouch,” Rosetto coughed. “That’s gotta hurt.”

“Yeah,” Job grumbled, “It did.”

“So you killed your family?” Rosetto said.

“No,” Job barked. “I would never do that. I loved them.”

“I bet it must have been hard raising a child with down syndrome,” Rosetto slipped out.

“No, you don’t get to do that.”

“Do what?”

“Use my daughter like that,” Job said. “She was perfect. She was the perfect little angel. You don’t get to do that.”

Job broke down in tears. He’d never cried like that before. Wailing. Sobbing. Whimpering. \*She was perfect\*.

They finally let him leave the station around 3:00 AM and urged him to stay close in case they had more questions. He stumbled into the street and his dysfunctional phone rang. \*Unknown Caller\*. He answered it out of habit and held it to his ear.

“Hello?”

“Job, it’s George Dowe.”

“Oh— Sir?”

“Listen, we need you to come in today.”

“You need me?”

“Yeah, um— Hendrix hasn’t responded in a couple days so I need you to step up.”

“Yeah, no. I— I can’t. Not today.”

“Don’t be foolish. This is the chance of a lifetime.""

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s all yours.”

“I— Uh—”

“So we can count on you, right?”

“Yeah, sure…”

“Great! We’ll see you in the morning.”

All of his rage consumed his actions. His mind shut off and he ran through the street screaming like a mad man. If a police officer would have seen him, he would have been sent right back to jail and the murder would have definitely been pinned on him. He couldn’t stop though. His senses were controlled by a high power. He fired off like a piston, cursing his job, wife, life. The heavens absorbed his dissipating prayers and spit back a gust of wind.

He arrived at his building and security stood up stiff at the sight of him.

“You’re not supposed to be here,” the security guard said.

They tried to cut him off but he leaped over the barrier. Job grabbed the elevator keys from behind the desk and sprinted to the stairwell. The security guards gave chase. He climbed the stairs in a fervor and entered the third story. He ran over to the elevator and pressed the up button. Job watched the door with anticipation as the stomping footsteps got closer. The door swung open and the securities guards scrambled toward him.

The elevator doors opened and he slid inside. Job slipped the key into the penthouse button and turned, pressing the door close button fervently as the security guards got closer. The doors pressed down as the security guards leaped. The door shut and there was a thud as the elevator rose to the Penthouse.

The door opened to a magnificent living room three stories tall. There was a balcony for each floor and the lights flickered warmly — their light blanketed by darkness. George Owen Dowe stepped out from his private study and stood over Job with an air of higher authority.

“What are you doing here?”

“Twenty four years,” Job said. “I’ve worked for you for twenty four years. Never once have you said thank you. Never once have you offered me a Christmas bonus. Why do you treat your best employees like shit? Oh, I know. Because you’re a goddamned asshole who exploits the hard work of good people like me. While we’re down there ruining our marriages and wasting our lives away, you sit up here in your ivory tower jacking off. Fuck you.”

“Are you done?”

“No, I’m not done. My family was murdered last night and you have the nerve to tell me that you need me? Now? I needed you and you just abandoned me. You’re the reason they’re dead. I looked up to you and I trusted you and this is what it’s gotten me.”

“Job,” George said.

“I just don’t get it,” Job continued, “I did everything you asked of me. I brought in countless accounts when no one knew our name. Yet, you have no mercy.”

“Job,” George tried again.

“What is it? What the fuck do you want from me?”

“Job, listen — I completely understand.”

“You understand?” Job cackled. “What on earth do you understand? You live in a different world than the rest of us.”

“I understand that you’re angry,” George said with ease. “I understand that you are hurt. We can focus on the past or we can look forward to the future. You can do whatever you want. Hell, hike the Appalachian Trail if you need to. Unfortunately, we can’t just stop our entire operation for you. That’s not how things work. We have to move on — with or without you. This opportunity will never happen again. Don’t miss it.”

George leaned forward on his desk and stared into Job’s soul. He knew that he had him. Job couldn’t respond. He was torn. George had implanted the smallest seed of doubt in his mind that ate away at his logic. He could choose a word to start with and it was apparent by George’s silence that they were done. There was nothing else to say. It was entirely up to Job.

\_\_\_

The second hand of the clock spun around the minute. It was 6:59 AM on a Saturday and the office was completely empty. Even the custodial staff was absent when they would usually be finishing up the bathrooms. The elevator opened and Job hobbled out. He had showered, cleaned up, and made himself somewhat presentable. He may have been smiling but his soul was being dragged through hell. Another day at the office.

90nno5,3,2018-07-21,[M4F] - Aunt gets the filling of her lifetime,IntentionallyDirtyPP,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/90nno5/m4f_aunt_gets_the_filling_of_her_lifetime/,"(Adult seeking other adult for roleplay.)

It had been several years since we'd seen each other, and I had grown since then. No longer the skinny little twig of a barely-teen, I had grown into a...well...slender adult. Not everything was in complete proportion, and the delight of various girlfriends had given me more than enough confidence for my age. You might even say I was more than a little cocky at times.

I'd had a bad crush on you all those years ago, masturbating my teenage cock furiously. Multiple times a day whenever you came over to take a dip in our pool, or even something as innocent as you simply visiting. It's not like going boys need much encouragement. 

You had cemented my desire for older women, and I had never forgotten it. So when you moved back, needing a place for the summer until you had your own place I encouraged it. I already wasn't going on the yearly family trip due to an internship I'd landed, and while I didn't necessarily think anything was going to happen just the thought of your delicious female flesh so close for an extended time was thrilling. Enough so that I had to spend an hour draining my balls before picking you up from time airport so I would not have a massive tent.

With the parents gone, the house and you were all mine, and if there was any chance I wasn't going to waste it. 

────────

Hello everyone, thank you for reading. I was envisioning an effort consensual or dubcon scenario, either way my character would be the sexual aggressor. 

I left a lot of details out, such as age of the aunt, marital status, and even personality. Make her your own so I can do the same. 

I tend towards the more.. intense scenarios and kinks and submissive partners, so please let me know what you are comfortable with.

I look forward to the conquest."

90oilq,11,2018-07-21,The Motivator [M/F] [prost] [oral],JackFisherBooks,sexystories,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexystories/comments/90oilq/the_motivator_mf_prost_oral/,"“You can do this, Mike. You can do this. You’re ready! You couldn’t be more ready if you tried.”

Michael Young said those words again and again as he paced restlessly in a small conference room. In just under an hour, he was scheduled for an interview that might very well determine the course of his life. He’d been busting his ass, working long hours and late nights at this company for nine years. After all that time and toil, the opportunity he’d been hoping for came along.

Six weeks ago, a new senior executive position opened in a newly-formed department. Whoever got that job wouldn’t just be taking over for some old employee who retired. They would be in a position to forge a bold new path for themselves and the company. It wouldn’t just be a promotion. It would be a clean slate with which to build a career to call his own.

Michael had been searching for that opportunity since he graduated college, having gone into debt and lived in crappy shared apartments for nearly six years. He only recently began driving a car that was less than 10 years old. Just paying off his debts wasn’t enough, though. Michael aspired to something more.

“This is what you worked for,” he told himself. “Nobody else will do this as well as you. You know that. Don’t you?”

That last part made him cringe, so much so that he had to stop pacing and lean on the conference table for support. He closed his eyes and cussed himself out for having such crippling doubt. That had been his biggest flaw ever since he started working, having lost out on more than one promotion because of it. His ex-girlfriend once told him his doubts made him falter and when he faltered, it was painfully obvious.

“You know. You know. You know, damn it!” Michael repeated, trying to hammer that into idea into his brain.

He checked his watch again. He now had 55 minutes left. Time was going painfully slow and he was already sweating bullets. At the rate he was going, he’d be a wreck before the interview started.

Michael refused to let that do him in. He already got much farther than most. Only five people were set to interview for the new position, him being one of them. His old supervisor even told him that the Board wasn’t looking to bring someone in from the outside. They wanted their new executive to come from within. They wanted someone who knew the company and was ambitious to build it up. That fit him to the letter.

Then again, those four other candidates probably thought the same. Some might even be more qualified, connected, or experienced than him, at least on paper. If he was to have any chance, he had to make a lasting impression in the interview.

He’d been practicing, mentally and in front of a mirror for nearly three days straight. Little things like sleep and relaxation had been exceedingly limited. He refused to use that as an excuse, though. He’d worked as hard as he could, preparing as best as he could. There was literally nothing else he or anyone could possibly do.

As he leaned on the desk, trying to purge his mind of all shreds of doubt, the door to the conference room opened. Having been told the room was supposed to be vacant all day, it caught him off guard.

“Michael Young? Is that you?” a female voice said.

“Yeah, who wants to…”

Michael stopped himself in mid-sentence. It wasn’t because he’d been overly shocked by the unexpected intrusion. It was because the intruder happened to be a tall, beautiful, and distinctly buxom woman in a black buckled sheath dress. Having become very familiar with the men and women who worked at the company, Michael didn’t recognize her and that was a telling sign.

“Um…I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said awkwardly, trying to collecting himself. “I’m just a little tense right now.”

“I can see that,” the woman said with a wry grin, “but if you are Michael, then I’m in the right place.”

“Are you sure? The facilities guy told me I’d have this room to myself for an hour. I’ve got this big interview coming up.”

“I know about the interview. I also know about this room being unoccupied for the day. That’s what I was hoping for. I’d rather not have any interruptions.”

There was a mysterious, but alluring subtext to her voice. Michael wasn’t sure what to make of it, but did not protest as the woman closed the door behind her, locked it, and set her purse aside.

As she walked over to him, he noticed something else about the woman that might or might not have been intentional. Not only was her dress somewhat undersized for her voluptuous figure, it did a poor job of containing her large breasts, so much so that he swore he could see her nipples poking out from the fabric. Having grown up in a house with three sisters, he could tell when a woman wasn’t wearing bra.

That alone hinted that the woman wasn’t the new intern in accounting. She couldn’t be the senior VP’s new assistant either, who was gay and extremely uptight about the office dress code. The way she walked and the way she carried herself made clear that she did not work at the company, but her poise gave the impression she owned every room she entered.

“My name is Elizabeth Sweet,” she said, now standing so close that he could smell her perfume. “I’m a consultant, of sorts. Your old friend Oliver hired me to help you before your interview.”

“Ollie hired you?” Michael said with a raised eyebrow. “Oliver Owen, the same guy who hired strippers for our college graduation party and still somehow married my ex-supervisor’s daughter?”

“Yep! That’s him,” Elizabeth affirmed. “He’s what you might call a novel thinker in the field of human resources.”

“That’s the least vulgar way to describe Ollie’s approach to management, but I’ll go with it.”

“For the past year, he’s hired me a few times to help motivate those he feels has potential. He told me you have more than anyone he’s come across and paid me extra to help you realize it.”

Michael opened his mouth to respond, but fell silent when Elizabeth moved in closer and snaked her arms around his neck. The warmth of her body, the soft touch of her smooth skin, and the devious glint in her eye helped captivate him to a point where he forgot about his earlier doubts. On top of that, he could feel her breasts pressing up against his chest through his suit, confirming that she wasn’t wearing a bra.

It also confirmed that Elizabeth Sweet – which he doubted was her real name – wasn’t the kind of consultant who lectured companies on leadership skills. Michael had been to enough strip clubs and bachelor parties – mostly with Oliver, no less – to recognize a sex worker. That helped him piece together what his friend had done for him.

“Remind me to thank and/or kill Oliver when this is over,” Michael said.

“It’s probably best you decide after you get your promotion,” replied Elizabeth in an overtly seductive voice.

“After? You sure sound certain.”

“And so should you,” she retorted. “You probably think I’m just some bimbo your buddy hired to boost your spirits…that this is just some elaborate prank meant to help you loosen up.”

“You don’t strike me as a bimbo, Ms. Sweet,” he said, “but to be fair, that sounds exactly like something Ollie would do.”

“I don’t think you give your friend enough credit. You see, I am in the business you think I am, but not to the extent you assume. I have a specialty, so to speak. I have a talent for gauging someone’s potential and helping them realize it.”

As if to make her point, she trailed her hand down his chest and over his torso. Even through his dress shirt, he could feel the warmth of her touch. It sent shivers through his body, which was a welcome contrast from all the anxious feelings he’d been experiencing.

Then, when she reached his pants and traced around his groin, Michael felt his dick spring to life. He was somewhat embarrassed at first, but a coy grin from Elizabeth helped reassure him. For all he knew, he’d just made her point.

“In my extensive experience with men, there’s a considerable difference between who have great ambition and those who actually pursue it,” she went on, her hand still rubbing the outline of his cock through his pants.

“What kind of difference?” asked Michael, trying his best to distract himself.

“It’s akin to the difference between wanting something and really desiring it,” Elizabeth said, using very erotic overtones for that last part. “Most people want that big promotion, a fat raise, or a beautiful woman to rub their cock. To desire it, though, you need to be extra motivated. Not just to work hard, either. It has to really matter to you.”

While still rubbing over his pants with one hand, she used the other to grasp his wrist and guide his hand to her butt. Having been leaning back on the conference table, it left him off-balance. He quickly regained it, though, reaching around with his other hand so that he had her heart-shaped butt in her grasp.

Even through her dress, it felt so good. Her presence, her body, and her voice just radiated so much sex appeal. He found himself giving her butt a quick squeeze, evoking a favorable response in Elizabeth. In fact, she seemed genuinely aroused by it.

“I can tell you’re motivated, Michael,” she said. “I sense this promotion does matter to you.”

“Is that really all you sense?” Michael said with a half-grin.

“I could spend the next several hours documenting all the things I see in you…your demeanor, your sense of passion, and even your taste in clothing,” said Elizabeth, “since we don’t have much time though, I’ll cut to the chase.”

“And hopefully it doesn’t involve my taste in men’s fashion.”

“It doesn’t. It involves the finding the necessary strength a man needs do more than pursue his ambition. If he’s going to get what he desires, he needs to be motivated into tapping that strength. That’s where I come in.”

The voluptuous woman gave his groin another squeeze. At that point, there was a noticeable bulge in his pants. Her touch, her presence, and her seductive tone had gotten his blood flowing and his heart racing in just the right ways. Considering how stressed he’d been moments ago, it was quite a feat, which said just as much about Elizabeth than it did about him.

With that bulge so visible, the beautiful woman reached behind and grasped his wrists. From there, he guided his hands up from her butt onto the zipper of her dress.

“Here,” she told him. “Help me out of this tight dress.”

“But…” Michael began, his mind racing almost as much as his heart.

“It’s okay. I checked with the facilities guy too. There won’t be any interruptions.”

He smiled awkwardly and did as she requested, unzipping the back of her dress all the way down. Someone walking in on them at that point was only one of his concerns, but as soon as he got a glimpse of Elizabeth’s half-naked body, all those concerns disappeared.

Once the dress fell to the floor in a crumbled heap, the beautiful woman was in nothing but a black thong and overpriced heels. The sight of her smooth skin, blemish-free skin filled him with a mix of awe and desire. Her breasts, especially, caught his attention.

“Whoa,” Michael said, much to her amusement.

They were so big and round. How that dressed contained them comfortably was beyond his understanding. He doubted they were natural. He knew the signs of surgically-enhanced cleavage as well as any man with an internet connection and a healthy male libido.

He was tempted to find out for certain, but before he could even ask, Elizabeth kicked her dress aside and guided his hands onto her breasts. Beyond just confirming they were fake, they gave him an intoxicating taste of her wondrous flesh.

“Go on,” Elizabeth told him. “Feel my breasts. Squeeze them a little. Show me your strength.”

“Um…okay,” was all he could get out.

Like a kid in a candy store, Michael began fondling her breasts. He wasn’t too firm, but he wasn’t gentle either. After squeezing her butt earlier, he got the impression that she appreciated shows of strength. The way she moaned when he squeezed her luscious tits, giving the nipples a little pinch for good measure, further affirmed that sentiment.

“Mmm…that’s it. I like that!” she purred. “Your hands a strong. Strength comes from ambition. Ambition comes from desire…really powerful desire.”

“Powerful…yeah,” Michael said distantly.

It sounded like a mind game, but it worked. He soon found himself rubbing and kneading her breasts with more fervor, really enjoying the way they felt in his hands. He wanted it…desired it. As such, he seized it. Doing so didn’t just fuel his arousal. It made him feel stronger.

It seemed to have a similar effect on Elizabeth. As she moaned, she reached between his legs again and rubbed the bulge in his pants. He felt his dick tense under her touch again, reflecting another growing desire. As that feeling intensified between them, she leaned in a bit closer and kissed the side of his face before. Then, she whispered something into his ear.

“Undo your belt, unzip your pants, and sit down on the table,” Elizabeth said. “I’m going to suck your dick.”

“Is that supposed to make me stronger?” he asked

“In a sense,” she replied.

Whether or not that was part of the mind games didn’t matter to Michael at that point. Now feeling both aroused and motivated, he did as she asked. He released his grip on her breasts, albeit reluctantly, and undid his pants. He couldn’t get them off fast enough, even fumbling somewhat to push them down his legs along with his underwear. The presence of a raging boner didn’t help, but being so motivated, he got them off.

“Hmm…I see some of your strength is already endowed,” she teased upon seeing his erect dick.

“Somehow, I think I’m going to need more,” Michael said as he sat up on the table.

“That’s why I’m here…in a sense.”

She snickered seductively, carrying herself like a temptress and a guide. Michael could honestly say he’d never been more motivated to see where this went, with or without his pants on.

Once on the table, his pants falling off his legs in the process, Elizabeth dropped to her knees and positioned herself between his legs. She showed plenty of ambition of her own, grasping the base of his cock with one hand and reaching into her panties with another. He saw plenty of desire in her as well, not to mention uncanny sex appeal.

“Time to taste the extent of your strength,” she said, licking her lips in ambition. “Let’s see if I can bring a little extra out!”

“I’d…like to see that too,” said Michael.

That sounded less confident than he’d hoped, but that didn’t dissuade the ambitious woman. With the kind of intent that any businessperson would respect, she leaned in and enveloped his cock with her mouth. As soon as he felt those soft lips and wet tongue on his shaft, he leaned back on the table and moaned.

“Ohhh fuck!” he gasped. “That’s…real strong.”

She responded by unleashing a focused onslaught of oral sex, sucking and licking his member with a skill that was nothing short of professional. Given his situation, seeking to prove his own profession competence, there was something uniquely fitting about that.

From feeling so uptight and tense mere moments ago, Michael felt a welcome wave of contentment as steady streams of pleasure coursed up through his body. That feeling of hot, slithering bliss around his manhood left him feeling empowered as well as aroused. He eventually had to remove his blazer to better-cope with the heat. However, as good as it felt, he still wanted more.

There was that ambition within him…that powerful desire that went beyond a simple want. Getting his dick sucked by a beautiful woman during a work day was nice, but there was potential for so much more and he sought to realize it.

“Mmm…Elizabeth,” Michael grunted, “That feels so good, but…”

“But what?” she asked, briefly ceasing her sucking, but still stroking his cock.

“I want more,” he told her.

“You want more?”

“No!” he said with more intent. “Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to fuck you on this table. I’m going to fuck you hard. And I’m going to fuck you until we come.”

“And that’s what you desire?”

“Fuck desire! That’s what’s going to happen. I’m certain of it.”

Michael said those words with more strength than anything he’d ever uttered to that point in his life. It surprised him much more than Elizabeth. If anything, Elizabeth seemed smug about it, as though her suspicions of him had been vindicated.

Regardless of vindication, she gave his cock one last lick before rising back to her feet. She then casually slid her panties down her thighs, revealing her perfectly-groomed womanhood, which had been fondled to full arousal during her oral teasing.

“Very well, Mr. Young,” Elizabeth said in an official tone. “Do as you say. Use your strength to realize that certainty.”

“Oh I intend to do all that and then some!”

Flushed with confidence, arousal, and overall desire to fuck a beautiful woman, Michael got up off the desk and took the now-naked Elizabeth in his arms. She kept goading him with that seductive gaze of hers, daring him to fuck her as hard as he promised and then some. He had every intention of delivering.

With strength radiating from every muscle, he turned her around and bend her over the conference room table. Her breasts now mashed up against the polished wood and her heart-shaped butt pointed towards him, Michael grabbed her by the hips and positioned himself behind her.

There was no hesitation or reservation of any kind. As soon as the tip of his dick made contact with her wet opening, he drove his hips forward, thrusting his rigid length into her womanly depths. That hot feeling of her flesh surrounding his was incredible. Moreover – and more importantly, with respect to his pending interview – it brought out a new strength within him.

“Ooh Michael!” the beautiful woman gasped. “Your dick…so deep and powerful. I love it!”

The sound of her voice – and the message her words conveyed, more so – inspired Michael to fuck Elizabeth with more energy than he had ever dared with a woman. He treated the act of having sex with her as the most important, meaningful task in his life at that moment. If the sheer volume of her moans were any indication, that effort showed.

He was intense, but not rough with his motions, imparting a unique intensity into each thrust. The way her body rocked with each movement, her nails raking down the wood as her naked skin rubbed up against the table, reverberated with his passionate energy. It wasn’t just the sex itself that conveyed the feeling. He made full use of his hands, reaching around with one to fondle her clitoris and using the other to squeeze her butt.

It didn’t just reflect his desire. It demonstrated his certainty with respect to delivering as he promised. He was going to fuck her. He was going to make her climax. There was no doubt or uncertainty. It was going to happen and he was going to make it happen. No other thought crossed his mind.

“You’re going…to come,” Michael grunted in between thrusts. “I’m going to…make you…come!”

Every thrust of his hips, providing the heated rhythm of his manly flesh pumping into her feminine depths, pushed her closer to that goal. The way she bucked her hips and arched her back helped supplement his motions, reflecting her own desire to achieve that same peak. Through that focused desire, shared by a common motivation, he sent Elizabeth to the brink of orgasm.

“Oohhh Michael!” she panted. “You’re…you’re going to do it! You’re going to…make me…come!”

He barely heard those words and the moans that came with it. Michael was so focused that the world around him became muted. He just kept working his hips, fucking her pussy and fondling her clit until she crossed that special threshold.

When it finally happened, there was no ambiguity. The beautiful, voluptuous woman closed her eyes, threw her head back, and let out a cry of ecstasy as she achieved her climax. Michael finally slowed his thrusting, enjoying the fruits of his labor.

“I did it,” he said. “I am that strong.”

He couldn’t help but grin in accomplishment, feeling he pussy throb around his cock while her euphoric moans echoed throughout the room. Beyond just making a beautiful woman come, Michael felt a rush of confidence he didn’t know he had. It was like tapping into a hidden well of energy, filling him with something he didn’t quite understand, but embraced none-the-less.

From that intense rush, he also recalled his lingering desire, which remained unsatisfied. Having given Elizabeth her taste of ecstasy, he was ready to embrace his own.

“Now, I’m going to keep fucking you,” Michael told her. “I’m going to fuck you until I come and I’m going to shoot my load on your tits.”

“Yes…do it, Michael!” Elizabeth said, still drunk on the ecstasy.

It sounded like she hadn’t forgotten her desires, either. There was no way an ambitious woman like her would’ve been satisfied with just getting fucked to orgasm. She sought more than that and so did he.

Making use of his newfound strength, he took Elizabeth by the waist and repositioned her, turning her around and lifting her up slightly off the floor. He then set her on the table, pushing her legs apart so he had a clear path back into her pussy.

Without hesitation, he got between her legs again and thrust his dick back into her throbbing depths. Now leaning back on her arms, Elizabeth locked her gaze with his. That intensity in her eyes that he’d seen earlier was stronger than ever. Unlike before, though, he matched it every step of the way.

“That’s it, Michael. Fuck me!” Elizabeth urged. “Fuck me with that strength of yours!”

“That what you call…motivation?” he said, matching her tone.

“Fuck yes!”

He wasn’t sure if that was confirmation or just him hitting an extra sensitive spot in her pussy that supplemented her post-orgasmic state. Michael didn’t bother speculating. He just their sex, focusing once again and delivering as he said.

He was more fervent and direct with his humping, really working his manhood inside her with unfretted desire. Holding onto her thighs, watching her breasts bounce every time he rocked her body with his movements, he didn’t just pursue that ultimate peak. He charged towards it at full speed. The end result was a direct path to that sweet, euphoric release.

“Ohhh yeah!” Michael grunted as he felt the coming onslaught. “I’m ready, Elizabeth.”

“Me too, my future executive.”

Her choice of words just added more satisfaction to the blissful rush that followed. As soon as he was in a position to blow his load, he withdrew his cock, pulled Elizabeth’s body closer to his, and aimed his throbbing manhood at her breasts.

Holding his dick in both hands, he let out a deep, powerful grunt as he released his manly fluid onto her amble cleavage. An eruption of intense, empowering pleasure followed. Elizabeth, not content to play a passive role, pressed them together to gather up every drop. She even rubbed them up against his cock, adding an extra level of intimacy to this act of strength.

“There!” Elizabeth said with triumphant confidence. “That’s how I know you have the necessary desire.”

“Yeah…that’s a lot of desire,” Michael said breathlessly.

“And now you’re motivated to pursue it. Am I right?”

Michael needed a moment to come down from his orgasmic peak. His legs were weak, his dick throbbed, and light ripples of pleasure were still reverberating throughout his body. He’d also wrinkled his dress shirt and tie, thanks to the sweat he’d worked up, but that didn’t bother him in the slightest.

As he leaned on the table, the naked Elizabeth still sitting there with her legs casually draped over the edge, he came to a realization. In doing so, all that doubt and anxiety that had made him a nervous wreck seemed so trivial. It was no longer a matter of whether or not his interview would go well. He already knew the outcome.

“You’re right,” he told her. “I know what I want and desire. I’m going to that interview, I’m getting that promotion, and I’m going to be the strongest goddamn executive this company has ever known.”

“Spoken like a man of strength and confidence,” Elizabeth said proudly.

“And it’s all thanks to your sexy brand of motivation,” said Michael as he began getting dressed. “I’m ready now. I’m not just confident, this time. I’m certain!”"
90pbgr,1,2018-07-21,Quitting Work,graphicbread,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/90pbgr/quitting_work/,"Hi guys,

I got really worked up this morning about going to work today and just starting freaking out. Ended up having a panic attack and crying non stop so I text my mom asking for advice but she doesn’t understand how much this job sucks the life out of me and it really brings out the worst in my anxiety. She knows I’m on meds and have been to CBT and all that but still thinks I’m just a worrier. She won’t even say the word anxiety or acknowledge I’ve been climbing my way out of depression the last three years. 

Ended up calling my dad, who convinced me to call in sick, and went to his house to hide out for the day. Only thing is I’ve gotten warnings about missing days and leaving work sick due to my anxiety before. Just last month I got called into a meeting where they told me I was letting them down and that I cannot keep doing this. I know calling in sick today will be the last straw and I’ll probably be dismissed next week. I can’t even bring myself to try and work tomorrow. I have to quit. I’m planning on handing in my resignation in the morning and just apologise for everything. 

Now that worrying about work will stop draining my energy, worrying about money will. This job is only a weekend job for college but it keeps my car running and gives me spending money since my parents aren’t well off. I have enough money coming in from an internship to keep me going for a month or two but when I start back college in September I’m gonna be struggling. I’ll figure it out hopefully. 

I just wish my mom understands what I’m dealing with. I know she wants the best for me but her yelling whenever I have a problem is just getting too much. I’m afraid to go home because she’ll be there and start interrogating me. I just wish I wasn’t like this. My chest hurts so bad. "
90piml,4,2018-07-21,[Question] How do you guys spend money on yourselves?,chu-chu8,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/90piml/question_how_do_you_guys_spend_money_on_yourselves/,"So growing up my nMum was the sort of N that would constantly tell me how poor we were and how much money I was wasting. Of course this was not true - in fact my parents are very, very wealthy, think 'casually buying some acres of land behind the house and building a stable on top of it and buy horses to put in it just for fun'-wealthy.

But due to all the gaslighting and stuff of course me and my GCbrother would believe her for a long time. Now I know how fucked up it was that she would do things like spent up to 50 euros a day just for sweets that she would eat the smallest amount of and then throw away every day, while screaming at me for 20 minutes for buying a 99 cent-Shower gel instead of the cheapest 79 cent-one.

But I still struggle with it a lot. They are way to wealthy for me to get any state support, so I was dependent on their money for a long time during my education. Finishing in less than a year now, wish me luck! It was a hard time, getting a budget that is only half of what jobless people get through welfare support here.

But I pulled through and am like the queen of saving up now. That's the good part. The bad part: I was finally able to rip all the saving accounts that other family members put up for me over the years from my parents. In germany it's not as easy to get access to them as a parent, so they were untouched. nMum pushed hard for me to just give her power of attorney over them so she could manage those things for me, but hell no!

So now I finally have enough money to get through my education, even if some things go wrong. After stressing out over finding enough students to tutor for extra money all the time to pay for meds for a chronic illness that our healthcare doesn't cover it SHOULD be nice and relaxing - but I just can't.

I have such a hard time spending money on myself! It has always been like this, whenever someone would gift me money for my birthday or something and my brain was like ""Wow! We could finally buy a cheap new shirt or something else nice!"" my heart was always immediately like ""Nope!""

I just pushed through a really cool but stressfull internship and it's summer break now: My friends and a therapist all think that I should just lay back and buy something nice for once, have a good time. But it's SO. HARD. I just bought a slightly more expensive hand lotion because the internship totally fucked up my hands - and though it was something that I really needed I felt bad for days.

Today I tried really hard to buy some groceries I usually wouldn't, because I love cooking and trying new things. It's not even stuff I will never be able to use again or something, it was maybe 5 Euro more than I usually spend. But oh my god. I thought I would get a panic attack. I was milimetres away from ugly crying in front of some poor old lady stocking the shelves of my favourite asia shop.

So yeah, I'm working on it, but all the time I feel like I'm wasting money on unnecessary things when I definitely will need it someday for more important stuff - and even when it's a super safe situation I still feel like I don't deserve it.

How do you guys do this?

TL;DR: Finally have money! Feel unable to spend anything of it."
90pj9e,46,2018-07-21,[GEAR] My new guitar was played by Steve Lukather,Krone975,Guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/90pj9e/gear_my_new_guitar_was_played_by_steve_lukather/,"Hey r/guitar!  
 

20 yr old Dutch student here. Been on guitar for about 8 years now.  
Currently doing my internship of 6 months in Nice, France. Brought a lot of stuff from home but unfortunately didnt have spare room to bring my Epi G-400/Bassbreaker 15W combo with me.  
After going crazy for 2 weeks from not being able to play, I decided screw it: I'm buying a guitar for here. My financial situation hasn't been optimal as I've had trouble with a landlord who ripped me off so my options were limited.  
I didn't care much however as I just needed something to play (probably second-hand).  
 

Came into the local guitar store and explained my situation to the employee, who was extremely helpful.  
I basically had the choice between 2 squier strats.  
 \- A regular black and white Bullet, good tone, €135  
 \- A PINK B-stock Mini (3/4 size) V2, €90  
 

After playing both through their most cost-effective amp, a Fender Champion 20, I had to be really honest with myself and came down with the fact that I simply preferred the Pink Mini for the feel, the tone, playability and just generally how excited I got about it.

Now, I'm a guy and I never woulda thought that I'd be going home with a guitar that has all the characteristics of a Barbie-house, but it just ticked all the boxes so I took it!  
Already paid for it and everything but then this happened:  


I'm a bit of a Toto fan and saw their concert in Amsterdam last March with a good friend of mine. Another employee comes out of the stockroom and goes: ""Hey, that's the first guitar Steve played when he came in here.""  
And I'm like: ""Steve?"" ""Yeah, you know the guy from Toto?""

As you can imagine I was over the fucking moon when I heard that and just made my purchase 10x more exciting. I walked out of that store with the best feeling ever. They took a picture with him which was posted on Instagram, I'll put it down below. 

Afterwards the guy who helped me said ""Once you're done with your internship you can come back here and we can make a deal for the gear so you can get some back for it. The Champion they can get back, but just as he well-understood: I'm definitely keeping the Mini.  
 

Even though it's technically a downgrade from what I'm used to, I can't express how incredibly enthousiastic I am about this new set-up and will be trying to learn some good ol' Toto licks for sure

Recently I got an offer on linkedin from a recruiter for an NGA internship. I’m sure plenty of people get this offer but I was just curious as to whether anyone here has done an internship before with the NGA or has worked with the NGA and what their experiences are like. There’s several locations where they offer the internship and I was curious as to what would be the best place out of the locations to intern in. Additionally I was curious as to what the interview process was like I see that they give you a background check and even have to take a polygraph test. I have smoked pot in the past year and was wondering if will I be completely disregarded from the opportunity ?

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"
90qi1q,0,2018-07-21,"How to Kill a Friendship [fanfic][Omin/ Grandmother Night (aka Rosie Beestinger)/ inconsequential original character][Violence, intrigue, scones]",Tangwystle,AcquisitionsInc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcquisitionsInc/comments/90qi1q/how_to_kill_a_friendship_fanficomin_grandmother/," A dark story of Grandmother Night and Omin Dran that I really hope is not even cannon adjacent. I don’t know where it came from, but I’m glad it’s out now.  Edited very slightly from the ""C""Team reddit post.

“What is your price, Grandmother?”  

Rosie considered briefly. “He is a friend. That will cost more—a lot more.”

“You are my first choice. You have access others do not. I’m sure if he is truly a friend, you will see that he is dead and does not suffer over much. Others I could engage might not be so kind.”

“That may well be true.” 

“Name your price, Grandmother. Then we will see if I can meet it.”

Rosie considered less briefly. “I want a thousand perfect diamonds, each no smaller than a ducks egg.” It was a price she found absurdly high. Ridiculously high. It would cost less to slay a prince. 

“He must be a good friend,Grandmother.”

“He has been a very good friend.” 

The stranger did not hesitate, said aloud “I wish I had a thousand and one diamonds, just as Grandmother has requested in some convenient vessel to transporting them.”

Rosie’s old heart skipped two beats. A small pouch appeared in the stranger’s hand. He opened the pouch to see nothing but velvet blackness. His hand withdrew three large diamonds. He placed all but one of the diamonds back in the bag of holding and offered it to Rosie. He had met the price she asked. This murder was now a sacred duty. Failure to succeed carried dire consequences. She had other responsibilities now. Innocents in her care would suffer if she did not follow through. Rosie snatched the pouch from the out stretched hand and turned her back quickly, cursing herself. She should have asked for ten times what she did.

\-------------------------

“I thought I should warn you that someone tried to hire me to kill you, Omin. But I have the orphanage now plus the cartographer duties. I prefer that work to the other. You should probably look into some more security, it didn’t seem like I was their only candidate.”

Omin sat thoughtfully behind his desk. “Hmm.” 

“If you want, I could screen some candidates for you. It wouldn’t be any trouble. I owe you so much.”

“Hmm.” Omin held his palms together, the index finger side across his mouth as he considered the information Rosie had just given him and the offer. “No. I have someone in mind. However, would it be possible for you to use your sources to gather any more information on this person that wants me dead? Billable at your usual rate, of course.” 

“That would be my great pleasure, Omin.” 

There was a soft knock just before an intern entered with a tray of tea warm scones and finger sandwiches. 

“Will you stay for tea, Grandmother? I find Vera’s scones quite exceptional.”  

Rosie noted that he addressed her as ‘Grandmother’, indication she should stay in her unofficial capacity, and not as a franchisee or friend. “Scones, you say? Sounds delightful”

Omin addressed the intern without looking at her. “Vera, please put up the ‘do not disturb under pain of death’ sign as you leave.”

The intern nodded, settled the tray and poured the first cup of tea before leaving the two alone to their conversation.

“Oh, she’s cute! Have you thought of asking her to stay for tea?” 

“Always the matchmaker… No, she isn’t an intern actually. I did a service for an old friend from school, and they ‘lent’ me the girl as payment. It’s not quite what it sounds. She is, however, covered by the ‘non-fraternization’ clause, that keeps her somewhat safe from Jim and Viari. Plus she has made vows of silence and chastity. And as I said, makes excellent scones.”

Rosie sighed. “What a waste. I never understood the need for those kinds of vows. But, to each their own, I suppose.”

Omin sipped the tea thoughtfully. Took a bite of a scone. Blueberry with at little lemon zest. “Have you found out any more about ‘The Six’?”

“None but Splug have surfaced. He seems a little happier without the death curse, though.” Rosie tried one of the little sandwiches. Chicken salad with small cubes of apple on thin slices of lightly toasted rustic bread. “Mm. Delicious.” Rosie added a little milk to her tea. “You know you have not made peace with those Zhentarim folks either.”

“They’re zelots. There’s no making peace with their kind. But, maybe a fruit basket? Or hire a couple of their mercs for some frivolous little job…”

Rosie almost snorted her tea. “Fruit basket? No, I don’t think that’s the sort of currency they’d respect. I don’t like the idea of hiring them either. But I would love to see them open a fruit basket from Acq Inc. I wonder how many detection spells they would waste on it.”

“Hmm. I think I prefer to stay under their radar.”

Rosie, finished with her sandwich reached for a scone. “I’ll *interview* Splugoth again. Keep him under some discrete surveillance. 

“Would you mind pouring another cup for me?” Omin asked a little sheepishly. “one sugar, no milk, a little lemon.”

“Oh, not at all.” Rosie took Omin’s empty cup, filled it from the teapot, added the sugar and lemon, and returned it to him on the saucer. 

Omin stirred the cup, clinked the spoon gently against the lip of the cup before taking a sip. “Perfect, Grandmother. I would expect nothing less.” 

“Well, I suppose if there isn’t anything else?” Rosie put her cup, saucer and plate neatly back on the tray. “I suppose I should be on my way.” She noticed the long afternoon shadows lying on the floor behind his desk. It was a very sturdy looking chair too. “I’ll let you know if I find anything new.”

“As always, Grandmother, your discretion is most valuable to me.”

“Goes without saying.”

“Oh, if you don’t mind, you can flip the sign as you leave. See Rolf in accounting if you think you need any per diem to get started.”

\-------------------------

Rosie arrived the next day in Omin’s office with a report of some of Splugoth’s associates, their whereabouts and some of their shady business dealings, but no proof that any of them knew about ‘The Six’. Again, Vera served them tea, sandwiches, and raspberry tartlets today. 

The day after, Rosie found Vera seated across from Omin engaged in a game of chess. It looked like she was holding her own. That was a very good sign. Rosie was slightly proud of herself for putting that little bug in his ear. Chaste or not, Omin really needed some female companionship. It was too bad he only now took her advice.

Vera quickly vacated the seat for Rosie and poured her a cup of warm tea. She looked at Omin before she left, expecting him to ask her to hang up the sign or for more lemon. When he made no comment, she nodded and left the office, closing the door very softly.

Rosie examined the game board. “It almost looks like she’s taking it easy on you, Omin.”

Omin chuckled uncomfortably; maybe his ears took on a faint pink tinge. “Yes, I think every time I up my game, she does too. I’m not certain how this will play out. “

“Very steamily, is my hope.” Rosie sipped her cup, but didn’t take a sandwich today. “I still haven’t found out the identity of the one that offered me the job, but I do suspect Zhents. Call it a gut instinct. I have nothing else to go on.”

“I trust your instincts, Grandmother. More than most.”

“Is that new?”

“Is what new?”

Rosie made a vague gesture to his desk. “There. On the corner. That very sparkly thing.” She walked to the desk and palmed one of the diamonds onto it. 

“How did? That wasn’t there earlier. I wonder if Vera…I’d better put that up for safekeeping.” Omin took the gem and tucked it in a desk drawer. “Oh, that reminds me. I found something that might interest you, Grandmother.” He sat back in his desk chair, the very sturdy looking one and opened another drawer. 

Grandmother Night, noticing that the shadows had just touched the back of Omin’s chair, bent them to her will. It would have to be quick. It would have to be now.

Omin found something around his throat, tightening mercilessly. Then his hands and arms bound to the arms of his chair. He strained against his shadowy restraints. The one around his neck…was so tight he couldn’t get out the words to a spell or a call for help, the ones around his hands, his fingers, he couldn’t make any of the signs to cast. He kicked back from the desk hard with his feet, sending the chair backward, but before it could thud against the floor, more shadowy fingers tightened around his legs, pulling the chair back down on all four legs. His vision began to fill with bright spots, but he heard Grandmother Night say to him “It’s not personal. Just a job. I hope you can forgive me.”

Rosie, wiping away one errant tear from her eye, watched as the struggling ceased and her friend slumped. She didn’t dispel the shadow for several more minutes, just in case. The shadows transferred Omin’s body to slump over his desk; it looked as if he might have just fallen asleep. Three deep cleansing breaths later, she said out loud “I’ll see you tomorrow, dear,” closed the door to the office and flipped the sign from “Enter at your own Peril” to “Do not Disturb.”

\-------------------------

Vera watched from the tall thin window in her room as Rosie walked down the street, and disappeared in the crowd of taller people surrounding her. Remembering that she should not run or draw excessive attention to herself, she forced herself to walk slowly back to Omin’s office. The sign had been flipped over from the way she left it. She knocked softly six quick raps with her knuckle, prayed for his surly “What do you want?” that didn’t come. She opened the door, entered, and closed it behind her before she looked up. 

Omin was slumped over his desk, his hand holding a dry quill. It did almost look like he had fallen asleep. She waited. She waited. She waited. As instructed she waited. She found that some tears had pooled, but were not yet spilling over. She waited.

Vera started as she heard Omin’s sharp intake of breath. Then another, then he sat up, sat back in his chair. “I’m so glad that worked. Oh, don’t cry. Everything went perfectly. There, there…” Omin patted Vera’s shoulder absently. “Now. Part two.”

The girl had wiped away her tears and stood waiting for the next instruction. “Did you get everything we need?”

Vera nodded silently, her eyes a little red. 

“Oh, it’s fine now. No one tries to kill a dead man. It’s the safest way.  This was really the only risky part and it went off without a hitch.”

Vera nodded again, silently, but sniffed. 

“Do you think you can help me get my clothes on the dead clone? I understand if it’s too upsetting for you, but I could really use the help.”

Vera nodded, took a deep breath and rolled up her sleeves."
90qlk5,373,2018-07-21,"[Fm] Closing in on 40, I impulsively decided to let go of my good girl ways...",ChelleeCannons,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/90qlk5/fm_closing_in_on_40_i_impulsively_decided_to_let/,"It had been at least a year since my last relationship ended.

That must have been the only reason I didn't shut him down from the start.

One long, depressing year of mourning, frustration, and a handful of bad dates. Working at the library didn't exactly create a lot of opportunities to meet single men.

One year without sex. Even longer, really, considering the last few months with Peter had not been a time we were getting along.

That's the only explanation. That, and maybe the fact that I'd had a few drinks.

It was a Thursday night. I was in a strange town sitting in a bar without a date. And I was being hit on by a guy who was barely half my age. I was about to turn 40. He couldn't have been more than 23. Mathematically, he was young enough to be my son.

And, yet, I wasn't doing a thing to discourage him.

It was the weekend of my intern's wedding. Rachel had just finished her undergraduate degree the previous spring. She was in graduate school and working on her masters in library science. That's how she'd come to work for me. We'd developed a pretty good relationship, despite our age difference. She told me that she thought of me as the ""cool"" aunt she'd never had--which surprised me. Nobody had ever considered me ""cool"" when I was her age. When she'd invited me to her wedding I felt flattered and obliged to attend, even though it was out of town and I had to drive down on my own. I'd come down that day to the quiet little beach town and the group of people who'd already arrived decided to get together in a bar near the hotel.

Robin was one of the groomsmen. He wasn't the best looking of the bunch and not the most polished, but he was attractive--tall and lean with a fit body. He was a bit dorky in the way most young men are, even if they don't realize it. But he was also apparently the most confident. Or maybe that was just because he'd drank the most. And because he happened to be the one sitting next to me at the bar as the crown thinned out and guests started heading back to the hotel.

Ninety percent of the time I would have just found the flirting cute, a bit silly, and would have politely sent him on his way. But it had been so long for me...and I was drinking...and out of town...at a wedding, which always seems to make a single person feel a little bit lonely.

I've always been a ""good"" girl. I was late to develop and a little plump growing up and in college. I was shy. I didn't have many close friends. As a result, I turned to books. I went to a college that was predominantly female and got a degree that few men get. And then I went into a profession dominated by women. By the time I'd really come into my own--physically and mentally--I had already become the type of adult woman who prefers quiet evenings at home and long term relationships over playing the field. I always assumed one of those relationship would lead to marriage, but it hadn't worked out that way for various reasons.

With long blond hair, a fit body, and curves for days, I knew I'd developed into the type of woman that could catch a man's eye. But, I've always felt awkward in social situations and have never been particularly outgoing, so I never seem to hit it off with men.

But none of that seemed to matter to Robin. He'd started out conservatively. It was obvious that he was flirting, but he wasn't being overt.

""I've always liked women older than me,"" he said at one point. ""They just seem more intelligent than women my age."" It sounded like a rehearsed line of bullshit, but I smiled politely.

But the more he drank, the more forward he became. And I'd catch him staring at my body.

I wasn't dressed very provocatively--but it was less conservative than my usual style. I had on black heels and stockings with a black sundress covered in a very bright, floral pattern. It seemed appropriate for the beach. It had a full skirt that came past my knees and a V-neckline that couldn't help but show off my chest.

That's where I kept finding Robin's eyes. On my tits. He'd start off looking me in the eyes when he was speaking, but eventually they'd drift down in the most obvious fashion.

Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was being out of down. Or maybe I was just happy to have someone pay so much attention to me after such a long layoff. But I made a conscious decision to play along. To flirt back just a little. To see how he responded. It seemed it would be good for a laugh.

""You know, you're very beautiful, Chellee,"" he said. ""How old are you?""

""A lady never answers that question,"" I said. ""Aren't you old enough to know better?""

""How old do you think I am?"" he asked.

I guessed correctly that he was 23.

""Almost 24, though. In a couple of months. Won't you tell me how old you are?"" He flashed a crooked smile. I wondered if that was something that had worked for him with girls his own age.

""How old do you think I am?"" I asked.

""I don't know. Thirty-three?""

I couldn't honestly tell if he was trying to flatter me or he really thought I was that young. Maybe it was a little of both.

""Really? Is that what you really think?"" I asked.

""Maybe 35. Max. Like a very young 35, though.""

I couldn't help feeling good about that. I knew I looked a little younger than my age. And I was certainly in better shape than most of my peers. But I still liked the compliment.

""You're really beautiful,"" he said again. ""And I like talking to you. You're smart. And cool. You're Rachel's aunt, right? She said you were her 'cool' aunt.""

""I'm not actually her aunt,"" I said. ""She just says that. I'm her boss.""

""Oh,"" he said. ""Well I'm not really close with Rachel. I mean, I'm her friend, but I'm really more of the groom's friend. So you work at the library?""

""Yes,"" I responded.

""So you're like the cool, sexy librarian?"" he asked.

I laughed at that.

""Is that a line, Robin? It sound like a line. Are you hitting on me?"" I said with a smile.

""No,"" he said. ""No. Well, I mean, maybe a little. But no. I was telling the truth. You're really beautiful!""

""What do you find so beautiful about me?"" I asked. I scooted just a little bit closer to him. The bar was really starting to empty out. Most of the people we knew had left. Robin had told his buddies he'd catch up to them later. But all that was waiting for me was a lonely hotel room.

""Everything,"" he said. ""I really like your beautiful blue eyes, though.""

""Those aren't my eyes,"" I said. Robin's glance had once again drifted downward.

There was a look of embarrassment for a second about being caught ogling my tits. I could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he decided how to recover. And then, as if a switch flipped, he apparently decided to push his chips to the center of the table and go all in.

""Well, I like your tits, too. You've got great tits.""

I blushed a little bit. I couldn't believe he was being so direct. I decided that maybe he'd had too much to drink and it was time to end the conversation.

""I'm not sure that's the best way for you to talk to a lady,"" I said. ""I think we should call it a night. I'll assume you just drank too much and didn't mean to say that.""

I stood up off the stool and put money on the bar for my drink.

He jumped up and stood next to me.

""Hey, Chellee. Don't be offended!"" he said.

Then he looked down again and didn't even attempt to hide it.

""But, damn, really. You have great tits. I meant it.""

""Good night, Robin,"" I said.

He put a hand on my waist and gently pulled my closer to him. It wasn't intentional, but I brushed my thigh against his crotch. He was rock hard. I could feel it. And it excited me just a bit. He put his lips near my ear.

""Come on,"" he said. ""When is the last time you've been fucked hard and long by a guy ten years younger than you?""

The answer to his question was ""never."" I'd never been fucked by a guy much younger than me. And he was a lot more than 10 years younger, though he didn't know it.

It had been SO long since I'd been fucked hard by anyone. Or fucked in any way. And I hadn't fucked a boy his age since my college boyfriend--when I was even younger than Robin.

He pushed his crotch into my thigh. This time he was making a conscious effort for me to feel his hard prick.

""I'm hard from just looking at you,"" he said. ""I PROMISE we will have a good time.""

He was getting me wet. Against my better judgment, I could feel myself contemplating the possibility. He did have a sexy body. He took my hand and ran it over his prick, letting me feel him through his khakis. It was definitely a thick piece of meat. Boldly, he leaned in and kissed me. And I could just feel myself letting go to him.

""Let's go back to my room for one more drink,"" he whispered.

My mind was racing.

""What the hell am I doing?"" I thought silently. ""Why the hell not?"" was my second thought. I was out of town. I'd likely never see him again. I knew nobody at the wedding except for Rachel. And what had being a ""good girl"" gotten me my entire life? I wasn't miserable, but my life hadn't exactly lived up to my best dreams. ""I'm almost 40,"" I thought. ""Why not have fun? Just this once?"" It would be harmless. An adventure. And a self-esteem boost.

""OK,"" I said. ""I'll have one more drink with you. But not in your room.""

Robin nodded and started to sit back on his stool.

""Not here,"" I said. ""How about over there?"" I pointed in the direction of a round booth in a dark corner of the bar. It would definitely be private and a bit more intimate.

Robin agreed and we went to the booth. He took a seat on one side. I entered in the other direction and moved all the way to the middle. I patted the bench next to me.

""Scoot over,"" I said. ""Get next to me.""

He moved closer, leaving a space between us. I responded by sliding closer to him until our thighs were touching. I could see the look of surprise on his face. He obviously wasn't sure what to expect. I imagined that in his mind he'd never thought something might really happen.

I put a hand on his thigh and ran it up to his crotch. His hard cock was going down the right leg of his pants--the leg pressed firmly against my left one. I started to caress it softly through his khakis.

""Ohhhh..."" he said. It was something between an exhale and a surprised moan of pleasure.

I slid my hand up and down, firmly pressing his cock into his own thigh. I could feel the heat through his pants.

""Mmmmm..."" he moaned again. The slick, forward personality was all but gone. He'd regressed into a surprised boy.

A waitress came over to take our order. With my hand still on his cock--safely hidden beneath the table in the dark--I calmly ordered myself another glass of wine. While I was still conversing with the waitress I moved my hand around until I found his zipper. And then I gave it a slow tug downward. I felt so naughty! I had NEVER done anything comparable in my life!

""And for you, sir?"" the girl asked.

""What? Huh?"" Robin said as he glanced up. He was very obviously flustered. ""I...um...I want....""

My hand was in his trousers and fishing around for his cock as he talked. I found it and gripped it tightly.

Robin stumbled through his drink order while I slowly, rhythmically tugged on his piece.

""Oh. OH. That feels so good..."" Robin said when the waitress left.

""Shhhh! You'll give us away. You don't want it to end do you?"" I asked.

""NO!!""

""Then be cool.""

He slumped back in the booth and tried his best to look nonchalant. I kept rubbing him off. I couldn't believe my own behavior, but it was making me hot!

Robin's breathing was getting heavy. He moved his hips, trying to force me to go faster, but I wanted it to last. I glanced across the room and saw the waitress picking up two drinks that looked like our order. As she turned to come back to us, I pulled Robin's cock out through his zipper. I couldn't help but to glance down. The table would hide anyone else's view but mine. It really was a nice, thick tool.

Robin appeared to be in a state of shock. I squeezed my hand tight around the head and started tugging faster. As people walked by, I was aware they might be able to see my arm moving. But they couldn't be sure of what was happening.

When the waitress got close I stopped pumping him. With my thumb, I rubbed the tip of his dick. I could feel little, sticky droplets of cum, and I smeared them around. Robin looked like he was in a stupor.

""Are you going to pay the lady?"" I asked him.

""Oh...uh...yeah,"" he said.

He fumbled for his wallet. I was still tickling his cock at the cum hole with the tip of my thumb. He pulled out a 20--way more than our drinks would cost even including a decent tip--and told her to just keep it. Obviously, he wanted her to get lost.

I picked up my drink with my free hand and took a sip. As soon as her back was turned, I went back to jacking him off forcefully.

""Drink your drink,"" I said.

Robin picked it up and gulped the whole glass down--some sort of whiskey concoction.

Two girls walked by and one of them did a double-take. I was certain she knew what was happening. Or at least suspected it. And I didn't care. For the first time in my life, I WANTED to be bad. I winked at her. Then leaned close to Robin.

""Do you like the way I'm touching you?""

He just nodded. Emphatically.

I looked around, and then casually opened the very top button on my sundress. My black bra was now exposed. I watched Robin's eyes fall on to the deep chasm between my tits.

""You like them?"" I asked Robin.

""Yesss..."" he said.

I ran my hand up and down his shaft a few times. I grasped the head and started pulling as fast as I could. I squeezed it firmly and he groaned in response. At this point, anyone looking what have realized exactly what was happening.

""You like the way I'm tugging your cock, baby?"" I whispered. It was phrase I'd never uttered in my life. Never thought I would say.

""Yes..."" he said again. ""Please don't stop,"" he almost whimpered.

""You want to cum?""

""YES!"" he said.

I gave him such firm tugs that I thought he might cum out of the seat. Robin groaned and grunted. And then he exploded. I felt some of his hot cum running down my hand.

I didn't stop until he was finished and gasping for air. I pulled my hand up to the table and looked at his jizz. I reached for my cocktail napkin. Then something else came to mind. Looking Robin dead in the eye and licked his seed off my fingers. Then wiped my lips with the napkin.

""Who the hell am I tonight?"" I thought silently.

""Well, I hope you enjoyed the drink. I'm glad I stayed,"" I said getting up.

""Wait. No. Wait,"" Robin stammered. ""Let me pay you back. Let me do something for you.""

My intention had been to just walk out. I didn't want things to go any farther. But I could feel that my little black panties were soaked. Instead of settling my craving for sex, jacking Robin off in the back of the bar had just made me hungry for more. I wanted a release. I wanted to just rush back to the hotel and take a hot bath and get myself off. But I knew I could have more fun.

""Don't be a prude,"" I told myself.

""Why don't you walk me back to the hotel?"" I heard myself say out loud. ""We'll see what happens.""

We slipped out a side door from the bar into a tiny alley between buildings. The boardwalk was out front. Beyond that was the beach. Robin was still dazed, but it looked like he was slowly regaining some of his swagger. We'd only walked a few steps when he firmly pushed me against the brick wall.

Robin went straight for my tits. He buried his face in them. And then he rubbed one roughly when he kissed me. He was sort of clumsy. A bit inexperienced. But I still liked it.

I glanced around. There was a large dumpster 50 feet up the alley before the boardwalk. I knew it was hiding us from the view of anyone passing by. But if anyone else left the bar by the side door they'd stumble right on us.

It didn't seem that Robin had any concern about location. He pushed the skirt of my dress between my lefts and started rubbing my pussy.

""I want to taste you!"" he said.

""Right here?""

""After what you did inside?"" he said. ""Yes. Right here.""

He grabbed the hem of my skirt and lifted it all the way up. There wasn't much finesse to his style, like I'd become used to with older men. His hand went right to the crotch of my panties and pushed it aside. He didn't bother with the clit. He just slammed two fingers up into me.

I whimpered a little bit with delight. He wasn't delicate in any way. He just started pounding me with those two fingers. The sound of his palm slamming into my flesh filled the alley. I tried to stifle my cries, but every once in a while one would slip and echo off the brick walls. I was ready to cum when he suddenly stopped.

Robin dropped to his knees in the dirty alley. He put his torso beneath my skirt. I felt him pulling my panties down to mid-thigh. And then I felt his tongue.

He may have been an awkward kisser, but the boy knew exactly what he was doing when it came to eating pussy. I felt myself go weak in the knees. He clenched my ass cheeks firmly with each hand, pulling me closer to him. He was like a rattle snake, flicking his tongue rapidly over my clit. He brought a hand back around and started fingering me again. I put my hands on my own tits. I could feel my hard nipples. I tossed my head back and closed my eyes. I moaned loudly. And then I just let out a cry. And then another. I didn't care if someone heard us. With his rough tongue sliding up and down my clit I had my first orgasm with another person in over a year. It was massive. My entire body quivered and trembled. There was a pleasant shock waves starting at my clit and shooting in every direction through my body.

He pulled his head back out from the skirt and smiled up from the street. I lifted the skirt to pull my panties up when the side door to the bar swung open and a few people stumbled out. The glanced at us, and it had to be obvious they had just missed something.

""Let's get out of here!"" I said and grabbed Robin's hand without thinking.

Without looking back we fled the alley and turned in the direction of the hotel.

Moment later we were in the hotel elevator. I hadn't even thought about what was going to happen next. I was still feeling great. And maybe a little embarrassed about how close we'd come to being caught. I hit a button on the elevator.

""That's my floor, too,"" he said.

We got off on the same floor.

""Your room or mine?"" he said.

It had definitely never been my intention to let things go that far. But without even thinking about things or about whether we should call it a night, I just answered him.

""Mine,"" I said.

Before the door to the room even closed I was at the buttons on his shirt. I wanted to fuck more than at any time in my life. I got impatient and just tried to pull the shirt over his head. Buttons popped and flew across the room.

He unbuttoned my dress down to the waist. I shrugged out of it and stood there in black heels, stockings, panties, and bra--I've always been one of those strangely OCD women who almost always matches my underwear. Robin looked stunned. He gazed at my tits. And my flat stomach. And my muscular legs.

I got his pants undone and they hit the floor. His boxers followed.

His cock was already getting hard again, but I decided to help him out. He leaned against the wall in the foyer of the room while I dropped to my knees. I took his thick cock between my full lips. I could taste the cum from earlier all over the head.

I bobbed up and down as Robin ran his fingers through my long, blond hair. He got stiff quickly, but I didn't want to stop right away.

""I want to fuck,"" he said.

""Mmm hmm..."" I said, with a mouthful of cock. I slipped my lips off and licked around he head. I tickled the cum hole with the tip of my tongue.

""Can you back up what you said in the bar?"" I asked.

""What's that?"" he asked. ""I kind of forgot. I was a little drunker then...""

""You asked me when was the last time I was fucked long and hard? Can you do that?""

""Yes!"" he said.

I stood up and took my bra off. I thought his jaw would hit the floor as he gazed at my big tits.

""Do you fuck like a boy, or can you fuck me like a man?"" I asked, before thinking silently ""who am I tonight?"" again.

""I'll fuck you like a MAN,"" he said with conviction.

He grabbed my arm and roughly pulled me to the bed. Then he pushed me down playfully. Lying on the bed I hooked two thumbs in my panties and pulled them off. I spread me legs so that I was on my back, with nothing covering me up except the stockings, the heels, and the small path of hair above my pussy.

Again, Robin wasn't one for foreplay. He jumped on the bed and started kissing my roughly. He kneaded my titties with his hands. And then he got on top and drove that nice, thick cock up inside me.

He was so thick I felt like I was being split open. It had been SO long since I'd had sex. And my ex had just had the standard, average, seven inch white guy cock. Robin's was FAT.

He didn't fuck as well as he ate pussy, but it was better than he kissed. There was no change of pace. He just fucked hard and fast--like he needed to cum inside me. And I liked it.

I dug my nails into Robin's back.

""Oh, fuck me. Fuck me..."" I heard myself moaning aloud.

""You like that? You like that?"" he kept saying.

His body was dripping with sweat. His breath came in hot little gasps. And still he never broke pace. His fat cock rubbed my clit with every stroke and I felt myself losing control. I called out his name. I gasped. And I came hard. I couldn't stop myself from digging my nails into his back.

He just went harder. He was like a fucking animal plowing into me. His face was locked in a distorted grimace. His moans were almost like growls.

Just the sound of the two of us fucking and his machine like rhythm brought me to the brink again. I felt my pussy clench as I came for the second time since we'd started fucking.

And still he kept going. Robin grabbed both my legs. He through my heels over his shoulder. The point of my black heels were pointed skyward. Suddenly it was like he had another gear. He slammed into my like a speeding truck into a brick wall. With each thrust he growled loudly. I cried out every time. He slowed down just a bit to deliver hard, deep strokes. I started rubbing my own clit, desperate to cum one more time with him.

It was close to a simultaneous orgasm. I could feel his hot load spraying inside me as the waves of pleasure washed over me. Robin kept right on fucking until he squeezed every drop into me.

He rolled off and the two of tried to catch our breath while we stared at the ceiling.

""Did I fuck you like a man?"" he finally asked.

""That depends,"" I said. ""You got one more in you tonight?""

He looked down at his own cock. I followed his gaze. He was already getting hard again. I'd forgotten that particular advantage of being with a young man!

""What do you think?"" he asked.

And then he rolled over and started fucking me one more time.... "

I'm sort of in a pickle as I'm wrapping up my summer audit internship at one of the big 4. I graduated this past May with 150 credits (undergrad) with the thought that I would do my masters in CIS this coming year with a May 2019 graduation, but this is no longer the case.


The firm only has two start dates which is either January 2019 or September 2019. The problem I'm having is deciding when to actually start and here are my reasons for choosing either one:


1) January 2019 - I'll have 4 full months to study for as many CPA parts as possible (hopefully 2 or 3 at max), will be promoted after my first busy season and start paying off my student loans ASAP ($30kish all federal).


2) September 2019 - A whole year to study for the CPA which I'm positive I'll be able to pass in that time frame, have plenty of time to travel, do a winter internship or pickup another job and work part-time throughout the year, and lastly maybe even apply to other positions in the advisory service. *Many professionals have encouraged me to go this route solely to finish the CPA exam.


I would gladly appreciate any input you guys may have!!!"

Working for a startup definitely has its benefits, especially a successful one. Me personally? I worked for a successful startup. Hours were great, the people were better, and their ""open mindset"" meant that they were *very* accepting of my girlcock, an absolute monster that'd dwarf any man's dick. I had the perfect skillset for the job, but I had been worried that having such a sizeable extra appendage wouldn't fit their feminist, ""all female employees"" agenda.

So what if I had a huge cock? I could just be as girly and feminine as every other woman who worked here. They just didn't get massive boners that threatened to rip right through their pants at all hours of the day. Most of the ladies here were understanding of my needs, to varying degrees of course. Quite a few were willing to give me a quick handjob in the bathroom, some would use their mouths, and the *really* nice ones would let me fuck them, though they seemed to enjoy that as much as I did.

That didn't really matter now, because now what I needed was release. I quietly got up from my desk, feeling an erection beginning to form. It was only 9:15, but my cock wasted no time in waking up. I nonchalantly made my way out into the hallway, the slight bulge of my slacks quickly becoming more and more noticeable. Hopefully some lady would be willing to help out in the bathroom, if I didn't run into a kinder soul on the way there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

So! An all-female, hipster, modern tech company where one employee *happens* to have a huge cock, and the others are happy to help her out. We could do several short scenes with this one, all sorts of angles. Maybe her deskmate decides to hide out under her desk for a little bit? Or a friendly, understanding coworker is in the bathroom when she bursts in at full mast? Maybe it's an intern's first day on the job, or the CEO calls our lucky futa into her office to experience this cock she's heard so much about. The more ideas you've got, the better!

I think it'd be fun if it was frowned upon for her to fuck in common areas, so we could incorporate that and the risk/taboo along with it.

I was intentionally vague on details so we could pick a ref for her. I have some I like to use, but if you have ones you like I'll definitely consider them! Basing her appearance off a celebrity is also an option. Same goes for any coworkers of her's you'd like to play.

Finally, my kinks(Some may not fit as well as others): Huge everything, bulges, distension, tons of cum, cum inflation, spanking, public sex/teasing, freeuse, name calling, cock worship, non-penetrative sex(titjobs, handjobs, etc.), pregnancy, lactating, tight clothes, teasing, casual sex/nudity, dirty/crude talk, and playing as youtubers/celebrities

Limits: Scat, piss, gore, bdsm, etc.

Please put a pun into your first message~ Can't wait to see those envelopes!"

Yesterday I saw this [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/javascript-fundamentals-react-requirements/) on /r/javascript not sure if there is a way to cross-post to give credit to the poster. I am an intern right now using React for work so I have been working on personal projects in React and at work obviously. I had some basic JS before so this article peaked my interest to figure out if I was missing something etc. It had a lot of upvotes and people praising it on /r/javascript but I had an issue with it that I'm not sure is justified / correct as I am fairly new. So on to the question/issue. He talks about using an arrow function for functional stateless components: 

    // JavaScript ES5 function
    function Greeting(props) {
      return &lt;h1&gt;{props.greeting}&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }
    
    // JavaScript ES6 arrow function
    const Greeting = (props) =&gt; {
      return &lt;h1&gt;{props.greeting}&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }
    
    // JavaScript ES6 arrow function without body and implicit return
    const Greeting = (props) =&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{props.greeting}&lt;/h1&gt; 

However, I thought that you wanted to just use the es5 way of declaring a function for debugging purposes. The arrow function in an error comes back as an anonymous function whereas the es5 way it comes back named. At least that's what I read when looking through why Airbnb style guide pushes the es5 way still. I just want to make sure that I haven't been writing my functional stateless functions wrong this whole time. Sorry if the post is so long for what seems like a really stupid question. As always thank you for any input and help that may be provided.

I read this sub sometimes and just would like a 3rd person viewpoint. This was a bit longer than expected.

GF and I have been together for 3 months ish. Very short time but honestly the best relationship I've had so far: same humor, complimentary easy-going personalities, and I find her so cute (sex is really good too). We both have similar interests, I love her company, and I dont see us fighting about anything anytime soon - our communication is really great. I'm currently living 1hr away from out University town on an internship and shes taking summer courses. I'll be back on campus in September.

Now I just got off a call with her ending up tearing up a bit because we had a pretty long (mature and respectful) convo on our views of religion. I consider myself a Christian and although she initially told me she was Catholic (her parents attending church, her going to Sunday school etc.), she admits not agreeing fully with Christianity but thinks there could very well be a higher being/entity.

I dont want this to turn into a debate on religion but would like to clarify my views on Christianity (which I let her know about). A lot of what the Catholic church stands for I do not agree with so I might be more closely trending to Protestantism. I support gay rights (being gay is not a choice and God wouldn't condemn ppl to hell by default I believe) and am pro-choice. I definitely know that Christianity has been used by the Catholic church to encourage/cover-up genocides, pedophilia, etc.  I believe in an all loving God who wants us to love him back. I admit there a lot of things I dont know about the world but I have faith in this. I am willing to explain my views more if anyone needs clarification. I'm also in an engineering degree so my logical side plays in how I see Christianity a lot, but anyways you have a basis for my views.

I let her know this throughout our discussion (Skype call btw) and she asked me towards the end how I felt about her views. She seemed sad, but I ended up being honest and told her that as of right now I dont know how much weight I put in my SO sharing my beliefs. Religion isnt the sole goal of my life but it is a part of my identity. I am open minded to people who dont share my beliefs and am always interested in hearing their side, I also am open to the fact that I could be completely wrong in the existence of a God. This is what I told her and she cried a bit. I tried to comfort her saying theres nothing wrong with her and that I'm sorry I assumed she believed in God when she told me she was Catholic. She said she was nervous that my decision on the weight of religion in my life could cause us to break up and I promised her that wouldn't be the case (mistake?).

Now I didnt let her know that I would rather my SO share my beliefs but I dont think it's something that should be a deal breaker - I'm still struggling on figuring this out. This is why I need help, We're only 3 months in but I can see myself dating this girl for a while, I really like her and we see eye to eye on everything else. This is the only thing we dont and even so we had a very solid conversation without having it turn into an argument. I like her and dont want to lose her, and honestly I think I can put my religious views to the side. I mean she even comes to church with me! Says she finds it interesting. I dont wanna hurt this girl and felt so bad.

I would also like to note that my mom was Muslim a my dad Christian when they got married and that didnt seem to impact their marriage too much. They're going stronger than ever now. Not saying I want to marry this girl already but y'know.

So that's my question, is something such as religious views a big dealbreaker, especially if everything else is perfect and we're both open minded to each other's views? Could it cause resentment in the future? Should I just suck it up or is this one of those fundamental things we should agree on (I.e. having kids type of thing)? Thanks for the help! I'm conflicted

*TLDR* - My gf doesnt have the exact same views on religion as I do even though she believes in a higher entity. Is this a dealbreaker or should I suck it up? Both very open minded people. "
90rdzs,1,2018-07-21,[PA] Are there any Bluetooth/Wireless IEMs with Noise Cancelling?,758759754,HeadphoneAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/90rdzs/pa_are_there_any_bluetoothwireless_iems_with/,"**TL;DR**

Are there any Bluetooth IEMs with Noise Cancelling other than the [Bose QC 25's](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earphones/quietcontrol-30.html#v=qc30_black) ? 

==================================================================

**Budget** \- Under US$400. Work is reimbursing. Less always better.

**Source/Amp** \- MacBook Pro, Dell XPS 15, Pixel 2, etc...

**How the gear will be used** \- Streaming from Spotify, YouTube (lectures, etc), video conferencing (work + academic), in the gym/biking, while traveling (train, car, plane), block out noise while reading/studying, etc. Small to fit in a backpack.

**Preferred tonal balance** \- I don't care too much on the quality or tone so long as they works.

**Preferred music genre(s)** \- Top 40, Spotify playlists, country, lectures/online courses, video calls, ...

**Past** **gear experience**

* $10 wired IEMs - They've worked for the last 10 years but sound terrible, let in a ton of outside noise, and feel terrible. But they still work! Phone no longer has an audio jack &amp; I prefer wireless. No microphone or controls
* Bose QC25 - Loaners during an internship. Sounded good, noise cancelling was cool but felt like a weird pressure/emptiness. Great on planes. Didn't like over the head as it wrecked my hair. Hard to use in the gym/when active. Took up a lot of space in my backpack.
* [SoundPeats Q30](https://soundpeatsaudio.com/catalog/product/view/id/53/s/q30-plus-soundpeats-magnetic-wireless-earbuds-bluetooth-headphones-sport-in-ear-ipx-6-sweatproof-earphones/category/3/) \- Great price ($30)! Fit well and passively blocked out a good amount of noise. Fit quite well. Wire connecting the two would occasionally get hung up. Wireless was awesome especially in the gym. After 5 months, the left is far quieter than the right and will probably die soon. Having controls and microphone was nice.

**What** **aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve?** Basically looking to replace the Q30's I have now, but with a higher quality pair. I'm thinking that active noise cancelling would be awesome for travel and studying, but I don't like the look of the collar with the Bose QC 25's. Is there any other wireless IEMs that offer active noise cancelling? I've been looking but have not been successful. I really do not want an over-the-head full set or wired."
90rj25,13,2018-07-21,Help the HomeLab newbie,the_grim_11,homelab,https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/90rj25/help_the_homelab_newbie/,"I recently got a Dell R710 with 2 Xeon E5645 6 core CPU's and 128GB of RAM in the SFF chassis. (I do wish I got the LFF chassis but it's not the end of the world for me and I'm not too worried about that limiting my learning as I can go pick up drives for it fairly cheap over time.)

Just to give some background on how new to this I am. I am 19 and graduated HS in 17' and I've made the decision to not go to college, or at least not right away. I am however working on completing Google's Professional IT Support certification. Which is very nice for me being able to go at my own pace, and Google offers to send my information to companies looking for IT support specialist. And I'd like to think myself as being tech-savvy and being the family's IT guy. I've done an internship with the IT Manager for an NBA team and followed him around for a few days for my High School ""Senior Project"". But getting into the Homelab scene has proved I don't know everything which is why I've come here for guidance. I've read the wiki however I didn't get a sense of direction from it. Like where to start and to build up from. 

I've tried installing a few different OS's on it just to play around and smile while putting a heavy load on all 24 threads. But I think I've settled on ESXi as suggested via the wiki. (Currently, I have both Windows Server 2016 and 2019 installed to mess around with AD with some ""client"" Windows 10 VM's. As well as a Ubuntu installation for generic Linux learning as well. The only thing I've found as a bummer is by using the free license, My VM's are limited to 8 vCPU's. Which over time I'm not sure how many VM's I'll make that would need that so again, not the end of the world for me. Right now I'm just throwing all kinds of VM's on it, trying them, then deleting them, repeat. 

So the purpose of getting this and starting my own homelab is to first, learn and have fun. But also being able to host reliable VM's or production VM's as I've read. One being a better file server for my dad's home business as the current one is running FreeNAS on an old desktop with 4gb RAM. It gets the job done but I want to do it better and more proper. (Our current server has no backup... Yikes.) As well as being able to do some version of a Home Media server such as Plex since my dad is planning to cut cable soon and move to internet only. Now I think I jumped the gun, As I ordered a H700 1GB raid controller to replace the i/PERC in the server already, just to read (about 10 minutes before posting this) the FreeNAS virtualized guide saying I need a card that can support HBA. Sooooo now I have to wait and most likely sell it. (BTW, if someone here is looking for one, PM me and I'll be willing to sell it, NA only please)

Another plan I have for this is creating a PFSense VM to manage the network as our Cable Modem/Router does not allow for change of things like DNS and whatnot. 

So my questions/concerns are as followed:

\- I need a RAID card that supports HBA, I've read that the LSI 9211 and the M1015 are recommended choices. If someone can just give me some reassurance that these will accomplish what I need before I go spend more money on *another* new RAID card.

\- Mainly, Where do I start? What are some ""labs"" I can do to get a basic and better understanding of the Hypervisor and server overall.

I've lurked in this subreddit for awhile now and I would highly appreciate any and all suggestions and advice."

#[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) - A website that actually helps you win

---

**WEBSITE NOT MOBILE OPTIMIZED YET**

**TLDR at the bottom**



[Source Code](https://github.com/dmilin1/tiltseeker)

&amp;nbsp;

### What Is It?

[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) is a website that helps Jungle mains optimize their pathing by calculating the best lanes to camp. However, many of the features can be useful to laners as well.

&amp;nbsp;

### The Story

A year ago, I finished a little python script I passionately named *Tilt*seeker with the purpose of doing what the game lookup sites I used could not. I wanted something that used statistics and data from the [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com) to actually help me win games. I'm a Shaco one trick, and if maining Shaco has taught me anything, it's that wins happen more when you get in your opponents' heads.

The first iteration of my program gave basic stats and had the primary purpose of finding enemies on tilt. Who could you camp all game to get your team fed? As I added more features, I was posting on Reddit and [mentioned my project](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8eur1e/introducing_the_blitz_desktop_app_fully_automatic/dxyqbfg/). To my surprise, the idea seemed really popular and I was encouraged to build it into a full website.

Despite my complete lack of knowledge of web development, I was determined to make [*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) work. A year later, [*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) is up and running with an open beta.


&amp;nbsp;


### What Does It Do?

[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) is a website intended for jungle mains, and is best utilized in ranked. However, it can be beneficial for any player regardless of their role. By employing Riot's outstanding public API, *Tilt*seeker looks up all players in a given game and assigns them a ""Tilt Score"", which indicates how beneficial it would be to camp that target during the game. 

In addition to assigning a ""Tilt Score"" for each player, *Tilt*seeker provides data about a team's damage output types, as well as various relevant stats for each individual player.

&amp;nbsp;

### The Stats

[Example Image](https://tiltseeker.com/Screenshot1.PNG)

Greater stats detail can be read [here](https://tiltseeker.com/guide.html).

- Losing Streak: How many games have been consecutively lost in a row in order to establish level of tilt.

- Winrate: A percentage representing a player's average chance of winning a given game in ranked (when trying their hardest).

- Mastery Points: The number of points a player has on the champion they are playing in the looked up game.

- Last Played: The number of days since the player last played as the champion they are currently using.

- Aggressiveness: An estimation of how aggressive a player is, based on how often they attempt to trade and fight in previous games.

- Warding: An estimation of how well a player wards, based on how they ward in previous games.

- Tilt Score: The tilt score is a cumulative estimate of the benefits of camping a player. A score below 25 means that a jungler's time is likely better spent somewhere else, because the player is likely good at warding, a one trick, a smurf, on a winning streak, familiar with their champion, and/or plays safe. A tiltscore from 25-35 is fairly neutral and does not indicate one way or the other. A camp score above 35 means that a jungler should heavily consider camping that player as they are likely bad at warding, unfamiliar with their champion, boosted, on a losing streak, and/or plays recklessly. A tiltscore above 50 is a prime candidate to camp and while a win is never guaranteed, a hard camp will make it incredibly likely.



&amp;nbsp;


### Desktop App

I have also made a portable [*Tilt*seeker Desktop App](https://tiltseeker.com/app.html) with [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) that automatically loads [*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com/) when a game starts so users don't have to do so manually.


&amp;nbsp;


### Money

I hate ads with a passion. I use an adblocker myself!

That said, I put hundreds of hours into building this website in my spare time and I have servers to pay for. However, since I hate ads so much, I have tried to keep ads to an absolute minimum. In fact, I only have 2 ad zones on the entire website!

Instead, my website uses your spare CPU cycles to generate revenue. It does this by performing calculations on the Monero network. You can read more about the process [here](https://www.coindesk.com/information/how-bitcoin-mining-works/) and [here](https://www.coinimp.com/faq).

However, I know that no one wants to have their CPU nerfed while in game. So, while using my website, I monitor your game stats to ensure that no CPU is ever used while you play League.


&amp;nbsp;


### Hire Me!

I'm a Software Engineering student in my senior year at San Jose State University in the Bay Area. If you're impressed by my website and have career or internship opportunities available, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/dmilin1/tiltseeker) and send me a PM! Or email me at contact@tiltseeker.com.


&amp;nbsp;


### Thank You

A big thank you to /u Parachuteee, /u JustcallmeDexter, /u TacoBowser, /u Kayma, /u Dsnahans, and /u chantdesange for encouraging me to finish Tiltseeker and build it into a public project for everyone to use.

90spls,3,2018-07-21,WIBTA for publishing a project that I said I would complete with a friend,TheBIBco,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/90spls/wibta_for_publishing_a_project_that_i_said_i/,"So for context, I’m a computer science student in college who wasn’t able to get an internship going into my junior year. This wasn’t too much of a problem since I knew I could just do a personal project to add to my GitHub (CS portfolio) to buff up my resume. Before the summer, my friend told me about his idea for a project to make a certain aspect about being a student at our school easier. I loved this idea and we planned a bit of the project at the beginning of the summer (he probably only put in like 2 hours total for the project). He unfortunately had to go out of state for the rest of the summer for work, so the planning that we did was the limit of our communication on the project up until now. 

After my friend left for the summer, I took an online course on everything I’d need to complete the project. After the course I coded the majority of the program and I’m just about ready to publish it to my GitHub. My problem is this: should I name him as a collaborator on the project even though he didn’t actually do any of the hard coding? Would I be an asshole for publishing the project on my page without even telling him that I decided to work by myself on it and not list him as a collaborator? 

The thing is, this project took me two months to complete and he didn’t reach out to me once during that time to ask if I was still willing to work on the project, meaning that he likely gave up on it. I put so much work into this project, and I don’t think it’s fair for his name to be on it, considering that I poured my heart into this thing. I do recognize it was pretty shitty of me to start coding without telling him and updating him about my progress. I get pretty severe tunnel vision and I’m definitely at fault for this. But at the same time, we didn’t get very far into planning and it was mostly my hard work and organization that was put into the project. "

I found it curious and got me looking for other similar models exclusive to either events or such and not related to the zune decals or engravings that people would get online. 

So far i found one with the NVIDIA logo, one for a delta force ranger event (one is up in ebay atm for $31 bid) and one for interns back in the day (saw one of the zune with a amazing decal and one of the zune hd)

As far as i can remember, the original zune in prototype phase had various unreleased colors given to the employees that were in a sense color code to prevent leaks, thus why the first leak is a black and white picture 😂

If any of you know other editions let me know."

90twx0,8,2018-07-21,I found out I was pregnant and had an abortion the same day,Ally_Cat513,abortion,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/90twx0/i_found_out_i_was_pregnant_and_had_an_abortion/,"This is gonna be a very long story, but I really need to get this out. 
Last sunday, I found out I was pregnant, and the very same day, a couple hours later, I had an abortion. 
I always thought that it could never happen to me, but I guess everyone thinks that, right?
I've had pregnancy scares before, about three in my lifetime (wich is a lot considering I became sexually active on last November), but it was always negative and we swore it would never happen again. My boyfriend and I knew we didn't wanted kids, so he got a vasectomy almost three and a half months ago. We thought we would never have a problem with pregnancy scares ever again. 
This time, I was almost sure I wasn't pregnant. I was only 2 weeks late to my period, I didn't have any sympthoms, I didn't ""felt"" pregnant at all, I had been cramping very badly for 2 weeks. I was sure my period would come anytime soon, but we did the pregnancy test anyway, for the piece of mind. 
That day it was supposed to be a normal date. We went to the clinic to have the blood test, and we were joking while waiting for the results. We talked about what would we have for lunch later that day. 
The nurse gave me a closed envelope with the results. I opened it, and I didn't even had to take out the paper and unfold it, right there I saw that word, ""POSITIVE"". My boyfriend must have noticed something was wrong, cause he took it from my hands and unfolded it to read it. 
We were death silent for what it felt like forever. He hugged me very tightly, probably cause he thought I was going to cry, but he was the one that looked about to cry. 
I had to think fast. I looked at the nurse with the best fake cheery smile I could give, and asked her if the test could tell me how far in the pregnancy I was in. She told me no, but I could calculate that myself checking my last period. She gave me the number of a doctor she knew to schedule an appointment for an ultrasound and congratulated me.
We got out of the clinic, and right away, without saying a word, my boyfriend went to buy misoprostol. It was expensive, so we didn't had lunch or anything else that day, not that we would have wanted anyway after hearing the news. 
We went to his house, holding hands the whole time. His parents weren't home. We researched on the Internet how to take them, and we started without a second thought. The bleeding started about half an hour later.
We cuddled, he caressed my belly, he was very attentive the whole process. He was clearly troubled. 
I didn't felt a thing. Not regret, nor remorse, shame, or sadness. The only thing I felt that day, was pitty for it, cause it was very unlucky to be conceived. 
It was physically painful. After taking the last four pills, we waited a little bit and he took me home. That night I fell asleep very quickly, while my boyfriend didn't slept at all. 
The next day it was kinda the same. I was bleeding and cramping, my grandma told me to stay in bed. She didn't knew anything, she thought it was my period, painful and heavy as always. 
The rest of the week I went to my internship as nothing happened, it felt far away, like a bad bream. 
On friday, I started to felt dizzy, puked, had cravings, and had pregnancy sympthoms in general, and I felt very sad about it, cause I knew there was nothing growing inside of me. 
I cried for the first time, I was feeling very moody. 
My boyfriend and I were talking about it daily, he felt guilty, cause he thought we could have had evoided the whole situation if we had waited a little longer to have sex without condoms. 
I cried during a call, while telling him that, even tho it wasn't planned or wanted, it was made with lots of love. 
Today I'm still bleeding, but I'm feeling better. I'm not thinking about it all day, and recently I started to sing again after not doing it for the whole week. I know it was for the better, and I know it was the right choice, but sometimes I wish I could have caressed my belly before having the abortion. "

Check here first!,illithid66,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/90u5t6/looking_for_career_information_check_here_first/,"I have seen a few people comment on some types of posts that have come up a few times.  I am 100% positive that I am missing things, so please, please comment and point anything else that I might have missed. 

**Career information and statistics** 

For the US- check here  ([https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/chemical-engineers.htm](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/chemical-engineers.htm)) 

Salary (lowest 10% &lt;$62k, highest 10% &gt;$170k) 

Underemployment rate vs other degrees ([https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market\_compare-majors.html](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market/college-labor-market_compare-majors.html)) Manufacturer information ([https://archive.epa.gov/sectors/web/html/chemical.html](https://archive.epa.gov/sectors/web/html/chemical.html))

**How to get started?** 

Are you in high school? Go for a four-year degree.  
Are you in another field and want to transfer? Generally speaking, a master’s degree will allow you to transfer.

**Know your degrees…** 

BSc- Basic 4 year degree more than adequate for most positions. If possible, get at least one internship or co-op, which will make you a lot more employable.  
MSc- 1.5 years of coursework often with a thesis option. The thesis is for proving you can do independent research. The MS rarely impresses employers for BS jobs, but will give you an idea if you want to do the PhD.  It can also make you a more attractive candidate for management later in your career.

PhD- Needed mostly for research and development programs or academic jobs.

MBA- Often used to get into the management track in larger corporate settings 

**Other options for degrees** 

MD- Chemical engineering students often end up going to medical school afterwards.  Going into medicine afterwards gives you an advantage with understanding the physical processes of the body.  A fair number of my class went this way. 

JD- Intellectual property lawyers for chemical companies often come from chemical engineering backgrounds. This includes the USPTO. 

**Job frustrations**… 

You probably can’t work from home. Your hours are (probably) rigid. Your promotions will probably have to do with other people’s retirement, rather than your own advanced skills. Less mobility between industries than your average programmer.  Many (but not all) of the plants are kept in the middle of nowhere and heavy industry environments. It’s hard work and you will have difficulty finding a nice place in the middle of a city. 

**Just graduated and having trouble finding work?** 

It’s hard to find your first position.  (Trust me, I know.) Yes, some people do start as a technician or draftsman after graduating and yes, it is better than nothing.  Keep applying.  If you can get any job, it's better.  Another option may be going back for your master's degree.  Network with your former classmates and see who is hiring.  Check with alumni from your school.  Go to other school's career fairs- usually they let you right in.

**While you are in school…** 

Internships- Get one if you can. It’s a litmus test for your employer and will show industry that you can function in a business environment. 

Co-ops- Even better than an internship for getting a job. It usually delays graduation but will be a more in-depth experience. 

Lab research- Good for determining if you want to try a PhD. Go for at least one paper per year.

**Think you might want something else?  Maybe think this might not be the field for you?** 

Chemical engineering proves to employers that you are hard working and smart.  A lot of people end up deciding they might want to check elsewhere.

Software- Lots more flexibility and openings. A lot of people transfer into this field.  There are lots of online boot camps and some in-person ones that help.  (Before you jump ship, check out industrial systems integration or plant automation- they can benefit from the ChemE degree too!)

Finance- Typically already has the hard math we do but nicer areas to work. Downside primarily will be even worse hours.

Environmental- Similar work, more locations, slightly lower pay.  "

I would go to bed around 4 AM and use my phone til I got too tired to keep looking. At the beginning of this month I started an internship which requires me to get up at 7:30 AM. I get home at 7 PM (hour long commute). I have 2 coffees in the morning and just feel tired most of the day. It's a very boring job so hard to stay focused. When I get home I have dinner and use the computer and go to bed at around 11. I only have these few hours to myself to play games or whatever so I stay awake even though I'm pretty sleepy by 9 or so. On the weekends I've been sleeping around midnight and waking up around 10:30. I slept before 1AM on Friday. Woke up in the middle of the night to pee (I've been getting up in the middle of the night to pee every single day recently but I fall back asleep quickly). Woke up at 9 AM and decided it was too early so I peed and slept til 10:30. By 6 PM I was feeling tired. Watched a 2 hour long movie and was feeling quite sleepy by the end. Had a very late dinner at 9:40 and by 10 I really feel like going to bed. So I've only been up for 12 hours and already need to sleep. I really don't want to be someone who goes to bed at 10PM on a saturday... my parents are 65 and can stay up longer hours. What can I do to not feel so tired all the time?"

I really like school. I like going to lectures or classes. I like listening to an educated person offer me information, sharing ideas and experiences with my classmates, and practicing what I've learned. I like following a plan created by someone with more expertise that dictates the order, the skills, and the content associated with learning a given subject. That plan gives me direction and makes it easier to learn things. I put in a lot of effort on any research paper or presentation to which I am assigned, but I find it really difficult to learn things on my own without a teacher. I tried to learn Spanish on my own. I tried to learn how to play the piano on my own. But those things fell trough. It's hard to know where to start, what to correct, what I should be learning, what information is important, how to do things correctly. 

I'm also doing a political internship with students who are so motivated and are great self learners. I find that they're just really interested in things. They always want to know more and don't stop at any length when trying to figure things out. They watch the news, talk about it with others, read lots of books, listen to podcasts, do political extra curricular a and internships. I don't do that. I personally really like writing research papers and doing assignments. I feel like if I were to just listen to podcasts and read books all the time, I'd just be resting on my knowledge and would not know how to apply it, so it makes putting in that effort seem kind of useless. 

I even know kids I go to school with who build their own computers. I know about kids that did or are doing extraordinary things just by pushing themselves and being really interested and action-oriented.  

I remember reading the book Spare Parts about 4 undocumented high school students who built an underwater robot that beat MIT in a robotics competition. None of them had any real prior experience with robotics, they were economically disadvantaged, and they went to a poor-performing  school. Still, they managed to learn and ended up building a really creative yet functional robot. I've never had the chance, but I don't know if I could do that. 


Part of the reason is lack of discipline. I watch podcasts and read books that I'm not really interested in and eventually default to scrolling through social media. Maybe I'm just doing those things because I feel like I have to, but how do I stay interested in things that don't interest me? How do I find the things that do interest me? Part of the reason is also not knowing where to start, where to find resources, how to get involved, what I should be focusing on. I really like the idea of taking on a personal project and I really like the idea of learning more about my field. 

Any tips will be greatly appreciated. 

And just for reference my interests are:

•Sociology (especially poverty&amp;social safety nets)

•Politics 

•Education (what makes a school good or bad, how that's compounded by race and poverty level, how family structure contributes to one's access to education)

•English (I like reading, writing, sentence structure. I want to improve my writing skills and my grammar) 

•Foreign language (I took Italian in middle and high school and really loved it. I also signed up for Spanish classes)

•how to improve the social structures I see issues with. How to create change 

•I'm not the best at STEM subjects, but the idea of a personal research/creative project like building a robot is really fascinating to me. I'd love to have a chance to do that "

Hardware info : 

I have a Synology DS414j with DSM6.2 installed on it. 

So about two weeks ago, my NAS got hacked. I could see the IP address being blocked everyday, guess they managed to get in, and locked me out. 

It took me a while, but I managed to get back to it, and my cousin, working in internet security, told me to install a vpn and a reverse proxy on it to be more secure, and to disable the ""quickconnect"" option that is offered with the package. 

To explain it, my NAs is in Paris, connected to the internet, and the address it has over the internet places it in tahiti. to connect to it, I have to type [servername.quickconnect.to](https://servername.quickconnect.to) and I'm redirected to a login page to my server. I thought it to be secure, apparently not. 

So I installed the vpn with OpenVPN ([tuto here for synology](https://youtu.be/ZcLhSfOU-r0)), and after all that, I'm a bit lost. I have a ""client"" folder somewhere on my computers (on is on W10, the other on Ubuntu 16.04) with the keys and certs and openvpn config file...

Here are my real problems : 

First, my router (Livebox, orange) changes public IP remotely every three months, company policy.  I had to set up a cron job to send me an email witht he new public IP every day so that I can still connect via ssh. 

Add to that, that I configured the VPN with the intern IP, so I can connect to it from my computer ont he same network, but I really dont see the use since I can access it via the network...

Finally, I'd like to access it from the outside world, and there I'm starting to get lost : On android, ubuntu or Windows, the config files are not the same and what the programm demands is not the same thing. How can I connect to my server given I have the right public IP address ? is my server simply at XX.XXX.XXX.XX:1194 ? 

I'm lost between all those things, networking is not my thing, please help me.

Thanks"

Tomorrow is the first day of camp for my church’s youth group! I’ve stated in previous posts that I’ve been blessed enough to lead as the youth intern this year and I’ll be working with the 10/11 grade boys (as I have been all summer)! 

The first day is always hectic what with all the moving supplies into the UHaul truck and making sure all students are registered and accounted for! This year is our biggest yet with 200 students going! We’re beyond blessed with this opportunity and would appreciate you praying with us! 

If you could, pray for: 

• peace in our hearts, undoubtedly things will fall out beyond our control and we might try and overreact or worry but that God would give us peace despite what our circumstances may show

• unity within our leadership team, that we would rely on one another when times get tough and that we could lean on one another spiritually; doing what we can to serve our fellow leaders

• for the students 
    - that God would work through the students and reveal himself to them 
    - that they would see camp as more than just following traditions or winning games but that it’s a chance to grow deeper in their faith and in their community 
    - that their hearts would be receptive to the message we have for them at camp 
    - that they would be safe 

• for overall safety and health; it’s going to be incredibly hot where our camp is and we want the students to continuously stay hydrated and make good health decisions as we work hard and play hard these next 5 days 


Thank you all in advance for your prayers and love! We have a phenomenal camp worked out for these students and we can’t wait to see how God will choose to move this next week! "

I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend of 2 years and I love her very much. It's true that I don't feel as passionate about her as I used to, but I do love her more than anything. This summer I'm doing an internship abroad. Another girl from college(let's call her Crystal), who I only knew from a class a couple of years back (before my relationship) is also here. I remember I used to be really attracted to this girl, I'll doze off for complete minutes looking at Crystal in class. But I never talked to her. The thing is she's not super attractive, but she had something that grabbed my attention.

Here we have become very close friends. We can talk for hours at a time. I know we both are in a relationship of our own. But I can't stop crushing about her, to the point is not letting me sleep. She's in my mind every moment of the day. When we talk I enjoy every little second of it. I can literally spend hours watching her do anything, every detail of her face, how she smiles, how she looks at me, I enjoy everything. Also, I have to admit that I have even gotten jealous when her BF calls her on the phone.  I can't really avoid her because our rooms are next to each other, so we practically live together, we are together every moment except when we go to work. 

Why is this happening? I don't want to ruin my relationship with my GF  and I also don't want to ruin Crystal's relationship. But my feelings for her and my inner demons are tearing my mind apart.  What can I do? Do I tell my GF? Do I tell Crystal? Please help"
90wlxp,24,2018-07-22,Internship Trouble,skellythrowaway132,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/90wlxp/internship_trouble/,"I'm currently completing an internship at my dream company. I've been given 9 weeks (6 weeks remaining) to identify and quantify condensate recovery opportunities across the site - my success will determine whether I receive an offer to return after graduation. So far, I've gone around talking to operators and engineers across the site and have used these conversations to identify what people believe to be the large flow rates of condensate.

The trouble I'm having is with quantifying the value of each stream. Because these condensate streams currently go straight into the sewer, there are no flow meters on the streams. There are flow meters upstream on the steam inlet, but only before the steam stream splits into multiple different units (so I have no idea what the flow rate is entering the unit I'm interested in).

Based on my manager's suggestion, I've been trying to apply Bernoulli's Equation with a tonne of assumptions to estimate the flow rate of condensate out of each unit. However, even with assumptions, the number of unknowns is too large. Effectively I get left with the following equation after assumptions:

P1 - P2 = 0.5ρ(V2^(2) \- V1^(2))

Where P1 and P2 are known, but V2 and V1 are unknown.

I'd really appreciate any suggestions on how to quantify the flow rate of condensate out of each vessel."

90x26u,3,2018-07-22,I Don’t Know What to Feel,stromni8,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/90x26u/i_dont_know_what_to_feel/,"My GF of over a year broke up with me yesterday. She was my first love, I was hers. I was her first...everything besides kiss.

This relationship felt as close to perfect as possible. Our first date was supposed to be a quick ice cream cone, but we sat there for 4 hours before we realized we were late for other things. Our first kiss was outside of a movie theatre when she was giving me a pottery thingy we made together earlier that week. She would never admit it, but we got close fast.

I honestly never thought I’d fall for her. Initially, I thought she was kind of weird and not super attractive (say what you will about this part, but first impressions rely upon aesthetic a lot). The more time I spent with her, the more that opinion changed. She was weird, but so was I. She brought out my weirdness in a good way...I almost felt like a little kid again. I saw the beauty in her; I could’ve stared at her smile for days. 

She fell for me a lot quicker than I did her but, in the end, we both fell hard. Next came junior year of college. We went to schools 2 hours apart. Annoying for sure, but we visited every other weekend; sometimes more, sometimes less. We had small disagreements here and there. She wanted me to visit more, but I had a puppy and my ability to leave revolved that pup. I still make a concerted effort to travel to her so she isn’t traveling to me too much. She wanted me to stop smoking (although she’d never fully say it to me) so I did. It took a couple months, but I became better for her. My annoyances seem inconsequential once I write out that last one.

I started cracking. Fraternity brothers started driving me to endless frustration. My relationship with my sister devolved to the point of me “being dead” to her.

She was the only one I felt like I could talk to. But we didn’t see each other enough. Sure, we texted about our problems, but sometimes you can’t get that emotion out without being face to face. So we’d see each other, face to face, every other weekend. And for the 2-3 days that we were able, any and all emotions would pour out. She had problems too, and I was the only one she could talk to besides her mom. We would hang out, do fun things, but there would always be half a day that felt like it was lost to unresolved issues. 

It feels like it was always me putting my baggage on her. Me becoming hypersensitive about the smallest, stupidest things because I was always on edge. 

At that point, my cracks seeped into the relationship. 

It was easy enough to ignore. We would see each other, have mostly good times, one meh-bad time, and then not see each other for 2 weeks. Essentially only texting and face timing in that gap. Problems tend to disappear when the person isn’t there.

Get back to summer after junior year and we’re finally physically closer again. We go on a vacation with my parents for over a week. That’s the most time we’ve ever spent together. I get frustrated with my parents at one point, she doesn’t like that. Put a sour mood on one day. Otherwise, as was well and I think we both fell like we got closer that vacation. 

I have an internship, which essentially means I’m working 9-5 M-Thursday. I was working the summer we met, but hours were a lot less consistent so we spent a lot of time together. It was hard to spend time when I was working, so we were essentially back onto the weekend-only schedule.


Her parents move. They were supposed to move during the next semester, not summer. Now she lives over an hour away. 

We both knew this wasn’t good. Being at a distance for most of our relationship was bad enough. It slowed down the whole process, kept us in the “cupcake” phase for close to a year. But we always took solace in knowing that we’d be close during the summer.

We have our anniversary.

At this point, there’s more BS every time we meet. I can’t think of anything she did because...I feel as if I ruined this relationship. I just started putting all of my negative feelings onto her. For example, I feel like people never listen to me. I’ve had so many nightmares of yelling and no sound coming out. So, I’d say (or imply) multiple times that I don’t want to do something (let me preface this by saying most of my life I’ve been extremely agreeable and would go with whatever someone else wanted to do, but I was really done with doing that at this point). And she would sometimes push to do it, which would really annoy me and I’d push those negative emotions onto her until I felt awful that I had. 

Still, 95% of the time we hung out we were completely positive. We’re like a lot of the same things, have the same sense of humor, and would usually get along perfectly.

Yet the cracks kept growing in my mind.

These last two weeks had felt slightly off. Lack of “I love you” from her when saying goodnight. Just slightly less emotion in the texting. Last time something like this happened, someone else had broken up with me, so I wasn’t that upbeat.

We meet up on Friday. She was moving apartments at her college so I drove the 2 hours from home to get there (yes it’s 2 hours from my home and my college). I get there and she says “sorry if this weekend isn’t fun, I’m just not in a good mood and I don’t know why”. Goodie.

So I try to help her move. We get into another small fight because I turned my finger sideways playing basketball and couldn’t put any weight on it but I wanted to help and felt guilty if I couldn’t. We get pizza and wings and have a great time watching tv and stealing a roommates’ futon to sleep on (her new bed was really uncomfortable). 

Next day happens. Everything is good, we see a movie early, finish moving out of her old apt, go back to her new one.

We sit down and start talking. What feels like a normal conversation slowly turns into a conversation about issues. She says she doesn’t know what to do. She says things feel wrong and she doesn’t know how or what...sorry I can’t get the words on here. But essentially we went over everything I had already said.

Conversation devolves. We both are bawling. It ends with me driving away while she stands on the sidewalk crying. 

She had ended it, but neither of us felt good about it.

Here I am. Wondering why I can’t get anything to work. Every relationship I’ve been in, I feel like it’s always been me. I wasn’t able to be myself in one and take the big leaps. I was myself in this one, but let out too many emotions in the limited times of us being able to see each other. 

No relationship is perfect, but I can’t see how I’ll ever get closer than this. Every couple fights, but ours were bs and barely even fights. 

I would do anything to get her back. I’ve told her that. I wish I could take back so much. There’s so much more I want to say. I’m just at a complete loss. I don’t know how I’ll find anyone more compatible than her. I already know I’ll never find anyone like her. She was truly unique...I just don’t know what to do. I can’t believe it ended.

It doesn’t feel real."

90xrox,46,2018-07-22,I want to get help with anxiety but I am very anxious about seeing a psychiatrist,bourgee,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/90xrox/i_want_to_get_help_with_anxiety_but_i_am_very/,"I'm going back to college soon after taking a semester off to work full time as an intern with two years left in my degree. Every semester I always have a lot of anxiety about making friends, roomates, classes, classmates, etc. to the point where I can't even leave my room to participate in anything. I worry about so many things like what to say to people and what they will think about how I look or what I do or say. I stress endlessly about where I want to sit in the lecture hall on the first day of classes because I think it can make a huge difference on how the semester goes (which it probably wouldn't). I hate walking around campus between classes because there are so many people and I don't know what they think of me even though most of the people I'm around I have had classes with and am fairly aquainted with. 

I generally feel that I'm a likeable person whenever someone new does talk to me, but I'm afraid everyone always thinks I'm too boring because I'm afraid to come out of my shell around most people. And when I do, I still feel like they just don't like my personality. I have many people in classes who I would consider friendly aquantances but none I have ever hung out with outside of class or studying at the library. 

My school has lots of activities and events at the beginning of each semester to help newcomers meet people and make new friends. Last year I really wanted to go to one because I was so lonely, but couldn't work up the courage to go. I took a nap instead and woke up a few hours later. I realized there was about 30 minutes left in the event and something just came over me and I literally forced myself to get up and go. I ended up meeting one of my closest friends. This was the major point when I realized my anxiety was seriously affecting me.

I have always felt this constant social anxiety since junior high and I have finally had enough. I have been thinking about trying anxiety medication for about a year now but I can't get past the anxiety of actually going to a psychiatrist. I know that I want to start this semester off not being afraid to put myself out there and make new friends.

Any advice or experience with seeing a psychiatrist for the first time? I know I could have bad experiences with medications and have to try several before finding a good fit, but I think it will be worth it. I just need a little help to push me to see a doctor. 

TLDR: Finally want to get help for anxiety before new semester of college. Any advice on seeing a psychiatrist?"
90y7p0,3,2018-07-22,How do I (27F) recover from a challenging period without pushing everyone around me away,DominiqueFrancon123,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/90y7p0/how_do_i_27f_recover_from_a_challenging_period/,"Hi everyone, :) 

So, I´ve been a long-time lurker on r/relationships, and you guys are a bunch of insightful, nice people, so I decided to post about something that I don´t have much experience with but some of you might. Sorry in advance if this turns out to be long. 

I´m 27 and I come from Eastern Europe. I come from a very privileged background and, if I wanted to, I could have taken over my parents´ businesses and lived comfortably. However, although I have a great relationship with them, I felt the need to create something of my own, that I worked for. I didn´t want to be so and so´s daughter and nothing else, as it were. So, at 23 I moved to a large, prosperous country in Western Europe for my master´s degree. I had a solid plan, I speak the language at a native speaker level, in addition to English and was accepted to a prestigious university. The first few years were hard, especially for someone who had grown up pampered. I studied full time and often worked two or three jobs. Towards the end of my studies, while I was working on my thesis I got very sick (partially life – threatening) and had to extend my studies for another semester. This hurt, but the entire time which I spent working odd jobs, saving every last cent (not wanting to take money from my parents), living in cramped spaces with numerous roommates, I kept telling myself, you´re doing this on your own, it´ll all be worth it, it´ll pay off. No summer vacations, no going out for coffee – gotta save money, no travelling, no fun for the entirety of my mid-twenties. I sort of regret that now. 

Fast forward to 2018. I graduate and do a good, but extremely low paid internship in my field in another city. This is a great experience but drains me financially. I go to visit my parents in my home country and begin looking for a permanent job in the country where I studied. This is where I began fantasizing about finally having my own money, travelling with my boyfriend, having a nice apartment, living in a cool city, etc. Well, things were downhill from there. 

I struggled finding a job and got rejected because of my foreign sounding name and people assuming I won´t do a good job despite my qualifications in the said country. I was forced to begin working as a cleaning lady to keep myself afloat which I would have nothing against had I not just thrown away years of my life on getting degrees. But whatever, I do it although the work is backbreaking and hats off to everyone who does it. All the while I am still applying for jobs and, in my naivety and desperation, I get roped up in being a personal assistant to a guy whose business turned out to be a money laundering operation. (I don´t want to get into this.) I get suspicious, call the police, they decide I´m an accomplice. Cue weeks of panic attacks from the fear of getting deported and ruining everything I worked so hard for. I am looking at a fine for this, I do not know how much. In the meantime, I am working three jobs (the money laundering guy did not pay me – what a surprise!) and the month ends with me earning 300 euros after working 12 hour days, without free weekends. While, naturally, applying for other jobs. 

At this point I am devastated, but come across an actual job offer. I pull myself together, freelance for the firm and they like me and offer to hire me. I am supposed to start my new position in September, getting paid and currently looking for apartments in the big city like I always wanted. 

I should be excited, feel relieved and try to put all of this behind me. Except I can´t. I have not genuinely smiled for months. I do not enjoy anyone´s company. I get up in the morning and leave my boyfriend´s place to go home and hyperventilate, wondering what will go wrong next. I´ve had a couple of health issues due to stress, but had no time to address them. I have become cynical and untrusting, and cannot relax or enjoy anything. A hike in the nature? Pointless. Going out with friends? Pointless. Sex with boyfriend? No desire. I do not like the person I am becoming. I am questioning my life decisions and even thinking about returning to my home country, which I do not want to do, although my parents would be happy to have me. My boyfriend has been an absolute angel, and supported me without a word, but I am still completely distraught. I just keep working and think about what is going to go wrong next. 

Believe me, I am aware of how spoiled I sound, people have gone through so much worse! But, I was wondering, how do I pull myself up? How to I return the faith I´ve lost in everything and how do I stop only seeing the negative side of things? During this whole ordeal, I did my best to eat healthy, kept going to the gym and taking care of myself, but I still bottled up my emotions and now they´re coming back big time. Moreover, I am involuntarily alienating people because I don´t want to bother them with my issues. 

Has anyone managed to become optimistic again after facing hardships and continued living a full life and not a fearful existence? 

Thanks so much everyone!

tldr: Went through a tough time, now I tend to be bitter and push people away. Does it get any better? Is it just a phase? "
90yhyi,4,2018-07-22,F1 Visa Holder - CPT Questions,rgoes2,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/90yhyi/f1_visa_holder_cpt_questions/,"Hello everybody,

I have a bachelor degree in telecom engineering, that is, a mix of electrical, network and signals, and I acquired my bachelor in my home country, not U.S. Right now, I am enrolled in an MBA degree and am going to start my third quarter of eight quarter(3/8). I wanted to now more about CPT, so what I did was to read about it and to contact my DSO, even though I got answer from her and read a lot of about it I am full of doubts.

According to my DSO, in order for me to apply for an internship through CPT I have to finish four quarters (would be possible only by the end of this year) and I would finish my degree in the end of the next year. However, according to the ICE website, I may enroll in the first semester CPT if I am in a graduate level (which I am) and if my program requires it.

When I communicate with my DSO about the CPT process she stated that ""We do not support CPT"" due to the fact that it takes a while to get all the paper work and would be better for me to wait a few more months and apply for post OPT once I graduated. According to USCIS the CPT process and paper work takes up to 4 months to be done, right? So it leaves me with plenty of time, around 8 month to do internship! Can my DSO/university neglect CPT to me?

Other question that I have is, my CPT needs to be correlated with my currently degree - MBA - or it can be based on my bachelor degree - telecom engineering? Depending on the answer for this question, I have the possibility to add an emphasis with my MBA, for instance, an MBA with emphasis in  IT management to become more similar to my undergrad degree.

I have a meeting with my DSO to discuss this matter this week. I would like to know as much as I can in regards with the CPT. Some additional information that may be helpful:

\- I graduated in engineer around a year ago and within six months I started my MBA degree;

\- I had a total of 8 months of experience in regards to my major;

\- I would like to stay in the STEM area due to post-OPT extension;

Thanks everybody.

I’ve stopped setting goals for myself because I fear I’ll never achieve them. 

I don’t bother applying for anything because I fear I’ll just end up getting rejected. 

I know I should get off my ass and get to work on improving myself but I simply feel dead and listless inside. The whole day goes by and I can’t get myself to work on anything constructive for even an hour. I can literally spend a whole day doing nothing. This has led to an anxiety that creeps on me whenever I try to sit down and watch a movie, a show or play a video game. I can’t even enjoy my hobbies anymore. I literally force myself to sit down with my guitar. I just end up playing the same old fragments of songs. I can’t be bothered to learn something new or whole. And this reluctance to learn and lack of curiosity goes beyond guitar.  

All around me, in real life and online, I see happy people living out their dreams. People landing internships and jobs, starting businesses, planning to marry their SOs, travelling the world, laughing and sharing moments with their large circle of friends. I try to feel happy for them but deep down I am filled with a terrible, suffocating bitterness. I know the world doesn’t owe me a thing, but God, it hurts.

Here I am, a 22M, unemployed, with few friends. I realized I’m the one who always reaches out to my friends so I tried being more distant. No one even bothered to shoot a hello at me. Few months ago, I’ve had a friend stop replying to my messages without any explanation. Another friend has been acting weird and distant for a while now, avoiding my questions about his behavior. I simply can’t comprehend how other people are on such great terms with their friends, trusting them like family and travelling around with them. I can’t get my friends to wish me a goddamn birthday, while I’ve seen some “popular” people get surprise birthday parties and 200+ FB posts every single year. I just don’t get it. What are these people doing differently to earn such loyalty, respect and adoration? And what have I done to be treated like a pariah?

I’ve never been in a relationship of any kind. I can’t imagine any girl I know would even consider being my friend, let alone being in a relationship with me. I’ve started forcing myself to not be attracted to women because I know it will end in failure when I approach them. I don’t want anyone want to label me as a desperate creep. 

To top it off, I flunked my last semester. I lost my scholarship and I have to repeat a lot of classes. I don’t know how to break the news to my parents, nor do I know how to ask help from my uni.   

I’m not a religious or superstitious man, otherwise I’d have thought this was all a test by some divine being. Or worse, punishment for some sins I’ve unknowingly committed. Or maybe I’ve been cursed or something. I can’t remember the last time I was successful or happy. It feels like my life has been a long string of disappointments and failures for a while now. It all keeps compounding and has started to take a toll on me. 

I can’t help but fantasize of passing away in my sleep. I know most people won’t care. I’d off myself but I don’t have the spine to do so nor do I want to hurt my parents. They’d be devastated. I know a lot of people would be glad to have the privileged life I’m leading, but I feel like I just can’t compete anymore.

90z0xk,3,2018-07-22,I've Destroyed my First Healthy Relationship,throwaway87203987456,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/90z0xk/ive_destroyed_my_first_healthy_relationship/,"Hi guys. I'd really appreciate any relationship advice you could give me on a bad situation I've landed myself in. Please excuse the throwaway account; my boyfriend's on Reddit.

I am a college student in the US, and I've been dating another guy from my school for the past seven months. I'll call him Tom. We met on Tinder, and I immediately knew he was someone special. For the few weeks, I tried to play it cool, but it was evident that I had feelings for him. He is different than me in so many ways, and every moment I spent with him expanded my view of the world. We officially began dating after the first month.

I've been in a few relationships before, but they were all extremely unhealthy. Being with someone felt like a constant game of who could land more barbed comments or be more aloof. With Tom it's different. I am completely naked to him. I've told him over and over that I am a bad person, but he refuses to believe it. He has taught me what intimacy feels like, and I am deeply grateful for that.

As is probably clear by now, I am completely in love with Tom. Think thirteen-year-old girl, writing a boy's name thousands of times in a diary. However, as I mentioned previously, he and I are very different. One of the ways this manifests itself is in our feelings on monogamy. One night, it came out that, before we were dating, I didn't believe I could only be with one person. I don't really believe that. I tried to explain that what I meant is I have the capacity to be in love with more than one person at a time. That didn't go over very well. Tom was furious and told me if I ever developed feelings for someone else to immediately break up with him. I told him I wouldn't do that, but that I would never act on my feelings towards someone else because I knew it would hurt him.

Fast forward to the present day. Tom and I have been long distance for two months now because I'm out of the country working as an intern. Long distance has been really hard on both of us but we get by with calls once every other day. About two weeks ago, I was invited by some of my co-workers to go out drinking on a Friday night. We ended up in a club and several drinks later I decided to dance. On the dance floor, I wanted to find someone to dance with so this girl and I started grinding. I didn't intend for it to go anywhere, it was just nice to be in physical contact with another person for the first time in months. After that, I started talking with a random guy. He seemed nice, and so I started dancing with him. I put my arms on his shoulders and asked if he was gay. I hadn't met any other queer people in the country I'm in and was honestly curious. He responded by grabbing my crotch. I politely pushed him away and told him that I had a boyfriend and that I only wanted to dance. Another friend of his started dancing with us and he grabbed my ass. I repeated the whole, ""Sorry, I have a boyfriend"" line. About fifteen minutes later my friends and I left.

The next morning I woke up feeling hung over and incredibly guilty. I honestly wouldn't mind if Tom had danced with someone else, but I knew that he wouldn't feel the same way. I called him, ready to confess and apologize. I am normally honest to a fault, but I couldn't get myself to come clean. Instead, I just mentioned what happened in an offhand way (""Oh this guy, grabbed my crotch last night. So random!""). This of course only made me feel guiltier, so yesterday I told him what actually happened. He's furious. I tried calling him over and over again but he wouldn't answer. I texted him asking if he was breaking up with me and begged him not to. I felt like throwing up for hours. Finally, he told me to call him. Tom said that I had betrayed his trust and that I'd hurt him deeply. He asked how I would feel if the situation was reversed, and I made the mistake of telling him that I wouldn't care. Now he thinks that I don't really love him. I apologized and told him it doesn't matter if we have different comfort zones and that from now on I'll respect his boundaries. I asked him if he thought we could get through this. He said he needed time to think about it.

I feel like I've ruined the best thing that's ever happened to me, and destroyed someone I care about. I really need some advice right now."
90z6p7,6,2018-07-22,I am a noob and I really need help with SDNs,amicaze,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/90z6p7/i_am_a_noob_and_i_really_need_help_with_sdns/,"Hello, I'm currently in an internship and my project has grinded to a halt pretty fast. We are software engineering students, and were taken in to create a webapp, however, our project was changed to networking stuff, and we're network illiterate, pretty much.

So let me explain the situation. Our tutor, my colleague and me all have a Linux machine. On these machines we have created a virtual network of routers (Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 6.0.1) and linked them all together using VMWare (LAN segments). We managed to make this work, we can ping every machine from each one.

Now we need a controller, and that's where it becomes... complicated.
Our tutor wants to use OpenDaylight, and connect to one virtual router using BGP, and basically, we have been stuck at this point for a month.  
I haven't even been able to connect ODL to my routers, my mate managed to display the network topology on a 3 y/o version of ODL, but he can't go any further. He was able to do that because in old versions you could edit config files directly, but now you have to use REST, and we can't make REST work.

It seems like everything is either outdated or incorrect, I've tried countless tutorials, and in each and every one of them, at some point, they tell us :

    to verify that the last command worked, use [this command] and verify that 
    you have this output

And the output is ""This data model doesn't exist"".

We are starting to get desperate. As I said, we don't know anything about networking, and our tutor isn't really helping us.

The next steps are :
 -Connecting each virtual network to each other via the physical network
 -Making a bunch of experiments involving shortest-path algorithms.

Do you think the approach our tutor took is the right one ? Do you know have any idea what we are doing wrong with ODL ? I don't think the tutorials are all wrong, but i really can't see why after following instructions we get these errors."
90z9d7,914,2018-07-22,Tiltseeker - A new tool for Jungle mains (and others),dmilin,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/90z9d7/tiltseeker_a_new_tool_for_jungle_mains_and_others/,"---

#[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) - A website that actually helps you win

---

**WEBSITE NOT MOBILE OPTIMIZED YET**

**TLDR at the bottom**



[Source Code](https://github.com/dmilin1/tiltseeker)

&amp;nbsp;

### What Is It?

[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) is a website that helps Jungle mains optimize their pathing by calculating the best lanes to camp. However, many of the features can be useful to laners as well.

&amp;nbsp;

### The Story

A year ago, I finished a little python script I passionately named *Tilt*seeker with the purpose of doing what the game lookup sites I used could not. I wanted something that used statistics and data from the [Riot API](https://developer.riotgames.com) to actually help me win games. I'm a Shaco one trick, and if maining Shaco has taught me anything, it's that wins happen more when you get in your opponents' heads.

The first iteration of my program gave basic stats and had the primary purpose of finding enemies on tilt. Who could you camp all game to get your team fed? As I added more features, I was posting on Reddit and [mentioned my project](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8eur1e/introducing_the_blitz_desktop_app_fully_automatic/dxyqbfg/). To my surprise, the idea seemed really popular and I was encouraged to build it into a full website.

Despite my complete lack of knowledge of web development, I was determined to make [*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) work. A year later, [*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) is up and running with an open beta.


&amp;nbsp;


### What Does It Do?

[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com) is a website intended for jungle mains, and is best utilized in ranked. However, it can be beneficial for any player regardless of their role. By employing Riot's outstanding public API, *Tilt*seeker looks up all players in a given game and assigns them a ""Tilt Score"", which indicates how beneficial it would be to camp that target during the game. 

In addition to assigning a ""Tilt Score"" for each player, *Tilt*seeker provides data about a team's damage output types, as well as various relevant stats for each individual player.

&amp;nbsp;

### The Stats

[Example Image](https://tiltseeker.com/Screenshot1.PNG)

Greater stats detail can be read [here](https://tiltseeker.com/guide.html).

- Losing Streak: How many games have been consecutively lost in a row in order to establish level of tilt.

- Winrate: A percentage representing a player's average chance of winning a given game in ranked (when trying their hardest).

- Mastery Points: The number of points a player has on the champion they are playing in the looked up game.

- Last Played: The number of days since the player last played as the champion they are currently using.

- Aggressiveness: An estimation of how aggressive a player is, based on how often they attempt to trade and fight in previous games.

- Warding: An estimation of how well a player wards, based on how they ward in previous games.

- Tilt Score: The tilt score is a cumulative estimate of the benefits of camping a player. A score below 25 means that a jungler's time is likely better spent somewhere else, because the player is likely good at warding, a one trick, a smurf, on a winning streak, familiar with their champion, and/or plays safe. A tiltscore from 25-35 is fairly neutral and does not indicate one way or the other. A camp score above 35 means that a jungler should heavily consider camping that player as they are likely bad at warding, unfamiliar with their champion, boosted, on a losing streak, and/or plays recklessly. A tiltscore above 50 is a prime candidate to camp and while a win is never guaranteed, a hard camp will make it incredibly likely.



&amp;nbsp;


### Desktop App

I have also made a portable [*Tilt*seeker Desktop App](https://tiltseeker.com/app.html) with [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) that automatically loads [*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com/) when a game starts so users don't have to do so manually.


&amp;nbsp;


### Money

~~I hate ads with a passion. I use an adblocker myself!~~

~~That said, I put hundreds of hours into building this website in my spare time and I have servers to pay for. However, since I hate ads so much, I have tried to keep ads to an absolute minimum. In fact, I only have 2 ad zones on the entire website!~~

~~Instead, my website uses your spare CPU cycles to generate revenue. It does this by performing calculations on the Monero network. You can read more about the process [here](https://www.coindesk.com/information/how-bitcoin-mining-works/) and [here](https://www.coinimp.com/faq).~~

~~However, I know that no one wants to have their CPU nerfed while in game. So, while using my website, I monitor your game stats to ensure that no CPU is ever used while you play League.~~

**Web mining will be made optional in an update in the next few days. I did not expect it to be this unpopular and I'm sorry.**


&amp;nbsp;


### Hire Me!

I'm a Software Engineering student in my senior year at San Jose State University in the Bay Area. If you're impressed by my website and have career or internship opportunities available, check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/dmilin1/tiltseeker) and send me a PM! Or contact me at https://tiltseeker.com/about.html.


&amp;nbsp;


### Thank You

A big thank you to /u/Parachuteee, /u/JustcallmeDexter, /u/TacoBowser, /u/Kayma, /u/Dsnahans, and /u/chantdesange for encouraging me to finish Tiltseeker and build it into a public project for everyone to use. A special thank you to TheWisestOfFools for the technical advice and expertise.

TLDR:

[*Tilt*seeker](https://tiltseeker.com)

Type in your username while at the loading screen and hit enter. Helps junglers figure out the best lanes to camp.

#Edit:

Webmining seems really unpopular. It'll take me a little while to remove it from the site, but in the meantime, if you add this URL to your adblocker, my website won't mine:

https://tiltseeker.com/webmin.js



---

#Edit 2:

I currently have a grand total of 631 ad impressions with 3764 page loads. That's 83% of you blocking ads. Gamers are tech savvy so I need a good solution to replace mining. So far I have:

- Ask users to white list
- Donation button with target
- Optional mining (disabled by default)

I'm in need of a good solution to make this work and I'm very open to suggestions. If any of you have ideas or have experience in monetization, I'd love to hear them.


---

#Edit 3:

I've followed the suggestions of a number of Redditors and changed mining to be disabled by default. I truly believe that mining is a wonderful replacement to ads, but I'm aware that not everyone shares that belief.

Now, it my site gives you 3 options:

- Whitelist my website. You'll see some ads, but I'll keep it reasonable.

- Get annoyed by a popup of me begging every time you load a page.

- Allow me to mine with some spare CPU cycles only when Tiltseeker is open and you aren't in game.

I believe this is a reasonable solution. I hope you all agree."

my name is Vince and I am a senior majoring in Human Computer Interaction. I am really interested in the field of UX, and everything that it has to offer to websites, products and users. The thing is I have been trying to get in the field of UX by applying to internships left and right but it seems I keep getting turned down. I understand I don’t have work experience in UX, but I have done projects and school work that applies to the field. My portfolio has all my work located in my website but I am beginning to think it is how I designed my website. I would really appreciate any constructive criticism on my resume/website to see what employers are and aren’t looking for. My website is listed down below. If there is anything anyone can do to inform me into getting an internship in UX and breaking into the field it would be greatly appreciated.

9109nm,2,2018-07-22,When I first realized NC would be necessary with nMother &amp; how can I still have a relationship with my dad,everwiccid,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/9109nm/when_i_first_realized_nc_would_be_necessary_with/,"I was looking at some memes online and one of them (in which someone's mother asks a bunch of times if they're working a certain day and day of, she's freaking out like ""where are you"") reminded me of just how much of a fucking control freak my nMother is/was. 

Sometime after I first moved out over a year ago, my mother was causing some friction because I was trying to slowly limit contact; our former relationship was far too unhealthy, and she treated me more as a best friend and slave all at once. It was fucking exhausting, and I was getting nothing done in my own home because she would drag me over to drink with her most nights every week. I was falling behind on the assignments in my college courses, so I needed to focus on school anyway. So she was already miffed she had no one to spend time with her (because tbh no one wants to be around her. Even her own family cuts her out of family gatherings. We have fucking SEPARATE FAMILY GATHERINGS so we can actually have a good time). Now, one of my jobs involves basically working as an intern (""Work Study"" in the Printing and Graphics department at the college I go to, and I had practically the same schedule as I did when I still lived with my parents. So it came as a surprise to me when, at 9 in the morning, my mother was trying to call me. I rejected the call and sent her a quick text saying I was working. She tries to call again, and I miss it because my phone is on silent. She finally responds to my text, basically saying she doesn't believe me. I remind her that it's the same schedule as before, and I'd always worked on that day. 

Y'all, let me tell you, I had to make a damn hand-drawn sign saying something to the effect of ""YES, I AM AT WORK"" with the damn date on it and hold it up in a fucking selfie SHOWING I was in the office for her to back the fuck off. She got all huffy, saying I didn't have to be so dramatic, but... How the fuck do I fight something that won't listen to logic?? My best work friend showed up then, and I realized I was scared. I was still afraid of my mother.

My friend helped me a lot with coming down from it, and he admitted that even though he had only met her once, he wasn't surprised at all. I guess I blocked out the time he came over to help my mother and I make Apfel kuchen (German apple cake) and she not only wouldn't let him help, but she was repeatedly passive aggressive with him for asking what he could do to help (since, as usual, my mother planned a cooking/baking project and just had me do everything while she watched). I confessed to him I always imagined I'd have to cut her off entirely and, while he's not the kind of person to think about cutting off family no matter how shitty they are (and trust me, he has some fucking SHITTY family members he keeps going back to), but even he was supportive of me cutting her out of my life.

It took a long while after that, as well as another larger narcissistic incident, but today we're NC/VERY LC, with the only contact I have with her being brief and polite for my dad's sake. I wish he'd leave her, he wishes he could leave her, but he refuses to have pay 20+ years of alimony to her. I can only hope he can maintain his newfound sobriety while still living with that wicked witch. Because honestly? Cutting her off helped with my own demons and my own addictions. When I found out he heard voices sometimes, it hurt my heart so fucking bad because I heard voices, too, until I cut her off. I wish I could do more for him, but I'm losing my home and he's going through bankruptcy. I wish there was something I could do to save him from her, but I have a lifetime of experience that tells me my urge to keep being the peacekeeper and the Supergirl for my family is only killing me. It fucking hurts. What CAN I do for my dad that's still healthy for everyone? And why can't I make the guilt go away..?"

The site I'm using is http://homeandlearn.org/ and I live the way it's all detailed, organized, and written out. I already know C++, and this program was only slightly repetivive. Im sure someone with no coding experience can handle it.


In addition to that, I have a couple questions: A) It seems to stand that I need more than one sheet on an excel file to work. i.e. one sheet to hold the processing, and another to ""display the data"". Can I work with one?


B) this is more of a rant, but was there a legitimate reason why offset action has the default of (1,1) to stay in the same cell, and not (0,0)?

910nr3,1,2018-07-22,I am my stepmother's next fixation. [TW: Emotional abuse],shuaidiao,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/910nr3/i_am_my_stepmothers_next_fixation_tw_emotional/,"[Previous post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8xgsqm/i_think_my_dad_married_a_narcissist_tw_mentions/)

Ever since my last post things have been...escalating. The good news is my sister and I have been compiling evidence should it need to be used in court, and NStep has told Dad that she wants a divorce. The bad news is that I'm the one that NStep has fixated on as the root of all the problems in the family because she told my father to bring home cheese for me and then I ate the last of it without asking if she wanted any after it had been sitting in the fridge for over two months.  The past week for me has been her screaming and slamming doors. She's been cursing at my dad over text nearly every day. 

Last Sunday, I sent her a message apologizing for causing her to be angry and thanking her for taking care of me while I'm home. I received a message four days later on Thursday that just read, ""Liar."" I haven't responded because I know responding is just going to give *her* a chance to respond, and quite frankly I don't really feel like I need to be listening to her right now. 

She's ""given"" me things (AKA, told my dad to buy it or hotel freebies) that she's now taken away or thrown out completely as if to say ""I can give these things to you, and I can take them away, too."" She's demanded that Dad hand over all his credit cards so she can limit his spending even though she spends the most money in the family (excluding necessities like food, gas, and bills). There's a new Amazon package for her at least once a week. 

For a while, we thought she was going to demand that I leave, and frankly we can't afford to have me stay in a hotel or AirBnB for the remainder of my time here (5 weeks). We just don't have the money for it. She's ""graciously"" allowed me to stay in the house provided that she doesn't see me, which means I have to stay in my room unless I need to eat, go to my internship, or use the bathroom. We aren't allowed to eat anything that isn't instant ramen -- we even purchased some nicer instant ramen and she boxed it up and taped it shut to tell us that we weren't allowed to eat it. Meanwhile, she's screaming at Dad about could he have raised me like this, how could he allow me to treat her this way, how could he have allowed me to become Satan's spawn?

I know it's not true but I'm starting to believe her. I've cried nearly every night since this has happened and I know I'm falling into a depressive episode but I don't know how to stop it. I have no appetite and I sleep too much but don't feel rested. I got into contact with the domestic violence hotline and they said that all I can do is practice self-care. I understand that ultimately it's up to my dad to take action, but it's so frustrating that I can't do anything about it. 

I'm so tired. "
910rzm,3,2018-07-22,Penn SEAS,finesse6ang,UPenn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UPenn/comments/910rzm/penn_seas/,"Hey guys! I'm a rising senior in HS (this isn't a chance me don't worry), and I want to know from you guys if UPenn would be a good fit for me. 


My academic interests: 

CS with the focus being on business, getting awesome company internships and future jobs at startups. I have researched before and I have been involved in industry before, and while I did love both, being in that development mindset and collaborating with others to make some direct impact in our world resonates with me so much more. I also love the business world and my end goal is to start my own successful tech company, so I know for a fact that I want to be an active software engineer for companies in the next 6-8+ years. At the same time, I don't want to sacrifice in-depth CS and engineering learning for this business-oriented ambition, as many people do that are simply trying to land jobs.

My personality:

I consider myself well-rounded as a character. I believe I am a people person -- I thrive on positive social interactions. It is a good trait of mine to balance out how hard I work on school/learning and other things that matter to me (nonprofits and work specifically). I inevitably tend to have stress built up, but I also tend to only feel truly stressed when people around me are. I love when I'm with people that also are under stress but don't act like they're totally screwed -- it's reassuring and makes me feel like I'm doing okay. I work out like once a day and have fun whenever I can to keep myself happy.

My social ambitions: 

I am a very social person, while also very independent, and love chilling with friends on workdays and partying and getting out of my comfort zone on weekends. I do love having friends that are similar to me and share my ambitions, but I really love making friends with people with different goals and from different schools. I wouldn't want to make like a pure CS social circle and spend all my free time with them, I'd definitely need to spend time with others across the campus. A bigger school would fit me better because it usually means you have more people and more things to interact with.

From what I have researched online, UPenn seems to match my needs in these aspects, and so I was considering EDing. Application wise, I feel like I might have a decent shot. What would you guys recommend for me based on how the Penn experience has been for you?

Thank you!! :)"
91163f,1,2018-07-22,Wondering if I (28M) should tell my new coworker (26F) about my feelings.,newcrushatwork,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/91163f/wondering_if_i_28m_should_tell_my_new_coworker/,"Okay, I'm sure this is a common topic, but I couldn't find threads related to this, so here goes.

I recently started an internship that is likely to turn into a full job. When I first arrived, this woman was the person who did my intake and helpfully showed me around the office and made some introductions. At that time i idly considered if found her attractive, and didn't think too much of it.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, she has brought me into her friend group of people in our office to help me get to know some more coworkers, and have some off time activities. During that, I thought I saw her giving me some subtle signals she found me interesting. We went on to have a very in-depth conversation about our interests and just who we are as people.

I quickly developed a full on crush for her, and our having conversations that are still as in-depth and enjoyable as the first time where time just flys by, have only cemented the feeling.

However, one thing she has freely admitted is her past history in relationships, and recently ended a very bad relationship. She is taking a break from dating for the time being, and doesn't know I'm really interested in her.

I do think she's really great, but am willing to be friends (NOT as a back door to something more down the line) because we've connected so well.

Complicating all this is the fact I've had as little romantic experience as is really possible at my age, while still being interested in relationships.

I personally see three options for this:

Tell her how I feel, and respect her choice regardless of outcome

Not say anything, and try to be as good a friend as possible, and start looking elsewhere

Try and distance myself from her and start looking elsewhere

Pretty fortunate gig for sure considering I'm just starting audio school in August. 

Unfortunately, it feels like I didn't get much out of it. The group was pretty much all vocals and it's his own studio so there was pretty much 0 setup every day (just left the mics in the same place) and the only thing I could ever observe in the recording process was the comping and what the producers would do to get performances they wanted. 

I'm not bitching that I did gruntwork, I expected as much up front but should I have expected more in terms of opportunities to learn things? 

How can I go about asking for more opportunities w/o interfering?"

So I'm a college senior economics B.S candidate, 3.4 GPA at a non-target school (Top 50 public university). I'm seriously considering registering for the CFA Level one. I'm trying to start a financial career and realize how competitive the industry is. My GPA and resume are not the strongest, and have found it rather difficult to land a financial internship at a reputable firm. I consider myself an above average test taker and motivated with studying. 

I'm very limited on time, and hope to land a job as a financial analyst after my last semester,  spring 2019. Would being a CFA L1 candidate (and hopefully passing) give me the competitive edge I'm lacking by not being a 'finance major?' And if I were to commit, would it be reasonable to expect myself to pass the December exam? In addition to my economics courses I've taken 3 or 4 finance courses as well as (double minor business and entrepreneurship). I also have a very light course load next semester, only 12 credit hours and 6 of those online. I would be able to hit the minimum 300 study hours recommended. 

Any advice or honest input is greatly appreciated, thanks. "

912yyu,3,2018-07-22,Is girlfriend of 4 years losing interest or am I just paranoid/controlling?,sigh-athrowaway,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/912yyu/is_girlfriend_of_4_years_losing_interest_or_am_i/,"TL;DR: 4 year relationship that has been recently distant the past month due to sudden long distance, she starts ignoring me more and more which makes me mad,claims she’s always out with her friends so she can’t text. We Have argument (says I’m suffocating/insecure), and she just starts “ok”ing me and not responding anymore/ignoring me. Should I ignore also? Should I keep trying to contact?

Sorry for the length, I’m emotional right now.

So my girlfriend (22f) and I (23m) have been dating all through college for 4 years now. We have/had plans to get married and eventually move in together. However, she is returning to go to graduate school and I was only able to find a job back in my hometown. 

This summer after we graduated, I start working while she gets a summer internship before grad school in a city about 3 hours away. At first, I visited every weekend, but as I started my job I missed a weekend and then she made plans for the next, and then again for the next, eventually I couldn’t come up the weekend after that etc. So I haven’t seen her in about a month due to this whole thing. After this summer though, she is coming back to grad school which is much closer to where I live. 

In the beginning, she used to call me every day and we’d talk on the way from work- eventually this stopped because we both just slacked. We used to text constantly, and then it slowed. I sometimes forgot to respond after falling asleep, she started going out with her coworkers and wouldn’t text me which I understood that she was busy. 

So here’s the main bit, eventually our texts got really scattered and I called her out a few times on it. She says she’s busy with friends, (her childhood female friend lives in the city she interns in, and recently got back in touch with her after a falling out) so I get it. But (curse social media) her Snapchat location kept popping up as active, so she’d get on Snapchat yet ignore my texts. I was getting really ticked at this.

So fast forward to this argument we had because she had been ignoring me again while I see on her Snapchat stories she’s with guys at the pool in the middle of the night just continuing to ignore my texts asking what she’s doing, if she wants to talk etc. I felt upset. I of course got upset with the Snapchat but I do trust her overall and wish she would just text me back atleast. I did feel insecure, despite the trust, and hate myself for it.

During this argument she ends up telling me that our conversations aren’t really interesting and boring, to which I respond that she doesn’t even bother texting me back most times because she’s busy (I mentioned the Snapchat and was getting angry like an idiot). She mentions that she’s having fun and enjoying herself and is sick of me expecting her to text me back all the time, which pissed me off because she ignores me for like 5 hours, it’s not like I expect a text in the next 30 minutes or anything. I could be wrong here and truly suffocating her, though.

What do you guys think is the issue and how should I proceed? I love her and can’t imagine my life without her, so it drives me nuts not talking to her. After this argument she has been ignoring me and I asked her to talk and she just says she’s with her friend (previously mentioned) and proceed to ignore me so I’ve been trying not to respond for a while now."

9160lt,2,2018-07-23,Being A Doctor Is Not For Me,gavdal2018,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9160lt/being_a_doctor_is_not_for_me/,"I need to get this off my chest and talk to anyone who can relate to my position. 

I have been a qualified doctor since 2012. HOWEVER: 

\- I have never, since qualifying, felt that being a doctor was right for me. 

\- I don't share a shred of the same enthusiasm for the job as most, if not all, of my colleagues

\- I literally count the minutes till I can finish work

\- Because my concentration is often poor at work, especially during my internship when I was dealing with a lot of depressive feelings, I did not get good feedback back from my tutors and mentors, which really sucked. I hate not doing well in anything, but at the time I just was so unsure about what to do. I felt like, and feel like, I was suffocating. 

\- My mental health as a result has gone back and forth between depression and anxiety several times since qualifying. I feel like Im spiralling downward, and as a result I feel as though I'm becoming even less and less competent at work. 

\- I left a training scheme early and began locumming as a doctor in the hopes that it would relieve some of the stress I was feeling but honestly speaking , it has only added to the problem. If you are not working crazy 70-80 + plus hours weekly, doing on-call, doing research, then you're often not seen as doing a good job. You face a stigma for that. 

Believe me , I wish I could find something to work really, really hard at and just somewhat enjoy. I am no stranger to hard work, but this job is just not for me , and I really am at a loss for what I can do. 

I'm now based in London city with my partner, who I'm very lucky to have, he is really supportive and does understand how I feel.  I'm hoping I can find myself a different career path. 

My passion in life has always been music. Ever since I was little I have always loved singing, songwriting, and performing. But, because I studied medicine it really did not leave a lot of time to properly pursue music. This is the point where I commend all those doctors who can also maintain healthy hobbies and actually be good at other things simultaneously - I don't know you guys do it! 

I even decided to return to college here to study music, which I have started. I thought initially it was a great idea, and believe me it feels good, almost natural to be studying something that I have always loved and always wanted to learn more about. 

But at this point in my life ( Im 29 in two days ) , I do not have a career. Simple as. I feel like I'm in total limbo land, wanting to get away from somewhere and reach somewhere else ASAP. Music is wonderful, but it could take another few years before I develop some sort of career in it , be it songwriting , teaching etc. 

 If there is anyone who can understand my position , please ....

feel free to say hi . "
916ceg,14,2018-07-23,Insights after 2 Years,Icecubes95,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/916ceg/insights_after_2_years/,"A few years ago I decided to quit video games to become a better person and find greater meaning and joy in my life. I want to share some of my insights from this experience with you guys.  
My history with video games is nothing unusual from the stories I've seen on this sub. As a kid, I played games like Pokémon or Mario Kart with friends or by myself and it was all well and good. Gaming was just one part of the many activities which I pursued in my free time. It started to become an issue when I started to play WoW at age 12. Looking back it's easy to see how WoW's game-mechanics are perfectly designed to keep players hooked, so that they will continue to pay the monthly subscription. At the same time, it was also very fun in it's own right. I have since realized that I am rather drawn to the feeling of progressing in something, whether that is in a game or in a real life pursuit.

  
The painful downside of the time spent gaming was that I kind of withdrew from real life. I stopped playing soccer and basketball, didn't meet up with friends anymore, ignored my family, didn't study much, etc. I think most of the people on this sub are familiar with this situation. Thankfully, I have always been pretty decent in school and also at sports, so I didn't really get bullied or anything horrible like that. However, I believe that due to my withdrawal I fell significantly behind in my social skills, which I am catching up with even today. For instance, I became rather anxious in social situations, such as parties, and when the other guys started dating I couldn't even fathom how they pulled that of. Eventually I was able to quit WoW but I still kept playing other games such as League, Civ5, Counter Strike, Skyrim. I spend around 6 years like that, pouring all of myself into whatever game I was playing (mindlessly surfing the web on the side), while doing the bare minimum to keep myself out of trouble.

  
Going of to University, I was super excited about the big life change and right about that time I stumbled onto Cam's Youtube channel as well as this sub. Initially, I wanted to do the 90 day detox to see what my life could be like if I put all my energy into personal growth. If there was any ambiguity to my ""addiction"" or at least compulsive use of games before the detox, that was gone after a couple of days. Honestly, it was super hard but it was also super worth it. It took me at least five tries to finally reach 90 days. At that point I was doing so well that I just decided to keep going. Here's some of the highlights that quitting brought me:

* Going from a short attention span to intense focus for long periods of time. This has been super helpful for University, where I was able to graduate in the top 10% of my year. Now I have my eyes on Grad School.
* Lots and lots of open free time, which I have largely used to explore new hobbies, e.g. running, lifting, reading, singing in a choir, dancing, mountain-biking, skateboarding, playing the Ukulele, cooking, listening to Podcasts, board-games with friends, going for long walks in nature, studying Spanish etc.
* Doing these activities, I gained a lot of confidence which has allowed me to accomplish a few things I was previously way too scared of: moving into my own place, studying abroad for a semester, completing two internships in different cities, solo backpacking through Europe for 5 weeks, working as a TA, and working as a waiter part-time
* Much better social life because I can make people a priority. With every encounter I have, I feel more comfortable and I am able to just be myself around people
* The time I spent exercising and working on my diet has also been rather handy. When I look at old pictures of myself compared to now, the positive change is astonishing
* Much better mental health, way less anxiety, and also the change from being known as a pessimistic and boring person to a kind and open optimist. Someone people actually like to spend time with, myself included. 

It's a few years down the road now and I feel really good and grateful to myself for quitting. I am also grateful to this community. Although I didn't post here before, reading your stories over the years has inspired me to keep going when things were difficult. For instance, the cravings never really left me, they only vary in intensity. I have to be vigilant because sometimes they can just sneak up on you, e.g., when I'm tired or stressed, or when I come across a trigger like my old desk, or a friends' off-hand comment on what he is currently playing.   
When I was about one and a half years into this journey, I promised myself that I would make an experiment with moderation after two years. It would be so great to be able to enjoy a game for what it is and then move on to other stuff right? 

  
So upon hitting the 2 year mark I somewhat nervously played some Pokémon Fire-Red, which is a comparatively casual game. In total I spent about 3 hours playing over the course of one day. Unfortunately, I found myself kind of rushing it, thinking all day about various team compositions, what I would do next etc. Hence, I stopped enjoying the present moment of other activities since my mind just kept going back to the game. Personal growth, career, my dreams of traveling, building a great social life etc. all kind of faded into the background. This was super scary to me, and so I decided that moderation is now for me. Therefore, I consider my experiment successful because it reinforced my determination. I know that if I would game I could still fulfill my obligations. Even at the height of my WoW addiction, I seldom exceeded 4 hours of daily playtime. However, I would not be able to live a fulfilling life because most of my energy and focus would go into the computer.

  
I hope that my story may be helpful or even motivational to some of you guys. For all of you struggling right now, there is a way out. Life can be awesome if we allow ourselves to make it happen.

I have a friend/coworker who is trying to become an actuary. She has passed 4 exams and is currently studying for the 5th exam.  She's a really smart, straight forward, and kind individual who has the ability to become an excellent actuary. 

She wants to pass test 5 before she starts applying. However, I feel like she should be working in the field with other actuaries so, she has like minded people to help with studies and carrier progression. (Please correct me if this train of thought is wrong)

Her passion would be to work in the insurance industry. She lights up when she considers the prospect of help creating insurance plans. She feels that her many years working in the dental field will prevent her from getting a job. 

What I am requesting is help getting her started. I start grad school in Aug and we will no longer be coworkers. I'd like to give her this gift before I leave. If you guys have any following please send them my way so I can forward it to her:

- a contact 
- entry level job opportunities
- internships
- any job hook ups
- motivational advice
- words of encouragement
- career advice
- testing advice (test 5 and beyond)
- insurance jobs tips and tricks
- cool work experience stories
- actuary jokes
- survival guide
- career advancement advice
- best insurance companies to work for
- best entry jobs to apply for
- interview tips and tricks
- resume review service
- anything else I might have missed


We are located in Illinois but she has expressed that she would be willing to move. She has no clue I'm doing this. I'm not looking for a hand out but something to help kick start her career.  ANYTHING HELPS.


Thank you.

I have been struggling with alcoholism for a few years at this point, and the beginning of the year I was doing ok, but I had a summer internship this summer and I spent the vast majority of it drinking daily, smoking weed almost daily (which I hadn't really done since I was 14). I am married and my wife hates it when I drink, because eventually I do something like drive home from the bar. But i have been away from her for the past 3 months, and figured..let's have a summer. 

But that life doesn't work for me. I get depressed, start feeling like I'm losing my mind. I tell myself I won't drink today and then on my way home I stop at the bar. 

Externally, I haven't lost much. But I have no doubt that I will. Internally...I'm a mess. I feel scared all the time, I question my worth as a person, I feel inadequate, feel like my moral compass has been progressing in the wrong direction. I never connected all of that to alcohol, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense. If I'm beating the shit out if myself everyday, why wouldn't I also think that I am shit? 

Also, we are having a baby. Our first. I have had nightmares of being drunk and passing out without taking care of a newborn. I can't be that person, and I am almost certain that I would be if I don't stop drinking. 

Ultimately, I'm going home next weekend to my wife and dog and decided now is the time to sober up and make the commitment to introduce myself here after lurking for the past year.

Thanks for listening. IWNDWYT"

I made this account solely to make a huge, long rant, and maybe make more in the future, but I hope I won't ever feel like doing it again. So to those of you who sit through it and are willing to talk to me, thanks. I really, really, REALLY appreciate it, because I know it's gonna look like a damn novel in the end. (Fuck, it does.)

So... this entire year has been nothing but a curse to me. But it's a domino effect of last year. My then-partner (about 2 years into our relationship by that point) had traveled across the country for an internship. They’re the travel type, their dream job requires going out of their way to do some amazing things, something I guess I'm a little bit jealous of because I've lost my passion to do that sort of thing. Of course, this hurt to deal with, but it wasn't a problem, because I loved them and wanted them to be happy. What made it most painful though, was that 1. They told me there was ""no one"" to go back to when they finished with their internship, because they liked all their friends over there better, 2. This meant that after college they would continue this, and me, having no means to move about with them, and no place to be intimate, anything to get about to see them, would be left behind. I really wanted to talk to them about this, but they wouldn't let me. I clearly remember a time where I said I was sad about it, and they texted me ""then think about something else"". I should have known right there that there was nothing I could do to fix it. If only I had a means of living without my family, it wouldn't be an issue. Things got cut for good when I angrily brought it up in November.

Then they finally admitted they weren’t going to do anything about it, and would rather drop me. It made sense to me, but it hurt a lot. They had dragged it on because they “didn’t want to lose their best friend”. Too late. We barely talk anymore. Everyone is always moving about, and I'm basically plastered into place here because I have to rely on my family for some more years. Otherwise, I would have moved around with them in a heartbeat.

In the middle of all that... I was working on finishing up my last 2 credits (literally 2) for college. I took a shitty winter class and in the end of January, I was done with college. I spent a week off. I felt OK, because my parents were out of the country.

Speaking of parents, I should give some context on them, and why it feels so much better when they are far, far away from me.

When I was a kid, my parents did *everything* they could for me. EVERYTHING. My dad took up every job he could. He was a taxi driver. He worked at a China plate factory or something... A bartender. Everything. E-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. Even through all that, his family back in our home country (he was a first gen immigrant along with my mom) would swindle him for money (and they still do), even when my first sibling was born, and he was jumping through hoops trying to please ALL his families. My mom didn't have it any easier either. But through all of this, me and my siblings were abused a lot. I want to say I can't blame them because they were doing so much, but I don't know. It feels terrible and ungrateful. But it traumatized me. When I see distressed kids I cry for them. When I see kids having the time of their lives, bonding with their parents, I get unreasonably happy for them, to the point that I start crying. I only have negative memories of my childhood, of being hurt, yelled at. I remember we once planned a sort of get-together, but we never actually went through with it. I remember it was supposed to be on a Thursday and I was looking forward to it. But when the time came, it was like we had forgotten all about it. I still remember it, like it's still gonna happen. Instead I dealt with being hurt for crying, being frustrated, etc, to the point where I did those things less and less - not because I had learned better ways to express my feelings, but because I was scared to show emotions. And as an adult, that's what I'm doing right now. We didn't get to ""bond"" - which lead to a house full of bottled-up kids with no outlets.

As a result, a few years ago, I don't even fucking remember - one of my siblings ran away. I didn't give two shits. I didn't like them. They treated me like trash. My parents were devastated, especially my dad, who later gathered the rest of us in a room and asked us if he abused us. A dumb question really, but it's not like I was going to answer it seriously.

I think that gives you an idea of what my parents were like. Well, at least my dad... Before this year. So... let's get back to why this year sucks for me.

This year... Some months ago, I was caught in the middle of a very bad episode at work. My coworker ratted me out I guess. I just wasn't speaking all day, I had tears being held back in my eyes basically all the time. My dad pulled me out of work and basically BEGGED me to tell him what was wrong. Of course, after all this nonsense, I wasn't going to tell him anything. We drove around for a solid hour or so where he said ""please"" upwards of 70 times and I swore I wasn't going to tell him anything. I had already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in freshman year of high school after I was \*forced\* to see a therapist because my roommates had reported me - and as a result I had to tell my parents, who didn't even believe me, or do anything to help at home. I eventually gave in because I was tired of hearing him beg me, even though I knew it wouldn't mean anything in the end. He went on to say he ""remembers me saying something similar"" but figured I just grew the fuck out of it I guess. I told him I couldn't trust him after all those years of abuse. He apologized for everything. He said he was done being abusive.

This was supposed to be liberating but it wasn't. I still don't trust him. He still has little outbursts, then comes back, and instead of apologizing, coddles me. It doesn't feel good.

Half the time they're home, I lock myself up in my room, sit around, cry, and play video games with online friends. At least \*they're\* supportive, but I wish I had more friends in the area. It's sad. I can't drive yet, but when I can (I'll have my license in the next month or so, I can at least do that right), I'm going to try to really get myself out there.

One of the few things that would have made me happy, was getting back into the dating scene. So I did. I didn't really get to do the whole ""dating"" thing before. My last partner and I were friends for so long that we just knew. No courting or whatever involved. I can't get out much, but I have a great bff who was willing to do fucking anything for me, including helping me get ready for dates and all. I got on a few dating apps, and as a result I've met two people, both started off promising but have just ended up feeling shittier than they should have.

I should be happy, but I have this very awkward luck. I met the nicest people. One was meant to be more casual and fun, not romantic at all - we met \*once\* and said person just... stopped. I just suddenly wasn't worth their time anymore. We had picked a second date a month in advance, and then I traveled overseas. I was so excited to come back to the states and see them again. But a few days before they revoked it for some other business - I'm not gonna ask them, but it didn't seem like anything time-sensitive at all. It just seemed like a way to get out of it. We haven't met since then. I flushed them out for a few days because the whole thing just made me upset. Eventually they came back to check on me. I was surprised they cared that much honestly. I reconciled. Later, they started to complain that I was pushing them aside because I had offered to play games with them but never followed up (the only game we had in common that is enjoyable is now unpopular amongst my friends so we... don't really have any more games to play. that + my ADD is weird and makes it hard to remember things out of my routine.) I was a little conflicted because I wasn't even good enough to be casual with this person.. which would have been ok, but they had also insinuated that they used me for some sort of validation while they actually had 0 interest in me - and when confronted about it they changed the subject with ""what were we talking about?"" (I'm not shitting you. they literally did this. over text. like, you can just go back and read it. wtf.)

The ordeal with the second person was a thing that ended literally this weekend. We had met online and talked in-app and then over text for a few weeks. I eventually invited them to talk to some of my gamer buddies because they would sit around on my twitch streams and say the cutest, most adorable things to me, and said they wanted to join me and my friends. They would joke about how much they loved my voice and my personality and that they wanted to go on a date already so we could make things official. I really gave into it and liked them quite a bit too. A week ago, I was having the time of my life because I was so happy that I got asked on a date. I was so nervous, but it felt so worth it. We ended up having it a bit early but more as a meetup (with aforementioned bff).

It went fine if you ask me - of course there were awkward rambles here and there but they were chill in person, I was still making up my mind but... all in all, it didn't change my mind much. We were supposed to have a second date this past weekend, but my family was up to some shit, so we had to reschedule and eventually cancel... They said it was OK and we could do it any other time. And suddenly, I started getting much different vibes. I just kind of knew they didn't like me anymore. I don't know why. I always get very strangely accurate gut feelings. I talked to a friend about it the morning of our would-be date, they told me it was just me. I wanted to believe them, but I knew I was right. I always seem to know when shitty things are going to happen.

Some hours later, that afternoon, I got \*the\* text. Of course I was right. They told me that they couldn't get the romantic feeling for it, which is so weird because that's all I was getting for weeks. I don't know what happened in those last few days to make them suddenly have no interest in me... I can't be mad, but I just don't understand. Maybe they were just communicating their love in the wrong way? But what about making it “official”? I don’t get it…

It always seems to happen this way. I have a thing going with someone and I like them a lot, then suddenly they turn around and aren't interested. This has happened twice before without me being notified, and before the person who was flirting and messing around with me would do it literally until a day or two before in which they would suddenly turn cold, and reveal - indirectly, like I'd find it while scrolling around on facebook or something - that they were seriously into someone else. And dating them. At least, one of them got proven to be a shitty person later, so I don't miss them. The other is still my friend today, and has since apologized... But it still feels bad to think about. Just, being a second-pick or something. I don't know.

It leads me to think that I must just be doing something terribly wrong. It's like when people talk about ""crazy girlfriends"" or whatever, it's usually more like ""crazy partner trying to control their girlfriend"". But I don't know what. I don’t try to control my friends... Or my partners. But it just feels like. I'm never important enough to anyone for anything. Not my family, not my friends, not my partners. Etc. Even though I know this isn't always true... my friends have done everything they could. There is no more helping me. I'm completely helpless.

Next weekend is going to suck too, every weekend sucks because my parents always invite really annoying visitors that stay all weekend and don't clean up after themselves. Lately I refuse to help them and just lock myself in my room or go out. It's been all month that we've had weekend visitors that stay the entire time, so I don't feel like I can rest. Usually they don't tell anyone in advance, but at least this time they did so I can fucking leave or something.

I make enough to move out now, but I don't think I should yet. I should save for some more years and get myself out there more. I just don't see the latter happening because I'm so fucking depressed all the time. But whatever.

My birthday is quite soon. I'm in my early 20s but I still feel awful for being single and struggling... and not being able to do much because my degree is useless, but it's all I'm passionate about, besides playing video games. That just makes my birthday feel worse every year. Tough luck I guess."
919czf,3,2018-07-23,Thinking about getting into CAD,EmpIStudios,cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/919czf/thinking_about_getting_into_cad/,"Hello, so I live in the US in the northeast, just to be clear, and I am thinking about getting into Computer Assisted Drafting and Design. I am not a total novice with digital design software, having used programs like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya in the past. I am looking at a trade school I could apply for to help get me educated, but before I commit to spending tens of thousands of dollars on schooling I wanted to be sure this is the right place for me.

How does the future look for the profession? What is the risk of outsourcing, or being made obsolete by future technology and automation? Is the opposite true, and the rise of 3D-printing going to make CAD drafters even more in demand?

What does the day-to-day of your job entail? What tasks do you find yourself being required to do, most frequently?

What got you into this line of work?

Is this a job you enjoy working at, and if so what kind of personality enjoys this kind of work?

How would I know what speciality I should be going into, whether it be architecture or manufacturing design?

How competitive is the field? If I did complete the education do I have a good chance of finding a job, or some form of apprenticeship? What techniques would you recommend for approaching getting a job?

Are firms willing to take internships from people looking to get into the profession but with little to no experience? If so, how would I find them?

If you had anything else you'd like to add, i'd be happy to hear it."

I'm a white 19 year old male and I'm looking for any women of color who are into slave and/or race play. I prefer to be the dominant in the situation and am looking for partners who think they'd enjoy being subservient and submissive to white men.

There are a number of options for how this could play out and I prefer to discuss story ideas in PM before settling on a scene. I'm a strong writer and usually write about a paragraph or two per post and expect the same. I'm open to ALL women of color for this, so please don't hesitate to drop me a note and see if we'd a good fit.

Kinks: Face-fucking, name-callng, puppy play, leash and collor, cum play, oral, anal, strong dialogue.

(None of these are a must).

I'm open to a number of different pairings but one idea as a starting point for a discussion would be that you play a character who's recently won a scholarship for a prestigious college. It's a full ride but requires a summer internship at my personal mansion over the summer. That would set the scene for us and we can discuss more in detail what personalities work best for each of us and see how a scene could stretch out. I most enjoy a good, healthy pace that keeps the story moving.

91bjew,55,2018-07-23,FOUND! Kid goat lost across the highway and in the forest,enlitenme,goats,https://www.reddit.com/r/goats/comments/91bjew/found_kid_goat_lost_across_the_highway_and_in_the/,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/goats/comments/912jxb/i_lost_a_baby_goat_in_the_woods/

Honestly guys, on my drive home from work today I was shaking with anxiety. How far could she have gone since the 5:30 a.m. sighting? Was I going to see a dead kid on the road? (Oh, I looked.)

The idea of the poor girl in a strange place, with predators, another storm coming overnight, missing her mamma and all the way across a highway from her was gut-wrenching.

Came home and the intern had momma at the side of the road. They'd seen kiddo run across the road 3 hours ago (how long had they been out!?!) Momma was crying.

I ran to get changed, grabbed a speaker and sounds of a doe calling on youtube (in case momma was tired) and as I crossed the road I heard them make contact.

Ohmigosh. 

Creep closer. 

Oh gosh.

And found! Momma was thrilled, baby was hungry, and all was well. Carried baby home with mom blaating the whole way.

I can't get imgur to work on the phone or you could have a pic, but then you'd see that I bought really skinny goats whose hooves need a good trimming.

I can sleep tonight without feeling wicked."

I decided to come back and finally try and finish the fluff I started way back when. You can see my old post here!


***TL;DR*** I was inspired by the stories about the various monastic communities in the Sengoku Jidai to try and make a marine chapter based around large monastic groupings. Since Marines already have a large fortress monastery, I wanted to make a chapter that would have several monastic complexes scattered around the sector they're stationed in. I was also intrigued by how well Salamander beliefs and training gelled with the Iron Hands despite the two chapters history of animosity and wanted to create a chapter that fused some of those beliefs. Most of the ideas for the chapter relied on the 1d4chan generator and me working backwards to fill in the lore to make it gel.

**Chapter Name**: Steel Drakes (Formerly the Steel Redeemers).
 
 
 
**Motto/Warcry** Current: (Mind and machine unite!). Former: (Purge the Flesh!)
 
**Founding:** Seventh
 
**Successors of:** Iron Hands
 
**Primarch:** Ferrus Manus


History of the Chapter: 
 
**History:**

 
&amp;nbsp;

The Steel Drakes were founded as the Steel Redeemers in M34 during the Seventh Founding. Created based on the mysterious and dire predictions of the Emperor's Tarot, the Redeemers along with the other chapters created during the seventh founding were made to counter these unseen and distant threats facing the Imperium. Using the genetic stock of the Iron Hands to create the Redeemers, Mechanicus genetors were shocked to find a flaw in the first generations of marines, the Catalepsean Node had changed from its baseline, not enough to render the stock irredeemable, but in the eyes of the Iron Hands, inferior to their own baseline genetics. Because of the node's changes, the Redeemers could go long periods of time without sleep, but at random times would fall into deep comas lasting hours, days, weeks or even years, creating a deadly weakness for the warriors on the field. Disgusted by this, the Iron Hands opted to send only a handful of newly trained marines to help lead and bring up the new chapter, many of them initiates who'd failed to impress their leaders, or marines who'd fallen out of favor with the chapter master. Wishing to live up to their progenitor chapter, the new group of marines took the name Steel Redeemers, to reflect their wish to live up to the ideals of the Primarch and Founders. In turn they also embraced a fanatical devotion to replacing their limbs with bionics as part of their initiation ritual. This was partially in an attempt to emulate the practices of their forebears , and also so that their Iron Fathers could use remote interfaces to move incapacitated marines from the field using their bionics.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


During an intense period of warfare in their sector when it was cut off by a warpstorm, the chapter was almost destroyed when a traitorous warband known as the Corsairs of Damnation arrived above the chapters homeworld of Kenshiro in a space hulk packed with warships. Using an Eldar device to disable the bionic implants of the marines, the Corsair's initial attack left the Redeemers unable to move or fight save for a hundred and fifty initiates and fighters who had either not yet completed the initiation process and replaced all four of their limbs or were already held up in the fortress monastery's Apothecary healing from earlier skirmishes. The rest of the chapter was slaughtered, laying helpless in their fortifications or on the field, unable to move their now useless limbs, which also failed to respond to commands from any surviving Iron Fathers. Desperate, the survivors sent out a call to aid to any nearby Imperial Forces, who unbeknownst to the Redeemers, were also locked in a fight with the Corsairs, which had splintered (to the consternation of their Chaos Lord) and were moving in several long tendrils throughout the area, spreading destruction and havoc in their wake. Help would come from the most unlikely of sources.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Months earlier, Forgefather Vulkan Bra'kall and a small contingent of Salamander warriors had passed by the Redeemers monastery on their quest to locate one of their primarchs lost artifacts. Inheriting their progenitors disdain for the children of Vulkan, the Redeemer's chapter master had been cold, rebuffing the forgefather's offer to meet and instead gave them a pathetic offering of supplies to send them on their way. Yet in the Redeemers darkest hour, Bra'kall and his warriors were the first to answer the call. Emerging above Kenshiro on the strike cruiser Hammerforge, Bra'kall and his ship smashed through a pair of Chaos frigates before launching to the world below to assist in relieving the siege of the monastery. Carving through the ranks of traitors hounding the gate the Redeemers mountain fortress, Bra'kall and the Salamanders managed to break the hold of Chaos around the fortress after three days of intense fighting, yet the Salamander's librarian had intercepted the frantic messages of the forces of Chaos, the invasion fleets had been beaten back at multiple points around the sectors, the scattered forces were retreating, yet planned to rendezvous above Kenshiro, and eliminate the marines, before fully retreating.  Wasting little time, Brak'all ordered one last load of supplies from his cruiser before sending it to meet with Imperial forces, and set about the task of preparing for the next siege. For week, he and his Salamanders would work tirelessly to help due surviving Redeemers, repairing fortifications, crafting more weapons and ammunition and tending to the injured, never taunting them or holding their mistreatment of the group over them. As the Chaos fleet gathered above, he would rally the survivors with a famous speech, now carved into the walls of the Kenshio Monastery:


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


    
&gt; ""The clouds of darkness gather above, ready to snuff the light of the Emperor mightiest. Brothers, today we are all one, not Salamander or Redeemers, not a son of Ferrus Manus or Vulkan, but instead all devoted sons of the Emperor. Should this be my grave I could not ask for a finer group to be by my side at the end. Let not our flaws or petty disputes be what defines us, but instead our deeds and our devotion to our brothers on the field. Let us make the traitors bleed for every step they take, let us make them pay onehundredfold for every brother they have taken from us with their foul war. Let them know the true might of the Emperor and his champions, that even battered, on the ground, thought broken, we can still rise higher than them and their twisted masters!""


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



For half a year the Redeemers and the Salamanders held, the Chaos fleet's  orbital bombardment was unable to break through the monastery's defenses, instead only serving to further devastate what was left of Kenshiro. Multiple times the fleet would disgorge and assortment of foul warriors and warp spawn, only to have them beaten back by the monastery defenders. The warpstorm that gathered around the planet being the only thing to hold back the tide of Imperial reinforcements. Yet even that couldn't stop one captain. Seven  times, the rogue trader Marquez ibn Von Helvick used a modified fast freighter outfitted with his family's ancestral warp sextant to navigate the storms and break through the blockade to deliver vitally needed supplies to the space marines, form ammunition and weapons, to vehicles and even a chance of murder servitors. Each times, he broke the blockade, Von Helvick was able to chart more of the storms and eventually discovered a safe channel through the tumult. From this small gap the Imperial fleet, lead by the Hammerforge, was able to enter Kenshio orbit and do battle with the Chaos fleet. For three days the sky filled with fireballs and rains of adamantium and steel as ships slammed into one another and plummeted to their doom in the gravity well below. On the fourth day, the chaos warband broke and fled back to the recesses of space. The siege was finally over.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


In the aftermath, the situation was grim for the Redeemers. Being reduced to so few in number and with their senior-most marines slain, extinction looked to be a real possibility, not helped by the Iron Hand's refusal to send aid or or new marines to bolster the chapter until it could rebuild. In this dark hour it was once again the Salamanders who gave aid. Vulkan Bra'kall ordered a grand shipment of supplies from Nocturne and several members of his expedition, including a chaplain, offered to remain with the Redeemers to help them train and rebuild. Though it would be a process that could take centuries, these Salamanders were unwilling to leave fellow battlebrothers to face such an ignominious end. After this display of comradely, the Redeemers survivors declared that in the face of their progenitors abandonment of their chapter, and with the Salamanders help in rebuilding, their chapter was no longer in need of ""redemption"" in the eyes of their progenitors, instead they were newly forged in battle and tempered by the great drakes of Nocturne. From this they formally changed their names to the Steel Drakes and began to rebuild.



By the 41st millennium the chapter had rebuilt its strength, and thanks to several forge worlds nearby and the Salamander predilection of forging equipment, the chapter is very well armed and equipped.[/spoiler]
 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

 
**Allegiance and Homeworld:**


The home world of the Steel Drakes is the feral world of Kenshiro. A formerly prosperous hive world, the civilization of Kenshiro was destroyed in a vicious war which devastated the planet. A radioactive wasteland of ruined hives and mutated dangerous creatures, survival is a daily battle. From this desperate scavenging people the Steel Drakes recruit the toughest survivors as initiates in their order. Annually the tribes will send several of their children on a planetary pilgrimage to the distant mountaintop fortress monastery of the chapter. Crossing radioactive deserts, frozen plains, rotted out hive spires inhabited by the mutated animals and former inhabitants from thousands of years ago, many pilgrims perish on the journey. The survivors must climb the one hundred thousand steps up the tallest mountain to reach the gates of the fortress and then must survive a fortnight outside the frozen gates before being allowed admission. In addition, smaller monasteries scattered across the sector receive children from families who wish to see their progeny admitted to the ranks of the Emperor's finest. The strongest of those children are placed in stasis pods and sent to Kenshiro once a decade to survive and make the pilgrimage across the planet. By necessity, due the multitudes of crashed Chaos wrecks and weakened points in the fabric of reality from the siege and warpstorm, the Inquisition maintains a small but formal presence on the world.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**Chapter Beliefs:** 


Being descended from the Iron Hands, the beliefs of the Steel Drakes follow many of the beliefs of their founders, in particular the reverence for the strength of steel over flesh. However, after the near destruction of their chapter via the disabling of their bionics and their rescue by as Salamander descended chapter, the Steel Drakes adopted many tenants of the Promethean Cult, in particular the ideas of self-reliance, meditation to overcome mental foibles and the practice of forging equipment.  Marines pursue ascetic lifestyles, evermore than the average chapter, a hold over trait from the Iron Hands and their disdain for the flesh. The anger that tends to be inherent in Iron Hands and their descendants is present in the Drakes, but they seek to temper their emotions with meditation and forging. In battle, the stubbornness common in both Iron Hands and Salamanders is seen as marines will doggedly hold positions under relentless assault, or will march with cold mechanical efficiency to complete their objectives. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 

**Organization:**
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


The Steel Drakes are a loyalist chapter, though like their progenitor are strongly codex divergent with an intense adherence to the the strength of steel over flesh, though their interpretation of such doctrine has its self diverged from their progenitors. Like the Iron Hands, they are not ruled by a chapter master, but rather a council of clans, though unlike the Iron Hands, they maintain only five clans as opposed to ten, due to consolidation measures taken to help offset random incapacitation's due to their Catalepsean Nodes. In practice this leads to each clan fielding two companies, one to act as an active company for deployments and patrols within the Itano sector and one to act as a reserve standing guard at their fortress, maintaining the perimeter and training neophytes. The active company is typically comprised of a cadre of veteran warriors overseeing the younger members of the clan, while the reserve company typically holds a higher number of more experienced marines. Thanks to close ties with the Mechanicus and the Von Helvick family, the Drakes are able to enjoy the use of smaller transportation spacecraft to ferry members and supplies around the sector to responded the needs of the active company.
 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


The overriding focus for the Steel Drakes is a need for redundancy thanks to their gene seed flaw. Each clan has roughly two hundred marines one hundred in the active company and one hundred in the reserve. New initiates to the clans are used as scouts and after being fully trained are assigned to assault marine roles. Given the Catalepsean Node deficiency in the Drakes, the assault squads faces the greatest risk if they become incapacitated. To mitigate risks, assault squads make heavy use of chain glaives as their main weapon, while utilizing a a ballistic mechadendrite to augment their combat capabilities. Its said that veteran members of the Kenshiro Monastery, which tend to comprise the seniormost marines have the ability to utilize two mechadendrite in battle as assault troops. In addition, as a departure from the Codex Asartes, assault company soldiers typically comprise of the seniormost members of a clan who have the most training to not only fill holes created by the incapacitation of one of their own, but to also protect any brother who might be claimed by the sleep in the heat of battle.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Tactical squads are follow a traditional ten man formation who have a mix of small and heavy weaponry. Utility mechadendrite's are used to haul heavier pieces of war equipment and to  to allow each marine to help conduct field repairs on equipment. Heavy weapons typically reserved for use in devastator squads are instead split between the tactical companies and the scout neophytes, with the scouts taking responsibility for longer ranged equipment such as las cannons and missiles launchers while the tactical companies will carry the heavy bolters, melta weapons and other closer and medium ranged weapons. These heavy weapon wielding members of the tactical squads will typically be the newer battle brothers, fleshly minted from the scouts. While the Drakes try to pursue flexibility, it is an acknowledged irony that the foregoing of the traditional Devastator squad created a strategic inflexibility in the Chapter. However, by maximizing their numbers of tactical marines, the Dragons are able to field a higher number of more versatile units who can in turn punch above their weight. In addition, by dispersing heavier equipment among the companies, it allows for fewer points of failure should a marine fall to the deep sleep, especially since it typically falls to the less experienced marines to carry to the heavy weapons, so should he fall, his more experienced brothers can fill his place.
 
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Leading each clan is lead a pair of Iron Captains, one to lead the active company and one to lead the reserve. Steel Drake custom dictates the reserve company captain typically be the elder of the two leaders who receives more deference as his actions are the ones responsible for the long term custodianship of comatose marines, as well as the training of the clans neophytes and equipment maintenance. It is from the reserve company that marines will be pulled from squads to replace holes in the active company created by casualties and from marines who succumb to the slumber.
While overall this structure gives the Drakes a high degree of redundancy and tactical flexibility, it has come with significant drawbacks. The Drakes field few specialized units such as land speeder squadrons or bike squads, partially due to an unwillingness to dedicate too many units in the active and reserve companies to such roles and also out of a concern that should the Deep Sleep overtake a vehicles pilot, the machine spirit of the vehicle or his fellow brothers might not be able to stop the fast moving vehicle in enough time to prevent disaster. In addition, the company lost most of their dreadnought frames in the Siege of Kenshiro and the marines interred in the few remaining units are still vulnerable to the Deep Sleep, resulting in rare deployments of their dreadnoughts. The chapter is well supplied with Rhinos and their variant patterns though thanks to their friendly relations with the nearby forgeworlds. This has allowed the company to focus on their niche as effective defensive units and shock attack infantry.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

 
**Training:**



Training and advancement is an esoteric mix of training, forging and mysticism. After an applicant is screened and admitted he spends a year training with the marines and other trainees in the monastery after the great Kenshiro pilgrimage. After the year has passed he is placed in a great workshop and order to create some kind of tool to demonstrate his abilities. These have ranged for knives, swords, crude guns to metal statues and carts. The object is then judged by a conclave of marines in the monastery. If it is accepted, the applicant is then implanted with the first phase of implants and sent to one of the five clans for further training. The neophyte will spend the next ten years receiving training and input from the five clans. At the end of the tenth year, the initiate is returned to Kenshiro where he must forge his first Mechadendrite. Often a small utility arm with several tools, this first bionic will serve the marine well as he learns the nuances of equipment maintenance and artificing. After his Mechadendrite is deemed sufficient, the neophyte attends a selecting, where representatives from the five clans will select the neophytes who'll join their clan for the remainders of their lives. After the near destruction of their chapter, the Steel Drakes have forgone the elective amputation of limb for bionics, instead preferring to utilize mechadendrites. However, many still opt to replace one of their eyes with a bionic replacement, both as a homage to their past progenitors in the Iron Hands and as a way to further demonstrate the synthesis of machine and man.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

 
After their time in the scout squad is complete, the marine must once again forge another Mechadendrite to add to their first. Demanding higher quality than before, only once the second attachment is completed is the marine allowed to join the clan tactical squad. This second Mechadendrite is usually some kind of servo arm, capable of hauling a heavy bolter or large missile launcher or las cannons. Some however opt to further refine their utility mechadendrite, adding additional tools and functions to better help augment their squad. In the tactical squad, the new marine will spend several years carrying heavy war gear for the squad to use in a quasi-devastator role, but often will fight with a  normal bolters as well. After years in this role, the marine will forge one more Mechadendrite, either a newer utility arm or a ballistic arm depending on their assignment. It is only after the third Mechadendrite is forged that the marine is considered a full-fledged brother in the clan.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


 
Further advancement in the clan is dependent on further rituals and training in the squad. While each marine is fully capable of maintaining and manufacturing the equipment needed for the squad, techmarine training allows for more advance fabrication and creation to occur. Marines selected for such training are allowed to embark on the Red Pilgrimage, a centennial journey where one hundred marines from the clans will board a strike cruiser and go to Mars for additional training. After their training on Mars, the marines will spend several decades on crusade before returning home. From these veterans, each clans techmarines are drawn from. In addition, these marines will have forged an additional Mechadendrite suited for their roles, often using both a utility and a combat mechadendrite. From the one hundred who embark on the journey, a few will be selected to work among the genetors of Mars, refining their knowledge and skills to work as apothecaries among the Steel Dragons. The primary tasks of the apothecary apart from caring for the wounded are to also monitor the Steel Dragons entombed in the medical wards of their monasteries in instances of the Deep Sleep taking hold for the long term. Their training among the genetors is also crucial to help monitor their own gene seed to ensure no furthers flaws develop within the new generation of marines.  

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;




Like the Iron Hands, the Steel Drakes also forego the use of chaplains and instead make use of Iron Fathers for their technical works and ministrations. To become an Iron Father, the marine must have already completed the Red Pilgrimage. Receiving permission from his clan, the marine will forge a fifth Mechadendrite, unrivaled by any of the four he's already made and then embark on a decades long journey. First the aspirant will make a pilgrimage to Nocturne to meet the Salamanders and learn finer nuances of the Promethean Cult. From there he will meditate on the cult's teachings while applying all he known of the machine cult and of the beliefs of Ferrus Manus. From Nocturne the marine must journey through the Imperium, surviving conflict and strife along the way. With the flaws in their Catalepsean Nodes, this journey is incredibly perilous for the solitary marine. Often these itinerant wanderers will join Inquisitorial bands and assist in rooting out heresy and other threats to the Imperium. Such skills prove useful if the marine survives and returns to his clan, not only has the marine learned more of the deeper mysteries of the Promethean Cult and the Iron Hand's own native beliefs, they'll also have the skills necessary to sniff out heresy within and outside the chapter should it appear.


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



The most important duty for the Iron Fathers however, is the ministration of Marines who've fallen to the Deep Sleep. Often should a marine be overcome, often it will be the Iron Father with his servo arm who will pluck the unfortunate brother from the field and bring him to relative safety. Unless he is one of the lucky ones who awaken minutes or hours from his slumber, following the battle the Father will intern the marine in a specialized life support pod and perform the proper ministration to his brother in the hopes of bringing him back to his fellows. Once his task is complete, he will turn the pod over the clan apothecaries who will then place it within a fortified bunker in the clan's monastery. Here the Iron Father's of the reserve company will perform daily patrols of the chamber and administer rites and perform meditations over their slumbering brothers, and should one awake, will be the first to greet him and welcome him home. These bunkers are the most fortified positions in all five monasteries, should the walls of their fortress ever be breached, every Steel Dragon will lay down his life before he allows one of his slumbering brothers to be slain before they have the chance to rise and meet their proper end in battle against the Imperiums foes.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

 
**Allies:**




Unlike their progenitors, the Steel Drakes maintain a friendly relationship with the Salamanders, holding onto the memory of the sacrifices of Vulkan Bra'kall's band of warriors. With the presence of three advance forge worlds in their home sector of Itano, and their Iron Hands heritage, the chapter also maintains close ties with the Adeptus Mechanicus, the centennial journey to Mars is always welcomed fondly on the red planet and all three forge worlds of Sector Itano have several facilities ready for use by the marines if they need rapid supply replenishment. To maintain friendly relations, the marines will often send these forge worlds the earlier mechadendrites forged by the marines in their training. While small in number, the symbolic return of technology to the Mechanicus often pleases the magos of the worlds.  The chapter also maintains friendly relations with Von Helvik rogue trader family, as both enjoy close relationships with the Adeptus Mechanicus, and the chapter still honors Marquez ibn Von Helvick for the times he risked life and limb to run the Chaos blockade and lead the Imperial fleet to their liberation.




While initially rocky, over the millennium the Drakes and their world's Inquisitors have come to have a good formal working relationship, helped further by the assistance the chapters Iron Fathers have lent to inquisitorial bands across the galaxy while on their pilgrimages. In fact, while their gene seed's history and  their chapter's unorthodox beliefs and practices have made a few in the Inquisition leery of the Drakes, the marines are actually the unknowing beneficiaries of informal support from a number of Conclaves and cells, many of whom have had their one or more of them members assisted by an Iron Father at some point throughout the millennium.


 
**Enemies:**


Having spent thousands of years fighting the Orks of Blud Choppas Choppa, the Steel Drakes maintain a fierce determination to root out and destroy the greenskin menace that threatens their sector. However, the Steel Drakes maintain a special hatred for the Eldar of Craftworld Fari, for it was by their interference that he vile forces of Chaos were allowed to gain access to the artifact which nearly destroyed their chapter. In addition the Eldar mount periodic and violent raids across the sector. In particular though, the various heretical warbands which attack the sector too are hunted without mercy by the Drakes, who have pledged to find and eliminate every member of the Corsairs of Damnation who nearly destroyed their chapter thousands of years ago. The task is somewhat difficult as the warband fractured in two, with some of the force dedicating itself to Slaneesh and renaming themselves the Singers of the Ascension. Having stolen a battleship from the Corsairs, both groups are targeted by the Drakes, who seek to end all who hunted them so long ago.

I wanted to see if this looked alright, I wanted the chapter to be realistic for the established rules and lore of the 40k universe, but I don't want to accidentally make them a bunch of mary sues or going full weeb. I still have to flesh out more details from the history of the chapter such as their conflict with the orks and some of their figures form chapter legend, but I wanted to get the feel for the chapter down first. Thanks!"

I feel my low maintenance routine needs a step up to help suit my lifestyle.,silentkiller000,beauty,https://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/91csfk/need_hairmakeup_tips_i_feel_my_low_maintenance/,"Hi Reddit. [Here](https://imgur.com/gallery/rocJED9) is an album of my everyday looks. 

I have a pretty low maintenance beauty routine. I shower at night, moisturize and use lash serum. My hair is naturally very straight, if I brush it while wet it will dry very straight, whereas if I brush my fingers through it in the shower and let it dry or use mousse it stays wavy. My natural part is in the middle, though I have been trying to force a side part since puberty. It honestly just falls where it falls for the day. I wear my hair in a high pony or French braid most days; I work a retail job and out of my face is the best option. 

As for make up and skin, I do moisturize and try to take care of acne when it’s a problem, but I mostly just let nature take its course while cleansing and moisturizing daily. I try to keep my eyebrows tweezed, but there are likely many outgrown strays on my face as I type this. I had this irrational fear as a teen that if I let anyone touch my beautiful bushy eyebrows they would make them too thin, so I’ve never had them done. My eyebrow hair is very long and gets curly, so if I sleep on it wrong they will be sticking out in every direction. I also have very long lashes that took over my beauty routine in high school, spending hours getting them perfectly separated and lifted, but I found that I was doing nothing but damage to them and I have mostly stopped wearing make up altogether. I use a serum and oils from time to time to keep them hydrated. I also get patches of dry skin around my mouth and eyes periodically, which I usually just treat with exfoliating and moisturizer. 

I also have terrible vision and wear glasses almost 24/7, but I am hoping to soon be able to afford a contact lens exam because another huge reason I don’t wear mascara is because my lashes get squished by my eyeglass lenses. 

I am a student at a university in the states, and I hold various positions: student government Vice President, intern at the university’s student credit union, membership in professional business fraternity, etc. I attend meetings quite often with administration, and I would like to look more kept together. 

Some of my struggles with this include time; I am not one to wake up early at all, and to wake up earlier to look nicer is not one of my priorities, although I would like to put more effort into this. I also do not have a problem with wearing no make up or low effort; I like to embrace my natural look but i know it could use a polish. I also do not have much money to spend on expensive products/services, but there are some things I would make exceptions for. I usually do have my nails done, and I would consider getting my eyebrows done. 

I am looking for advice on a new haircut (color?), I would like to keep my length, if possible (my hair was down to my butt in HS and I cut it all off in college thinking it would help me look more professional, but I regretted it a lot). I’m not sure what haircuts would suit my face shape best/accentuate my features. I have also considered just getting my lashes lifted so that I don’t have to touch them or mess with an eyelash curler when I do wear make up. 

Any other skincare/make up suggestions? I’d love to find a routine that doesn’t take much time or skill, if at all possible! 

Thanks so much in advance, and if I am doing anything that is not suggested, please let me know!"

Since I started working in this place like a year ago, a girl that also works there would always come around and start a conversation with me.. I was never attracted to her, and I always tried to show her that in some polite way to avoid hurting her feelings because she was always nice to me. Let’s call this girl Betty.

Then, there is another girl at the office… lets call her Kelly…, Kelly and Betty are doing an internship here, both go and study in the same place, and are kind of good friends. Kelly in my opinion is more attractive than Betty. We get along well the three of us, but I try to keep my distance from Betty because it was pretty evident that she was really trying to get me to invite her out or something… Well.. like a two weeks ago I invited Kelly to a wedding as my partner, the wedding was this Saturday, we went to the wedding and everything was fine, we didn’t even dance or anything we just had dinner, and pretty much spent the rest of the night joking around and talking to each other or to my friends.

Now comes Monday(today)… BETTY unleashes HELL… She starts telling to everyone in the office that Kelly stole her boyfriend (ME?, SHIT SINCE WHEN?) She starts telling everyone that she Is a fucking slippery whore and that she wants to beat the fuck out of Kelly.. I start to freak the fuck out.. WTF is wrong with her?? BETTY also started to send texts to their mutual friends informing them that Kelly had just stole her boyfriend and that she was a dirty bitch, etc etc etc … Kelly showed me her Instagram, her facebook, and her twitter account.. It was full of awful posts like once every hour on each social media..

Now like 6 of Kelly’s friends won’t answer her because they think she did something pretty bad to Betty.. FUCK FUCK FUCK she was crying all afternoon on the office.. I don’t really want to date none of them.. but im in the middle of this shit… how can/should I fix this???

Any advice will be useful, thanks

Fuck me, I don’t know what do….

TLDR, MET TWO GIRLS AT WORK, I DONT WANT TO DATE NONE, INVITED ONE AS A FRIENDLY PARTNER TO A WEDDING, HELL BROKE LOOSE

91d3kk,10,2018-07-23,I am jealous of my brother who ran away from home.,gradschool16hope,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/91d3kk/i_am_jealous_of_my_brother_who_ran_away_from_home/,"My brother (22) ran away from home about two months ago to ""attend"" a programming internship in Nebraska and to live with his girlfriend. It was somewhat violent, with my parents trying to stop him, but he managed to escape and he got on a flight to Nebraska. My parents have done everything they can, but his girlfriend's parents won't tell her to kick my brother out and without that, they will probably remain together for the forseeable future. 

I wouldn't have done exactly what he did, like leaving his company without giving two weeks notice. He even called the local police and claimed that my family was harassing his girlfriend and her family when my parents tried to call them to convince my brother to return home. 

Still, I can't help but think that my brother is happy where he is because he is with his girlfriend. He is learning to be independent and live on his own, and I wish I could have that experience. Obviously, being with his girlfriend makes him happy, and just that makes me feel kind of jealous. 

Now, I can try to explain in detail why I ""think"" I am feeling jealous. I haven't had much success holding a job other than about 8 months at Target, and I am growing tired of living with my parents. I appreciate all they have done for my brother and I, but I don't even feel comfortable asking to attend networking events because I don't have a car. I just wish that I could make more decisions regarding my career path, dating, time management etc. 

My parents are planning to return to Japan in the future, and I really don't want to go back myself, but I need a stable job to live by myself in the US. I am studying as many skills to help me land a job, such as Spanish, accounting, Quickbooks, but I really have no idea what I want to do yet. 

I just needed to vent about how I have been feeling. I appreciate it if you read this post all the way to the bottom, and I hope that to hear any advice or comments. 

Tl; dr: My brother ran away to be with his girlfriend in Nebraska, and I am feeling jealous that he is learning programming, presumably interacting with others at his internship and is becoming more independent. "
91d76k,37,2018-07-23,"I’ve been playing dumb to my family, friends, and everyone. I am just realizing it now.",-saltymangos-,awakened,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/91d76k/ive_been_playing_dumb_to_my_family_friends_and/,"I just realized that I’ve been playing “dumb” my whole life. 

I say stupid shit. I sometimes act dumb. My former friends legitimately thought I was dumb because I acted in such a weird way.  I said stupid shit all the time to them to the point where they couldn’t take me seriously when I actually was being serious.  When I was being 100% serious they just pushed what I said aside. 

This has happened as long as I can remember. 

I dumbed by myself down to people—to society.  I feel like I have to dumb myself down to society so they don’t think I’m “dumb.”  I literally programmed myself to lower myself down to the “normal” person’s level of thinking.  

I WANT to be friends with people. I WANT to appear “normal” and not be that “he-thinks-he’s-better-than-everyone-else-because-he’s-“woke.””  I have a hard time meeting people that align with my ways of thinking, morals, etc. 

Example: I had college orientation last week. I met some cool people (2 of them are definitely the type to join frats and party).  I realized this within the first hour or two of being around them. The way they talk, their goals, their behavior.  It wasn’t ME.  

Now, I am somewhat proud of this (for a strange reason).  If “-saltymangos-“ from a year ago would have gone to this orientation, I wouldn’t have even talked to these people. I honestly wouldn’t have made friends or talked to people. That is because I’m growing and working on my confidence and finding myself.  

Back to the point: I just find it extremely difficult to be yourself in these situations. Yes, I was being myself at orientation for the most part. I could easily improve.  Honestly, I just want to attract people would are truly THEMSELVES or at least working on finding themselves like I am.  I want to attract positive people. People would have a passion for something. People would have a fucking drive for life. People who want to DO SOMETHING NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR OTHERS.  I want people in my life who are empathetic and care.  I want to have a connection with these people. 

I feel like my whole life I’ve had friends in my life that just aren’t “there” mentally. I really can’t blame them because it was high school, but whatever.  All my previous friends through 8th grade-senior year just didn’t care about me. That’s partly do to the fact that I was interjected in their friend groups. I was an add-on.  They all liked each other and knew each other years before I knew them.  I just want to have a group of people who have a passion and drive in life that’s bigger than them.  It’s hard to find that because people are shallow.  They are obsessed about other peoples’ lives and not their own.  I browse through Instagram comment and view tweets and their posting shallow/negative things to the point where I legitimately feel depressed.  

I play dumb because I want to people to be my friend. I play dumb/say dumb things because I’m afraid of saying something “profound” or “woke” and they will think weirdly of me. Yes, it’s so easy to think to yourself, “It doesn’t matter what people think of you!” You do you blah blah blah...” I have that mentality.  I wear a shirt that reads “Sushi Cat All Stars” with a bunch of cats in sushi and wear super short shorts.  I guarantee you people think I’m gay. I own a pair of custom made Vans with cats and a flame on the sole. People must think I’m out of my damn mind. But, I wear it because I really don’t give a fuck about what people think of me.  

It’s MUCH more difficult to SAY what people don’t understand because the common folk will listen to you say something they don’t agree with and call you dumb. 

WHY? 

Because MOST people cannot reflect on themselves.  You say something about “money doesn’t equal happiness” and some people will go ape shit on you. You say something about how you want to be an artist in THIS day and age and people will scoff and say “get a real job”.   People just follow the fucking flow. They can’t think for themselves. Don’t believe me? Go find an instagram page that posts tweets and you’ll see the dumb shit I’m talking about. 

Side note: I remember when I was 15 and I wanted lots of houses, exotic cars, watches, etc. I would customize cars on websites, look up houses on real estate websites and pick which ones I wanted. I’d spend hours looking at Rolexs and Omegas.  I don’t know want hit me but at 16 I didn’t want those materialistic things anymore. I didn’t have an urge to research the cars and watches. It’s almost like I grew out of it. I saw it as worthless and pointless.  

I’m tried of having to dumb myself to people so I appear “normal” when EVERY other aspect of me isn’t. I have weird clothes.  I want to a street artist. I want to do photography and sell my photos. I love graffiti. I’m white in a city that’s 80% Hispanic.  I feel an urge to do something in this world to make it better. I can’t just be friends with someone because they have one thing in common with me. I have to flow with them. They energy has to be the same as mine. They have to have similar morals and beliefs. They have to be genuine.  

I just want don’t want to go to college, get a degree, get an internship, get a real job, work, get promoted, and retire. I want to do something for ME that will benefit others. There’s no purpose in working for a company for 25 years only to retire and have 10-15 years until you can’t do a lot. I need a purpose. I don’t feel like working for a company for 25 years is a purpose. I need to be different. I need to be unique. I want to better this world. I feel like I’m different than other people.  I’ve known of so many people who just want to party in college and get drunk and hook up. So many people who want to sell their souls for money. So many people who just want to do a job because the salary is a lot. I just look at them with sad eyes because I hope they will realize that they won’t succeed if money is their only drive. 

 I turned 18 two months ago, but yet I feel like I understand more about the world than a 30 year old.  

I just want to truly be myself in a world that is against that idea.

I attend a pretty competitive school. So this means grades/ academic achievements are held in high esteem.

I used to do great in elementary and middle school, but now I find myself in an environment that isn't academically encouraging but rather quite cutthroat. This means you'll see kids flexing their internships on Instagram, scores on exams, whatever. I DONT GIVE A FUCK.

What's so annoying is that they tend to be passive aggressive about what they've accomplished. Like they'll play it off as nothing. 

Example-- ""I don't know, doing [research project] at [local uni] is cool and all, but it isn't really the highlight of my summer."" 

I'm ALL for a rigorous academic environment and doing your best in school but this shit is starting to get under my skin. Honestly this is why I hate social media- smart kids that aren't humble.

fffffucckkc I am such a mediocre student.

However, I don't hold a grudge against my class (a majority of them are great people outside of school) but there are a few perpetrators.

Screw those guys.

It’s good to know that there’s other people with this same struggle as well. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve simply felt stupid.

I’m a 24 year old female who was diagnosed with dyscalculia at age 12 by my psychiatrist and a school psychologist. I performed a series of tests, and while I scored extremely high in reading and writing skills and average in science,I was pretty deficient in math.  I struggled all through school in math and had to get extra tutoring just so I could keep up, and I really only managed to pull C’s with all my effort.  I tried so hard and felt like an idiot. 

I have my Bachelor’s degree in Early Childhood Education, but after a long job hunt with no real results offering a full time position (I had two low paid part time internships and one part time job after two years of searching), I decided to open my options. I’m still not sure if I want to go back for a Master’s but I needed a job. I was offered a job at a title insurance agency (real estate). They must have offered me the job for some reason obviously even though I let them know I struggle with math skills, but they assured me I could do it. Now I’m really wondering if I can. I really love my coworkers and the legal side of the job and it pays decently, but the math portion is plaguing me and giving me so much anxiety and I don’t know how to cope. We have to balance fees between all parties for a successful transaction. We are dealing with the biggest financial transaction in someone’s life, and I am so afraid of screwing it up. When someone asks me to quote their fees or balance their settlement statement so they know how much money to bring to closing, my stomach flips and I get so anxious. On top of that, I’m beating myself up because my coworkers usually have to take some of my workload because I’m so overwhelmed. I’m just so embarrassed and feel hopeless and starting to wonder if this was the right step for me. But dang it, I don’t want this job to get the best of me and I want to prove to myself I can do it.

Sorry for the rant, but does anyone have any good coping tips for how I can deal with on the spot math anxiety? I’m just so afraid of appearing stupid, but I need time to work things out and so many people want their questions answered right there. Does anyone have any mental exercises they use to help calm them down when confronted with on the spot financial questions? Thank you... "

Hey APP! So, by the title of this post, I'm guessing that you figured out that I want to play as a younger guy, we can discuss age in the description, that somehow ends up getting together for a secret sexual relationship with a celebrity.

I have a few ideas for this, and they all really depend on what sort of celebrity you play as (Singer, model, actress). However, they all generally include us spending a lot of time alone for whatever reason and this time allows us to build a good strong relationship without anyone else around.

1. I play as an intern at a recording/photography/movie studio that you are supposed to be working with.

2. I am your new assistant.

3. I am an interviewer who comes over to your house, and the interview begins to get pretty flirty and touchy before we end up fucking, making it a regular thing.

4. I am a new up and coming actor that won the chance to costar in a film with you and we decide to spend some time together and alone to get to know each other.

5. I am a lucky fan that got to spend a weekend with you at a resort.

6. I could be the son of a very important executive you are trying to get to sponsor your next project.

We can think of many more! Please message me with any celebs you are interested in playing! Also, [see my other prompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/7odzp0/m4f_calling_all_submissives_who_want_to_be_made/) if you'd like more ideas of what we could play.

My kinks are: Raceplay (Especially Asian women), worship (you worship my dick), cuckolding, oral, anal, impregnation, BDSM (light), Bondage (light), clothing, bimbos"

91fcih,1,2018-07-24,TRIP TO NGONG ROAD,Ubricoin,u_Ubricoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ubricoin/comments/91fcih/trip_to_ngong_road/,"Good morning people of Kenya, my name is Stanley Minda and I am doing an internship in the marketing sector of Soko Janja in the UBRICA company. On the 16th of July 2018, the marketing team and I visited Ngong road to see street sellers who sell their products on the road due to poverty which leads to an inability of getting proper premises to sell their equipment. We went there to pitch the idea of Soko Janja to them to help them market and sell their products with more ease. When we were there I saw the good, the bad, the ugly and the opportunities of recruiting these people and being a street vendor. In this article I will be explaining to you, the reader, what I saw and learnt.

The Good

The first thing I learnt and observed was that a lot of the workers were willing to listen to our pitch which, to be honest, I did not expect; the workers were very friendly and seemed intent on listening to our idea. They also knew each other and were willing to point us in the direction of other sellers who they thought may be willing to listen to us and use our online marketing platform.

Out of the 12 people we explained our idea to, 9 of them agreed to let us help them through Soko Janja. They also agreed to let us take photos and some even wanted to take the photo themselves to ensure their products are well represented in our online market. Another positive thing I saw was that there were a lot of original products which, if advertised to the right market, would be very quick to sell due to their originality and high quality. It would also help Soko Janja which is lacking variety attract more diverse customers and will help spread us spread its reach.

The Bad

Some of the street sellers were not willing to be filmed for our UBRICA channel as they thought we were journalists and would not be told otherwise. This is obviously bad for us because we want to tell the whole story of our journey and do not want to leave any stone unturned. A lot of the sellers’ businesses on the roadside had managers who were not there; the sellers who were there listened to us but told us we had to wait for their managers in order to seek permission from them to take pictures for and register them for Soko Janja. This process was very  tedious and wasted a lot of precious time as we were hoping to talk to as many sellers as possible. Some of the sellers were absent minded and didn’t seem interested in talking to us at first; if that is how they behave towards all their potential customers it may be a factor in why their products are not selling even though they are well made, original and of high quality. It was also difficult to find some of the sellers as they were sitting far away from their products and did not check if customers were coming to view their products which means they may miss some customers who do not bother to wait or search for them.

The Ugly

A major disadvantage to the street sellers in Ngong road is that they sell their products right next to sewage. There is also a lot of dust in and around where they sell and, in the air, due to dust being kicked up by cars as they drive on the road. This means that their area of business is dirty, has a terrible smell (sewage) and is extremely unsanitary. I believe it is one of the major factors they don’t get a lot of customers; due to the unsanitary state of their business premises it is unattractive to customers who lose interest as soon as they see where these products are being sold. The dust also gets on products like furniture which makes them unattractive to potential customers and causes them to lose interest in these products which, usually, are of very high quality.

It is also extremely dangerous for people walking as the products take almost all the space and people are forced to walk incredibly close to the road which highly increases their chances of getting hit by a car. As these cars are driving through, the sellers are exposed to a lot of exhaust fumes which could cause pulmonary complications in the future. Since the sellers work and sell on the roadside with no shelter they are exposed to all types of weather (e.g. extreme heat/cold, heavy rain which also affects their products).   

When we were there I witnessed someone trying to sell products that were not his and even had knowledge about the product that one would think only the owner of the products would know. He was caught and thoroughly beaten by the other sellers when they discovered what he was attempting to do. When we asked the sellers, they told us that that was a common occurrence in the street selling business and that it had happened to some of them as well. Theft of product when operating on the roadside is a huge risk and the workers must be extremely careful with their products.

The Opportunities

	With as many problems as these street sellers face it is easier for us to get them on board with Soko Janja as they know their businesses won’t be on the road for a long time and also due to the opportunity to get more marketing and sales of their products through Soko Janja. There is a wider variety of products for Soko Janja to market and sell which is sure to attract more customers that are diverse and increase Soko Janja’s brand awareness. One of the goals of our company as a whole is to help the Kenyan citizens improve their lives and by helping these street sellers sell their products through Soko Janja we can help them improve their lives in multiple ways (e.g. provide better for their families, move their businesses to better premises etc.). Since we will be helping the government by helping these people get off the roadside our company could collaborate with them and they could help us fund our various projects through grants and subsidies.

In conclusion, the more I work in UBRICA, specifically Soko Janja, the more I learn about the true state and suffering of the poor in Kenya and learn how, through Soko Janja, we can help them improve their standards of living."

The first one being that I cannot expect any outcome without it becoming the complete opposite as to what I expected. For example lets say I made plans to hang out with my friends or go someplace or expect some work to be done by today or any specified date, it never happens.If I had to plot a graph showing how accurate this is ,it would have an accuracy of 98%.Just thinking of this fact makes me sick.

The second one is really fucked up.The second one restricts me from having any fun or happiness or positivity in my life.I cant do anything good without being punished by it moments later.Recently I had a 8 day internship/training at someplace(lets name it Bagaland).The internship programme took place between 10am to 3 pm.The rest of the day was off, we could do whatever we want.I came with 7 of my friends.Right from the first day ,whenever I was with my friends and we made plans to go out, it all (as you can guess) fails.Everyone gets dissapointed.Sometimes I feel that this is happening because of my participation in the group,as guess what , the two days I decided not to join the group ,they actually had fun,like as in whatever they expected happened.I feel so guilty when this happens.Also the first day I recemmonded a place where we were supposed to stay, turns out we had to walk 3 miles from the railway station and we realized we were scammed moments after we went in.If it was me I would have been okay,but since the other 6 people with me also had to suffer the same fate because of my being in the group , it hurts me really really bad.I had to bargain and get our money back ,because i felt solely responsible for this.And yes we did get our money back but with some losses ,but I thought I had undone one of my fates. We did find a decent place to say but it was overpriced, we were tired from the journey and we decided to pay it.This was the first day.The subsequent days I had things happen which were subtle but if you really notice it then its my second and first rule in action.But I dont mind those as long as its me who,s at the recieving end  of my problems, but when it starts affecting the people around me, I go insane.I feel like my brain is put in a blender.I never really had plans of going to this intership but since i never really went anywhere in the past 2 years, i felt that this was a break that I really needed.But this fucked me up even more. There are a lot more incidents that have happened to me in the last 8 days.I could write it all,I have even shared these with my best friend in the hopes that it may lighten my burden, but so far it has done nothing. Im scared that my fucked up system is affecting people around me and I think social isolation is what I need. Just yesterday I took the initiative of booking tickets for our return, because no one else was taking up the initiative.We were supposed to be at the bus station at 9pm and the bus was supposed to leave at 10pm.We met with some traffic on the way but we reached the station at 9.15pm.Guess what happened next.The agency which booked my tickets said that the bus has already left at 9.10pm instead of 10pm because of the weather(it rains heavily here and almost randomly,there is no season called a rainy season).We were then made to settle with a lower tier bus for the same price.We had to again walk a mile to get there.Bus was shite .Bed bugs and what nots. If it was me I was okay with all of these because I know how my life works, but then when it affected 6 of my friends , I knew that it was because of me that all these things happened. I somehow have ruined the 8 days. I have come home today and I dont feel any different.I feel that this world could have been a better place if I had not existed.Because of the two rules I dont even have the courage to do onything. My self confidence is at a all time low. I dont go to make new friends,actually I have stopped interacting with my friends. I have started shutting myself down even though I know that I shouldnt.I know that there are a lot of people out there who are even living a shittier life than me, but the thought that nothing will really go as expected for me and whatever good deed I do i get punished, keeps fucking me over and over and over. I cry just to ease this pain out. This has been bothering me since a long time, but I think Im falling apart piece by piece.

There are still many stories, like the one where my uncle was getting married.I had my cousins everywhere, happiest day of my life I guess, boom ,next moment i was hit by a stone on my head by a random guy who was trying to shoo a stray dog away. 3 days in the hospital.Fuck My Life"
91frbi,8,2018-07-24,How I became Microbiologist | Career Talks,rahul8080,IndiaSpeaks,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/91frbi/how_i_became_microbiologist_career_talks/,"Originally posted on [Navigus](https://navigus.in/blog/how-to-become-a-microbiologist/)

We had been extremely lucky to have a sit down with Mrs. Shubhangi who is a [Marie Curie fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Sk%C5%82odowska-Curie_Actions), a research scientist, and a microbiologist. Read on as we find out what kindred in her an interest in science, specifically microbiology and how she came to be a Marie Curie fellow. Along with the ups and downs of her journey to becoming a research biologist.

## What leaned her towards science?

While many of the green-eyed Gen X’s wouldn’t be able to comprehend a world before the internet Shubhangi considers herself to be lucky to be born in an era where there was no Facebook, no iPad, and no computers. Hence as a child to learn and understand the world around her back then, all she had to do was to run out and get her hands dirty.

&gt;***“My parents always encouraged me to do whatever I wanted to do”***

Fascinated by the secret workings of the world around her she had a natural inclination towards science. One particular instance she recalls as a child is being mesmerized by the process of metamorphosis. Hence she conducted her own experiment with a caterpillar in a jar. That after weeks turned into a butterfly. She was in awe of what she had witnessed. Thus it was at this point that she had decided that this is what she wanted to learn about, to study how things change from one to another and how everything is connected one way or another.

## How then did you decide on the field of microbiology?

“The real world begins when you complete schooling and make the first choice about your career” she quipped. After schooling a naïve wish to help others was what led her to her two final two career paths; a doctor or a researcher. Similar to many science students, she gave the Central examination for being a doctor as soon as schooling ended. She, however, picked being a researcher instead as it allowed for a larger extent and broader reach than the other path.

Later she opted for botany at a time when everyone considered the subject *dead if not ancient.*While everyone felt she was making a mistake picking botany her parents support saw her through the end of her masters.

After taking botany while she was conducting an experiment on the soil, she learned of microbes and their extensive role in the various biological cycles. This made her question how something so tiny could have such drastic and far-reaching effects and hold such importance in the circle of things. After a brief discussion with a professor, she was intrigued with the microbial side of things. She came to understand that *life could be improved* considerably through research in the field of **microbiology.**

## And the prestigious Marie Curie fellowship did that come as naturally to you as science did?

*“No not at all”* she simpered. The story behind that goes as follows. When completing her master and hunting for internships the Director of her institute suggested that if she were truly keen on research and development **(R&amp;D)**, it would be best for her to look at internships abroad. She hadn’t thought of that and so she gave it a try. Hence while preparing SOP’s, research proposals, etc. Her *first head-on contact with scientific world* began. She started reading and reviewing the literature and finally wrote her first research proposal to hundreds of professors around the globe. Later she was selected for an internship in Germany. And loved everything about it. Hence soon afterward she decided that Germany was where she’d like to **grow her career.** After backtracking this decision she applied to several scholarships such as **DAAD**, wrote proposals, etc. 5 years hence after being rejected twice and bouncing about jobs that taught her much. She finally got the opportunity to be a *Marie Curie fellow.*

One of the most prestigious scholarships all over the world. Which does not give you a fellowship just to complete your Ph.D. but rather is more of a **training network t**hat trains people to become the **next generation of researchers** in their respective fields. They train you to*practice what you learn in a lab* and *apply that in the real* world where you might help create a product through your research.

## On being a research scientist.

Being a research scientist means shouldering a tremendous amount of responsibility she says. One has to view their work *critically* and *analyze* as well as *criticise* it in the right light. While additionally *appreciating* it in the right light. As **every project is unique.** No one has done it before you and nobody will do it after you. Also from one’s research would stem many other projects. All funded by public money. Hence your research is accountable. You are accountable.  A research scientists life it about responsibility, hard work, and collaborations, in short, it is about **balance.** This balancing act gets too much for most hence many quit their Ph.D.’s after a while.

## Her views on automation.

Computational parts of work are increasing and it is for the better as you no longer need to be the **brawn** but solely the **brain** behind the experiment and research. Most research fields have become extremely interdisciplinary and hence at some level or another of your research, you’d require the ease computation. Similarly in biology, computational biology. In fact, in the *last ten years, we have gathered more information than in the past three decades* due to the ease of computational biology and automation.

## Any advice you have for students and teachers?

https://i.redd.it/t986akgc2vb11.jpg

“To students, I’d say make a lot of mistakes. As until you don’t know what’s wrong, it’s impossible to learn what’s right. Be curious and if you aren’t, then get curious. Get your hands dirty. Want to know how something works? Open it up. Don’t be afraid of failing. Persist in your efforts and if that doesn’t work then persevere.” To teachers she asks to take the practical aspects of subjects more seriously as once someone does something with their own hands they automatically think about it, *why does it happen, how does it happen?* And so they are taught **‘how’** to think and not **‘what’** to think

## Any major difference in you’ve noticed between research here and in Germany?

https://i.redd.it/2wxouh4g2vb11.jpg

*“People are fearless over there have the courage to say ‘I don’t know but I am willing to find out.”* Everybody is comfortable with the fact that **no one knows everything** but we’re **all in a constant state of learning and evolving** and hence accept *“I don’t know”* as a valid answer. Compared to India where stating the words *“I don’t know”* could mean the end of your academic proficiency in the eyes of your peers and professors.

91fs6a,3,2018-07-24,"MacBook Air Review (13-inch, mid 2012)",adapteronline,u_adapteronline,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_adapteronline/comments/91fs6a/macbook_air_review_13inch_mid_2012/,"Apple's MacBook Air was initially an high-priced luxury, but with an update in 2010 became an affordable, fantastic machine. It is light, well-made, and fairly powerful, and it really is microsoft surface 3 charger/surface 3 13w grow to be the selection of many men and women prepared to trade the raw computing prowess of a far more high-end machine for any device that's a little bit less complicated on the spine. Last year's model brought macbook pro 13 charger 60w/macbook pro 13 inch 60w magsafe power adapter a brand new level of computing power for the Air, devoid of changing a great deal concerning the style.

New year, old story: final week at WWDC Apple announced the latest revision from the Air, altering the internals with out altering the physique at all save for the new MagSafe 2 port. The Air's usually been a looker, but with macbook air charger 45w Intel's Ivy Bridge processor inside along with more rapidly flash storage, it appears like its brains may well finally match its beauty. It really is not the only thin laptop around, although. An abundance of other companies have built outstanding ultrabooks - lots of that shamelessly ape the best functions from the Air, quite a few that effectively go a distinct way.

Design and Build

At 1st glance, you may be forgiven for pondering that is asus ad883220/asus charger ad883220/asus ac adapter ad883220 the same machine as its predecessor - Apple just hasn't fixed what wasn't broken. The 2012 MacBook Air 13 inch continues to be a gorgeously minimalist unibody affair sheathed in anodised aluminium, that's just 17mm thick and weighs a mere 1.35kg. If it wasn't made by Apple, it could be named an Ultrabook.

The similar angular lines, glossy black screen, matt black keyboard and big silver touchpad are all present to greet you, whilst build high quality is toshiba satellite l50 b 1nx battery/toshiba pa5186u 1brs battery just as superb. In actual fact, the only way it is possible to tell anything's different in the outside is by looking at its connectivity, and especially in the slightly much more elongated MagSafe two connector (and no, your old MagSafe kit will not match unless you buy an adapter).

Aside from softening a handful of edges, there's seriously not as well much we wanted to determine changed, so we're not complaining. From the a13 045n2a/acer a13 045n2a/acer ac adapter a13 045n2a/acer a13 045n2a charger non-Apple ultraportable crowd, only the Samsung 900X3B, Dell XPS 13 and, to a lesser extent, Asus Zenbook are playing in the identical field in relation to the combination of premium appears, sleek lines and superb create on present.

Display and speakers

After a few days of using the MacBook Pro with Retina display, I could barely stand to look in the show around the MacBook Air. That's hp spare 800049 001/hp battery 800049 001 the crazy factor: this is still a definitely very good show, the identical 13.3-inch, 1440 x 900 screen the Air has had for the final two years. It has phenomenal viewing angles, extremely accurate colors, along with a frustrating degree of glare and oleophilia. It is not as great because the 1080p display on the Sony Vaio Z (a much more high-priced laptop), but it's asus ad883220/asus charger ad883220/asus ac adapter ad883220 nevertheless really solid. The Pro and its mesmerizing 2880 x 1800 screen are a quantum leap beyond ""solid,"" though, and it really is difficult not to wish for the same issue to come towards the Air. Obviously, we've been hearing rumors that just such an upgrade is coming later this year, and that is tantalizing enough that I might advocate waiting a number of months to view if the rumors are accurate.

The FaceTime camera around the new MacBook Air is a1286 charger/macbook pro a1286 charger/a1286 macbook pro charger now technically ""HD,"" but I wouldn't contact it a huge upgrade. The new 720p camera is unquestionably an improvement, enabling other people to determine me considerably better - when I chatted with our intern Tyler Gold, he pointed out that together with the new MacBook Air he could count how lots of teeth I had, whereas around the old model my grin was just a single white blob. Particulars are asus ad890m26/asus ad890m26 charger/asus laptop charger ad890m26 a little clearer, and also the picture's slightly sharper, but the Air's camera continues to be about on par using the front-facing shooter around the iPhone. That is to say, not pretty excellent.

I've lengthy been impressed with the MacBook Air's internal speakers: they're not the highest-fidelity drivers you will ever hear, but they're pleasantly loud and sound is pa5109u 1brs/toshiba battery pa5109u 1brs clear and crisp. On the new model, the speakers happen to be slightly enhanced. Highs and lows are nonetheless clipped a little (that is why I nevertheless propose a superb set of external speakers) but mids are richer and fuller than ever. In the event you like bass-heavy music, even though, you happen to be nevertheless out of luck.

Performance

Now this can be the section you've been waiting for, is it not? We already know how the MacBook Air appears and feels, but how does it execute with lenovo g50 80 battery/original 41wh battery for lenovo g50 80 serie that faster processor? The $1,199 model we tested includes a 1.8GHz Core i5 CPU, specifically, in addition to 4GB of RAM along with a 128GB solid-state drive. (The final Air we tested had comparable specs, but sported a Sandy Bridge Core i5 CPU clocked at 1.5GHz.) As you could see in the tables above and beneath, the newest generation delivers a considerable overall performance increase over last year's model, in each Mac and Windows benchmarks. Its PCMark Vantage score of 13,649 is just blistering. Record-breaking, even. We haven't observed an Ultrabook that comes close to this -- not even the ASUS Zenbook Prime UX21A, which has asus ad891m21/asus ac adapter ad891m21/asus ad891m21 charger a Core i7 Ivy Bridge CPU, 4GB of RAM plus the very same integrated Intel HD 4000 graphics.

Granted, the UX21A may be the only other Ultrabook we've tested to date having a third-generation Core processor, so we expect there is space for other Pc makers to close the benchmark gap when they get their refreshed systems into the hands of reviewers. Still, it is not possible to shrug off that a1278 charger/macbook pro a1278 charger/macbook a1278 charger/a1278 macbook charger delta in scores completely: there is no purpose the UX21A must score three,100 points decrease in PCMark and almost 1,300 points less in 3DMark06.

So what do those raw scores translate to in real-world performance? For starters, we timed an 18-second start-up when we had been booting into OS X (with Windows, it was closer to 40 seconds). We also ran the surface pro 4 charger/microsoft surface pro 4 charger/surface pro 4 docking station disk benchmark ATTO to pull off a much more direct comparison with many Ultrabooks we've tested recently, as well as the SSD inside showed prime read/write speeds of 551 MB/s and 521 MB/s, respectively. That's just a shade more quickly than the ASUS Zenbook UX31, which had been holding steady as the Ultrabook transfer speed champ for about eight months. It's pa5186u 1brs/pa5186u 1brs white/toshiba pa5186u 1brs battery also worth spelling out that the Air stayed quiet all through our testing period, and surprisingly cool too.

Battery life

If we were betting forms, we would have guessed the battery life would not be substantially various from final year's model: after all, this year's Air packs exactly the same 50Wh cell as its predecessor, and Apple is pa3817u 1brs/toshiba battery pa3817u 1brs/pa3817u 1brs genuine/pa3817u 1brs original toshiba after once again promising among five and seven hours of runtime. In addition to, early Ivy Bridge benchmarks have recommended the battery life involving machines with second- and third-generation Core chips is comparable.

In reality though, the 2012 Air lasted six hours and 34 minutes in our rundown test, which entails looping a video with WiFi on and genuine toshiba pa5024u 1brs/toshiba laptop battery pa5024u 1brs the display brightness fixed at 65 percent (in the case of Macs, 10 out of 16 bars). That is about an hour longer than what we got when we ran the 2011 Air by means of precisely the same test last year. This also makes it the longest-lasting 13-inch Ultrabook we've tested -- a distinction lengthy held by the HP Folio 13.

Basically, Apple's MacBook Air 13 2012 remains what it was - an incredibly great subnotebook with a incredibly higher high-quality claim. On the other hand, the high-end gear such as the SSD and aluminum case, as well as Apple's premium claim boosts the price for the 13.3-inch simple configuration to 1249 Euros (~$1606). You can wish for any much better screen in view of that. Apple prospects will most likely also nevertheless must wait a lengthy time for an integrated 3G module."

basically he's been helping us edit  some vlogs and do some VFX work but  today he brought in this crazy length  this is a  to , millimeter lens  at , millimeter lens is extremely  zoomed in it's like the most zoomed in  shot you can possibly get it's basically  a telescope without mirrors it's only  like $ wait what yeah it's super  gentle we can't read anything on that  fire extinguisher up there but we can  read it through here Sam put your face  there this is actually really cool  because it's basically a telescope but  with the camera on it only your eyes are  framed of Sam I'll switch with you if  you want to come look at this yes that's  so lens like this basically it creates  like an orthographic image you can't  really see vanishing points everything  is just super like space is compressed  you guys want to take this to the  streets what if we put this lens on our  red camera okay good luck because I  think it will be actually incredibly  challenging we might have rails that can  extend this bar but nothing to actually  you mentioned you had a good idea yeah  this thing takes time like this we can  mount this middle part on the tripod the  camera here I can build a sort thing for  it and then the weight is still mounted  somewhere in the center albert is you  might be able to actually mount the  tripod head on to that so what I want to  do is I want to be able to put this  camera like down at the end of Hunter  Street and point it all the way down  past all the cars towards Santa Fe what  exactly will be legible if we do that  how far zoomed in can we get and still  get discernible things in the image  they're interesting we haven't done this  before some I'm excited Christian hey  man I have to take a phone call like  right now Carmichael is stuck on the  roof Jake he's not gonna last out there  there's him can you can you help him  right now yeah  thank you thank you please don't forget  first of all thanks to netmarble for  sponsoring this  and helping me  discover my new favorite mobile game  sometimes \[[how to drone fish](https://reviewsdash.net/best-fishing-drones/)\]it's just like really slow  around work so like I don't really have  anything to do really helps me pass the  time but it's a highly addictive  open-world game and you can do  everything from quests dungeons battles  there's literally so many things that do  and explore like I don't even know how I  have time in the day to do anything else  made this sweet dual wielding warrior  character so I'm pretty lonely exploring  all the dimensions of lineage  by  myself but I hear this game's  multiplayer so I'm kind of in search for  a squad to help me battle these these  high-level dungeons you can pre-register  now on lineage  websites for free or if  you go to the link in the description  you will receive the hero starter pack  full of gems armors and all this other  cool loot that I've already been working  so hard to get plus if you pre-register  now you actually get to reserve your  characters a name ahead of everybody  else and you get an exclusive title so  if anybody wants to come join me and  play some of these dungeons hope that we  play with you soon but for now I'm gonna  continue this dungeon I feel like I  forgot to do something now back to  lineage  let's get your process alright use that  process that's secure it's a photo Pro  UFO curl oh these are the those cool  guys for NAB all right I like these guys  it's very sensitive right now in fact if  it stays on it moves the actual ball  mount is not locked that's pretty tight  now I assume I can keep rotating this  value called Jake did that works so  compare the size of this lens to our  biggest lens in our inventory the  to   millimeter lens and this is like two  and a half times longer okay I'm gonna  get on the one with Ren I've carried  more expensive stuff this lens is really  good for getting this heatwaves type of  that it's not a very hot day but I'm  sure I see some distortion of those  shots so now we have all of this range  to look down the middle of the street  that's providing enough support of  course so I'm gonna write the one wheel  all the way down there that guy it looks  like he's right in front of you dude the  cars that pass by the second acid give  us a clap we can see yeah yeah  know what the exhaust that's coming out  of the back of these cars is causing all  sorts of turbulence I can't even see Ren  I'm so far away like on this camera for  our fingers three all of them five five  so Renton when it clears up just go full  speed we're gonna try to follow you with  the focus right after this car what are  you doing  it doesn't look like it but there's at  least a football field between us that's  how far he was from he couldn't hear me  yelling I'm not talking to you we  thought you're gonna get hit by a car  every few seconds it certainly looked  like it oh my god like right here it  looks like I'm literally about to in it  this is the most insane Lin setup man I  wish we could go even better this is a  two times teleconverter  in this tiny little lens will actually  double the zoom of this giant lens    millimeter cool that is locked oh my  gosh oh my god this is so wiggly wobbly  no way  no way oh hey Jake whoa now you have a  real job  well your problem Esther how did I  become the prop master if

setup  I've been reading the TV show shooter  the sniper guy I kind of think we need a  long lens it doesn't have to be that  long because I mean most of the time  it's the stupidest thing ever to

Nothing too fancy but shows I've already learnt something.

I'm not sure what to do in terms of making things easier for me. Is it better from my point of view to use as many open source libraries and frameworks as possible or should I aim at writing as much code myself as possible? The code is much simpler when using libs/frameworks but I don't want anybody to think I'm lazy and don't know how to write code myself.

BTW: what do you think about my project? if done properly, is it something that can impress anyone looking for a junior developer or an intern?"

91gw7d,17,2018-07-24,Getting my nursing license with past charges,Orbitalpenny,nursing,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/91gw7d/getting_my_nursing_license_with_past_charges/,"Hey Reddit! So I'm about a year away from finishing nursing school (yay!) But the closer I get the more I worry about getting my license with my criminal background.  When I was 18-19 I ended up from a couple dui under 21 charges (meaning I wasn't old enough to drink but had a measurable amount of alcohol in my system) and I got a possession of marijuana charge.  These charges are 12-13 years old. I ended up getting a DUI in 2013 (misdemeanor), no excuses I was just stupid and I have paid for that mistake many times.  

Now for all these charges I completed my probation. The older ones I just received copies of in the mail and they show they are dismissed but still on my record. Apparently I missed some community service hours back then so they were not expunged. The recent charge (2013) I completed 3 years of probation, community service, drug and alcohol classes, counseling, and random drug/alcohol tests for a year, plus paid fines on all the charges. 

So my question is, is it even possible to get my nursing license with this much going on in my past? I've checked into applying to have the records expunged but I'm looking at about $1500 per charge which I definitely can't afford on top of school right now. I may try to have the most recent one expunged at the very least.  

Not sure if it matters but all my charges were in Oklahoma, I currently live in Alabama 

If anyone out there has successfully turned their life around and gotten their nursing license even with a checkered background it would definitely make me feel better to hear it!  

TL;DR: criminal charges on my background, wondering if I will even be able to sit for my NCLEX or get a nursing license


Update: So I applied for a position with a local hospital.  Disclosed everything, still got an interview.  Was informed after running the background check that NOTHING showed up.  Not sure where to go from here for my NCLEX.  I was about to start the process for expungement but if it doesn't show up is it worth it??  Btw, got the job. Start next week.  Just as a nurse intern for now until I graduate. "

I’m finishing my master in Computer science and working as a software engineer(5 years), but some time ago I realized this is not what I want to do in my life. I have only my master thesis left, so I want to graduate, however, then I want to change my career path to urban design and planning. I think my studies will give me some benefits and tools I can use, like soft skills, problem solving, analytical thinking, etc.

Since a long time I was fascinated in urbanism, how cities work, the way they can change people lifes and how to create more friendly spaces. 
That’s why I created the list of tasks I should get familiar with. 
I’m working, so I want to fulfill them in my free time, after work and during the weekends.

1. Practice urban landscape drawing and sketching, I think this is quite important skill to learn, even in a digital era: 

  https://www.udemy.com/urban-drawing-and-design-101/learn/v4/overview

  [/r/ArtFundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtFundamentals/) subreddit might be useful as well for practicing sketching. 
 
2. Learn GiS: 
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gis
3. Read books based on programme of some studies. Here’s the list of books I created:
 - Happy city by Charles Montgomery(Read already)
 - Cities for people by Jan Gehl(read already)
 - Local Planning: Contemporary Principles and Practice
 - The Image of the City by Kevin Lynch
 - A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction by Christopher 
Alexander, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein (optional)

 - Well Tempered City by Johnathon F.P. Rose
 - Walkable City by Jeff Speck 
 - Architecture and The City by Aldo Rossi
 -  Notes on the synthesis of form, 1964 and Patern Language, 1977 by Christopher Alexander
 - Good city form, 1984 and Image of the city, 1959 by Kevin Lynch
 - The death and life of great American Cities, 1961 by Jane Jacobs
 - The production of space, 1974 and Writings on cities, 1968 by Henri Lefebvre
 - A City is Not a Tree by Christopher Alexander [PDF available](http://en.bp.ntu.edu.tw/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/06-Alexander-A-city-is-not-a-tree.pdf)
 - Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander
 - A New Theory of Urban Design by Christopher Alexander
 - Emerging Concepts of Urban Space Design by Broadbent

Here is a list of articles from New World Economics, all of them are worth to check: [https://newworldeconomics.com/category/traditional-city-post-heroic-materialism/](https://newworldeconomics.com/category/traditional-city-post-heroic-materialism/)

----
After getting more familiar with theory and tools used during designing and planning, I think the next step should be to apply for an internship or apply for postgraduate programmes(mostly 1 year long).

What do you guys think about it? Any recommendations, tips? I based my programme partially on Amsterdam’s Urbanism studies.

I have an amazing internship that I wish I liked and wanted to go to, but it makes me so anxious I am constantly trying to make up excuses to skip or leave early. The whole day before even going I get anxious even thinking about going. I feel like I am going to mess something up, or do something wrong or something bad will happen. I get bad anxiety at night and although I live in a safe town, I am terrified that the door isn't locked and that somebody is going to break in and harm me and my family. I also am scared that my friends get annoyed or irritated with me, along with other stuff. 

My heart randomly will beat really hard and feel like its palpating and my breathing gets heavy and I feel like I am on the edge of tears but it is not a full on anxiety attack. 

But...  I will read articles from people living with anxiety and my brain will convince myself that ""no, you don't have anxiety you're being dramatic, these people have it way worse than you"" but that doesn't help, all my syptoms still happen and I am left in just a confused state. 

What is going on with me?

I am also too scared to tell my family or friends or even a doctor in fear that they will think I am being dramatic or lying about it. My best friend has anxiety and I don't want to ask her about it because I feel like she will get annoyed with me and say that I am being dumb and don't have it. "

So I'm in Paris taking a short vacation after finishing an internship in Spain (I'm American btw). I'm walking in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral when this woman comes up to me asking for donations for a school for the deaf and mute. I will be me, and the woman will be CB for choosy beggar:

CB: Hello would you like to donate to help the deaf and mute?

Me: Sure, here's 2€.

\*I have my coins mixed with my bills and am carrying a 20€ note\*

CB: No no minimum 20€.

Me: Sorry I can't give any more.

CB: But you have a 20€ note right there, give it to me.

Me: 20€ is too much, I can't afford that.

CB: Fine can you give 5€? I'll give you change.

Me (annoyed and trying to get her to just leave me the f alone): Fine here.

CB goes to her group of other choosy beggars to try and find change, clearly making an effort to force me to just give her the 20. One of her friends produced a 10€ note after 5 mins of ""searching"".

CB: Here, have a nice day.

Me: You still owe me 5€.

CB: Have a nice day, bye. \*shooing me\*

At this point I've had enough of their bull and just asked for the note back.

Me: Here, take this and give me my 20 back.

CB: \*hiding the bill out of my reach\* Have a nice day bye.

We repeat this exchange for a good minute, and each time I put more force behind my words, until I'm at the point where I'm about to grab her arm and take the bill, when she finally caves and gives me my money back. Moral of the story, don't ever donate to a cause in Paris. Those people were almost definitely trying to scam tourists.

TL;DR: Woman approaches me asking for money for the handicapped, refuses my donation and asks for more. I oblige but need change. Woman tries to short-change me and I almost get into a fight getting my money back."

I'm about to enter law school from the workforce, but I have about 1k in CC debt that I won't be able to pay off before I begin school (I've done the math and I don't have family that will assist me), and it might even increase to \~1.5K after I pay for my move and other things I need. My 0% APR period also runs out this month. I was thinking of getting a credit card that could hold this debt at 0% interest rate until I have a year under my belt and can get an internship (assuming I do well in school, an internship would pay as well as a standard lawyer's job). 

I have a great credit score (&gt;770) and I currently make \~50k, so I should be able to get a good credit card. If the wise thing is to apply for a new one, should I apply with my current salary even though I will become a student soon, or should I apply for a student CC.

I'm not looking for any advice on law school - I've spent more than enough time on r/lawschooladmissions and r/LawSchool \- just CC advice.

Thanks for the hlep!"

It all started well with promising goals, but without me being able to use the lab because I am foreigner and I was okay with that since a public dataset, a computer, coding is all what I need to do.

1. So figured out a potential contribution, he was on a long vacancy trip, decided to finalize my idea (at least code), I almost finished and started getting results, I went to his office, he told me this is stupid and I have to change the entire research topic after really one entire year of research, I thought he knows what he's doing, and just obeyed.

2. got an internship and needed his agreement, he turned into a giant angry Chicken and asked me to change supervisor, I explained to him it would be nice but it's late nobody will agree to be the advisor of a PhD with 1.5 years left.

3. a few weeks ago, I run some code, I did some comparative study, it went fine, and decided to write and submit a conference paper out of this, he agreed happyly, and I had a thesis proposal presentation, he reviewed my report and everything and was okay with them a day before (yesterday), but today (the presentation day) he started complaining about me, my performance and my work and the stupid idea of the paper next to the committee members, I was shocked, it was really unexpected,

dear redditors I felt like sharing my bad experience here, I feel so angry, bad and hopeless, but I still have to deal with this monkey, to graduate hopefully..

dear advisor, you are a piece of shit and you are going to hear this from me once I graduate (or leave)"
91k2fo,42,2018-07-24,Is it time to break up with him?,frustratedddddddd,JustNoSO,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNoSO/comments/91k2fo/is_it_time_to_break_up_with_him/,"My SO (M19) and I (F19) are entering our sophomore year of college. We've been dating for two years. We've been living together this summer for our internship at a company. I helped him get the internship.  

I'm really irritated with him because he keeps telling his family, as a joke or what, that I abuse him. Stuff like I throw things at him or I yelled at him a lot or that I'm constantly pressuring him or manipulating him. I have never thrown anything out of anger at hin, except maybe a pillow or a stuffed animal. I guess I yell but I confronted him about the fact that he yells at me and scolds me like a little kid and he said that he doesn't yell at all and has never yelled. Which seems hypocritical.

He gets mad at me for drinking. One time, I had one drink with someone and was so nervous about telling him that when I did he went off about how I was being unruly and basically scolded me about the consequences. It's really getting on my nerves. I feel like he treats me like a little kid.

I wanted to take a vacation before we went back to school and he was being cheap about it even though I offered to pay for most of it. He said that he didnt think I should be spending that kind of money. I have excellent personal finance skills and have been working hard to maintain discipline over my accounts. We share no accounts together.

I don't like feeling embarrassed like that with blatant lies. His family seems to like me but I really wish that he wouldn't treat me that way in front of other people. I'd go on more double dates with other folks my SO just doesn't know how to not keep his mouth shut and stop lying about me. I don't know if he's joking or not. He falls on the spectrum though.

I'm becoming really irritated with him and have told him that I'm unsure if we should break up. Part me wants to leave because he can be so obnoxious. The other part doesn't because he comforts me and supports me unlike any other. He is also obsessed with me and it would probably destroy him."

Hello, I am not an actuary or an actuary student, but my girlfriend is. She loves to stress about not being able to find a job in the future, and how the actuary exams are really hard. (Gets really bad a week before an exam ha ha) I want to make her feel chill, but I can only say generic things like ""Just Relax"" or ""You'll be fine"". Of course that just sounds really generic and won't be very effective in getting her to chill out.

Therefor, I have made it my mission to get a better understanding of the actuary world so I can have a better perspective when talking to her. I've spent some time reading post on this forum and got a good handle of a lot of things. Mostly a high level view of how actuaries work and the standard career path.(Go to college, pass exams, get job, take more exams and get better jobs) But I have questions about some specific things that I can't really find online. 

Here are my questions:

1) How many exams do people usually pass by graduation? My girlfriend is about to enter her 3rd year of college and has passed the FM exam and just now the P exam. I feel like she is right on track since she passed them both her first try, but still before every exam she says she wants to change her major and she is just wasting her money. (Of course after she passes she relaxes)

2) How important are internships? My girlfriend is really school oriented and I doesn't always realize that work and school are different from one another. She doesn't have any internships, so I think that if she gets one (only 1 summer left to try) she'll feel more grounded and comfortable with her future career. She has a family friend that will give her some internship next summer if she can't find one her own, but I am not sure what she would be doing.

3) What are the best ways to find an internship? In my major, Computer Engineering, its really easy to find an internship as there are many job postings and many different fields we can work in (software , hardware, electrical). I remember she looked for some internship positions (it was nearly summer at this point), but she only found 1 or 2 postings and neither excepted her.

I got ready to go to my internship, and then, I had to run to the bathroom. I had very bad diarrhea, and I emptied my stomach completely after puking last night's dinner. It was painful, uncomfortable, and horrible in general. 
Then, I got a little bit of a fever and physical pain all over my body, along with chills. My stomach was totally empty, so I drank water. Bad idea, cause I kept puking. 
I had to call to my boss to tell her I wouldn't make it today, she told me to rest, stay hydrated, and that it was okay if I don't go until I feel better. 
My grandma was very worried. She felt bad, cause she thought that maybe, her food made my stomach act like crazy. But I know it wasn't that. 
I curled up, nausea, pain, fever, chills. I'm still spotting a little bit, so asking me if a was pregnant was not on her mind at all. 
Then I texted my mom. She just asked me if I had my period this month, and told me that if I still feel bad for two more days, she'll take me to the doctor. I'm actually scared, cause maybe she'll discover what I did. 
When I tried to talk to my boyfriend about it, he immediately stopped me, and told me that he didn't wanted to know anything about the abortion anymore. 
Maybe it's my fault. I was tending so much to his feeling and emotional needs after this, that I neglected myself. And so did he. 
I know it was harder for him at the start, but knowing he doesn't want to hear about any of that anymore makes me feel like I can't count on him for the emotional support I so desperately need. "
91lppw,7,2018-07-24,Should I switch out of CompSci?,keneralgenobi1492,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/91lppw/should_i_switch_out_of_compsci/,"Hey /r/asu, was wondering if you could help me out with my academic dilemma.

I'm entering my senior year of college with two or three semesters left of my computer science degree. I switched into the major from mechanical engineering at the end of freshman year, mostly because I didn't know what I would do with it and wasn't a fan of my physics class. While I have been doing well enough in compsci (my marks are more or less average), I can't help but feel disillusioned with my study and future job prospects. For the first couple semesters of the major I was excited to be a programmer but after a while I found myself uninspiredly drifting through the classes. On top of that, I had a semester-long internship last fall where I got a glimpse of what the working environment may entail for a programmer, and it seemed like a lifestyle I might come to dread after not too long. Coding to me is a tolerable activity, but I can't say I've ever been excited to sit in front of the computer and crank away for hours on end. In fact, for the past year or two I haven't ever been inspired enough to create any programs outside of the mandated class assignments, which seems like a red flag when I talk to other students in my field. Recently, now with 400-level courses approaching I'm unsure if the workload is even worth it anymore at this point, given my lack of enthusiasm. As far from ideal as it would be to switch majors now, I fear even more going entirely through college and ending up with a degree that I'm not a fan of and as a result not going to do well with.

[TL;DR] My main fear is that my indifference in computer science is becoming a liability that will prevent me from having an enjoyable and successful career, which is the whole reason I chose this major in the first place.

So my question: Should I suck it up and endure to the light at the end of the tunnel and pray I like my work after graduation? Or should I change majors and go back to square two? For what it's worth, I was thinking of switching back to either mechanical or electrical engineering, now that I'm no longer a naive 17-year-old and have a somewhat greater and more mature understanding of what I could do with either of those degrees.

What do you think?"
91lqtx,3,2018-07-24,My [29M] Chinese girlfriend [24F] is causing me a lot of stress over finances and lifestyle,thedisconnect1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/91lqtx/my_29m_chinese_girlfriend_24f_is_causing_me_a_lot/,"I have been dating my girlfriend for over a year now, and we both just finished university (electrical engineering for me, I was upgrading from a previous college diploma in an unrelated field). She finished an English degree. She is planning on going to film school in LA for another 3 years while I am working.

I am currently in China visiting her family, and she is an only child. Her parents want us to get married (and we see things going in this direction too), but they have informed me that the Chinese marriage tradition is to have the husband buy a house for the wife and himself before marriage. As in, outright purchase it with the help of his parents.

As a way of ""helping me"", her parents said that I could buy a small house in Ontario (where we currently live) as an investment, and they would get a house in LA for my girlfriend and I to stay at while she attends film school. I appreciate the gesture, but I won't be able to afford to buy a house outright for years! They also don't seem to grasp that even though my family is doing well, I can't just ask my parents to buy me a house...

I come from a family of 4 kids, and my parents did a lot to afford us the life we have. They paid for each of us to attend undergrad and post-grad. They were only able to afford it all because we lived extremely frugally throughout our day-to-day lives. Ie, no brand-name clothing, no get-away trips, no presents (ever) growing up, never eating out, basic cars, etc. Furthermore, all of my parents money is tied up in assets and a company that my father is trying to acquire. My parents are true ""savers"", and I think they are doing very well for themselves, but don't hold liquid assets.

In contrast, my gf's family are ""spenders"" and seem to always be gifting each other with lavish presents. Because this was the first time I was meeting her parents, I bought them Canada Goose jackets and it was a HUGE thing for me. I see such expensive gifts as reserved for only important events. In return they went out the next day and bought me a $1000 jade bracelet, a Galaxy S9 phone (because my Note 3 was cracked...), and handed me a stack of cash worth $2000. I feel like they were just paying dividends on my gift, and although I appreciate the gesture, I don't like the feeling of making a profit from the exchange. My gf also bought her mother a $5000 omega watch (with her parents money lol), and her mom didn't bat an eye - she was just appreciative. That interaction made no sense to me; my mother would kill me if I bought her a watch that far outside of my means instead of saving my money (nevermind the fact that my gf spent her parents money to buy it!). Aside: My gf was not trying to trick her parents or anything, they know she used their money.

After visiting my gf's family in China we were also going to visit my family in Italy, but were going to skip out on going to cities where I didn't have relatives who we could crash with. Well... my gf recently booked 5-star hotels in Rome, Milan, and Florence for a total of 3 weeks with her parent's money, at their encouragement. I don't even want to write out how much it cost them, it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I see this kind of spending as overly gratuitous, but this treatment is what my gf has become accustomed to.

My girlfriend has learned to not spend so much money since we moved in together earlier this year and she never expects me to pay for her expensive tastes, but I really dislike how her parents are enabling her to be such a huge spender without providing her with a means to sustain her lifestyle. I don't think her English degree or film schooling will get her there. I currently have $15k in my bank account left over from a 16-month internship, and I am starting my electrical engineering career as a fresh grad at age 29. When I get home in September, I will be searching for a job. I am nowhere near being able to afford a house. 

I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on how to deal with this disparity in lifestyle or the traditional Chinese custom of having the husband buy a house outright before the wedding? My gf has been very good in adapting to living within her means when we're at home, but she says she wants her kids to be able to travel the world, go to private school in LA, etc. She has no idea what it's like to not be an only child that is funded by two highly-paid parents and I am not sure how she will handle it."

This one, though, is the craziest one I've ever had. I told it to a few people today who had no idea what it means. 

I don't know if it's that I quit drinking a few months ago or pain killers I sometimes take for neuropathy pain from high-dose chemo a few years ago, but this one was very vivid and it took me most of the day to shake off.

I woke up this morning and to record the dream I wrote a step by step of what had happened during it. There was little lead-in between some of these vents so it makes sense to just keep the thing in list format. If anybody could give me even an inkling of what this means, I'd be very grateful. 

1. I was at a massive house party involving alcohol during which someone died
2. I got married to my girlfriend despite her parents being very mad about it
3. My girlfriend's parents found out we got married and were pissed
4. Had to drive my ""wife"" back to her parent's house
5. While driving my ""wife"" back, we ran into her mentally-challenged sister who said that her mother hated me in a way that few people ever hate anyone
6. I dropped my girlfriend off at the parking garage next to a stadium that was holding a sporting event, which was filled with spectators
7. While I was leaving my girlfriend's mother spotted me and tried to chase me down, but I pretended my hand was a cellphone and pretended like I was talking to someone so the mother wouldn't bother me
8. I tried to hide from the mother further by ducking into a building that looked like a bank, but was really a remote controlled elevator run by a bunch of disgruntled interns
9. Eventually, the parents caught up with me. The father said the reason that they hated me was really that I didn't understand return investment on mortgages. (This is the last subject in reality this guy would ever be pissed about. They're very salt of the earth people.)
10. My girlfriend's mother hugged me and cried, almost like she was apologetic
11. As I was walking with my girlfriend's parents, snow started melting which resulted in racoon-squirrel like creatures becoming unfrozen and scurrying by, which meant they'd get trampled by people
12. I dreamt that my girlfriend and I decided to move into a fancy hotel/super luxury apartments, the people who lived close to us were a young successful, slightly annoying couple
13. I went into the bathroom and noticed in the mirror that I had long black hair like Nick Cave
14. I took a shower, closed the curtain, and the water almost overflowed
15. I noticed that there were different foot pedals used to drain the shower waters, but when I used these in addition to the water being released bright colored balls like the ones you'd see at Chucky Cheese were released too
16. My girlfriend walked into the room, only she wasn't my girlfriend any longer, she had morphed into the girl that I had dated when I was in my early 20's, in real life she was a very egotistical but pretty aspiring actress in Los Angeles
17. My girlfriend found her way into my arms and started talking about how she wasn't beautiful, I thought the completely opposite and insisted that I was very much love in with her
18. As I was talking to my girlfriend, a contact lens slipped from her eye and I noticed the lens falls down her body
19. My girlfriend started talking about how she hated the couple next door until she had heard the young lady in the couple mention having “Natalie Holloway” tattooed on her stomach while she pregnant
20. My girlfriend talking about having a baby (while my girlfriend today and I have decided to not have children, the girl I dated then was only okay with potentially adopting at some point in the future)
21. I picked up a magazine which was a sales listing and my girlfriend talked about how pitiful dads raising children were.

I don't know what the hell any of it means. I think it's an absolutely strange dream. I'd appreciate any illumination that anyone could shed on what any of this means. Thanks a ton."

I really need some advices from people who might have been through the same things as I have. I’m a college undergrad(tech major), working on my last internship this summer. I met my bf about 4 months ago. He’s a musician and was working on his album at the time. When I first met him, he’s good looking, sweet, charming, and very good at mechanical work. We fell in love really fast and even though we argued a lot, we always got back together cuz we cared about each other. 

But about a month ago something with his album didn’t work out, and he had no where to stay so he moved in with me.  That’s when I saw the truth. He’s addicted to coke and some other hard drugs, and also an alcoholic. He has no saving(literally 2 digits) and is homeless and jobless. He can be saying really sweet things including wanna get clean and start a family and have children one day, and do drugs and act abusive the very next day. I don’t know how many times I cried and believed him and he’ll change but he never did. He’s said things like he really loves me but drug addiction is a mental problem and sometimes his mind’s tricked and he couldn’t help himself. I wanted to save him so I’ve been trying to help him financially and emotionally in the past few months. 

However, All my friends and families want me to leave him and I realize that I’m already financially and emotionally drained by him. So I told him that he can’t stay with me anymore and should move back home. But we still loved each other so we agreed on that he’ll go to a rehab right away and we’ll keep in touch and I will not give up on him. We’ll move back together when he’s clean and ready. He left yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon, he called me and told me that he’s back on coke again and broke up with me. He told me to “release him and let him go”. I don’t understand why would his feelings change 180. A month ago, he’s the one who cried and begged me to save him. I don’t know if the love he had for me was real at all or if everything’s just a lie. I blocked his number and everything when he broke up with me, but I’m still very heartbroken right now and I really need some help and advices. "

91mkmq,15,2018-07-24,(Very long post) I just spent 4 days in a Psychiatric Hospital. Here is my experience. (includes TL;dr),jdonovan74,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/91mkmq/very_long_post_i_just_spent_4_days_in_a/,"Some of you may have seen my posts on here in the last couple of weeks. I was really struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts and finally decided to bite the bullet and go to the hospital; here is how it went. I will also answer any questions if anyone is curious about anything.  


Day 1, hour 1: I walked into the building and didn't even get 5 yards before I was stopped by a security guard. I had to remove my shoes and all contents from my pockets while going through a metal detector. After getting the ""all clear"" I was let into the waiting room/reception area where they locked the door behind me. In this first hour I was checked in and seen a psychiatrist in less than 30 minutes of being in the door.  


Day 1 hour 2: The fist psychiatrist was accompanied by an intern who jotted down my story. She recommended that I go to a local crisis center but wanted to run that by her superior first. I then met a second psychiatrist who was able to get a little more out of me. That little more was enough for him to suggest I stay the night there.  


Day 1, hour 3-6: Literally sitting in the waiting room... Got my blood pressure taken, and watched TV...  


Day 1. hour 7: I was told my room was ready. I was searched down to my underwear and given a gown to wear. I was taken to an elevator by a security guard who then had to call use a walkie-talkie/radio to get me up to the floor. I guess as a security measure the elevators had to be managed from a different location. After getting to my floor I was greeted by the nurse I disliked the most my whole visit. She spent about an hour struggling with an obviously outdated computer trying to sign me in. I was then haded off to another intern who showed me around the unit, including my bed room where I fell asleep for about 20 minutes within minutes of arriving.  


Day 1, hour 8: Everybody starts going to bed. The commotion wakes me up. I toss and turn for about an hour and realize I couldn't sleep, so I get up and head to the common room where I spend the next hours watching ambulances and helicopters take patients in and out of the neighboring ER.

Day 2, let call it hour one because this was the official start of my 72 hour stay: Numerous meetings take place in the morning. None I want anything to do with. I head to my room but immediately realize I can still hear everything in the meetings. Then a singing group started and I just wanted to not hear it. I quickly realized there was no where I can go to escape this! My room made me claustrophobic, and I was locked in the unit! In less than 10 minutes I start having a total panic attack.  


Day 2, hour 6: I see the first psychiatrist that I have seen since the two I seen during check in that was about 24 hours ago at this point. I tell my story for what feels like the 15th time, and to no surprise I am put on another anti-depressant. I mention my panic attack and he also adds a low does benzo to keep me calm. I mentioned that I don't want to stay there any longer than I was forced to, so he told me that I can sign a 72 hour waiver. That would make it where when the 72 hours is up, he can either 302 me, or I can leave against his advice when it was up.  


Day 2, hour 7-15: I finally started talking to people. This was insane considering how bad my social anxiety. We ended up playing numerous board games, which made time go much faster. Everyone was pulled aside every once in a while for things like drug tests, blood samples, and other medical tests that are run when you go to most hospitals.  


Day 3, hour 16-48: Same things as before. More meetings on how to deal with stress, and anxiety. Given medications. ETC. The difference was it was now Saturday and Sunday. The main psychiatrist for our unit was at home, so we had another one. This doctor literally talked to each of us for no more than 2 minutes each. So since that is how it went on Saturday, I declined to talk to him on Sunday.  


Day 4: I tried to sleep most of the day to just make time move quicker so I can get out of there. Didn't happen... I was woken up numerous times. Once to tell me breakfast was ready. I declined. Then again shortly after by the sound of music coming from the common room. Knowing that I was likely to leave at the end of the day I finally decided to join in on the meetings. I can honestly say they helped! Learned some new ways to deal with certain triggers! Later that day I was finally seen for only the second time by our unit's doctor. He was accompanied by a social worker. He told me he would like me to stay a bit longer but I know I couldn't handle it, so I told him I wanted to leave. He left me with another anti-depressant script, and an intake appointment with a new psychiatrist that will handle my anxiety.  


TL;dr: I voluntarily checked myself into a psych ward after a suicide attempt. Overall it helped and it left me with a few new coping mechanisms and new therapists and psychiatrist. Would I go back? Yes, but not voluntarily..."

Anyways he ""suggested"" I major in computer science and I said sure, sounds interesting enough. Now 2 years into my degree, I know it is FAR from interesting enough (for me personally). I am switching over to nursing. Actually tbh I switched last year but I didn't want to tell him as I knew it would be an issue even though he is not paying for my college or anything. He kept talking about me looking for tech internship positions and I didn't want him to get his hopes up so I gently told him I was thinking of going a different path. Since then, his behaviour has been BIZARRE. At first it was shock and anger. One time he called me sobbing and begging me not to change it. Then he texted me ""its ok I still love you and am here for you even though this breaks my heart"". Now he is reverting back to the angry abuser he always was in my childhood. I called him today to tell him my blood pressure is extremely high and he said in a rude way ""Thats what you get for changing your major, you are such an idiot. Don't call me unless you need money but if student financial aid cuts you off then I can't help you sorry"". I have been bawling my eyes out as he is my only biological parent who is alive (a point he always lets me know) and I just wanted some comfort not a guilt trip! He makes me feel horrible about my own decisions and unsupported... but I know he worries about me.. I want to go NC but I need advice here!"

So i finally passed all parts of my CPA (So happy), but i still need a couple of credits left to get to 150 (NY CPA). 

NASBA is telling me i need 14 more credits, 8 of them accounting (which i will be calling a coordinator tomorrow on since they counted one course as a duplicate and they did not count my accounting internship as accounting credit). I will likely need another accounting course or two before i can finish off the accounting requirement, any recommendations on cheap and quick ways to get accounting credits post college? 

Thanks so much."
91nory,5,2018-07-24,[Futa4F]Employee of the Month for all the right reasons...,Why_must_you_know,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/91nory/futa4femployee_of_the_month_for_all_the_right/,"Working for a startup definitely has its benefits, especially a successful one. Me personally? I worked for a successful startup. Hours were great, the people were better, and their ""open mindset"" meant that they were very accepting of my girlcock, an absolute monster that'd dwarf any man's dick. I had the perfect skillset for the job, but I had been worried that having such a sizeable extra appendage wouldn't fit their feminist, ""all female employees"" agenda.

So what if I had a huge cock? I could just be as girly and feminine as every other woman who worked here. They just didn't get massive boners that threatened to rip right through their pants at all hours of the day. Most of the ladies here were understanding of my needs, to varying degrees of course. Quite a few were willing to give me a quick handjob in the bathroom, some would use their mouths, and the really nice ones would let me fuck them, though they seemed to enjoy that as much as I did.

That didn't really matter now, because now what I needed was release. I quietly got up from my desk, feeling an erection beginning to form. It was only 9:15, but my cock wasted no time in waking up. I nonchalantly made my way out into the hallway, the slight bulge of my slacks quickly becoming more and more noticeable. Hopefully some lady would be willing to help out in the bathroom, if I didn't run into a kinder soul on the way there.

-----

So! An all-female, hipster, modern tech company where one employee happens to have a huge cock, and the others are happy to help her out. We could do several short scenes with this one, all sorts of angles. Maybe her deskmate decides to hide out under her desk for a little bit? Or a friendly, understanding coworker is in the bathroom when she bursts in at full mast? Maybe it's an intern's first day on the job, or the CEO calls our lucky futa into her office to experience this cock she's heard so much about. As the title may have hinted, it'd be a fun tilt if her coworkers/superiors enjoyed her cock, and it helped her get professional success? e.g. a raise or a promotion? The more ideas you've got, the better!

I think it'd be fun if it was frowned upon for her to fuck in common areas, so we could incorporate that and the risk/taboo along with it.

I was intentionally vague on details so we could pick a ref for her. I have some I like to use, but if you have ones you like I'll definitely consider them! Basing her appearance off a celebrity is also an option. Same goes for any coworkers of her's you'd like to play.

Finally, my kinks(Some may not fit as well as others): Huge everything, bulges, distension, tons of cum, cum inflation, spanking, public sex/teasing, freeuse, name calling, cock worship, non-penetrative sex(titjobs, handjobs, etc.), pregnancy, lactating, tight clothes, teasing, casual sex/nudity, dirty/crude talk, and playing as youtubers/celebrities

Limits: Scat, piss, gore, bdsm, etc.

Please put a pun into your first message~ Can't wait to see those envelopes!"

Hey Reddit. I know this is long, but I really think it's necessary. Most Americans don't know what it's like in Congress for those who aren't elected officials. I wanted to provide the perspective of those on the lowest rung- the intern. For the sake of anonymity, I will not state specifically which office I worked with, nor will I state my name. I just wanted to get this off of my chest, and hopefully this can cause more discussion.

I’m a double major in political science and history, and I’ve always loved the thought of working in government. As a matter of fact, I can seriously say that I have never considered any other career path in my life. I see working for government as the highest form of public service- after all, everyone who works in a government job, from the DMV to the President of the United States, is a paid employee of the people. I hope to one day be lucky enough to be a public servant that can help those who need it the most. 
So, I was ecstatic when I learned that I got an internship in Congress. Finally, I’d be able to work in a place where I could see how people could make a difference in my country. Finally, I’d be able to see the inner workings of the so called ‘swamp’- a place where lawmakers work together to advance the interests of the American people, from Iowa to New York. Finally, I’d be able to work in Washington, D.C., the capital of what I consider to be the best country in the world. 
When I got to the office, I was surprised by how *kind* and personable the staffers and other interns were in my office. As a Democrat, I was worried that my political opinions would be stifled and ignored in the office. Instead, I stepped into a office that not only was politically tolerant, but also was fun to work with. My boss, the staff assistant, was a jolly guy who ensured that the interns could not only focus on different policy initiatives (be it healthcare, taxes, or social issues, etc.), but also made sure that we had ample opportunity to find ways to advance our career in Congress. My chief of staff was nothing but accommodating, and even ensured that he could get me into contact with offices that aligned more with my political affiliation. 
The first thing I learned at the internship was that *politics does not matter when you work in Congress*. Everyone is interested in networking to find something (be it a job, a congressman, or even just friends) that help them out in the long run. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Democrat or Republican. If you showed the initiative, that was more than enough to make your presence known among staffers and members of Congress. 
One of the reasons I came to intern in Washington, D.C. was because I secretly wanted to see what the political climate was like in the center of American politics. And what I learned was that the House of Representatives and the Senate is the calmest dumpster fire I have ever seen in my life. Since I make sure to pay attention to political news every day. And some of the news stories I have seen have legitimately terrified me. Republican lawmakers have not worked towards ensuring that the United States election process is secure, nor have the majority even considered that the FBI may be right in the fact that Russia has interfered in the elections of another sovereign state. Not to mention that Sacha Baron Cohen has done a fantastic job in uncovering the insidious intentions of politicians like James Spencer, who clearly sees those who are not like him and his brethren (i.e. white) as Americans who deserve equal rights. 
Yet no matter what, every single office I worked in or visited was full of smiling faces that worked towards fulfilling the interest of their boss. For the most part staffers and interns were much nicer to constituents who visited their office in person. Those who worked for organizations and lobbied for different interests were treated to a beverage and a snack in some offices. Every single time. Of course, I totally understand why. They’re guests of the office, and it was only right to treat them with respect. 
However, I can’t say the same for the constituents who had the heart to call their representatives in order to voice the opinions that they had the constitutional right to let their elected official know what they think. Most of the time, my office (and a lot others) would be annoyed with the fact that they were getting calls in the first place. Every single time that a constituent called in with an opinion, no matter how kind or vitriolic, me and the other interns in many different offices would simply write down their names and numbers, and that was the end of that. I can say for sure that the representative that I worked for never knew what the constituents who took the time to call their office thought of his policies or his voting record.  In the office that I worked in, congressional staffers wouldn’t even pay attention to the names that interns had written down, even if they lived in the district. Interns often joked about some of the people who called in. I found it worrisome that those who called in the most often had the most criticism levied against them, even by the interns. 
I was also fortunate enough to meet my representative as well, and he was just as kind as the staff that he hired. He wanted to know more about me as a person, more than what part of the state that I came from. Yet, as a black intern, it was still extremely hard to look past the memorabilia in his office, especially when he showed me a picture that he took with the infamous Strom Thurmond. It was hard to reconcile the nice Congressman I met with his pride over one of the most well-known segregationists in United States history, and it was even harder to feign awe at the photo. Politics don’t matter, but the way that you act around your boss, the congressman, does.
While I loved working in the city of DC, I can say without a doubt that working for Congress was one of the most disturbing experiences I have ever had. This was a chance for me to really see what the people who worked in our nation’s capital were like. What I expected was one of the most partisan areas of the country. After all, staffers of all types of political affiliations were there. What I found, on the other hand, were actual people. There were staffers that were doing their jobs to ensure that not only were the congressman’s wishes carried out, but also trying to pay off their student loans. There were Congressman that were charismatic, no matter how loathsome I found their political philosophy to be. And there were interns, just learning how to navigate their way through all of this. And through it all, I sat and watched everything go crazy while everyone went about their normal lives. 

Though our lives were anything but normal. After all, we were all working for the interests of the former host of The Apprentice. How could any of this shit be normal?

91p314,112,2018-07-25,"gave my son his first head, with lots of thoughts in my head [M/S]",MrsBancroft,incest_relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest_relationships/comments/91p314/gave_my_son_his_first_head_with_lots_of_thoughts/,"First I have to mention that I asked my son if he would like to start calling me by my first name, since we're in an adult relationship now. He wasn't too comfortable with that, which is fine, but sometimes he'll call me ""mommy"", usually after we kiss. It feels weird, but at the same time, I really like it. and I've even caught myself referring to myself as ""mommy"".  It gives me a comforting feeling, like, he's still my boy. Except I also want him to be a mature man who can live up to dating a mature woman. So now when he calls me ""mom"" or ""mommy"" I tell him to use my first name. 

Maybe that's too much to expect from him, though. I want to figure it out internally before dragging him into it. He's just having a nice time learning about sex from his mother while she's going through all this complex stuff. I want to keep him innocent, but also help him mature. I know that's a contradiction. I guess I just need to write down my thoughts more than anything, but I'm always happy to hear advice.

On a lighter note, he got a promotion where he's no longer an intern but a paid employee at his job. Usually they don't do that until they graduate, but they decided he was worth it. So it was a big deal, and I am so proud of him! I treated him to a nice dinner. He asked if I would wear [my red dress](https://www.venus.com/viewproduct.aspx?BRANCH=7~72~&amp;ProductDisplayID=43442&amp;source=yal) (he likes how it shows the freckles on my shoulders) with my [ gold shoes](https://www.farfetch.com/shopping/women/aquazzura-gold-purist-105-metallic-leather-sandals-item-12970011.aspx?fsb=1&amp;storeid=9359&amp;size=24) and his favorite [toenail polish](https://www.violetgrey.com/product/le-vernis-longwear-nail-colour/CHN-159012), so of course I obliged. We had a sommelier who was this beautiful Latin woman probably in her 30's (not much younger than me). She actually offered him wine but he declined.  After she left I teased him that they would make the most beautiful mixed babies together. He goes ""The lady I'm with now is much prettier."" That, of course, made me tingle in all kinds of ways, but that made me bring up the question of doesn't he want children? Obviously with me that would be impossible. His response really surprised me. He said ""could we move to a country where its legal?"" I still don't know if he was serious or not, so I kinda laughed and said ""Honey I would gladly make love to you all you want, but getting mommy pregnant is out of the question."" Meantime, he has no idea what's been going on in my head (I'll explain that a different time). I'll just say I couldn't stop myself from running my foot up the side of his leg at the thought of him getting me pregnant. Then I realized the tablecloth wasn't that low and the whole restaurant could see a middle aged woman playing footsies with her son.

Which also got me thinking. What about when people find out about us? **Should** they find out, or should we keep our romance a secret? We don't live near any relatives, but what if his college friends found out? I wouldn't want them to shun him because of me. He deserves a normal college experience. I don't want him to be laughed at as the guy who has sex with his mother.

So I behaved in public after that, but when we were at home again I kissed him and asked him to spend the night. I'd had two glasses, so I was a bit in cougar mode, poor guy. He was worried he would make a mess on my $2400 bed set, but I thought of the advice from here and said ""you could put the mess inside mommy instead."" He turned really red to that one. I figured since I embarrassed him, what do I have to lose, so I said I'm going to be wearing wearing a sleep mask, and an [outfit](https://www.lovehoney.com/product.cfm?p=35079) that would give him easy access to me, in case he changed his mind. I thought on my toes and told him if he wants my mouth instead, to lay upside down with his feet on the pillows, and I would know what to do without him having to say it.

So after an hour I gave up waiting and went to sleep, but I felt the bed move suddenly and realized he had joined me...upside down.

So, for this part I'm not giving too juicy of a story, because it was a very intimate, private moment with my son that I'll cherish forever. All I'll say is pretty much right away he said  ""I love you mommy"" and halfway through that sentence it was showtime.  It must be torture, in a way, to be a teenage boy. You're full of what seemed like gallons, and the slightest touch is like a pin to a water balloon. Needless to say I was very happy to help. I moved the pillows to the foot of the bed to cuddle him afterwards. I ran my hand up and down his chest hair and told him ""by the way, it's I love you (my name) instead of mommy"", and he corrected himself, although I felt bad after saying that.

So I guess my advice ask for this post is, is the ""mommy"" thing a big deal or should I put a stop to it?"
91pino,15,2018-07-25,Boyfriend thinks I use my anxiety as an excuse to be lazy,irldrfu,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/91pino/boyfriend_thinks_i_use_my_anxiety_as_an_excuse_to/,"Throw away account. 

I've been with my boyfriend for three years, and we love each other immensely. We are both very committed to a long-term relationship. I have always had anxiety symptoms my entire life, but they never seemed intense enough to talk to someone until starting college. We are both currently in college, and my anxiety has taken a turn for the worse. I started having pretty intense panic episodes and meltdowns and found myself unable to do a lot of everyday things and schoolwork simply from fear and overwhelming stress. I have seen a therapist and been to a psychiatrist 6 months ago in which they prescribed sertraline for anxiety-depressive symptoms and propranolol to lessen physical panic symptoms during occasionally triggering social events. I have definitely seen an improvement in my mood and an overall level of calm most days. I still have bad days obviously. I still struggle to overcome certain things, especially social things, but every day I'm trying and still seeking help along the way.

I have expressed my feelings and challenges with my boyfriend many times and he seems to be very understanding, though I know it is hard for him sometimes. We make compromises for each other and he pushes me to overcome many issues I face, while also being understanding when I just can't.

Recently, one particular issue has come up for us a lot. With both of us being in college, internships, jobs, grades, and grad school are constantly going through my head and I try to plan ahead without getting too overwhelmed. I try my best to take it one day at a time and really focus on current issues (like passing a class I'm taking or getting a job for the semester). I also devote some time to looking at grad schools, GRE, planning for the future, etc. But I try not to focus on those things too much because they are sort of a trigger for me and will cause me to spiral into an existential panic occasionally. 

My boyfriend is very successful in his field of study and has had multiple internships and a lot of experience with some big-name companies. He has amazing grades and it always seems to come naturally to him. I love him and I am incredibly proud of him, but I do feel a little inferior sometimes, which isn't his fault. For me, some days I'm happy to just have gotten out of bed and done the dishes. I try not to focus too much on the future because I know it will cause me to panic. I celebrate things, like studying hard for a class or getting a new job, that I know are little steps that will help me in the long run, although they may not be as big as getting a paid internship or talking to an intimidating professor about grad schools.

Although I know that doing the small steps will lead me to my career goal eventually, my boyfriend seems frustrated that I'm not doing the BIG steps. He wants me to ""do something that will forward my future career"", but I feel I'm already doing that in my own time. The things he wants me to do are things that I am not ready for emotionally; they are things I want to do and I know I will do, but not at this moment. I need to build up to them, not go head-first. But he sees my avoidance of doing these things as me not wanting to do them and ""having no drive or ambition for my career"", which is not true and pretty hurtful that he thinks that. It almost seems like he expects me to do exactly what he has done in order to be successful.

It's not that I don't want to do these things. I just can't physically force myself to do all of them now, I need a chance to do them in my own time. He gets incredibly frustrated when I say that it makes me feel incredibly overwhelmed and anxious to try to do them. He thinks I ""sometimes use my anxiety as an excuse"". That really hurts me. And I've told him that, but he doesn't seem to understand how my anxiety really feels. He always tries to problem-solve and give me logical reasons why my avoidant or stress behavior is self-sabotaging as if I didn't know. He can't rationally understand it, and that is the thing: Anxiety causes irrational thinking and behavior. But he can't wrap his head around why in the world I would do the things I do, when ""it would be easier if you just did this"". I love him, but sometimes I wish he understood how hard it is and that I'm not choosing to be lazy just for the heck of it. I have goals that I want to achieve, and I will achieve them in my own way. He just can't seem to hear me out when I say this. Advice?"
91qvs8,0,2018-07-25,uni or polytech?,fluffy2monster,newzealand,https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/91qvs8/uni_or_polytech/,"so i'm going to do a graduate diploma in ICT next year, idk if anyone's heard of it but it'll be the SHIFT programme offered by Signal. 

i've pretty much decided that i will do it, but my problem is this: should i study through the university of otago or through the ara institute polytechnic?

i've talked to the programme directors and they've confirmed that all the modules, way of teaching, projects, internships, etc. will all be the same. the only differences will be which institute awards the degree, and the locations.

i'm currently in dunedin but i've been thinking of moving to christchurch for a while, mostly because it's bigger, rebuilding, more opportunities, but i also don't want to shoot myself in the foot by going to a polytechnic and then finding out no one wants to hire someone from a polytech.

but would it be a big deal though? would employers not care so much since i'm getting the same skills and experience as uni students anyways? it would be great if i could get some opinion on this, i've been thinking on it for weeks.

thanks all!"
91qxhw,1,2018-07-25,(F16/M17) My Long Distance Boyfriend Disregards All Of My Feelings.,AnthropogeneticKidd,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/91qxhw/f16m17_my_long_distance_boyfriend_disregards_all/,"Hello! Before I begin, please don’t complain about the fact that we are in a long distance relationship, it becomes irritating.

My boyfriend and I, let’s call him ‘A’ have been dating since August 2017. For the most part, our relationship is really good, but we’ve definitely had bumps in the road. Before, when we had an argument or problem, it was easy resolved with a few days of space and an apology. We’ve begun to have this reoccurring problem that when he becomes stressed out, he becomes extraordinarily distant and angry, and my response to that is to instantly cling and try to fix all of his problems. It drives him absolutely insane how clingy I am, and I try to lay off, but it isn’t enough. But this time, I think he hurt me more than he can fix. July has been an awful month for our relationship. It started off with him going to NORWAY the same day I arrived in the COUNTRY HE LIVES IN to visit family. He went to Norway for an internship opportunity and his father accompanied him, I knew that he felt awful about leaving but I felt even worse. It would’ve been my only chance as a teenager to see him, and he blew it off. 

As soon as he got to Norway, he was busy 24/7, and with the business cams his stress, exhaustion and anger. He began to take it all out on me, calling me clingy, annoying and demanding for texting him a few times after he ghosted me for three days. The more this month went on, the more I began to feel neglected and foolish. He only speaks to me at night time, and when he finally texts me he’s often rude, demanding or bitter. Last night we got into a huge argument, and it all started off with him not speaking to me for two days. I was out with my family and he began to spam text me around 9:00, sending me at least fifteen messages in two minutes. I didn’t have time to reply to him just yet, and I left him on read, where he replied with “Smh. Read? FUCKER. I’m deprived of you here.” 

At this point, my feelings were still hurt that he was active on social media but couldn’t make time to talk to me, and that he had been fighting with me constantly and saying mean things without any apology. I began to bring up my sadness and disappointment, to which he just talked over me about a concert he was about to to go see. I told him that I was too sad to entertain him right now and that I needed some time, and that was it for a few hours. When he texted me again, he completely blew off the fact that I was clearly hurt and began to talk about something his cousin had did to him. I snapped, and told him I didn’t want to hear or read the poem his cousin had wrote him. He asked me what had gotten me so pissy, while continuing to talk about the same bullshit I had asked him to stop. 

I began to tell him how I felt sad and neglected, and he made a complete joke out of it before telling me he had to go, leaving me feeling super invalidated and hurt. So, I took an hour off and wrote him a few paragraphs on my feelings and how he had hurt me, and yet again he gave no fucks about anything that I was feeling. He told me this in response;

“sick of these fucking tantrums over nothing.”

 “I’m done. There’s way too much shit happening and I am not up for your clinginess and demands. You don’t can’t even begin to understand how much you’re pissing me off.”

“Every single thing you say and do aggravates me so fucking much.”

And then, a quick; “I’m actually so close to saying it please just shut up and go sleep.” 

Which obviously meant he was thinking about breaking up with me. I don’t know what to do, my feelings are so hurt and I’m left feeling like he doesn’t love me or care AT ALL about my feelings. I consistently drop everything for this boy and am so careful to make sure I don’t hurt him or upset him and now he’s put me into this place where all I want is to emotionally withdraw l. I feel as if I’m just some annoying pest he can’t stand, and it really really hurt me. So, what should I do? How can I fix this? Should I withdraw and give myself and him some space? For how long? Opinions?

TLDR: My long distance boyfriend has been fighting with me constantly. For this entire month, he has been invalidating my feelings, picking fights out of nowhere, calling me ‘clingy, demanding, annoying’, telling me that every single thing I do or say aggravates him and has been sparingly with affection. He takes out all of his frustration, anger and stress out onto me and I’m beginning to feel sick. Help?"
91riq8,3,2018-07-25,in which way did i fuck up? 4Y relationship breakup,capn123,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/91riq8/in_which_way_did_i_fuck_up_4y_relationship_breakup/,"2 weeks ago i ended a 3 years 9 months relationship, the last 9 months we were a LDR cause i started a masters abroad. I was visiting her every 4 months for a period of 2 months, but after the first visit things fell appart. 

I am having lots of thoughts regarding what could I have done to save the relationship, at the beginning she said she would join me and also do a masters, internship, language course, but then she said she actually did't want to do that, so we both agreed that it was better to be a LDR and be together when my program finished (1 year from now). i could have planned my thing very differently if she would have been honest and clear from the beginning but she didn't really know what to do (she has a lot of anxiety about what to do with her life), she said she wanted to be with me for sure... even after the first visit (3 months ago) she said she was absolutely down to go wherever with me, so was i. 

But just 2 weeks ago she tells me that she wants to find her own happiness, not follow someone else's plan, then she broke up with me, she also told me that she felt incredibly miserable by being alone all the time (she is the type of person who cant be without a partner at all times) i mean i literally told her all i wanted is to finish my program ASAP in order to join her, and make a life together. i don't know where things were wrong. i never tried to force her into anything, i just wanted to let her know that i wanted her in my future, cause we have always talked about it, and i think she was scared at some points that i would change my mind.

should i have been more cool about our issues? like when our communication was fading should i have just let it happen and think about it as we are a confident couple who doesn't need to be in touch all day? (i mean not saying much during the day, depending on the message content, but i could tell her lack of interest a lot) should i have not said anything about her not supporting me in any way during my time here, not a single good luck in your exams or anything, should i have not said anything that she forgot my BDAY and when i reminded her she just says a ""hahaha sorry honey i'm the worst, HBD!"" when 3 months ago i threw her a giant surprise for hers.

everybody here says that we should learn from our mistakes from our past relationships and i'm sure i did many, but i just cant believe that the reasons that make my relationship fail were the same reasons that i thought would save it (more communication, support between each other, trying to find a clear path for our relationship in order to keep our hopes about the future up)"
91rqs8,1,2018-07-25,"Me [22 M] with my now ex-girlfriend [22 F] of 5.5 years, broke up with me, feeling lost.",Popohad,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/91rqs8/me_22_m_with_my_now_exgirlfriend_22_f_of_55_years/,"My girlfriend and I started dating in junior year of high school, and did long distance for college. I recently graduated in may and moved back home with my parents. I am currently looking for a job in my field, and she has had an amazing internship this summer which has caused some friction (she has another semester of school left). 

Our relationship has not always been perfect, but we have worked through and moved past many of the issues that caused issues in the past. However, relatively recently, I started feeling as though she didn't feel the same way about me as I felt about her. She didn't ask me how I was doing, or wasn't as affectionate. She wouldn't take my feelings into account or would not consider how something she said could be hurtful. 

We talked about this two times, once in may and once two weeks ago. In may she apologized, and said that she would try to be more thoughtful and caring. For a while, until mid-late June I would say, this worked. At around that time period she became much closer with some of her coworkers that are interning with the same company. I was happy for her, as many of her past friends she is no longer that close to, with a few exceptions. I should note that I am not in contact with anyone I went to high school with, and have almost no friends in the city I live in anymore. 

It started causing issues when I noticed some of the same behavior as I mentioned earlier, where she would consider what she wanted and not how it would affect me, or prioritized time with her friends over time with me. I have done my very best to not be controlling, to not ask her to choose between me and her friends, but I think I came off somewhat like this anyway. 

The first time it came up in an acute way was after she had come home from work and we hung out for a few hours, she asked if I could drop her off at one of her friends houses, as she wanted to spend time with them. This hurt, as it felt like she was directly choosing them over me, though I did take her there. I don't know if that is a reasonable feeling to feel, or if it is me being controlling/assuming I have a right to her time. 

We had some small discussions about this afterwards, and again for a while everything was fine. The next situation that came up was on July 4, where she had made plans with her friends to go to a nearby park. I had been looking forward to watching fireworks with her, as it was a time that we had shared for the past few years. She told me that she hadn't thought about it the same way, which should have been a warning sign to me, but that she would do her best to ensure that the trip ended at a reasonable time to watch fireworks. She asked if I wanted to come to meet her friends, and after being convinced, I did. 

The day was a complete disaster, as pretty much no one spoke to me the entire time. I felt as though I did my best as a fairly shy person to talk to her friends, and I think only one person spoke a sentence to me without me saying something to them first, and this was on the way home. I felt completely abandoned, like she had left me out to dry. She made no effort beyond initial introductions to make me feel comfortable, and barely paid attention to me the whole day. 

I felt incredibly hurt by this, and we spoke about it the next day. I think at the start of the conversation she intended to break up with me, though by the end she expressed a renewed interest in trying to fix our relationship. I should clarify at this point that her doubts in our relationship mostly came from her wanting to be free and be young and not have to consider a partner, and that she had been slowly falling out of love with me over the past couple of years. 

We then spent the most amazing week together, and I could tell that she was really trying to fix our issues. I felt so so loved, and important to her. We had fun like we hadn't in years, joking around and being silly. I received news that my grandmother was dying, and asked her to cancel plans with her friends to spend some time with me because of this. With no hesitation she agreed and again I felt loved and appreciated. My grandparents live in a foreign country, and I dropped everything to go there for the funeral. I spent about a week there, and when I returned late last wednesday, she came over for about 45 minutes to see me, and again I felt loved and happy, I really missed her and she seemed to have really missed me. 

The next day she came over after work, we went out for dinner and watched a movie afterwards. Towards the end of the movie she started getting many messages from her friends, and afterwards asked if I minded if she left and went to see them. Again I felt hurt, as I was just away for a week, and it really doesn't seem like much to ask to spend a whole night with your girlfriend who you haven't seen in a week. We argued about it and she had her dad pick her up from my house, without resolving anything. 

We spoke the next day while she was on her way to work, and she expressed that she thought my current unemployment put pressure on our relationship, as potentially I didn't have anything else going on and so I thought about it and her too much. I felt that even if I was working full-time, I wouldn't feel any different about her, as I truly was in love, and I didn't think a job would change that. 

I went away for the weekend for a hobby of mine, and we spoke through text about our argument. I said that on saturday I would be free to talk around 7, and she said ""sounds good!"" I took this as that she would try to be free then to talk through our issues. At around 7:30 I realized that my work shift would not end for around another hour, and texted her that information. To my surprise she said that she was at a friend's house and wouldn't be able to talk that night at all. I felt hurt that she had purposefully stood me up, and she expressed that she wasn't the kind of person to wait around to talk to someone if it meant giving up on other plans. We argued about this back and forth for the rest of the weekend, and I said that on sunday night I should be able to talk while I was on the bus home, and again she made other plans and we were not able to speak. 

She claimed that she wanted to speak about this in person, and not over the phone, but was too afraid to tell me that. I was confused, as I have not raised my voice in our entire relationship, and feel as though I have been quite understanding and considerate when faced with her feelings. We made a plan to speak on monday night, and spoke beforehand during the day about how we felt. She expressed that she wanted to try to work things out, but wouldn't compromise on her core beliefs and goals. I don't think I ever asked her to, and said as much. We plan to meet at the park, as there wasn't really anywhere else to speak privately. 

When we get to the park and find a secluded area to talk, she says that she is apologizing for the last time, and that she thinks that if this was something she wanted to save, she would feel differently. She said how she wants to travel and be free, to be young and carefree, and to not have to worry about my feelings or consider me if she were to go on a long trip out of the country. I was pretty confused as we had discussed similar things before and I have always expressed my support. 

Eventually she says that it is unfair to both of us to have a relationship where she doesn't love me anymore, and that it is better to end it. I say some mean things about how she is selfish and that she doesn't consider other people's feelings, and then she says that it is just mine she doesn't consider. Everyone else she cares about and is compassionate towards. I am in disbelief at this point, as she returns my house key and leaves. I say that I will wait at the park for an hour in case she changes her mind, because I don't believe it, this has to be some kind of cruel trick, of course she will come back. Eventually I go home and cry some more, reaching out to some of my friends from school as I have pretty much no one left. 

Yesterday I remember that when we were 17, we made a promise to each other that if it didn't work out romantically between us, that we wouldn't let it stop us from being best friends, as her previous two breakups had ended up in non-speaking relationships. I texted her this, and that as painful as it was, I intend to try to keep my promise. Today she is coming to drop off my things and pick hers up, and I have been thinking through every possible way this could happen. Losing my girlfriend of five and a half years is enough, losing my best friend at the same time is too tragic. I realize and agree that it isn't the best thing for me to be in a relationship with someone who feels so differently about me than I do about her, and that she probably made the right decision if that's truly how she feels.

The past two days since them have felt like a bad dream, almost surreal, as for the past five and a half years we have been constantly texting and in contact. I feel like a part of me has been cut away.

She is on reddit and is a pretty active lurker in this sub, so if you're reading this and feel as though I've misrepresented anything that happened, feel free to comment and clarify. And know that you are truly my best friend in this world, and I don't want to lose you.

TLDR: (my first) Girlfriend of 5.5 years fell out of love with me and broke up, feels like a bad dream and not real life. She is picking up her stuff today and I don't know what to say to her, as I feel like I can't lose her from my life. How do I go on? "
91slzs,1,2018-07-25,Moving to Australia me 21f (NL) and 23m (NZ) I'm a bit scared,gustwalker,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/91slzs/moving_to_australia_me_21f_nl_and_23m_nz_im_a_bit/,"TL;DR me and boyfriend are together for 6 months, he is from the other side of the world (where I had a 6 month internship) and moved to me for 3 months 2 weeks ago. It's been great so far. He has a job offer in Aus (October) wants me to move to him. Scared but also great opportunity. 


Hi guys, me and, let's call him Dan, are together for a few months now and had our fair share of ups and a little downs because of the stress of a LDR. I visited his country for 6 months, met him 1+1=2 and I fell in love. Not handy at all but hey! It was and still is amazing. We have a few differences and argue sometimes but he can talk very well (still learning to) and has had an 8 year relationship before me. Me on the other hand has had 3 relationships of 4 months and my last relationship was 1 year but he was 28 (different life goals). I've never been in a really long relationship since after 3 months or so we don't seemed compatible or I got very irritated, but not with this guy. I just like almost everything about him and he is super sweet. I just need to say to him I need to talk about something with you (about thoughts mostly) and he goes from a joking state to serious. It's been fantastic. I was there for him when he got to my country( NL ) and supporting him and showing him my life I had here is amazing. We talk alot and make a lot of effort for eachother. All my friends like him and say I've changed in a more relaxing state of myself. I'm very happy.

Now the thing..

He has a job offer in Aus set at October. We talk alot so ofc also about this. I just graduated but it was always on the big plan i would do another study of 4 years to get a better pay in the end (3500+ in stead of 2500+). I'm not very happy about those 4 years. I've done a lot of working and internships so I know what I like and what not. I'm a designing furniture maker btw. The next step would be teaching or product design. Dan completely supports me but we both know a LDR is killing for us. It wasn't easy to keep things going and feeling very connected on such a distance.


My mother was from Australia (she died 10 years ago) and I still have family there. Dan would like me to come with him after I worked here for a bit to get some more money and be there for Christmas. I am super thrilled since I don't feel at home anymore since my travels and my country is in almost every expect boring since NZ. I feel the NL is an inbetween station and I would love to see if Australia could be it for us/Me. (He also applied for just in NL and works in him visa here so aus was plan B)


We live together with my dad now and things go well. I have my motorbike and he learns every day. I'm just scared. I've never had a long secure relationship that was so life changing but I like myself more with him (example) since we do more things outside. He is that extra push against my lazy thoughts sometimes haha. I don't want to rely on him in AUS so I want to find my own goals again and work up to them. Find a job or do a study there or a course. I'm just scared since I've never had it like this and if we want it to work we have to take the leap. 


It's a stressful thought sometimes but every time I look at him it's okay. I'm an overthinker and some times it's just a bit much. This is also more just to type it off. I know things are going fast and I have been in a fast situation before that wasn't good so I know this one is. Still the fear of losing it all keeps me from fully going in to the leap to another country to actually start building in. 


I don't know if it's my countious that tells me watch it or my trust issues because of prev relationships. I thinks it's rational to think like this but man he just flew 24 hours to be with me here for 3 months. If I needed more prove than that to know he takes this seriously and also left his whole life as an engineer behind.


I'm just interested in your opinions like the older people in here (NL)say study, it's a romance it will go away or it will stay on if you are meant to be together ldr or not. Other people my age and everyone I talked about it with in nz (also family ) say do it. It's a chance and you can always come back and do that study later if you want to."

91tpys,44,2018-07-25,How Financial Services are Like Secret MLMs [LONG],SFSisScam,antiMLM,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/91tpys/how_financial_services_are_like_secret_mlms_long/,"While I’m sure many of us are familiar with popular MLM companies (Plexus, LLR, Amway, Herbalife, etc.), there’s another, similar phenomenon that occurs under a guise that is much more difficult to spot: financial advising. Those who work in the finance industry all graduated college with at least one friend who went to work as a “financial advisor” for Northwestern Mutual, Edward Jones (to a lesser extent), or a similar financial services company know exactly what I’m talking about. While I’m not sure what to call these, I’ll simply refer to them as “Sketchy Financial Services,” or “SFSs” from now on.

SFSs love to prey upon shiny, young college students who are sophomores or even younger, offering them internships at their well-known, incredibly-respected financial companies. These recruiters lure their bait in with professional-looking seals, rich company histories, talk of lavish conferences, and very professional, well-respective work environments. Did you know that Magic Johnson hosted the most recent Northwestern Mutual conference??? The first red flag here is that these companies do not only target students majoring in finance, but ones majoring in marketing or management as well, which isn’t inherently bad, but it seems to suggest that they aren’t too exclusive with whom they hire.

Upon arriving at their new internship, these students are force-fed kool-aid from a firehose. In a [ fantastic reddit post that everyone should read](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/4tc2f0/working_at_northwestern_mutual_wall_of_text/) detailing the experience interns and new hires can expect at an SFS firm (Northwestern Mutual), /u/nugrape explains how these interns are pressed about “who they know” as early as the first interview in an effort to see how many insurance sales the company can squeeze out of this potential new hire. /u/nugrape further explains that the interview process comes across as very rigorous, despite most interviews being a shoo-in for the position, just to add to the perceived prestige of the company. Following these interviews, the new hires are instructed how to sell insurance using a tried-and-true sales pitch, and are told that they can make upwards of $60k in just a few months! Next, you meet your “joint-work partner,” an employee who is a veteran of the company, a mentor…who takes half of your commission. Sounds a bit like a downline, huh? The MLM similarities don’t end there, however, as new hires are forced not only to contact every family member or friend in their contacts to solicit insurance, but they are also encouraged to inquire about the networks of those family and friends. Like, “Hey, can I unwarrantedly solicit life insurance to you? How about your family? You got any friends I can try to sell this to?” Cold calling friends and family to solicit unwanted products eventually can damage or even ruin relationships, as these connections are now seen as opportunities to make a sale instead of friends and family. Similar to MLM networking, new hires are brought on for their potential sales network, not their actual skills as salespeople or financial advisors.

“Now, OP,” you might say. “This is simply how sales work. SFSs are selling a legitimate product in life insurance, and plenty of sales positions rely on commission-based compensation. Why is this a bad thing?” It’s simple: these life insurance policies are garbage, and I want to make sure you hear this one thing if you don’t read anything else I’ve written: [**WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE IS A SCAM.**](https://momanddadmoney.com/why-whole-life-insurance-is-a-bad-investment/). Do all the research in the world on this if you don’t believe me, but it’s illiquid, far more costly than alternatives (term life insurance), undiversified, and salesmen of these SFSs target young adults who have literally no need for a life insurance policy at all, let alone a whole life insurance. There is no need for you to get life insurance if you have no dependents. None. These salesmen may draw up a scenario where you die and your family can’t afford your funeral or your significant other is left homeless on the streets without your financial support. This is a weak fear-mongering tactic designed to appeal to your emotions, and you shouldn’t fall for it. In addition to peddling these policies, these SFSs employees also offer financial advising services, so they (smart, rich, savvy) can help you (poor, financially illiterate, helpless) control your finances! How sweet of them! As I’m sure you can guess, these *totally unbiased* (/s) financial advisors strongly recommend their own products to you, as they’re still salesmen, even if they’re wearing a “financial advisor” hat. If your financial advisor is employed by an insurance company, they’re not truly a fiduciary for you. This is the equivalent of hiring Coca-Cola salesman to recommend soft drinks to you or a Ford salesman to recommend muscle cars to you.

Anyway, I hope you learned about why working for a SFS is a scam, similar to traditional MLMs and why you yourself should not give business to these companies. If you’re a college student reading this, I urge you to look up reviews on whichever internships you’re considering. If you’re a young adult, I urge you to consider why you would need life insurance at all if you’re single or if you have a significant other/spouse who would not be financially destitute in the event of your death. If you’re reading this at all, I would urge you not to aid these companies and allow them to take advantage of your network, and I would encourage everyone to **do research before you take out any insurance policy.**

I should say that you shouldn’t refuse to work with any financial advisors or stay away from any companies that will help you smartly invest your money. Just make sure you know the intentions of anyone you hire to give you financial advice. Additionally, there are legitimate careers to be made at SFSs (even Northwestern Mutual), just as people make legitimate careers selling Plexus or Herbalife, but it’s just such a small minority of employees that truly prosper.

91v8xl,5,2018-07-25,"Help to find funding for last semester of school. Federal Loans, grants, scholarships have fallen through. Minimal to no family support.",StarkeyWombat,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/91v8xl/help_to_find_funding_for_last_semester_of_school/,"Hey guys, I’m in a bit of a tight spot at the moment and need help figuring a way out of it. I’m a college student in South Carolina who is attending his final semester of college in August and am set to graduate in December. I’m not great at putting my thoughts into words but I’ll do the best I can and hopefully you guys will understand.

Up until today I’ve had enough money to support myself financially through the end of the year, provided that I receive the same amount of money through federal loans and grants as I have every year. I’ve taken multiple semesters off of school to go work a well paying internship to pay for my living expenses each year. I don’t have any financial support from my parents, as every conversation always ends with how I should’ve worked harder or done exactly as they say as they say it, or this, or that (it’s a rather controlling and emotionally abusive situation which is neither here nor there, but I thought it might be important to include). The bottom line is every penny I’ve spent as far as tuition or living expenses are concerned has either been earned by me or provided through grants, scholarships, and federal loans.

Here’s where the problem is. Like I said, up until today my budget was planned out and I would have enough money to make it through the end of the year, at which point I would find a full time job and begin earning money as an adult does. This was all assuming I receive the same amount of financial aid as I always do. Unfortunately, according to FAFSA I’ve reached the maximum borrowable limit for direct loans. To make matters worse, my income from the 2017 internship has made me ineligible for the need-based grant funding, Pell Grant, and Federal Work Study Program (according to my financial aid supervisor at college).

After asking my financial aid supervisor if there were any other grants that I’m applicable or other methods of getting the money for tuition, she informed me that my two options are a Federal Parent Plus Loan or a private loan. I’ve applied for a private loan and naturally I was denied without a cosigner. I asked my parents to cosign and I’m still dealing with the fallout. The gist is that since I haven’t done everything they’ve said to do financially for the last 5 years (mind you I’ve managed my own finances to get where I am today) that I don’t deserve a cosign and they refuse to do it. That being said, that means the Federal Parent Plus Loan is also out.

So there’s all the background information. Here’s the numbers I have to deal with right now. Note that I typically try to over budget as much as reasonably possible so I don’t put myself in a worse situation than I started in. I’ve also tried to give myself a 3 month buffer for living expenses in the worst case scenario that I don’t have a job lined up at the end of the year.

**Savings/Checking/Credit:**

Saving Account: $496.69

Checking Account: $8,648.03

Credit: $1,500 credit limit, currently 100% paid off.

**Automotive Information:**

Car: 2012 Honda Civic

Auto Loan: $7,163.90

Auto Insurance: $94.12 / month

**Monthly Expenses**:

Misc. Spending: $150

Groceries:  $150

Gas:    $80

Rent:   $415

Car Payment:  $277.10

Electricity:  $50

Water:   $30

Car Insurance:  $94.12  (as stated above)

Dental Insurance: $21

Miscellaneous: $300

**One Time Expenses:**

Tuition:   $8,075

Textbooks:  $500

**Requested Loan Amount:**

$13,000

**Justification:**

I’ve included a monthly $300 Misc. value in my budget from August through December because I want to over budget this as much as reasonably possible given that I don’t have any parental support if things don’t work out. It will also give me a 3 month buffer window in the worst case scenario that I don’t have a job lined up at the end of December. If i’ve included all of the values correctly, this would put me somewhere around $1,760 left over at the end of March. To further justify the $300/month value, I have two dentists appointments coming up at about $250 each, a small low-maintenance dog with a $200 appointment coming up, and two weddings I need a suit for in the fall as one of the groomsmen for both. The remaining money would be a further buffer/emergency fund.

**Other Information:**

My lease is a one-year lease. Without getting into it, it was the best option for me given my living conditions/relationships and financial ability. Other options for 6-month leases would’ve been more expensive short term.

If I seem to have left anything out or you guys need additional information, just let me know. I’ve been throwing numbers around in my budget while I write this so if any of the values don’t check out for the information I’ve given then I’ll do my best to correct it. Hopefully I put it all into an understandable format. What I’m looking for is other potential means by which I can pay for my tuition this fall, how I can better my budget, maybe any advice on reducing my auto loan if that’s a thing (my knowledge of financial management extends as far as numbers, not so much on terminology, loopholes, way to reduce auto-loans/payments, etc).

Thanks again for any help that can be given.

Edit1: Removed repetitious information.

Edit2: I'm studying Computer Engineering.  The plan is to have a job with a base pay of at least $60k so the main concern getting through the fall and earning the degree to do so."

91vl0f,1,2018-07-25,My S/O[22/F] is having workplace and roommate issues and it's getting out of hand for me[24/M] to deal with,kn49,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/91vl0f/my_so22f_is_having_workplace_and_roommate_issues/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 and a half years. Things have been mostly good, with some rough patches here and there-- more so lately however. She had a falling out a year ago with her crazy, abusive parents after they tried to kidnap her, when they found out that I was dating her. Their reasoning: I wasn't in the same caste system as them(we're both Indian).  Along with that, she's had roommate issues with her college roommates. Apparently, they shut her out of discussions, talk shit, make passive aggressive comments, and blame any dirt/mess/issues in the apartment on her even though she is a pretty clean person and doesn't try to start shit with anyone. It ended up in her refusing to pay utilities for the last month of her living there after she tried to work things out with them. As a result of these and other experiences that involve some sort of drama regarding not getting along with people, she automatically sees the worst in people and has evolved into a cynical, skeptical personality. She doesn't want to share an apartment room with people anymore because she thinks something bad will happen for instance.

**What's going on right now at work:** I got her a job at my previous company with the same boss that I had, as a marketing intern with the occasional full time hours, following graduation. Initially, he was seemingly nice to her and took on the role of a mentor, but the CEO of the company apparently started cracking down on interns/ new hires, and on the first day, asked my boss if she's qualified for the role without even giving her a chance to prove herself. The CEO is kind of an asshole/moody, and apparently he was salty that he wasn't told about her hiring. He is also known to be sexist towards women, so that might explain the distrust. As a result, her boss, feeling pressured from above, started distrusting her and it looks like she's been working for 2 months, but he doesn't allow her to take on greater responsibility, cut her hours during the week from 35 to 24, gets angry if she doesn't predict what he's thinking etc. For instance, the other day, he was mad that she changed the title of some customer marketing campaign email to that of a previous email title(these things are semi-recycled for different campaigns) that was approved, and that she should have asked him first before making the change. At the same time, when she did take a cautious approach and ask him before making decisions, he claims that she isn't taking ownership and should be more confident in her decisions. Apparently, nothing she does seems to please him and I can't figure out if she might actually be doing something wrong/not getting the big picture of her job, or if it is genuinely a problem with him. I never seemed to encounter any issues with the boss when I worked under him, other than the occasional disagreements that most normal people have with their boss from time to time. I told her to quit the job if it is so bad, but because she has no financial fall back(due to the parent situation), she feels that she has nowhere to go and even with her 8k in savings, she doesn't feel like she can survive if she quits. I told her to talk to the boss about it, but she claims that it is futile because he talks over her, and due to a stubborn personality, won't even acknowledge her points. She mentions that when she makes a decision, she tries to explain her thought process but he doesn't seem to get it. 

I'm pretty fed up with this situation- she complains about it for an hour EVERY day, and I told her it's too much and we shouldn't dwell over it so much, but apparently that makes me insensitive and uncaring about her situation. I've tried offering suggestions and being more optimistic/evaluating exit options, but she still gets very upset about it all the time. 

**Roommates:** Currently, she is subletting from some university students close to her work. She claims that, although they are better than her previous roommates in college, they also seemingly exclude her from things and talk shit too apparently, but can't understand why. Apparently, she's tried being nice and making conversation, and is usually clean but one of the roommates sent a passive aggressive group text telling everyone to clean their dishes-- she thinks it's a slight at her for not cleaning one of her pots immediately after use. She thinks her college roommate situation will repeat itself, and that they're going to hold back her security deposit or screw her over financially at some point-- again, coming back to the skepticism/cynicism. I told her that they're not going to take such drastic measures, and if she hasn't done anything egregiously wrong as a roommate and cleans her dishes in front of them, she shouldn't worry about that happening. However, it appears very difficult and nearly impossible to convince her otherwise.

I should also mention that we are both in a long distance relationship currently, about a few hours apart from each other by drive which has made communication a bit more difficult. I feel bad for her, I really do- for everything that has happened, but I can't help but wonder if this theme of drama, frustration and inability to maintain proper relationships with her coworkers, friends, roommates etc is going to continue forever and be a prevalent theme in our relationship. It's starting to be too much to handle, and I question whether it is worth staying in the relationship sometimes with someone that can't seem to avoid this magnitude of problems. I need help, suggestions, advice-- how do I deal with this situation? Should I talk to her boss about it, or is that unprofessional? I told her we need to tone down the negativity and approach everything with a more resolute, positive mindset but that makes me sound insensitive and dismissive. Is it bad if I dump someone that I've been dating for so long, who basically no longer has a family because of our relationship(which I think would have happened regardless of us dating)? It's hard for me to do, because at some point in the day she will come back to me and profess how much she loves me/do something cute so I can't tell if this is just clingy behavior in case she has fear of abandonment or something.

My parents know I’m behind but not te full extent of it. I’ve been lying massively to them for the past year. I’ve also not passed a single exam in the past year.

I think I’m depressed, I can’t seem to study without giving in to distractions, I always procrastinate and when the exam nears I panic, try to study more but fail, and in the end I don’t show up at the exam (curiously enough, I’ve never failed an exam: mostly I just don’t go). 

Also, 2 out of 4 exams I passed was more due to luck than preparation. 

I started lying to cover up a failure, telling myself I could make up for it along the way, but then i couldn’t pass any more exam so the cover up lies became more and more, and I don’t know what to do

My parents love me but I’m ashamed of myself. 

I’m almost 23 and I don’t know what to do with my life, really 
Medicine was a lifelong passion of mine and I still like it but the amount of study it requires seems to be out of my league. I’ve never studied much in middle or high school either 

I have an exam tomorrow I tried to do last July, then couldn’t finish the program. I tried in September with the same result. I planned to take it on January/February and the same occurred, with months in between where I did basically nothing all day (I live far from home to attend university) 
Same thing in April, and the same is happening now and I’m scared shitless 
My colleagues know that I’m behind and are trying to be supportive, as is my girlfriend who is the only one who knows everything about all this, but I’m really unable to do anything. 

I’m scared my parents would ask me to see my online exam record. I’m scared I’ll have to face the truth someday. I’m scared I’m not made to study like this since I can’t seem to succeed at it

91vvxz,5,2018-07-25,Machine Learning and Materials Science,Dobix,neuralnetworks,https://www.reddit.com/r/neuralnetworks/comments/91vvxz/machine_learning_and_materials_science/,"To begin with, I am quite new to working with neural networks. I studied materials engineering and currently doing a master ‘s degree on materials science. I am about to conclude an internship where I was given a goal to develop a neural network which can interpret X-Ray Fluorescence spectra and identify elements present in a sample. I had absolutely zero prior knowledge on machine learning, and limited experience on coding in general, so this internship definitely was fascinating for me. After messing around quite a lot with conventional nets, I ended up having success with convolutional nets on this task.

I definitely would like to dig deeper into neural nets, and machine learning in general, especially into applications thereof in materials science. I have been using Keras with Tensorflow backend during my internship. Any recommendations on what my next step should be? I am in particular interesting in learning more about RNN/LSTM’s and Decision Trees, my dilemma is that I find the papers difficult to read through because of my limited background on computer science and its vocabulary, so I’ve been trying to find a healthy equilibrium between papers and blogs.

Any recommendations on thorough books on machine learning? When I ask this question to my  friends studying computer science, they usually refer me to some websites with tutorials and so on (like Kaggle), but maybe because of my background in physics, I really prefer reading well structured books/pdfs instead of going through tutorials/blogs.

Hope I’ve made myself clear, I’d appreciate any direction you can give me :)"

This is hilariously ironic because I never saw myself ever going to TAMU. My dad is an die-hard longhorn and he even raised me to hate aggies. 
Now that I am older, I realize TAMU is a great university that has lots to offer.  
I guess I will just suffer from my dad teasing me with his dad jokes about Aggies. (27-25!!!) All jokes aside, my dad will support me no matter what college I go to. 
If you are wondering, why not go to UT? Well, I'd love to go to UT but UT is overwhelmingly competitive especially for the Computer Science department.
I'm thinking about going to UTSA but honestly my heart is set on TAMU. 

Anyways, I have a few questions regarding TAMU. 
1. Is this a good school for Computer Science and Cyber Security?
2. If I was in the Corps of Cadets, would I be able to do internships in the summers?
3. Is the Corps of Cadets harder on women? (Yes, I am a girl)
4. Is it easy to make friends at TAMU? 
5. Is it true that the aggie job network is stronger than UT?
6. Is there good scholarship opportunities?

I'm half FtM and half bisexual (I say Lesbian, but I have a boyfriend but he's the ONLY guy I'll EVER be with)...I'm still trying to figure it out, but I feel comfortable talking with you guys. You all are supportive and I need that right now...

I weigh 352# and I'm 5'4"". I was going to do Keto, but I've decided that I'd rather just eat clean and do CrossFit. Problem being I'm 352# lol. I have arthritis, compressed disc in L4-L5 and L5-S1 so my back throbs all the time. I've heard good things from other people that have had this type of injury do great in CrossFit. I discussed this with my doctor at length and he thinks I would do great at Keto and CrossFit, but he also agrees that since I love fruit and vegetables that as long as I eat plenty and less all that other stuff that I should do great. I'm also cutting out my food intolerant foods. IgE says allergic to them, but he wants to see a difference in me at my 6th month check up coming up in October/November; even if it is only a few pounds. I told him I'd do my best. 

Now here comes my problem...my boyfriend of 10 years. He doesn't want me to get too skinny. He likes fat chics, he's ok with me losing weight, but he doesn't want me to get toned and buff. Probably thinks I'll leave him for someone else. That's not going to happen. I do love him. But I feel like if I lose weight then he won't like me and it makes me not want to workout. I get anxious over it and give up. I want to look hot for myself and he wants me to stay hot for him too and we can't agree on a common ground. He absolutely does not like toned abs, but he's ok with toned arms and legs lol weird fellow. But I don't want to lose him and I don't want to end our relationship we're working on 10 years and they've been pretty good years. So dumping his butt is out of the question. I'm hoping when I get to where I want he'll just be ok with it. 

Where I need help is, is there anyone in the San Marcos-Austin, TX region who could use a workout partner or buddy? I do I suck at starting. Once I start I love it, but it'll take me a month to get to where I like it I'm sure cuz it's going to hurt real bad at first. Some days I'd like to phone a friend and get some supportive talk too. I'll reciprocate whenever you'd want or need it. Some days I'm not going to be doing good eating wise. I'm a broke ass college student who doesn't get any financial aid money so what I eat is what I get from my family and they aren't the best at shopping, but there's 5 of us and only about $300 in groceries for a month so we have to get cheap meals which means processed garbage a lot. You wouldn't believe how many times we've had bunless hot dogs for dinner. We are on a hamburger kick right now box of 40 premade burgers from Sams Club $25. $4.00 for 48 buns. That's four meals. Yes we are big eaters. I will be cutting down and drinking more water (I hate water). But until I do get my internship going (August/September) I can't do too much in food yet. Then I will be able to get my own groceries for at least a semester. 

If I am granted an aid appeal I will be getting my boyfriend and I a place to live and then we will have $300 for groceries a month for just the two of us which will be much better, but I won't know until around September. Sorry this is longer than I wanted. I just wanted to give you the basics of things.

Edit: I just told him he just gonna have to get used to the body I want. He said “fine” then smiled. So that’s nice to hear and see. "

She’s gone a while without set, and on most of her sets she likes to have some fun. She tries to find someone to have that fun with, and eventually deciding on your character.

You can be anything from a young intern, an older producer, a middle aged cameraman, or anything in between. I also like the idea of your character not being perfectly handsome, maybe average or a bit below average, the celebrity just wanting someone to have a good time with. 

If you want I’m willing to play yep ladies who look for someone to have fun with together, but I’d also love if you played two guys that the celebrity decides to have fun with. 

Kinks involved are anal, spanking, rough, sloppy oral, dp, group, light drug use (just weed), dirty talk and unique positions (Eiffel tower, Piledriver, against the wall, one leg standing, held up, etc.)

Limits are blood, gore, scat, piss, bestiality, noncon and impregnation

Below is the list of celebrities I'm willing to play:

Well, either way, I have got a ton for you! It's been a while since the last update, partially due to working two jobs and an internship in Costa Rica, but I finally got it updated and there's a fair amount of new content to boot! 

The list is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndertaleAUs/comments/91ruxq/curated_fan_fiction_list_part_1/).
-

For the newcomers, this is a curated (by me) list of fan fiction separated roughly by type and tagged with a few important content warnings. In addition, every entry has a short blurb by me, or a summary of the author's summary if I feel it does a fair enough job and I don't have much to add. 

It should be noted, this list is curated only by me, and I'm not trying to document and read all fan fiction or anything like that. That means that many of the entries are there based on my own personal tastes. For instance, there's a good amount of Charisk fics (all labeled so you can easily avoid them), and few sans-centric fics. I think like 2 or 3 sans/reader ones despite their prevalence on the actual archives.

Regardless, the pick tags are handed out fairly carefully, so find yourself a finished fic with no **[R]** tag and a **[C]** tag if you want to get started somewhere.

ONE LAST THING!
-
Please be SURE to Kudos, comment, rate, review, or whatever the fics you read. I do not exaggerate at all when I say that comments save lives and bring fics back from the dead. Authors like getting kudos, and they love it a lot more when you take the time to leave some written feedback or even just a quick blurb saying you like it!

Most of the cases you see in Karma Court are of Redditors acting boorishly, rudely, or disingenuously. But I bring to you a case of someone who, in a demonstration of unadulterated haughtiness and arrogance, posted OC that is so good it ought to be illegal.

On July 23, 2018, u/Thomilo44 made an innocuous post to r/sbubby [cleverly corrupting the Netflix logo](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/91bg55/its_true_and_you_know_it/).

In response, u/Thomilo44 claimed [they would actually make the meme deReluctantKing suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/sbubby/comments/91bg55/its_true_and_you_know_it/e2yipgi/). Had u/Thomilo44 let it stay there, this would have been a mundane case of bamboozlement, not worth taking to anything more than small claims court. But then, on July 24, 2018, u/Thomilo44 did something unthinkable.

How in God's good Earth are we supposed to get any karma after u/Thomilo44 thoughtlessly moved the bar for quality content so stratospherically far above our heads!?

91xkfh,21,2018-07-25,My whole life is a lie with my parents,athejme,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/91xkfh/my_whole_life_is_a_lie_with_my_parents/,"I am from the middle east (will not specify the country). The UN brought us to canada montreal in 2001 when i was around 11-12 years old. i have very strict parents that are very religion and Arabic culture oriented. Obviously with time i started to have friends in school, learn the language, learn about the western world and live with them and be like them meanwhile  taking into consideration my background, my culture and my religion. 

Like all kids, they want to go out, have friends, go play outside with friends, this was not an option for us because my parents were scared we have “white people” friends because we don’t share same culture or religion and scared we my and my twin brother get influenced by them.. so all my childhood was either full time school, or all summer at home..  they didn’t even think about taking us outside and entertain us. Every time i ask my parents to go out to play with friends, it a No.. we were very innocent, we ask our parents for their approval for anything we want to do. For example in high school my friends want to go eat outside on lunch time, so me and my twin literally go ask my parents the day before if we can do that and go eat somewhere with friends and as usual it is a no. this was pretty much my childhood.

In the end of the second year in high school, my friends planned to go hangout after the final exam in a computer store to play Counter strike. I start thinking if i should ask my parents if i can go with my friends without asking my parents or no. And oh by the way, my dad is suppose to pick me up after the exam. I decided to go with my friends and not tell my dad. It was very stressful situation and i was very nervous to take such decision. So that day came, i was thinking about that during the exam the whole time. I finished the exam and technically i had to call my dad to tell him that my exam is finished so he can come pick me up. But i didn’t call him and I went with my friends. I didn’t think what gonna happen if he comes and wait for me and doesn’t find me. I was so worried though the whole time and it was not fun at all. The time pass and all i see is 2 hours passed by . The adrenaline kicked and i left the store running without knowing where to go. I was able to find a public phone and I called my dad with fear. This was the craziest moment in my life at the age. I ran to a public telephone and called my dad, to know i don’t know what to know about. I guess i called him to tell him i am alive i guess. He was yelling at me asking me where i was and he has been waiting and worried. I told him where i was and he came to pick me up but i didn’t tell him where did i go. I told him i was with a friend that they know (it makes it a little bit less worse because he was from the same country as mine). After that i knew that if i wanna do something like that, i need to plan it better to not be caught. 

I have skipped classes to be able to go hangout with friends because as i mentioned i was never allowed to hang out with friends. With time i was able to master lying and do whatever i want. I got so good at it that even my friend cant believe how i do it. When i want to plan something, i really take the time to think about it, to think what are the scenarios that i might face and what can i tell them for every single scenario!! In the age of 21 in 2012, i decided to buy a car. I had a student job in the airport and i felt i was able to afford a nice car. My parents didn’t want me to have a car at that age. I took my time to look around and visite dealerships and i end up buying a toyota corolla XRS 2010. I financed it obviously. All this without them knowing and i was able to hide the car for 2 YEARS! I felt so free because i could go anywhere everywhere without struggling with the busses and metros and the weather. When i decided to tell them, i had a good opportunity to tell them because i needed a car for my internship (civil engineering). So i took advantage of the opportunity to tell them i needed a car because otherwise i will not be able to get my internship. (I needed to visite construction site using my car and the company didn’t offer car or a truck). So i told my parents that i JUST bought a car and i need it for my internship...

It got so bad that i had a girlfriend and they didn’t know about her until she forced me to tell them and everything got screwed up and we broke up.
I was lying almost every weekend and everyday to be able to go hangout with friends. I tell them that i go work but i dont.. this is not the only thing, my parents are so controlling and hard to deal with and whatever they say must be done otherwise i am a bad son. I am a horrible son that doesn’t care about their parents. It was that way that they were able to control my twin brother that he was never able to do what i did. Imagine,  lying almost everyday to be able to do what i need to do and what i want to do to have that freedom that i never had. Now i have a girlfriend for about a year and a half and they have no clue about that. We see each other everyday until 9PM and when i get back home, i tell them i was at work because i was working far since i have construction sites. I really do but not that far that i get back home at 9pm

We are planning to move together in an apparement in 3 weeks and i told my parents that i am traveling for work for a while. My girlfriend understand very well whats happening because she went through the same thing. We knew each other since high school and we were best friends since that time.
So yeah, here is my life, double life filled with lies and it makes me sad because i always wished i am able to be open with my parents and have my choices respected . But unfortunately it isn’t the case

I forgot to mention, my parents were able to have 2 other kids, so i have a brother and sister. My sister is around 11 and my little brother is around 9
I wonder what gonna happen in their case when they grow up. It makes me scared about their future with such parents!!"

91y5nm,3,2018-07-25,How to calculate rate of elimination for methamphetamine?,cookiethumper88,AskDrugNerds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDrugNerds/comments/91y5nm/how_to_calculate_rate_of_elimination_for/,"Hello, I'm looking for some verification and wondering if you could help me out, I'm not too sure if this an acceptable post.  I was calculating the half life with peak plasma concentrations (I'm sorry I may be doing or saying this totally wrong). 
What I've found through source -
Half life of methamphetamine ~12 hours 
20 mg of methamphetamine with peak plasma concentration at 0.0526 mg/L at 2.5 (+/- 0.5 hrs) hours
[Source:] https://books.google.ca/books?id=OWFiVaDZnkQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=vd+of+methamphetamine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=59wOXfy6BG&amp;sig=Rv2CMhonm2Ch7EHaF9XEP_0C8F0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjWwqbB_7XcAhUHHjQIHUkKDDYQ6AEwBXoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vd%20of%20methamphetamine&amp;f=false

The only thing I would change is the amount I used - 100 mg not 20 mg
Which if I did this correctly converted to 263 nanograms/ml and not 52.6 nanograms/ml. 

I already did the drug test but because I take prescribed dextroamphetamine and bupropion, they sent it to the lab for further confirmation testing.  

This pre-employment test was for a mechanical engineering internship.  I didn't think they would call me back so soon with an offer otherwise I wouldn't have done it (I got drunk at a wedding and I didn't want to be drunk anymore).

I scheduled the test for Friday at 14:30 which gave me approximately 132 hours of no drug use (even my prescription up until Friday morning, that's when I took my medication) 

Drank copious amounts of water, did my usual 30 minutes of jogging per day and two played baseball games. 

Overall I just want to put my mind at ease as this is giving me some anxiety not knowing. Any of your knowledge and insight would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!

You love the way they're so overawed by your status. So eager and greedy for fame and recognition. So easy to manipulate.

I'm dressed somewhat plainly compared to most of my peers. along skirt falls to my ankles, obscuring my lower body from view. A thick blazer covers my top, rising to my throat and putting plenty of loose fabric to obscure the curve of my breasts. My blonde hair is knotted behind my head.

You'll fix that soon enough. My good sized bust, slim waist, and smooth legs will soon be on display for everyone.

The others cast me jealous looks when I'm chosen to be your assistant. If only they knew what lay in store for me...

Corrupt me; change me from a sensibly dressed intern to your scantily clad dress up slut who revels in the lustful gazes of others.

I want this to be mainly focused around exhibitionism and corruption, but I'm pretty open to ANYTHING else you want to add. Steering towards extreme (beast, snuff, etc.) can be fun, but definitely not a requirement or even preferred. 

Some other things I enjoy are being given piercings (especially through my nipples), being collared/leashed (maybe the leash can hook through those nipple rings?), impregnation, and being sold/auctioned/whored to be used by others

91yoyj,9,2018-07-25,I seriously need help on how to settle my first car accident. (CAN),serendipitty,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/91yoyj/i_seriously_need_help_on_how_to_settle_my_first/,"Hi everyone. I'm 21 and currently intern at a company. I was involved in my first car accident 2 weeks ago. Someone scratched my parked car in the parking lot while I was not at the site - they waited until I came by. He was an employee of the company in his 40s. He explained what happened and we decided to settle it without getting insurance involved. We agreed that I would get an estimate for the damages the next day and he would e-transfer the money.  I told my parents what happened and they were glad it wasn't too serious. We thought it would be settled by the next day. But things didn't turn out as simple as we thought. 

The estimate came out to be about $1500. I sent a copy of the documents to him and he called me immediately. He complained it was too expensive and (literally) begged to just settle with $1000. I called my mechanic and luckily she said she could manage to repair it for about $1000 but we wouldn't be able to get a rental car. After a long discussion with my parents, we decided that we could just settle for $1000. I call him back to tell him our decision. And then, guess what - apparently he had a vacation planned starting that night and wouldn't be back until today. My mom told me to let him take his vacation and then we can discuss it afterwards... which brings us to today. 

He called us saying that $1000 is now too expensive and starts bargaining with us. He first starts at $200, then $500, then $800. I firmly told him no, we agreed on $1000. I had zero fault in the accident and it wouldn't be fair to pay out of my own pocket. And NOW he says that he refuses to pay $1000 and wants us to open insurance claims. I am now very angry at how this whole situation turned out, and frustrated at how naive I was... I seriously feel like an idiot. I didn't take any pictures of the accident site that day and there were no witnesses around. My boyfriend was with me, but he didn't witness the accident. How would opening an insurance claim turn out for my situation now, especially considering it's been over 2 weeks since the accident and I have zero evidence? I'm really anxious about this whole situation and would like some advice on what to do. Thank you in advance.

I’m about to enter my last year of college and will exit with over $160k of debt in a creative field. I’ve become increasingly anxious and panicked about what kind of job I can get to even continue to live in a big city. I’m already broke because I just have not been able to land a job or internship throughout my summer break. I applied for jobs throughout the past three months pretty frequently and either never heard back or was told an applicant had been picked before my interview could commence. I recently got a part time job for a bakery but my work won’t commence until September. 

I have a $10k investment for my business and thesis year which I’m also stressing about because I want to make sure I utilize it in a way that allows me to build a profitable future. I even got studio space to keep all my materials and for me to work on projects, just for my studio mate to bail on me three months into a year lease. 

To add to this, I recently moved into an apartment by myself which was a ridiculously more expensive place than my last place. I only did this to escape living with my toxic significant other, who tore down my sanity throughout our 16 month lease. Now I feel like I’m falling out of love with him, but I also have some some deep trauma bonds that confuse the shit out of me. I’ve been conflicted about this for over 2 months and just feel trapped. 

My actual family is lowkey mess because my parents relationship is slowly deteriorating and my youngest sister [f/13] is beginning to notice. My middle sister [f/19] is going through her own struggle of dealing with a PCOS diagnosis and takes her anger out on everyone. If she isn’t happy, no one can be. Going home is a sure way to be in another toxic environment. 

I feel like I’m stuck mentally, emotionally and physically, and that I suddenly can’t even handle my responsibilities. I’m so paranoid about the future that everyday I wake up feeling like there’s a golf ball in my throat. My muscles are tense all day; my trap and shoulder muscles almost never relax nor can I get them to. I’ll sit at home all day long feeling so demotivated that sometimes I don’t even have the will to take my dog outside. Other than her walks, I often won’t even go outside. 

Sometimes it will feel like the paranoia is taking over my body; almost as if all this energy is looking for an escape route through my arms and legs. It can even feel like a physical pain that I’m not even sure how to explain. A lot of this manifests into emotional eating, where I will literally binge on thing after thing. I’m slowly putting on weight which stresses me even more.   

My brain feels like mush. I feel so unplugged and I just wish I could figure out how not to feel like this, or figure out how I can constructively work through this, at the least. Is this depression or just a hump? I can’t even tell anymore, I just want things to be okay. Reading all this makes me feel embarrassed and ashamed that I’ve even got here. I feel like I should have so much to be thankful for and yet here I am, festering. I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal, but on the daily I sure do wish I could just hibernate through all of this. "
91zr24,2,2018-07-26,How to get back into Journalism after long periods of absence and trying to regain ambition?,agirlenroute,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/91zr24/how_to_get_back_into_journalism_after_long/,"Hey there,

I'm a J-school student and it's my first time using the reddit forums, so I apologize for looking like an idiot here. I've been debating about posting my question and ramblings on either r/Advice or r/Journalism, but I opted for the latter since getting advice from the industry was something I needed.

I don't think of myself as a gifted writer, nor have I ever been academically inclined, but I grew up wanting to be a reporter. My prior experience (if you can call it that) includes academic courses, my program's school newspaper and a month-long practicum internship I recently completed back in April. I haven't written anything since then, simply because my personal problems have affected my work mentality and unfortunately, I'm still stuck in a rut.

I have life-long family problems as my father is an alcoholic and will likely die by the bottle. My mom doesn't recognize that she's an enabler, sending mixed signals towards her kids' well-being and I've been dealing with my own health issues as well. I should've graduated a while back but I didn't finish my courses in time and will need another year to complete the requirements. To be fair though, my program's been putting students through the ringer by making us do six to eight courses per semester and expecting us to complete their program in two years (one if you're in a certificate program). I should've looked up the curriculum closely and signed a student waiver had I known about it but that's life. I've been having doubts if I'll ever complete my program and turned myself into a sitting duck for almost four months now.

Lately, I've been browsing articles from a lot of publications (Canadian, US and UK-based), re-reading my old CP-style guide and skimming through my old school work. I've come to realize that I still want to be journalist, despite my shortcomings.

One of my first steps is to hopefully be enrolled for September, complete the program by the summer semester and then apply for postings after graduating. It's easier said than done, unfortunately. I've spoken to profs in the past, some were understanding, others gave me colder reception. It's been hard to let myself vent out my frustrations but I hope you guys can help me out.

How do you think an underachiever student, like myself, can overcome obstacles to complete school and work towards becoming a journalist?

What did you do to finish J-school and how do you juggle it all?"

Both my internship and my job have been around UX development and design. I am involved with designing a new UI and also implementing it in code.

After working for a year, I realised that I'd like to have a more formal knowledge in HCI. Could you recommend a course which is less research oriented and more industry centered? As of now I'd like to work as a UX Designer.

I have an average academic background (barely above 3.0). and decent GRE scores -315 (q-165, v-150). But stellar work record and have great recommendation from senior people like architects and senior designers.

I'm not sure if that is enough to apply to the top tier like CMU/GaTech/UWash. Any suggestions insights on these would be helpful.

We went to school togehter, with her being one year above me, so we saw each orther quite frequently and got along really well. I kinda fell for her back then, but she had a SO back then so i didn’t make any moves at that time. After we graduated from high school I moved to a different city for my studies while she stayed in our home town. During that period we barely kept in touch. 

So about a year ago I moved back to my home town for an internship and now i‘m working on my master thesis at the same company. I met her again, drunk (but we had a good talk), while I was out for drinks with a buddy of mine. She told me we should a grab a beer sometime and so we did a few days later and we had a lot of fun. Fast forward a few weeks I met most of her friends since she has her own flat and most of the time everyone hangs out at her place. I‘ve become good friends with them aswell and spend a good amount of time with her younger brother. 

Now to the part I‘d appreciate your advice on: I slept over at her from time to time, even though I live like 10 mins away from her place. The first time I was gonna sleep on the couch, but she told me in can sleep upstairs with her, she has a 2x2m bed so enough space wasn’t an issue. On the next occasion I slept over from friday to sunday and spent most of my time with her, with other people dropping by from time to time. The last time was after we got a few drinks in a group of five, went to her place afterwards and fell asleep cuddling on her couch until we went to bed like an hour later. Keep in mind that each of those nothing sexual happened.

I‘m just really unsure what to make of this whole situatuon. If I ask her out on a date and shes not interest in that kind of way I‘m afraid it‘ll damage our friendship, which I enjoy and value, but also my friendship with the people I met through her. On the other hand it makes me crazy not knowing how she feels, and either way she‘d react at least I could move on.

She is always very busy, so just spending a lot of time with her and seeing how things pan out isn‘t really an option. Should I talk to a mutual friend first (her little brothers girlfriend would seem like a good choice, or even her brother) and see if they know if she‘s even looking to date someone right now, how they feel like it would affect our friendship and so on? Should I just ask her out on a date the next time I get to see her? Should i wait and see where things are going (I doubt that this is a good idead, it‘d most likely frustrate me more than anything)? If we wouldn‘t have known each other for 20 years I‘d just ask her out, but I don‘t know if we are just good friends and thats it.

If you guys and girls have any adivce, been in a similar situation or can give me tips on what to do know please let me know! Have a great day everyone.

tl;dr: Reconnected with a girl i‘ve known most of my life, not sure what to make of it, how to read her signs or how to approach the situation."

9212xx,42,2018-07-26,"Ugly duckling here, this sub is straight up reality",uglytohot24,Braincels,https://www.reddit.com/r/Braincels/comments/9212xx/ugly_duckling_here_this_sub_is_straight_up_reality/,"Hi. I”ll try to keep it short and will get straight into it. Here is my life experience having been both ugly and then hot in life. I’ve been reading the sub for a while and although it repulsed me at first, I quickly realized “ok, these guys like to joke around but what they’re saying is so true” 

My life when I was 16-17 and ugly
- 5’10 and 250 lbs of fat, terrible skin (acne, greasy, gross), face like a blob of lard
- total nerd (WoW/Runescape addict) since playing games helped me escape reality or “cope”
- had zero friends who were girls, they were grossed out by me or laughed at me (not with me)
- never thought of even asking a girl out, had been rejected a lot and knew I was too ugly to score
- low self-confidence and very insecure

How people (esp girls) treated me - Stayed away (didn’t wanna be seen with me in public), made sure not to post pictures w me, made fun of my looks and appearance, told me laugh it off as “in good humor” , guys were still much better but they all made my life miserable
Now I know all girls are not mean but the simple reality is I was an asexual being to them and none of them would ever even think of me as a potential partner. They just virtual signaled and told me “there is someone out there for you!” while making an “ewww”face if I dared ask them out. 

Now, the fun part. I had a massive height spurt (5’10 to 6’2) got obsessed with football (and working out) at around 17 and lost all the fat + put on 25 lbs of lean muscle over 2-3 years. I had a solid physqiue AND (most importantly) had a handsome face. I was shocked to see I had such a nice jawline beneath that fat. 

I cannot even explain how much my life changed. I started fricking loving my appearance - I’d stare at myself in the mirror, take selfies (from not having social media), look at my body in the mirror. I felt life was my playground and I was born to be at the top. I’d go out and see girls eyefkin me, smiling at everything I said. My professors loved me and while applying for business internships I was told “You 
look like the part son, tall and manly”, I was NEVER bullied again and never picked on. When I talk people stay silent and listen. It is fucking insane how some little bones in the legs and face change your whole life.

Getting a girl’s number? haha lol. What a joke all these pick up artists are. It takes 5 minutes for me at most and 2-3 on average. 

I want you all to understanding something. Confidence COMES FROM successful social interactions, NOT the other way round. When I talk to a girl, IK she likes me and I will get her number. (i get rejected too but that is really rare)

When you’re hot af and everyone tells you that everyday, treats you differently and the opposite sex literally showers you with attention - you become confident, you feel good and have a very high self esteem. All of this carries over IRL interactions too. You “become charming”

I am the same person as I was when I was 16-17( in terms of nature/personality). Today, I love my life and look forward to waking up everyday. I love meeting new girls, meeting new people and exploring my life. People love me and my halo effect helps me in every area of life. 3 years ago I’d go to sleep at 4 am after eating junk food and playing WoW for 8 hours. Sad and lonely, I had only virtual friends to talk to. Yet, all I wanted was for a girl to like me, for my classmates to be nice to me and for life to not feel like a big burden

So yeah, being an incel for so long forever changed my view of this society we erstwhile view with rose tinted glasses.

Does he mean it is because they are constantly spouting lies to advance their agenda? Partially, but it is much larger than this.

I believe that the media not only parrots the propaganda talking points of the deep State every time a false flag attack happens. They are among the architect's of the false flag attacks.

Remember how quickly CNN was on site with their cameras at the Parkland shooting? Remember how the BBC broadcaster announced Building 7 had collapsed 20 minutes before it actually had?

Think about the times the media is try to foment violence at different racial riots.

Of course the vast majority of the members of the media are not involved in planning or even know their organization are behind These event. Rather, they just read the talking points that have been handed off to them. However, I am certain that a very large number of those with the greatest power and visibility, such as CIA intern Anderson Cooper are certainly part of the entire conspiracy.

Oh what a joy it will give me to see them all behind bars!"

Main question: Do psychiatrists have the ability to label you as an addict on your medical record? That was my main reason for never going to a doctor. 


Hello all,

I post on here a decent amount but this is a throwaway since I wanted to give a little more information.

A brief overview of what my experience has been. 

I started taking benzos recreationally back when I was a freshman in college, buddies had always have some when I went back home and took xans now and again but never got super into them.

I took basically anything I could for a a couple years till I finished up my sophmore year and during the summer I realized that I could quit my landscaping job and sell drugs and make more money moving back home.

I did just that and broke up with my girlfriend at the time who I was with over the summer. When I came back is when things started going downhill. 

The night I came back we had a party, being my first college house, and I was getting all sorts of intoxicated. Then my roommate looked at me said ""your night is gonna be ruined"". Sure enough, someone tried to rape my girlfriend, ugh i get angry just thinking about it!! But of course got super angry and tried to do something but I couldn't. We called the cops and made an anonymous tip, and I was with my now ex-girlfriend. I let her stay the night and just tried to make sure she felt safe.

During the summer though I did have sex with this other chick. Nothing came of it, just two people partying and having a good time. Felt bad about it since my gf and I were technically ""on a break"" and yes I am an asshole I have accepted that.

Sorry that was a little more backstory than I wanted to type out.

After that, started diving deep into Alp (xanax). I would get my stuff in a powder and then buy propelyne glycol and mix 100mg into 100ml and boom 1ml = 1mg. It was cheaper and I was smart enough not to do a fingerprint of alp powder. That got crazy and started doing like 14-20mg of alp a night.

Decided to switch to etizolam to see that would change anything. I got down to 2mg of etiz and then I found a really awful chemical. [Flubromazolam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubromazolam). This shit is nuts, .25mg would annihilate me when I first started and would last for more than 12 hrs. I did make the mistake of taking like 2 or 3mg? Cant remember honestly, just videos of me falling over and almost cracking my head open.

Anyway I was also taking adderall, coke, acid, molly, and of course alcohol. 

I had broken up with my gf again because I just felt bad she had to see me just go down the drain due to my addiction. I also had an intervention that my brothers set up for me which sort of helped. Made me realize that people are worried about me. That is when I started to slow down on a lot of stuff. Stopped taking the Flubromazolam and switched back to etiz and stopped my adderall and coke usage. 

Tried going off the etiz and had a seizure at work, that sucked but i made me realize that I have to actually think about my dosages and shit. Didn't really wanna do that so I started taking just .25 of the Flubromazolam and drinking every day. 

After a while of that I decided to switch it up since that was not working. I found another RC [Flubromazepam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flubromazepam) and this shit was the bees knees. Did not give me that benzo feeling but kept the withdrawals at bay for a good 4 1/2 days. But I still was drinking a half a case a day. 

School started back up and coming into it I knew I had to do something. Now was the time.

Talked to my ex-girlfiend, told her what I wanted to do. Quit drinking and start taking my tapering seriously. She actually believed me and started helping me through.

Cut to halving my dosage almost every other week and not drinking, this led to 10 weeks of that shit while I got off. 

Finally got through it all and was clean. Have been feeling super good every since. I have gone to therapy but I did not get much out of it. I liked one therapist but I just couldn't find the motivation to keep going.

Now I am at an internship and hoping to finish up my degree online. But I am starting to think that I need to see a psychiatrist for anxiety and some anger issues.

My main reason for this post was to ask if I go to a psychiatrist and tell them all this shit, will I be labeled as an addict on my medical record? I don't want to break a bone and not get morphine but I also hate that I am not completely honest with medical professionals."

Am I asking for too much?,Fleeting_Light,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/923f62/entrylevel_job_asked_me_how_much_my_salary/,"Hi guys, hopefully you can help me out with this. I’m a recent graduate working as an intern with the possibility of it becoming a full-time job. The president of the company asked me what my salary requirement was if I am hired full-time, and I asked him if I could have some time to figure out everything. He was more than okay to give me time to figure this out. So here’s some details about the job:

My title would be Web Designer, however I do a lot more than that in this job. I also do marketing, animation, packaging design, and graphic design. I might ask if the job title can be changed to something more encompassing, but that isn’t my concern right now. 

The company is small. The marketing team (including me) is 5 people. I would say the company is about 10-15 people total. Because of this, I don’t know how much money they would have to give me, and I don’t want to be insulting by asking for too much.

Now about me. I have no student loans and no debt at all. I am in a situation where I’m not paying rent or utilities (except for internet). So really, I don’t need a lot to survive, but I really want to start saving for the future. I calculated that I spend approximately $500-550 a month on bills and fun things, so about $6000-6600 of a yearly salary.

I wanted to ask for $40,000. After doing some research, I found the average entry-level salary for a web designer was 45K, and other design areas floating in the 40K to 48K range. Without being too specific, the job is in a very popular central Pennsylvania city.

I assumed that if the salary requirement was too high for them, they would negotiate it down, but I’m very worried they just won’t hire me full time then. What do you guys think I should ask for? "
923ivg,123,2018-07-26,What you need to know about Faisal Hussain's cover man: Mohammed Hashim. A deeper dive.,Super-Throwaway_64,metacanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/923ivg/what_you_need_to_know_about_faisal_hussains_cover/,"The story behind the story of Faisal Hussain, is Mohammed Hashim.
Hashim is likely why Trudeau has been so mute on the shooting.

Hashim is a busy guy. 

He’s involved with the [National Council of Canadian Muslims](https://www.nccm.ca/connect/training/) which works to train people how to speak to the media and counter anti-Islam narratives. It also advocates for the veil in Quebec.

He is the co-founder of [Progress Toronto](https://www.progresstoronto.ca/) which is VERY interested in getting progressive candidates into office.

He’s part of [Youth Fellowship](http://www.youthfellowship.ca/) which works specifically to place Muslims in municipal internship roles.

And he’s part of [DawaNet](http://dawanet.ca/our-impact/) which keeps the Imams of the GTA co-ordinated.

He works full-time with the [Toronto &amp; York Region Labour Council](http://www.labourcouncil.ca/) which is happy bedfellows of [Organizing Committee Against Islamophobia](https://1989.cupe.ca/2017/07/17/organizing-committee-against-islamophobia-standing-together-against-hate/) . A group that doesn’t have qualms about calling the Anti-Defamation League (y’know, the Jews) a Fascist organization, and puts out rallies like [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWiQQR3Ijl4) .

That guy is Walied Khogali, brother of Yusra Khogali: co-founder of BLM Toronto.

In other words, Hashim is an active player in: 

1. a vast network of Muslim groups working their way into the civic system.

2. pumps out the usual ‘white supremacy, jews are fascists, we’re under attack, refugees welcome’ narrative.

3. is effective enough to immediately run cover for an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack. And *lies about the motive to protect Islam.*

Now. I’m not an autist, ~~so this took a lot of effort I’d rather not spend.~~ But I thought I’d do my civic duty for once and put some information on the table for y’all.

Trudeau's keeping his mouth shut because he doesn't want anyone to look into Hashim. And he *really* doesn't want anyone to ask why a random Muslim family in the GTA was able to access such a skilled spin-doctor on such short notice.

[Edit:](https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/furey-meet-the-spin-doctor-behind-the-hussain-family-statement)

&gt;“I am just a friend of the family and have shared their statement as requested. I am not their spokesperson,” Hashim said via email.

&gt; Hashim would not clarify which family members contributed to the statement.

We should *really* be asking why Hashim is a friend of a family that had one brother involved in the largest drug &amp; arms bust in Ontario history, and the other brother becomes the shooter. I'd love for someone to point a laser at Hashim. There's a lot of dirty money floating around here and Hashim is heavily involved in GTA politics.

I would also suggest some compassion upon the parents, at least until there's some evidence that they were involved in their childrens' downfalls. It sounds like they had three kids, and they're all dead (Fahad is in a permanent coma.)"

I transferred to a 4-year university and did well my first semester. Then 2017 became my depression year and I failed 3 classes over those 2 semesters. Since I'm a transfer student I had to give up my comm college gpa, a 3.8, and start over again. Got a 3.2 my first semester, but it dropped to 2.1 after the depression year. I've managed to build it up to a 2.8 by doing extremely well this past semester and in summer semester, but I worry about whether or not this coming semester's grades will be in on time to reflect in my gpa when I send it to grad schools. 

I know myself enough to know that I'm not as prepared as my peers when it comes to grad school. I still feel like a freshman sometimes. But I'm entering my last year, and the separation from the nparents has been great for me. 

I've chosen programs within my field of study, psychology, that cater well to students who don't know exactly what subfield they want to go into. The problem is that they have very high standards. I'm not sure I can make the gpa requirement. So my admission will be more dependent on gre scores and rec letters.

My fear is that I won't get accepted into any master's program.

Ever since high school, my life goal has been to get as far away from my family as I can, and I've been using college to get away. But because the 'rents never let me get a job ever, and I've never gotten to do internships because I'm a transfer, it would be extremely difficult for me to get a good enough job with just a BA. 

I'm almost confident in saying that I won't be able to afford rent. My parents would make me move back in with them, and I'd have no choice, nowhere to go. 

If I can just get into a master's program I could be set to leave. It's just contingent on so many things. And I'm so friggin terrified that I won't be good enough to get accepted, and get stuck back in my hometown. "

924lmp,58,2018-07-26,Who Killed Audrey?,serendipityjones14,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/924lmp/who_killed_audrey/,"*I've mentioned this story in passing comments, but since we've just passed the 30th anniversary of Cardenas' death, I decided to finally just write it up. I was living about a mile away from where she was found at the time and have been haunted by the case ever since.* 

On September 27, 1989, John Lanman pulled into his driveway after driving home around 5 p.m. But when he got inside, he found his worst nightmare: His pregnant wife Jolaine and their preschooler Kenneth were dead. They’d been badly beaten and stabbed, they were covered in blood, and scissors had been plunged deep into Jolaine’s neck. 

A note, purportedly written by Jolaine, lay next to her body, stating:

&gt;""A wanan and 2 men hit me they called each other croupa Bob Dlany and Varl. The bragged about killing audrey Cardenas There Il LPN CRX 15 and KDH 221."" 

This referred to Charlotte Kroupa, Maurice Vale and Bob DeLaria, social workers with the Illinois Department of Public Aid.

Jolaine had last been seen alive that morning just before noon by a neighbor in their quiet, middle-class Villa Madero subdivision just outside Belleville, Il. Another neighbor noticed a suspicious car that day, right around the same time. The driver had gone to several homes for sale, carrying a heavy briefcase and wearing a cap. The Lanman house was also for sale at the time.

**The IDPA Social Workers’ Link**

This wasn’t the caseworkers’ first “brush” with the law. A few years before the Lanman murders, Kroupa, Vale and DeLaria were arrested when another coworker accused them of assault and theft. The coworker also claimed that they’d threatened to kill him if he told anyone. It wasn’t true -- Dale Anderson had made all it up out of spite, and all charges were dismissed. But that didn't stop him. He wanted them gone, and he was willing to go to great lengths to accomplish that. Including, evidently, the murders of a pregnant woman and a 3 yo.

**Audrey Cardenas**

It also wasn’t Dale Anderson’s first brush with murder. In the spring of 1988, Anderson had met with a young newspaper intern about his claims that the IDPA was out to get him. Audrey Cardenas, a native of Texas, had only been in Illinois a short time when her body was found decomposing in a creek bed next to a local high school. 

Audrey had [last been seen](https://www.bnd.com/news/local/article209633319.html) on Monday, June 20, 1988, when she cashed her paycheck at a local bank. That was at 8:30 a.m. The bank was located downtown, just a block or so from the Belleville News Democrat, where Audrey was interning. But by 10 a.m., she hadn’t yet made it to work. Her body was found a week later.

(Note: There are discrepencies about the time she was last seen. Her official date of death was June 19, but bank records show the check as deposited on Monday. That could be a record-keeping issue since many banks don't tally deposits/checks on Friday afternoons, weekends and holidays until the next business day, which would have been Monday in this case. However, the bank teller specifically remembered seeing Audrey on Monday morning). 

**Rodney Woidtke**

It didn’t take police long to zero in on a suspect: Rodney Woidtke. Woidtke was a mentally ill drifter who’d ended up in Belleville when he had car problems. He tried to get into the cordoned-off crime scene, immediately rousing suspicions of his involvement. He gave several different versions of what had happened, but that didn’t deter police from charging him. 

Woidtke wasn’t fit to stand trial; he was instead sent to a mental hospital. However, he refused to use his mental illness as a defense, and after a short bench trial. Woidtke was found guilty and sent to prison to serve a 45-year sentence. But there were still plenty of questions that were left unanswered and little evidence tying him to the murder. Eventually Woidtke won a retrial -- and [was acquitted](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/columns/pat-gauen/rodney-woidtke-key-figure-in-high-profile-belleville-murder-completes/article_5abb9572-4ccb-5ddf-85ef-66149b08472d.html). He walked away a free man.

*That wasn’t the end of his story, though. Just months after his release, he (allegedly) battered another man in a with a bicycle chain. He was jailed and charged with a hate crime and ultimately was sent to a care facility due to several serious health issues, which eventually killed him.* 

**Who Was Dale Anderson, Really?**

But back to Dale Anderson. When he was arrested for the Lanman murders, [his home was searched](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19921150604ne2d54611121). Police found knives, guns, metal bars, blackjacks and other weapons stored in his house. The windows were covered with cardboard. Anderson’s wife wasn’t allowed to work, and he kept their kids home from school. Whenever Anderson was home, his wife said, he hid in his room listening to the police scanner. Police who responded to the house that day called him a “sexual psychopath,” and [Robert Ressler](https://www.npr.org/2013/12/29/258160192/the-fbi-investigator-who-coined-the-term-serial-killer) believed he had all the hallmarks of a serial killer.

**Other Victims?**

Anderson was readily convicted of the Lanman murders and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990. Since then, Ressler has tentatively linked him to other murders in the area, including:

* Elizabeth West, a student at BTHS-W, whose body was found on the outskirts of Belleville
* Ruth Ann Jany, whose body was found a few miles from the site of West’s 
* Summerfield Jane Doe, who was eventually identified as Eulalia Chavez 
* Kristina Povolish, who was found in a ditch near Belleville

But the links are, perhaps, tenuous, and other men have been blamed or even convicted of these crimes. Chavez’ murder has details that could point instead to a convicted kidnapper named [Larry Hall](https://www.bnd.com/news/local/article126695289.html). He hasn’t been charged or convicted.

As for West and Jany, Greg Bowman was convicted and imprisoned for their murders. There was no physical evidence, but he’d confessed under somewhat questionable circumstances. And, as with Woidtke, he was eventually released pending a new trial, during which time police doubled down on their efforts to put Bowman away. That’s when they [positively linked](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/killer-of-st-louis-county-teen-once-also-convicted-in/article_4a97caf7-d5d3-5350-85e6-e88c7c28dcf2.html) him to another murder, this one in nearby St. Louis. The young woman’s body was found “strangled, slashed and raped” and was dumped.

**Kristina Povolish and Audrey Cardenas**

So that leaves [Povolish and Cardenas](https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/illinois/gauen-author-looks-for-links-among-three-s-murders-in/article_e1ba5931-4787-5677-b210-984d01529939.html). There wasn’t a lot to guide investigators as to Cardenas’ cause of death: They were fairly sure she’d been sexually assaulted, and they believed she was either strangled or had her throat cut. Maybe both. Povolish was strangled. 

And, of course, Lanman had been beaten, stabbed and left with scissors in her throat. 

Dale Anderson spent a lot of time lurking around the Belleville News Democrat’s newsroom, pitching stories. He attended Cardenas’ funeral, and he may have stalked another reporter, [Carolyn Tuft](http://www.editorandpublisher.com/news/was-she-stalked-by-the-killer-she-s-writing-about-p-12/), who worked at the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Tuft, who tells of disquieting statements Anderson has made about Cardenas’ murder, believes that Anderson is Audrey’s killer.

Anderson had contact with Povolish, too, through his work at the IDPA office. Was he using his role there to hunt his prey? 

It’s been [30 years](https://www.theeagle.com/news/local/years-later-aggie-s-death-still-raises-questions/article_009f6f91-753c-5e31-81b5-d4bdbcad799e.html) since Audrey was brutally murdered. Longer for Povolish. Did Anderson kill them both? Did he kill all the women that were linked to him? Was he indeed a serial killer?

924t4u,8,2018-07-26,Feeling guilty,vampiretuesday,OpenChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian/comments/924t4u/feeling_guilty/,"Just a quick background: I’m a college student about to start my sophomore (second) year. 

So I’m currently on summer vacation with two weeks left before I return to school. I got an internship working at an office, which is what I’ve been doing for the past 11 weeks. It’s a good job, pays well, and will look great on my resume. Here’s where the guilt is coming in. A lot of my friends, I could safely say most of them, are working as summer camp counselors at Christian camps all over my state. From what I can see from their posts on Instagram and Facebook, they are having a great time, spreading the Gospel, constantly talking about how thankful they are. Which is wonderful! I’m truly happy they are having a fulfilling time. 

I’ve just been constantly comparing and wondering if I should have done the same thing, even if I don’t feel like that’s what God was calling me to do. I went to a Christian summer camp for three years when I was younger, and I enjoyed it, but I never felt called to serve as a counselor. I’m not super into working with kids, and I’m not sure I would be very good at that job. But nevertheless, I wondering if that means those people are better Christians than I am. 

How can I rid myself of these feelings of guilt and inferiority?

My friend and I are both undergrad black women (juniors). I currently have an engineering internship at a big 4 tech company. While applying for internships and considering career/academic moves, I felt very...alone? There weren’t a lot of black people at my school (let alone in STEM), and I do follow publications and blogs tailored and written by black people, I felt something was missing.

So I’ve been thinking about writing a blog about black women in STEM, like a hybrid advice/anecdote blog. I’ve mentored a lot of freshman/high school aged black women, and I think? I can give good advice. The blog would be targeted to younger women (18-22?), since I haven’t had a full time job outside of the internships I’ve had.

My friend disagrees. She says I don’t have enough experience (4 tech internships is experience, in my opinion, and I can always talk to more experienced people), and that the kind of blog I want to write is “unnecessary”. Also, she says “I should let people who are more established in the industry give advice”, but I feel a student’s perspective is important.

Do you guys have any thoughts? I’m solidly in the planning stages for this, so I want to make sure there’s a need for this kinda of thing, and I’m not cluttering the web with junk.

Thanks!

I'm developing a web scraper which scrapes around 35K pages. The scraper itself is done, and now I've been tasked with setting up the proper infrastructure to allow this to run regularly. After some research I've decided that the basic architecture will look something like this:

* Create SQS queue and load URLs into the queue
* Create and configure Lambda function to read from the queue. The function will be invoked once per queue message
* Lambda function will write results to DynamoDB
* Download results from DynamoDB
* Use Step Functions to combine the above steps

So I have a basic idea of how it will all work, but don't really have a clue on how to actually do it. I'm pretty new to AWS so this is all pretty daunting to me. If you know of any projects similar to what I'm trying to accomplish, I would any resource you may have. Thanks!"

Me: I can see info on all the packages but how do I actually book it

**Packages will go on-sale to the general public on Friday, August 3rd at 1pm ET! at that time, you'll be able to click purchase buttons from the package page**

2)

Me: and is this all inclusive like all food and drink?

**Airfare is not included. Each Deja Voom package includes concert access, resort accommodations, food and drink inside the concert venue, shuttle transportation between Cancún International Airport and your resort, and shuttles between your resort and the concert venue (if applicable).at the Barcelo, it is all inclusive, but not at the rosewood resort**

Me: okay sorry for being repetitive but just to clarify...if i stay at the barcelo palace all my food and drink will be included there and all the food and drink will be included at the venue as well?just wanna know how much I need to budget total and if I should take into account if im gonna spend a bunch on food and alcohol there

**not a problem! yes, that's correct**

3)

Me: And how far is the venue from the barcelo maya and barcelo palace?

**yep, pretty cool! All resorts may offer extra amenities that are not included in the resort’s all-inclusive plans, such as spa treatments, exclusive dining experiences, off-site adventures and whatnot that are available for purchase as wellthe venue is at the Barcelo, the closest rooms are a few hundred feet and the furthest room is about a 10 minute walk**

4)

Me: who are you affiliated with?

**I'm part of our Guest Services team here at CID Presents :)**

Me: whats that?

**the company putting on DejaVoom!**

**we are a company who partnered with Bassnectar to put on this event**

5)

Me: well the reason I asked if you were affiliated with Lorin is because I want to know your opinion on if I should drop $5000 on this

**It's going to be an incredibly intimate and special event. However, the prices aren't that expensive per person! Have you looked at the pricing?**

Me: yeah I would be paying for my gf also though, it's most likely the only way i'll convince her to go

**I think you'd both have a great time!**

6)

Me: okay another question: is all inclusive ALL inclusive like alcohol too?

📷Kennedy Intern 15:12

**yes, alcohol is included in the all inclusive plan at the barcelo! although all resorts may offer extra amenities that are not included in the resort’s all-inclusive plans**

7)

Me: and what about fees? I know packages like this and hotels have fees a lot of times - so if I am getting the Superior room package for 2 people at the Barcelo Maya 5 nights, it says $4259. is that gonna be more like $4500?

**There are no additional ticketing fees on top of the prices you see, and all Deja Voom packages provide an all-inclusive experience within the concert venue for all three (3) nights. Please note: The Rosewood Mayakoba package is NOT all-inclusive at the resort.**

8)

Me: and what about the payment plan? so if I do that I pay $300 to start and then I have to pay $989.75 for 4 months after that?

**At the time of purchase, you will be able to choose between paying in full or taking advantage of our payment plan. With the payment plan, you can secure your package with $300 down, followed by 4 equal payments of the remaining balance on October 10th, November 10th, December 10th, and January 10th. Please note: there will be a one-time $50 payment plan processing fee added to the first payment for your packageyes, $989.75 is correct. but it's $300 + a one time $50 payment plan processing fee**

Me: what happens if we miss a payment? can we make it up the next month?

**if you miss your payment, your plan would NOT be cancelled right away but we would send you an email with the deadline for when you would need to pay it by**

9)

ME: And do these things usually sell out or does the price fluctuate based on how many tickets have sold?

**the prices don't fluctuate, this is the inaugural Deja Voom event, so unfortunately I can't tell you if it will sell out or not**

Me: historically do CID presents events sell out?

**yes historically intimate events like this sell out!**

10)

Me: so it looks like the junior suite is the cheapest room at palace and superior room is the cheapest at Maya, right?

**for two people, yes**

11)

I have a question about the payment package. If my girlfriend and I want to get ONE room together with a king bed, but we want to pay for our own tickets...is that possible?like is there a way to each have our own payment package that we are responsible for but also have booked the same room together?Read

**During the initial purchase, you will only be able to use one credit card. If you opted for the payment plan and need to change your credit card to make the next payment, you may do so at a later date by logging into your ticketing account online.**"
925mly,7,2018-07-26,Dealing With an Nparent post college?,mw343,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/925mly/dealing_with_an_nparent_post_college/,"Hi RBN, 
Ive lurked here for a long time now ( a few years in fact) as this sub has been very cathartic and extremely contextualizing  and helpful for me. However, at this point I am at my wits end so I figured I would ask the people ive gotten so much vicarious advice and help from.
About my situation;

I am a young 20's male who just recently graduated college. For most of my memory( from about 7-8 onward) I have always understood that my mom had somewhat of an ""odd"" temper. She would fly into a rage and cry at the most random things, generally brought about  by something my father had done or forgotten to do(or done wrong or not well enough or not fast enough). She would have trouble ""remembering"" exactly how she said things, especially hurtful things, that I now understand as gas-lighting, thanks to this sub. As soon as I reached my teenage years, me and my mothers relationship deteriorated quickly. Retrospectively it seems because she could not mold me anymore to do EXACTLY what she wanted. Through this time i was always referred to as being a spoiled or lazy brat who was ungrateful. I was frequently told to ""watch my tone"" or ""I dont like your attitude"" when I would object to being verbally abused or questioned some N platitude. To the contrary, I was a kid who literally never got in trouble(never been to detention or anything) got good grades and was nationally ranked in my sport. My Dad, who did not agree with her most of the time would placate the situation by telling me to ""not throw more gas on the fire"" or ""shes just really passionate"".I was screamed at and called nasty things and all the stuff that seems to come along with Nparenting. Some various examples include histrionically crying and sobbing and running away(numerous times) when the conversation does not go her way, telling my long term GF that  I ""was not the son she raised"" when asked to keep her temper down AT MY BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION, calling me a ""little piece of shit"" for being sick at a family reunion, throwing dishware at my dad, and playing the martyr game(""you all just hate me, im a terrible mother etc.."") when we criticize the mean things she says. Long story short, when I began to read this sub late in my senior year of high-school, something clicked. It was surreal to basically read whole entire conversations that I have had word for word with my mother in other peoples posts. Additionally she seems to have some aspects of BPD in terms of 
how she relats to us and the rest of our extended family.
&amp;nbsp;

With this new context and information in mind, and me moving off to college several hundred miles away, our relationship improved somewhat as we did not have to interact face to face too often. However, when we would meet for family gatherings and such there would always be contention. Several times this has culminated in me and my father begging her to get some sort of help or psychiatric evaluation. Never happened-- surprise! At this point for my last 2 years at school I had moved out full time and was considerably happier and more stress free. The kicker is however that I am not exactly financially independent yet.
This has come to a head recently since I have graduated. I have had trouble finding a job immediately (its been about a month and a half at this point) and Im being accused of being lazy and freeloading by my mother. It is important to note that I have worked 40+ hr weeks in multiple internships every summer up until this point. Its not that i dont want to work, quite the contrary, but it almost seemed easier to find internships than an actual job. None the less im being constantly accused of not trying and not accepting her help. 

My dad does not feel this way and voices his continued moral and financial support, but makes sure to remind me how my mother feels every time we talk. Keep in mind this is with me sending them an updated spreadsheet with all the companies I have or am planning on applying to. What really ground my gears to a halt today was her saying to my dad and by extension me that I am not trying hard enough and that there are not enough companies on the list. While this might be reasonable in and of it self, i specifically asked her a month ago what she would  consider reasonable amount of applications so she wouldn't pester me. I never got a straight answer so i figured about 15  serious full time applications and some other part time ones would be sufficient. NOPE, im being threatened with being cut off financially since im not trying I guess. Obviously I will be stepping up my efforts at job searching as that is indeed a final solution to this particular issue.At this point I would almost prefer being cut off abruptly to the stress of dealing with this now. The only thing keeping me in contact with both of them is my father's continued support and good will, however much he seems to enable my mothers behavior. 

TL;DR: Nmom controls me financially (partially) with a sympathetic-to-me Edad. Relationship is becoming increasingly stressful and toxic but i would like to at least maintain contact. 

I guess im not really sure what im asking. Im just tired of being hounded like a child and being called lazy and being threatened by my own mother. How do I continue this relationship without going crazy?

So I am intern in the IT a pretty large office building.
One problem we having is that there is no clear templates for mail being send to the rest of the office so some mails being sent to everyone are like ''hi guys, we are currently working of fixing the printer issieu'' and the next day someone is mailing to everyone ''Dear all, The IT departments have made a new tool for you to use. You can it on this link''. So everyone is just typing whatever they want. 

So my boss wants to use a template tool for Outlook that is easy to use and easy to store all kind of templates in. So for example if there is a issieu with the printers someone can just click, ''sent to all'' and then ''íssieu with printers'' and then the mail is ready to be sent out.


But I have no idea were to begin searching so I am hoping I can find some good ideas here. Price is not realy a problem.

I've gotten an EC2 Instance up and running and have everything working as I'd like it to. This instance is supposed to be for our accountants to remote into (as they will be working from home for a while due to our current circumstances) but I'm not sure about how secure RDP is. 

I've done a little bit of googling and found that RDP traffic is encrypted, but that there is a vulnerability to a MITM attack? The article is old and I'm not sure if this is still relevant, should I be taking any extra precautions in securing the RDP connection? 

And during my digging around, I've found some stuff about RD Gateway on amazon's website, and I don't really understand what it's for, but the guide has the article titled ""**Setting up Secure Administrative Access using Remote Desktop Gateway**"". Is this something I'm going to need to set up? I've got an Internet Gateway set up already and can remote into the instance without a VPN, so I'm not sure if I need this.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm 19, my parents divorced in 2016 after a 25 year long marriage. Their relationship was fine (so I thought) growing up, there were fights and stuff but I just considered it normal. I was surrounded by friends whose parents had already divorced or were being beaten, so to me I had it pretty good. After so many years together and a really good relationship, all things considered, my Dad left abruptly on Valentines Day. I still remember coming home from somewhere (memories are foggy) and seeing my Mom leaning on the kitchen table, crying, and then explaining what had happened. The next 5 months or so were the most stressful of my life, I was applying to colleges and dealing with the nuclear fallout of this nightmare scenario. It was so bad I can't remember it even though it only happened 2 years ago. I actually cannot recall most of the events that happened and the ones that stand out to me still have really foggy aspects like I mentioned before. I can remember it was Valentines Day and I can remember where I found my Mom but I can't remember where I came from or what happened next. 

The thing I find that what makes going through this so hard is that people on the outside don't understand how many other aspects there are to a divorce. If it was just my parents splitting it would've sucked but that wasn't all that happened. When you break up a family that has been together for a quarter of a century it's not a clean exit. It's like dropping a bomb on a village to kill one man, there are casualties. My sister had to be admitted to a psych ward because she was young, emotionally vulnerable at the time, and had been dealing with other mental problems, she didn't feel safe and nearly attempted suicide. I got into a massive fight with my Mom that haunts me to this day, it made me scared of myself. My Dad pretty much abandoned us, he didn't ask for visitation days so it was just whenever we could see him which resulted in being roughly 1 or 2 times a month. I guess that's good compared to what some people have but we were close, I saw him as a best friend as well as a father. Now, when we would see him he'd be angry and/or drunk. We tried to avoid seeing him after that because it was abundantly clear he didn't want us around. One of the first things he told me after coming back from disappearing for 3 days was ""you're 17, you're basically raised, it's not a big deal."" That's the awful part of going through it older though, you've known what a happy family felt like, you have plans for your future based off of your family, you have comfort, you have all of these things so when you're stripped of them you don't know how to reconcile that. You want to blame people, beg for things to go back, do anything you can to get back what you had. After a while though it dawns on you, there will be no more family holidays, no more dinners together, no more family really, and you have to accept that. 

What really got me though, and what I didn't expect, was for my parents to start dating so soon after and what that would be like. I remember the time I came home and my Mom was in our house with another man and his young son. I couldn't handle it, I almost broke right then and there. They went to sleep together, my Mom, her boyfriend of 3 weeks, and his fucking 7-8 year old son, all in the same bed. The same bed I used to sleep in when I was a toddler, and where my Mom and Dad used to stay. That night they slept there and I left the house in the dead of night. My nerves were shot, so much turmoil had happened before this that I couldn't even bring myself to feel anything of substance. I drove out and started smoking to calm down. If I could pinpoint the day I lost compassion for people it was that day. My trust had been broken over and over, but this was something else, I felt like I lost both parents. 

I haven't been the same since. Lifting weights saved my life in college, without a doubt I would've attempted suicide by now if I didn't start hitting the gym. Getting discipline and taking control of my own life has completely changed me. I can't fathom having those thoughts now. I'm stronger than I've ever been, have a great academic career ahead of me, an amazing paid internship starting (it's literally my dream job), and I have hope that I might get into a space where I'm ready for a relationship. All I had was myself to rely on I felt that if I couldn't trust and love myself, then I truly had nobody. I don't want to be one of ""those guys"" but if anybody actually reads through this, lifting + discipline can change your life. I've become colder and I'm not proud of that, I'm extremely lacking sympathy for others, people come to be with problems and I can't give a shit. Life's hard, either rise above or die. I don't even know how to begin overcoming the trust issues but I have faith it will get better. I'm figuring out where to go from here but I'm happy with how far I've come. Just days like today, when I'm home from college, I can't help but think about it.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, if anybody read this hats off to you. If you are dealing with a similar situation I want to let you know it gets better and I mean that. Divorces are serious shit, people need to be more aware of that. They are way too common and with kids involved it's nothing short of a disaster. The worst thing you can think is that ""I'm not a child so this shouldn't affect me."" That's bullshit, this shit can be rough. Don't lose sight of yourself, you are not your parents. Keep pushing on, ask for help when you need it, there is no point in lone-wolfing it, it won't make you stronger it just delays the healing process. "

927ght,13,2018-07-26,What should I [22M] do about my GF's [22F] parents? [40s MF],_parents_dislike,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/927ght/what_should_i_22m_do_about_my_gfs_22f_parents_40s/,"I've been with my girlfriend for about 1.5 years, since our junior year of college. We recently started our first jobs out of school in different cities, roughly 2 hours away. We've been good about visiting each other most weekends and calling most days, and plan to keep doing that for 1.5 - 2 years until we can move to the same city. We have a great relationship, only one real fight in our entire relationship, talk about marriage/kids/etc often, etc.

The only problem in our relationship seems to be that her parents don't like me. They are incredibly manipulating and controlling. When we first started dating, her parents weren't happy because they thought that I would take away from her study time, and made that clear to her. The summer after junior year, we had internships in far away cities, and I planned to fly and meet her in her city. When she mentioned to her parents that she was going to drive 60+ minutes to pick me up from the airport, they freaked out and threatened to take away the car and said that she can't do that because ""she's not an experienced enough driver"" as she didn't drive enough in high school (because they were controlling, and didn't let her...). So I had to take a bus.

They also complain now because they're worried that I'm going to distract her from her ""career"" (I'm not, she's incredibly hard working and I also have an equally good job that I'm focused towards). My girlfriend also thinks that part of it is that I am not of their cultural descent (their descendants are all 100% from their parent's country, and they are very proud of that, I don't even have a tiny bit of that country's blood). Further, the one fight we got in happened to be the week before she was planning on going home for the weekend, so when she went home and was crying all weekend they asked her what was wrong and she eventually spilled it to them, putting me in an even worse light in their eyes. It only took a few days for us to resolve that fight, but of course her parents don't care since they'll always remember the fight and how it made my GF feel. After that, they would just look for excuses to not like me, like how I didn't meet them at my GF's concert during our senior year of college (I've only met them once in person a few months after that). It doesn't help that I get the feeling that her only brother doesn't like me very much either, even though we've hardly met, and he probably sides with her parents on that.

Last week, she and I went to a festival together. A few days before her parents had called and said they were coming up for the festival, which they had mentioned once A YEAR AGO but never actually planned, and when my GF told them that I was coming up and we could all hang together, they got all mad and stopped talking to her, and would occasionally message her nasty things.

Most recently, she had planned to get her car checked for inspection since she moved to a new state, but the car company cancelled on her without telling her. When she called and told her parents, they yelled at her/made her feel bad (as if it were her fault in any way) and said that ""if she wasn't spending all weekend with \[my name\] she could have gotten it done,"" and then when she fought back they asked if she had been drinking wine because ""it makes her moody and she should stop because too much will make her fat"" (???????).

I'm at a loss. My girlfriend and I are worried that they're going to constantly make up excuses and try to get between us. We love each other deeply, and frankly I just want them to accept our relationship. I feel like part of it is that they don't like their daughter dating yet, and part of it is that they don't like me specifically. Is there anything I can do, or is it absolutely hopeless???

**tl;dr: GF's parents don't seem to like me at all, whether it's because of me specifically or just because their daughter is dating at all. I really want to make this relationship work and get the parents to accept our relationship.**"

From the day you were born, for the entire duration of high school, and from the beginning of college right to the very end, you've always had one goal that reigned supreme above all others, one job you always wanted, one path you needed to take. You wished to be a designer, or rather, a lingerie designer, a material designer, of the sexiest and most alluring fabrics around. You don't why, but you always had a strange obsession with fabrics. The softness of satin, the smell of rubber, the luxurious patterns of lace, and of course lingerie proved to be the best outlet of all of these desires of yours. Sexual? Maybe, maybe not, but the obsession would linger even when the sexual feelings would go. Needless to say, you kept this to yourself. You told your parents you were off to study fashion design at college, which was true, in part, though they didn't know you were studying fabric too, and in your part time, helping at a lingerie brand. After graduation, through a mixture of talent, ambition, charisma and work experience, you had managed to get yourself an internship at perhaps the most well known boutique lingerie designers in the world, Morelle Noire, ran by the the famous Lillie Nightshade. You were in awe of her, worshipped her designs for years, which only seemed to get better each season, and now, you were finally here.

The company was smaller than you expected, only twenty people or so, though it made sense. The company made good money, millions even, but no more than that. Each lingerie set or catsuit was handcrafted, was made specific to the customers tastes and had to go through hundreds of test to make sure it stood up the standards of the Morelle Noire brand. Luckily for you, your designs got the attention of Mrs Nightshade herself. She quickly took you on as an apprentice, no, a protege. She was an attractive woman in her late 30s to early 40s, though she appeared much young. She has a slim figure overall other than her amazingly fat ass, her wides so wide she even struggled with a few doors at work at times! Her narrow waist and long legs only accentuated this feature of hers too. Her jet black hair, pale skin and vividly blue eyes often reminded you of her of being some vampire, or at least, some immortal creature that never seemed to age. You were amazed at all times. She was your hero, nothing more, nothing less. And, thankfully, overtime the two of you became closer, though never quite to the level of friends, more respected teacher and student, even a motherly kind of relationship at times.

One year in, and you're the ace designer. Well loved by the equally friendly staff, helping the company make even more money than before, you were rewarded for your hard work by an invite to the 'Night Moth Ball' itself, the luxurious and decadent private parties Mrs Nightshade would hold in her own home, a mansion on the outskirts of town, hidden from the woods on her own private estate, fit with lake, stables, and other wonderful fancies, a typical English manor on the wealthy could afford. She also asked you to bring a USB stick of *all* your designs, telling you that she was planning something special for the two of you to collaborate on, even promising to make you a star! With that kind of offer, you couldn't refuse. The uniform code is all black, smart. Upon arriving, you are amazed by the beauty and splendour of the house, and how wonderful all the guests were. Strippers were invited, but you found the infamous 'debauchery' to be marked down by a bunch of guests getting far too drunk. Overall, things were a bit tamer than you expected. Curious, and bored, you make you way around the house, skulking, investigating, a house this big must've had hundreds of secrets inside!

And you were right. Sadly, for you, it was finding out those secrets that assigned you to your fate forever. Upon reaching a library room of sort, you pull a book away from it's bookshelf. It was The Story of O, an infamous BDSM novel written in the 20th century, inspiring all sorts of perverts to come out of the woodworks after it was written, to descend on humanity like depraved monsters. Not your sort of book, but by pulling it, you managed to crack the secret entrance. The bookshelf opens slowly, every so slowly, before leading you down to some stairs, very old and ancient staircase. You shouldn't go in. You *really* shouldn't go in.

But you do. What a stupid mistake. What a stupid, stupid mistake. Descending into the bowels of the mansion, you are confronted by a strange, disturbing imagery. The walls seemed to be covered in a dense, heavy rubber of some kind, jet black, yet illuminated enough for you to see, even without lights, as though it was neither darkness or light, somewhere between the two. The basement area was more like a labyrinth than anything else, halls upon halls, all connected, leading to different rooms, all of which were locked. You manage to find one that isn't locked though. Your heart was beating, the smell was powerful, putting your head in an almost drug like state from the intense miasma. Upon entering, you are privy to seeing a most horrible sight. Dozens of human beings, all of them coated in latex, tight bondage suits as they were known, covering every little inch of their bodies, all arranged like *furniture*. Some were as though they were chairs, others tables, or beds. It was a horrible sight. They were perfectly still, their restraints so incredibly tight that they couldn't move, but each one, well, you could sense they were there, even if perfectly silent. They were alive. You were spooked, incredibly so, turning to leave and run out the house. But you find the door locked behind you, and quickly, you are grabbed, by a latex covered minion, how they were able to see you or sense you with every part of their body covered by this latex was unknown. You realise the minion came *from the wall*, giving a new meaning to the walls being able to hear.

From the back room, a door opens, as the queen of the castle herself walks towards you. She was dressed in rubber as well, and it wasn't unusual to see her like this, but this time it was sinister, fetish-y even. A tight black corset with matching thigh high boots, latex underwear and a little dominatrix cap to add that final touch to the whole 'Psycho Dominatrix' look she was excellent at. ""My, my, what have we hear? A little stray?"" She beckons to you, smirking. More people arise from the walls, yourself quickly realising that the walls, ceiling, even the floor, were people, *living* people, all trapped in latex and tied up. They surround you, ripping your clothes off within seconds, and leaving you naked, before returning to their 'place'. The USB stick falls to the floor, and she picks it up, observing it for a moment. ""It's so good of you to bring this to me. I was getting a bit worried you know. Everyone saying my designs are outdated, that yours are the way of the future... Well, let's just say that i'll be reigning on top for just a little while longer for now."" She smirks, hiding the USB stick away before turning your attention to you. You can't help but notice the needle in her other hand, filled with a dark blue liquid, before smirking. ""I imagine you must be confused? Don't worry, everything will become clear in time, and you'll soon realise your purpose, your *only* purpose in life. You see, you're not a human. Not really. You're an object, a living one at that. You don't think, you are only told to think. You are destined for this, but you already knew that didn't you? You want this. Give in and become my object. Give in, and become what you've always needed to be!"" She rants on, before suddenly jabbing the needle into your neck. You pass out, slowly, but not before struggling in great fear and anger. But when you would awaken, you would begin your new life.

You're not a person. Not anymore. You're just an object, a rubber doll in human form, a toy for her to degrade, to abuse, to do whatever she wants to do to you. There is no escape, no serenity, no peace, no mercy. This is your fate, *forever*

-------------------------

I didn't mean for the whole thing to have a horror-esque feel to it. But what can I say? I'm a lover of all things spooky and weird, including sex! Summary: You're a designer for Lingerie company that specalises in latex, lace, satin, and all those other lovely materials, who is lured and trapped in the company's CEO and founder's basement. You will be transformed into a rubber slave, no, an object (though other materials will be there too, don't worry) with no chance of escape or mercy. Pretty bleak, if kinky, stuff. As you would expect, latex lovers are a must for this really. I am not looking for too many partners, maybe two or three or so, perhaps less, depending on how I feel. I am eager to meet my new partners regardless, and to hear their own ideas to what they want to add to the prompt, i'm always trying to be open ended! Kinks are pretty much endless for this, I want it to be a total fucking kink fetish, as weird and bizarre as you like it. I'm also ready to go pretty overboard with sadistic stuff as well, though we can play it less so if you prefer.

927sfa,1,2018-07-26,Help with cat bullying dog,Bnstates,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/927sfa/help_with_cat_bullying_dog/,"A bit of context: about a year or 2 ago, my mom got a cat to keep my dog company. My dog is getting older (he was 7 at the time), and she felt bad that he was home alone most of the day since I went off to college. We got the cat when it was a kitten, and my dog did not take to it whatsoever. He's one of the biggest babies you'd ever meet, he acts like he's still a little puppy (golden retriever) and he's scared of absolutely everything. My cat started noticing this fear and takes advantage of it now. 

It started out as mostly just play, and hell, it might still be mostly play, but my cat sometimes just jumps on my dog with his claws out and causes my dog pain (he yelps when it happens). He's terrified of the cat now. 

My mom was talking about declawing awhile back, but I tried my best to shut that idea down for 3 reasons: 

1) The cat had a mild case of food aggression, and he wasn't a fan of the food he was getting so he took it out on my dog when he got food. He likes his new food though and I don't believe theres been much hostility at dinner time, although I guess he does make my dog move when he's drinking water (the cat has his own water but likes to drink from the dogs)

2) As I'm gone for college most of the year (and internship in the summer), my cat is left to only my mom and my dog for entertainment. My dog doesn't want anything to do with him, and my mom doesn't do much with him besides feeding him. Her boyfriend's kid plays with him on the weekends, but i'm sure he doesn't get much more attention than that.

3) He's my cat, and I want what's best for him. I obviously love the crap out of my dog, but I think his scared nature amplifies the bullying and I don't want my cat to lose his claws because of it if he doesn't have to, when it might not even help.

Any tips for addressing the bullying, or maybe toughing up my dog? Should I be this worried about my cat getting declawed?

I searched for job and accepted a job this fall at  another bankruptcy firm. The other firm does complex restructuring. I agreed that I could work a minimum of 10 hours. This firm hired three interns for one office space meaning that only one intern can be in the office at a time.

927za4,1,2018-07-26,BF [23M] is in Thailand for a month without me [25F],Cibum2000,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/927za4/bf_23m_is_in_thailand_for_a_month_without_me_25f/,"Ok, so I am going a bit crazy. Well, not that much, but i am trying to contain myself as much as i can. 

I have been in a relationship with this guy for a few months and we have gotten quite serious, pretty quickly. It felt good to do it this way. We got along so well and i was finally able to actually commit to someone. I have not been in a relationship for 1,5 years before him because i didn't want to commit to anyone before that. Now i know why... 

Apparently i have a huge fear of commitment because i also have a huge fear of abandonment. He just left to Thailand a few days ago for a month. My thoughts are going everywhere. I have no clue how i can deal with specific feelings of him being so far away, afraid that he will forget about me, change his feelings, not being able to have him close to me, etc.. 

I have not been in a relationship before where my boyfriend left for this long. Especially to a place where there are so many amazing experiences. I do not only feel left out, but it also feels like we are missing many moments on which we would be able to connect with each other. I do want him to have fun and have an amazing time, but at the other side i don't want him to? This might sound cruel, but it just feels stupid that i'm here at home working, trying to earn money and doing some 'boring stuff'. It also counts for something that he's going to places i have been dying to go to for a really long time. I'm pretty jealous of that. And the fact that there are lots of drunk girls who probably make a move on him, ugh... 

The way i am trying to deal with this right now is to put my focus in my own development as a human being. I've gotten a new job, an internship and i'm doing some of the things i have been wanting to do for a long time. Only by doing this self improvement shit, i feel like im creating a greater distance between him and me. I can't get to share everything with him since the contact that we have is quite limited.

928jw4,14,2018-07-26,First Wig?,palindromeisme,Trichsters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trichsters/comments/928jw4/first_wig/,"Sorry very long post. I need to vent and could use some encouragement.


My hair is at the point where I can go without a hat if I spend a half hour applying makeup and Toppik to half my head. I've spread my pulling out enough that I'm not completely bald anywhere larger than a nickel and have juuuust enough baby hairs to make the makeup/Toppik work. But my spots aren't getting any better. And while last time this happened I handled it by wearing a beanie to class every day, now I'm graduated, finishing up an internship, and trying to get a job. Beanies aren't really an option at job interviews, and neither is embracing a shaved head by choice--not for the kind of job I want.


So I got a wig. I figured trying one on first would be best the first time, so I researched the best shop in town and went there. I also figured I shouldn't spend too much money when I'm still figuring out what works, so I went for a cheaper, synthetic, no lace front option. It was around $170.


The lady at the shop was very nice but spoke with a strong accent, making it difficult to understand what she was saying about the wigs. I kept nodding my head and pretending to understand. She asked if I have alopecia and I said yes so that I wouldn't have to explain anything.  She then gave me a 10% off alopecia discount, which made my husband insist I'd stolen from her by lying. I had no idea she would discount it and didn't realize what she was saying right away when she mentioned it at the register. Plus I'm pretty sure it was a general ""hair loss"" discount. Still, I feel bad.


The wig I ended up getting was only in gray at the store. That says something about the market for that style, but I've kept cutting my hair shorter to hide the damage, and I wanted a wig with a similar hair length to mine so I could plausibly tell people that I'd just gotten a new hair style. Anyway, since it was gray, the lady at the shop showed me color swatches and suggested something that I agreed to order. I picked the wig up today after waiting 9 days for it to ship. 


Turns out the color is my least favorite part, as it is noticably lighter than my eyebrows. I have very dark dark brown hair that I have always been proud of. This wig has little subtle blonde hairs that are supposed to make it look more natural but that don't match my solid block of brown, and it's a milk chocolate shade instead of my garden-dirt-in-a-bag shade.


The bangs are completely different from how I've been wearing my hair, and the wig looks a bit like a helmet on me. Plus the band I have to use to keep it on gives me a headache. 


I was feeling pretty good about the wig when I first picked it up and wore it grocery shopping before picking up my husband from work. Then he didn't like it at all and pointed out how it was shiny and too light. He told me everyone who already knows me, including my coworkers, will know it's a wig and not a new hairstyle. That got me down and I've been huddled in the bed under the covers ever since we got home.


I do appreciate my husband's honesty. It's one of the things we do in our marriage--we don't have to say unpleasant things if unasked, but if the other asks a question, we respond completely honestly. I trust him to tell me when I need to wear a hat or put more makeup on my head, which makes it easier to believe him when he says I look nice. 


That being said, he hasn't been handling the wig thing as well as I'd hoped. He's very sad for me, but even though it's for me, that sadness is getting in the way of him comforting me. He's pretty much just told me how he felt and then left me alone without noticing how much I need a hug, which is unusual because he's usually very intuitive. He's done this today and back when I ordered the wig last week. I've had to beg for comfort both times while he hasn't even seemed to register that I'm having mixed emotions and want some support. Even while giving me my hug last week he kept talking about his hobbies. 


I know it's completely natural for him to have difficulty with this, but it's frustrating having to take care of him and his doubts while I'm struggling. I was excited about the wig despite it's cheapness until I talked to him. Plus he knew this might happen before we got married, and he really played up how supportive he would be if it happened.


My plan was to buzz my hair and wear the wig wherever I wasn't comfortable going bareheaded. I was super excited to get rid of the mess on my head and to give my scalp a break. On the grocery trip today I bought a pair of clippers for the job. But now I'm scared to do it, since I'd have to wear the wig to work. 


On top of everything else, I haven't told any family that I bought a wig yet, and I'm not looking forward to that discussion.


Sorry for the rant. It's just I've been trying to be positive and excited and to have mature, realistic expectations, but now I'm sad. I just want this hair off my head but I don't know if I can wear the wig I bought if I buzz everything, and I am not brave enough to go to my internship or to job interviews like that. 


Plus my husband talked me into joining a twelve step program that starts next month, which might be nice for the support, but I have no idea how it will help with something like hair pulling. 


Any encouragement is nice, but thanks for letting me word vomit here."

Some FUTA options as well.",dppthrowaway1394,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/929d6t/m4am_playing_f_older_woman_as_affair_with_younger/,"**I am an adult looking for another 18+ year old adult for a fantasy rolepay.**

Please have the Discord app as I mainly prefer to chat on it because of all of its user friendly features (mainly editing posts if mistakes happen).

I'm a male but I’m looking to play as the older woman so I’m looking for someone to be the boy.  I'd like the mother to be pretty much based off actress Milla Jovovich and I have a specific idea in mind for the boy but because of the new rules I'm not allowed to say his name.  PM me and we can talk about it (if you don’t like the choice we could possibly change him if need be).  She would be in her mid-30s to early 40s and he would be around 13-15.

I was thinking of three possible scenarios (all amendable) and I’m open to any other possible suggestions.

1 - Mom/step mom is about to get married and she is in her dress at the church waiting for the ceremony to start.  The son/step son could walk in on her and confess his feelings for her and for what ever reason she decides to give into temptation and have sex with him.  Maybe she tells him it has to be a one time thing to get out of his system but once she see's his surprisingly large dick she becomes obsessed with how it stretches her out.

An alternate take on this could be that the boy is some what evil and he blackmails the groom into writing a letter saying the wedding is off (perhaps he threatened to start saying he molested him) and when she finds out that her big day has been ruined he comes in to comfort her, with or with out her really wanting to have sex with him.

2 - Option two is that she is a married woman in a rather loveless marriage.  They are fairly wealthy and the husband provides her with pretty much everything she needs...except for routine fucking.  Alternatively, she could be completely single and be yearning for her next conquest (especially if it’s extremely risky). One day she comes home from grocery shopping and notices a moving truck next door and spots the absolutely beautiful son of the new neighbors and her minds starts going to dark sexual places.  After a while, some light teasing and exhibitionism beings to take place and one day the next door boy comes over and overs to clean her pool/mow her lawn.  She gets into a sexy bikini and goes out to the pool to tan and gives him something to look at and she starts to notice his big dick in his shorts.

This concept is highly editable and the two of them could be made to be related instead.

3 - Kind of stole this third idea from someone else’s post and made some edits since I liked the idea of it so much.

It was like any other day at the park, a comic book in his hard, the same bench in the shade of the tree as he looked at the people jogging on the track. There was one woman though who decided to come and sit next to him on the bench to tighten her shoe laces but she did strike a conversation with him.
""Are you alone here?"" she asked him, bending down to tie her laces.
""Umm yeah, who are you?"" he asked, lowering his comic to look at her.
""Oh no one I was just doing my run there and I noticed you over here. Thought I'd come by and give you a piece of advice"" she said.
""Oh what's that miss?"" he asked, in a sweet tone, closing his comic book and placing it on his lap.
""Well, sweetie those shorts aren't hiding anything"" she said with the warmest smile on her face. It was embarrassing when she said that at all. Maybe she meant it like a compliment.
It was hard after all to keep a __ inch cock concealed in these shorts!

This idea could feature a bunch of different options.  We could be complete and total strangers meeting my chance.  It could piggyback of the theme of option 2 and we actually live in the same neighborhood and this is how we approach each other. I could be a mom and my son could go to the same school as you and I’ve seen you at parent teacher meeting and other school functions.  Or I could be a teacher at your school and I’ve seen you walking through the halls before.  Many options to be decided on this one.

So those are my three ideas but I'm willing to take any suggestions if anyone is interested.  I’d also be willing to play multiple women and include a sister character or have a secret (or not so secret) girlfriend on the side.  Group role play is also acceptable.

My only hard limits are snuff, gore, vore, and scat.  Lingerie, feet and shoes (especially platforms) are a plus.  Anal, water sports, cum shots (facials and cream pies) that are larger that normal, public/risky sex, clothed sex, handjobs, squirting, sleep/wake up sex, oral sex (especially giving while the other person is busy doing something else’s like talking on the phone or playing video games with a headset on), smoking,stomach distention/inflation, fisting, beast and a lot more are all acceptable kinks in my book.

Some ideas for FUTA prompts.

Like above, I’d want my character to be based off Milla Jovovich (specially the first few photo options in the link below).  The other roles can also be based off actors, models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis.
https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13943

A)  I would be the boss or a high level executive at some kind of company.  You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship).  I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me.  After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard.  Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.
   
This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe you’re the kid of an employee and you’re in the building for some reason).

B)  I’m a teacher or P.E. teacher/coach at a school.  I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before before.  This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/couch maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office.  I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited.  Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing.  You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s.  You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s.  For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass, Mathilda from The Professional or any number of possibilities.

C)  Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where.  I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place.  For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car.  You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment.  Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do."

1. What do your day to day activities look like during busy season? If you're currently pushing cells on a spreadsheet all day, what project are you doing this for?
2. In your opinion, what are some of the things that you (yourself) can do to become more efficient at your job or whatever project you're working on right now? If you're not up to anything at the moment, in retrospect, what were some things that you could have done during busy season to make your life a bit easier in terms of getting stuff done before deadlines, etc.
3. In your opinion, what qualities in a person make a good tax accountant? Or is this a career where you generally just gain more experience and wisdom as you spend your life doing this?

Yeah sorry if this seems like some sort of freshman career interview lmao, but I'm actually genuinely just curious. Feel free to share your insights, thoughts, and advice on the tax accounting career as a whole. Cheers!"

The real question is, why am I a secret?

1) You're just plain tired of your love life being front page news on the gossip websites

2) I am scandalously younger than you, maybe not even old enough to drive to see you

3) Officially you're my boss (intern, PA, actor on your first project behind the camera, etc... )

4) We are related. Top choice is brother/sister but open to cousins, aunt/nephew, or even mother/son

5) I live out in some rural small town that could not handle the news you were visiting, much less sleeping with me

6) Some combination of the above. Most of these are not mutually exclusive, and some even work better together

As for kinks and limits, I'm pretty vanilla... specifically into agegaps, incest, cumplay, oral, teasing, body worship, and maybe anal or impreg... but let me know what you're into as long as it's consensual and no scat, gore, blood, bimbo, drug use, non-con, or BDSM as those are my hard limits.

This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 18-25 and their gender could be male or female.

B)  I’m a teacher or P.E. teacher/coach at a school.  I could be a teacher you have a class with every single day or I could be someone that teaches at the school but you never had me as a teacher.  This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/couch maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office.  I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited.  Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing.  You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s.  You could be a female or male student.

C)  Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where.  I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place.  For your character you could be a young driver that has just been in their first minor accident or you’re freaking out over an odd noise you’ve been hearing.  You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes of getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment."

Can we easily reverse this? We're looking at it now today and don't know how to reverse it. 

Any advice on how to fix this would be greatly appreciated. I'm an intern and this is just a huge mountain of work, and I need this to run as smooth possible. Thanks in advance "

EDIT: I should've said that I am an information systems major

I've been subscribed here for a few days and I've visited many times in the past. I love this sub! Anyways, Im a college student and I've got 4 years of help-desk experience. I just got my first internship that im trying to turn into junior system administrator. With that known, you can probably guess why I am here.

So I told my boss I was going to buy a dell t20 tower server to start practicing powershell and vmware (at my company we are going througha hybrid cloud migration and I want to be the front runner in knowledge). And he told me to take an old supermicro sever (2013 16gb ram xeon intel, and as many HDD as i need). Awesome!! super pumped. So I brought it home last night and I began set-up.

So as I understand installing the hypervisor comes first (or should I install an operating system like win server first)? I think I'm going to go with vmware esxi because it is what we will be using at work for our virtual machines. Now I can install this through the optical drive and thats fine. I will probably have a network folder for other ISO's - I saw that functionality in Xenserver.

Lingering questions you can answer if you want but otherwise I'll be researching for more definitive answers

If im going to do a Raid 0 set-up do I need to set up the disks first or is this something I can do after installation?

What is the domain controller, software or hardware? Do I need to install one of these?

Can I access my different virtual machines via ip address? further, does each virtual machine get its own ip address while its running on the network?

Thanks everyone. If you have any questions about linux or scripting (sorry still working on PS) I'd be happy to trade answers with you just pm me your question if you answer something here. I really appreciate it."

We are in our last days of the fundraiser! Powerful gentrifying forces are rapidly changing Manhattan’s Chinatown and the stakes are high. Those whose livelihoods are most impacted often do not have a platform to voice their concerns. The W.O.W. Project works to amplify these community voices.  
The W.O.W Project was born from a turning point in the survival of the oldest shop in Chinatown, a five-generation owned family business that has witnessed almost a century of change in the neighborhood. It is a women-led initiative that has the mission of sustaining ownership over Chinatown's future by growing and protecting Chinatown's creative culture through arts and activism.  This past year, we worked on this mission by:

* Hosting **18 public programs**, including our Homeward Bound series which highlights everyday resilience in Chinatowns around the world 
* Mentoring **10 interns** providing them grassroots community organizing experience and leadership skills
* Supporting an emerging Asian American artist through our **storefront artist residency** which included 17 community paper cutting workshops with over 100 participants
* And completing our first year-long youth-led **Resist Recycle Regenerate** program which included political activism, oral history and papermaking workshops that taught 5 Asian American young women skills to explore their own histories of migration and to share with the community by making paper out of collected confetti during the Lunar New Year parade. 

**Now, this is where → YOU ← come in!**  
To celebrate this year of growth and raise funds so we can continue our cultural organizing in a time of rapid cultural displacement, we are asking you to **contribute to this crowdfunding campaign** to launch the W.O.W. Project into its 3rd year of programming. Your money will go directly towards developing our public programs, youth internships, 店面/storefront Artist Residency, and the Resist, Recycle, Regenerate papermaking project. For example, **$1500** allows us to invite experts to teach our Resist, Recycle, Regenerate fellows different skills to share back with the community, **$1000** will help us buy all the necessary supplies for our artist in residence to hold community workshops, **$350** will cover costs for one public event, **$100** will bring a youth intern to a workshop that will help them develop their personal projects. 

*There are some fantastic rewards for donors including\*:*

* ***W.O.W. Elder 長老 - $3000 or more*** *- everything listed below + recognition as a W.O.W. donor on our website and honorary plaque put up at the shop* 
* ***W.O.W. Auntie/Uncle 阿姨 /叔叔 - $1000 or more -*** *a hand painted customized ceramic bulldog + an annual membership to the Museum of Chinese in America*

TLDR below.

I’m 21 f,  born and raised in Vietnam but have spent the last 3 years in college in the states. My parents are from two different countries but are both south East Asians. Anyways it’s my mom (Vietnamese) who I’m struggling to deal with.

Let me start by stating that I’ve never had an abusive relationship with any of my parents, they’ve provided me with an amazing education and a comfortable life, even enough to send me abroad for higher education which neither of them ever had. But at the same time , they are workaholics and we were never super close and just talked over dinner a few times a week,  

Anyways, here’s the story, I’ve been abroad for the last 3 years and have been visiting once a year, things have been good but for some reason my mother had been very judge mental about everything I’ve done. These were the things she’s complaining to my WHOLE FAMILY about while I was SITTING THERE listening over coffee.

1. How my goal of wanting to become a vet is a waste of time and money and it’s stupid to waste my effort on saving animals while there’s millions of people that needs help saving. .. I wanted to become a field medic and it was a strict no so I chose to go to vet school.. this was fine a year ago, 

2. How she wished she had children that was more like an intern (about my age) “D” at our family business. Her exact words “D Is super smart and hardworking and learned the business just like that. Our eldest (me) won’t learn the business(false) yet we have an outsiders that’s so willing to, hes also trying to study pharmacology in the states when he gets a chance.. only if one of our kids was a fraction of  D” .. she said this right when both of her children was listening at the table, In my defense I wanted to learn the business instead of going to college but was denied the opportunity because it “would’ve been too challenging for a female” - her words. 

3. She constantly criticized how I dress, how I carry myself and doubts everything I do,  I don’t wear anything too revealing in my opinion. Nothing that shows my cleavage or stomach. Shorts and skirts are always longer than my finger tips. My back may be more exposed as I like to wear spaghetti straps. My bra straps shows on occasion but not my actual bra. Etc. I always need to act more feminine and get fat shamed constantly. I’ve struggled with my weight growing up but have finally become more confident this year before this visit but now she just shattered all my confidence, 

Everything she says has hit and hurt me bad, I’ve struggled with depression and spending time around her is starting to make me feel worse and worse. I am so upset with myself and want to give up, but I also want to get her out of my life and prove her wrong. I want to stand up to her and study what I want but I’m so dependent on my parents and it’s considered disrespectful in my culture. I want to live my own life but i feel like I can’t if I want to maintain our relationship, 

Is the relationship worth salvaging? Or is it pointless ..? Am I being disrespectful for not wanting to make her happy? Please help., 

TLDR; mother is unhappy about my life choices and making toxic comments about me in front of my family with my presence.. what should I do?"

92f16z,1,2018-07-27,"[M4A](M playing F) Older woman as affair with younger son, step son, stranger or student. Some FUTA options included.",dppthrowaway1394,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/92f16z/m4am_playing_f_older_woman_as_affair_with_younger/,"I am an adult looking for another 18+ year old adult for a fantasy rolepay.

Please have the Discord app as I mainly prefer to chat on it because of all of its user friendly features (mainly editing posts if mistakes happen).

I'm a male but I’m looking to play as the older woman so I’m looking for someone to be the boy. I'd like the mother to be pretty much based off actress Milla Jovovich and I have a specific idea in mind for the boy but because of the new rules I'm not allowed to say his name. PM me and we can talk about it (if you don’t like the choice we could possibly change him if need be). She would be in her mid-30s to early 40s and he would be around 13-15.

I was thinking of three possible scenarios (all amendable) and I’m open to any other possible suggestions.

1 - Mom/step mom is about to get married and she is in her dress at the church waiting for the ceremony to start. The son/step son could walk in on her and confess his feelings for her and for what ever reason she decides to give into temptation and have sex with him. Maybe she tells him it has to be a one time thing to get out of his system but once she see's his surprisingly large dick she becomes obsessed with how it stretches her out.

An alternate take on this could be that the boy is some what evil and he blackmails the groom into writing a letter saying the wedding is off (perhaps he threatened to start saying he molested him) and when she finds out that her big day has been ruined he comes in to comfort her, with or with out her really wanting to have sex with him.

2 - Option two is that she is a married woman in a rather loveless marriage. They are fairly wealthy and the husband provides her with pretty much everything she needs...except for routine fucking. Alternatively, she could be completely single and be yearning for her next conquest (especially if it’s extremely risky). One day she comes home from grocery shopping and notices a moving truck next door and spots the absolutely beautiful son of the new neighbors and her minds starts going to dark sexual places. After a while, some light teasing and exhibitionism beings to take place and one day the next door boy comes over and overs to clean her pool/mow her lawn. She gets into a sexy bikini and goes out to the pool to tan and gives him something to look at and she starts to notice his big dick in his shorts.

This concept is highly editable and the two of them could be made to be related instead.

3 - Kind of stole this third idea from someone else’s post and made some edits since I liked the idea of it so much.

It was like any other day at the park, a comic book or phone in his hard, the same bench in the shade of the tree as he looked at the people jogging on the track. There was one woman though who decided to come and sit next to him on the bench to tighten her shoe laces and she started up a conversation with him.

""Are you alone here?"" she asked him, bending down to tie her laces.

""Umm yeah, who are you?"" he asked, lowering his comic/phone to look at her.

""Oh no one I was just doing my run there and I noticed you over here. Thought I'd come by and give you a piece of advice"" she said.

""Oh what's that miss?"" he asked, in a sweet tone.

""Well, sweetie...those shorts aren't hiding anything"" she said with the warmest smile on her face. 

It was embarrassing when she said that. Maybe she meant it like a compliment.
It was hard after all to keep a __ inch cock concealed in these shorts!

This idea could feature a bunch of different options. We could be complete and total strangers meeting my chance. It could piggyback of the theme of option 2 and we actually live in the same neighborhood and this is how we approach each other. I could be a mom and my son could go to the same school as you and I’ve seen you at parent teacher meeting and other school functions. Or I could be a teacher at your school and I’ve seen you walking through the halls before. Many options to be decided on this one.

So those are my three ideas but I'm willing to take any suggestions if anyone is interested. I’d also be willing to play multiple women and include a sister character or have a secret (or not so secret) girlfriend on the side. Group role play is also acceptable.

My only hard limits are snuff, gore, vore, and scat. Lingerie, feet and shoes (especially platforms) are a plus. Anal, water sports, cum shots (facials and cream pies) that are larger that normal, public/risky sex, clothed sex, handjobs, squirting, sleep/wake up sex, oral sex (especially giving while the other person is busy doing something else’s like talking on the phone or playing video games with a headset on), smoking,stomach distention/inflation, fisting, beast and a lot more are all acceptable kinks in my book.

Here is a link to some pictures of Milla to give some visual references plus some dick pics for the boy’s genitals to be modeled after.

———————-

Some ideas for FUTA prompts.

Like above, I’d want my character to be based off Milla Jovovich (specially the first few photo options in the link below). The other roles can also be based off actors, models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis. https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13943

A) I would be the boss or a high level executive at some kind of company. You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship). I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me. After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard. Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.

This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe you’re the kid of an employee and you’re in the building for some reason).

B) I’m a teacher or P.E. teacher/coach at a school. I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before before. This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/couch maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office. I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited. 

Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing. You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s. You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s. For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass, Mathilda from The Professional or any number of possibilities.

C) Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where. I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place. For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car. You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment. 

Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do."

So I was recently hired to be an RSP teacher for an elementary school for this upcoming school year. Though I don't know about my caseload yet, I know the model is mostly push-in with occasional pull-out for small groups/assessments, etc. The school will have 2 other RSP teachers with varying experience (for support considerations) and I'll probably have about 25 IEPs to juggle. Anyway, I was just informed that a position just opened up in a middle school for an SDC class of about 10 students. The class is mild/mod - I don't know a ton about the students yet but I know there is a very supportive and experienced teacher in another SDC on campus that would be an excellent resource. 

My question - as a first year teacher (and INTERN, on top of that) do you all think it would be better to start in an SDC class with a small case load and less schedules to juggle or should I stick with RSP and not have to worry about setting up a class and everything else that comes with it? I see the pros and cons of each. The large caseload seems overwhelming but I like the idea of collaborating with the gen ed teachers. 

A lot to consider and I need to make a decision relatively quickly so any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!! Either way it will be a crazy first year (and beyond!)

I really need some advice on this situation, as I'm not really sure who to talk to about it.

Basically, Former Best Friend (FBF) and I became friends 2 years ago now. He was a package deal, with a big group of other friends who I'm not really close to anymore, save for one: Other Best Friend (OBF). I also met my SO of 2 years via them, and we are in a very happy, settled relationship. That is not why I am here. 

FBF and I became very close friends very fast. We thought the same stuff was funny, and had shared a lot of the same issues when it came to mental health. He was like a brother to me, I had absolutely no feelings other than platonic friendship. He of course had something different in regards to me, as it goes. About 2 months into our initial friendship, he told me he needed to ""take a break"" from our friendship, since he had feelings for me and needed to clear his head. I was hurt, but I understood. I really wished it didnt have to be that way but obviously didnt want to further upset him, or lead him on. 

A month or so went by of no contact, until he finally told me he was ready to be friends again, and had a clear head. And things were fine from that point on. Nothing weird, no weird vibes, nada. Until OBF (who also used to be extremely good friends with him too) left for an internship, and he began to want to hang around me more and more during school. Which was understandable. The 3 of us were inseparable, until the 2 of us were forced to wait a few months for our third musketeer to come back. However, they began to have falling outs while OBF was gone, and I was caught in the middle. This continued when OBF came back, AND when OBF began dating her current SO. 

Fast forward to last November. In the months leading up to this, OBF and FBF had been acting like my divorced and estranged parents whom had shared custody of me, and didnt really care for that at all. Neither told me I couldnt remain friends with the other, they just couldnt stand to be around each other but respected the friendship I had with the other. Then I was talking to OBF's SO, whom I have now become very good friends with, whom never really got along with FBF, even before his relationship with OBF. OBF's SO told me that FBF had been talking about me at work in a very...romantic sense. Not a huge problem if it was from before he got over his crush, still weird but to be expected. But no....OBF's SO claims it was recent. As in, a year into our friendship when FBF knew I was with my SO. I, however, was floored by this and didnt know what to do. I also dont deal well with confrontation. So I just blocked FBF on all accounts, and cut ties cold turkey. Not the best way of dealing with things by any means, but tends to be how I do things because I am not a fighter. 

However, once the immediate anger calmed, I began to have regrets. I've still been having these regrets, or at least...second guessings, I should say. I'm not sure if I did the right thing, considering OBF and her SO could've made this up/slightly fabricated it because they dont like FBF, and didnt want me to like FBF anymore either. 

Basically, I just dont know if I did the right thing. I realize it's now July, and I havent spoken to FBF since November, and i dont think FBF would even want to speak to me anymore....but I miss that friendship. We've seen each other around since then and it's just been so weird ignoring each other. I still remain that I have no feelings other than platonic, I just miss my friend. We had a lot of good laughs together. I cant tell if I miss FBF, or if I miss a friendship that will never be the way it once was when it was in its golden days. I am conflicted.

tl;dr I havent spoken to my former best friend in months since a weird, possible misunderstanding/possible not so great situation. Cut ties and burned bridges, not sure if I should reach out, or if my sadness over a lost friendship will eventually go away.

Edited to add: the week before I found out about what he had supposedly been saying, he was weirdly in my personal space a lot....like sitting next to me, and not listening when i asked him to please move over a bit, because I'm weird about my personal space. He took it as a joke and kept doing it, thinking I wasnt being serious, until i had to kind of snap at him to back up because I really didnt like anyone being that close. This was the only issue otherwise though, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. "

I've browsed Reddit in the past and felt the community here is great. I'll spare you a ton of detail, but I'm 21 years old and go to one of the top business schools in Canada. I come from a middle class family in extremely small town and go to school with, mostly, wealthy kids from Toronto who I feel are all smarter than me. At my school, students are often characterized by the prestige of their summer internships and their grades. I failed to get a summer job like the rest of my class and have spent the summer living with my parents working 2 minimum wage jobs while the rest of my friends are in Toronto and the US working, which has led me to feel completely ashamed of myself. My long-term goal has always been to be a lawyer and I've already taken the LSAT twice and will be writing it again in September because I didn't do well enough the first couple of times. 

Right now, it's looking like the best course for me is to take a year or two off after my undergrad is finished (I'm going into 4th year) to work and apply to law school after. I'm terrified that no one will hire me without a solid internship behind me from this current summer and I'll be left with a mountain of debt to pay off and will be forced back to my small town to work another minimum wage job for god knows how long. A big part of me just feels like I'm too stupid to actually do a job in the real, corporate world like so many of my peers are doing and will do. My parents are unsupportive of my law school aspirations and don't think I can do it, which makes the whole situation worse. I was turned down by many jobs during the recruiting process leading up to this summer as well, which has just left me feeling undesirable in general. What's wrong with me? 

Over the last couple of months I've had thoughts of suicide because of all this. I feel like I'll never get into law school. I feel like I'm never going to get a job that pays well enough for me to live in the city and enjoy my life. I feel like I'll never find love because who will want to be with someone that can't support them? I feel like committing suicide just puts an end to all of this. I've worked so insanely hard to get to where I am right now and I feel like it's all for nothing because of where I am right now. Has anyone experienced something similar? I'd love to hear your story and you dealt with it. I could really use some words of wisdom right now. Thank you so much for reading this."

I will be graduating next spring with a double degree in geophysics and computer science from a very oil &amp; gas focused school. I did an internship at a major O&amp;G company during one of my summers and did not enjoy the work I was doing very much, so I am thinking I want to try to get a mineral exploration type job when I graduate.

In my experience with O&amp;G, the answer to my programming question is ""it depends"". Seems like some places use externally developed software for nearly everything and some have a mix of external and in-house stuff. I would guess it would be the same in mining, but I would be curious to hear from people actually in the industry. 

I am going to have to be cold calling/emailing people looking for a job since we don't get many (if any at all) mining related recruiters at the career fair. My hope is that the CS degree will give me a leg up when I am doing that, kind of a useful in the field with the geophysics and during the off season with CS type thing. Is this realistic?

Thank you in advance!"

I only have 3 months to find a job based on my current savings, so it has to be one that I can easily get.  Obviously, im researching this online constantly, but figured getting some other thoughts would be well worth the time.


I am simply looking for advice on what would be a good ""resume builder"" part time or full time job in the Columbus area for a recent college grad.  Anything remotely related to tech would be strongly preferred, or something office related at least. I have significant coding experience and excellent computer skills (Excel, Word, PowerPoint).  I had 3 coding internships during college as well.  So any companies hiring for IT, tech support, call center, QA, site admin, anything like that would be strongly preferred.  (My goal is to find a junior or mid developer full time role, but it seems that's probably going to take 6 months to a year to get settled as it is fairly competitive right now.)


That all said, If it's a good opportunity and still not a ""real"" job, I'd definitely be willing to consider it.  I'm trying to avoid service type jobs simply so I can have a better resume and something more interesting to talk about in interviews, but definitely not above them.   Not at all if they pay well.  For example, i saw some field technician positions available I was interested in (never heard back though). 


Tl;Dr, Recent OSU bachelor of science that's having trouble with bills right now and sincerely appreciate any career advice, particularly if specific to companies hiring in the Columbus area.  I have 3 months to find a job based on my current savings (4 months to get paid), so I'm looking for things that I can very easily jump into.  I have a professional resume and pretty decent tech internships from college, and about 6 years work experience in total.  I also have a car so I am mobile.  Very flexible with anywhere from 25-40 hours per week, also flexible with pay, needs to pay only $11 an hour."
92giup,1,2018-07-27,Fear of investing in a bull market,elicik1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/92giup/fear_of_investing_in_a_bull_market/,"I am 20 years old, and I have a little more cash than I could reasonably use after my summer internship. I have about $2000 of income that I'm comfortable putting away for investing. Currently, my thought was to invest $1000 in an index fund for a long term (\~10 years), thinking that at age 30, I probably will be at the point where I am considering a house or marriage. I also was going to put another $1000 into a Roth IRA because even though it is difficult to know that I'm not going to see that money for at least 40 years, I've seen the power of compound interest. I would obviously add to both of these once I have money to do so.

Right now I am a little bit afraid to bite the bullet with regards to the index fund. Looking at the S&amp;P, it looks to me like everything is prime to crash fairly soon. Last recession it took 5 years to recover back to where it was at the start. I'm worried that if I invest now, it's going to be a waste of 5 years, and I really should invest once the market has crashed. Does it make sense to invest now and just hope that the recovery is quick/the gain beforehand is good, or should I wait a year or two? Does the idea that the market **always** bounces back mean that investing is always better than waiting?"

I'm looking to get into algorithmic trading and was wondering what a good way to start was. I've checked out quantstart for example but it seems extensive. A bit about my background first, I have a BS in EE CS from a top UC school and I also work as an software engineering intern right now at a well known Fintech company. My backgrounds pretty heavy in CS + EE and mathematics as well and I'm excited to apply my skills towards trading and algorithms where I can also use my software development skills. I also have an offer for a winter internship as a quant dev/analyst a small fund on wallstreet. I'm also deciding on an MFE/CS/applied econ math program next fall or spring as deadlines are coming up.

Desire: I would like to understand more about algorithmic trading platforms and of course to begin trading, I'd like to learn how to apply my background in ML to markets as well but my main goal is starting slow. I want to do this before my internship begins. I've also began using robinhood and it's alot of fun, I'd love to play around with their api.

My questions:

1) My main questions pertains towards the finance side. I don't have trading experience and would like to learn within the next three months. I'd like to learn more about backtesting and begin simulated algorithmic trading with fictitious money before moving on to actual money. Any tips on this?

2) What platform should I look into to learn more about trading, I'm thinking about equities first and then looking into something like forex or even crypto. Unless a better suggestion you have in mind. I'm mainly interested in commission free and no fees, if that even exists. I know robinhood does this but is there a desktop based platform? 

3) I'm curious about the inner working of algorithmic trading. Are most people using just an autonomous algorithm they run that connects to an exchange/broker? Or are most people building their own exchanges and testing on both?

4)If there's any good articles or guides/videos you've seen that are applicable that would be great."

Whatever we had lasted four months, the first person I felt truly put an effort into anything.

Now she’s cold, self absorbed, depressed because of low self esteem. She complains to me regularly about her friends and her nights out and her experiences with other men, she’s even seeing someone new now who seems great and nice. But after whatever we had took a nosedive for whatever reason it did, I’ve been feeling insanely lonely for such an unbelievably long time. I can’t talk to her like I used to, venting to her falls on deaf ears, all our conversations basically consist of banter or her issues.

Hearing about this new guy is only draining my self esteem and making me feel lonelier for one reason or another, I want to be happy for her, I really do, but all I feel is self hatred? Complete exhaustion?

I live in a country where online dating is nonexistent, where conservative/ religious culture makes approaching new people almost impossible unless they’re friends of friends.  And when I travel abroad for my studies, I can make friends, and meet people, but I can’t seem to get them to be interested in me or to put anywhere near similar levels of effort in me, it makes me feel like something’s wrong with me.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve plenty to be proud of myself about, I’ve done pretty well for myself so far, academically and extracurricularly, with internships in large international companies, good grades, charitable work and various skills and hobbies. But I still feel extremely inferior and under appreciated and alone every day I come back home.
How can I fix that? 

*TL/DR* my friendship with an ex is exhausting me, and I want to be able to feel better about myself so that I could be a better friend, but I don’t know how to fix loneliness or self esteem."
92h42j,17,2018-07-27,Struggling with the decision on whether or not to enter the field,tjg8399,psychotherapy,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychotherapy/comments/92h42j/struggling_with_the_decision_on_whether_or_not_to/,"Hi everyone-

This sub has been such a big help over the past several months as I've explored a possible career transition to psychotherapy. Now, with several weeks before grad school starts and a $50k+ loan offer (untouched as of now) burning a hole through my inbox, I've been fighting cold feet and struggling to decide whether or not this is the right decision for me. 

This field definitely excites me. I had a group advising session the other week and left feeling energized after discussing the courses, research opportunities, and internship possibilities with the Program Director. I've struggled over the past several years with feeling disengaged, disinterested, and unmotivated in my current career, and don't believe I'd feel the same way as a psychotherapist. 

However, the amount of time and financial sacrifice it would take to become licensed is really causing me to doubt this decision. Not only would I realistically need to cut back to part-time work during the 3 years of grad school, there's the supervisory period struggle, and once finally licensed, still only make ~ $40-50k. PP is my main goal, and I know there's good money to be had if you can run your business well, but that's an additional few years of start-up costs. All in all, the whole process from school to PP could potentially be 8+ years of financial hardship while trying to pay back tens of thousands of dollars in debt.

I understand there's something to be said for doing work you are excited and passionate about. I would love to feel that way, for the first time in my life. However, there is something to be said for financial stability and freedom as well. I've know people who LOVE their work, but are perpetually frustrated by financial hardship and live with a chip on their shoulder because of it. I don't want to be that person. 

I guess I have no real question, just wanted to vent a bit and see if anyone struggles/struggled with similar thoughts, and how it worked out for you whether or not you pursued this route.  Feel free to throw some supportive thoughts and positive experiences of your own my way, too. :)

Thanks all! "
92hbtr,10,2018-07-27,"How I ensured I will never relapse again, and the answer to the Opioid Crisis",TylerFortierPhoto,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/92hbtr/how_i_ensured_i_will_never_relapse_again_and_the/,"My name is Tyler Sang-Tae Fortier. I am 25. In some way, I have been an addict since I was 13, up until roughly 3 years ago. From 13-18 I did inhalants, 18-19 was Benzodiazepines (Anti-anxiety drugs / Ativan), Self-Injury was 19-20, 21-22 was excessive alcohol, and technically you can consider me still an addict of caffeine (coffee), alcohol (responsibly), and to some extent video games (because up until a few months ago it was not an addiction disorder).

Basically, the “formula” or steps I have observed happened I have used to justify any of my addictions are as follows:

1: Traumatic event happens (or anything negative used to justify starting said addiction)

2: I use traumatic event to justify starting the addiction (drug use, alcohol, self harm, etc) because I believe, unknowingly or not, I should “punish” myself for the event happening, even if I had absolutely no control over it

3: In some way I feel good, whether it be literal, like dopamine rushing to my brain to reward said punishment, or metaphorical, because I still believe I “deserve” to be punished

4: If it involved dopamine, I go into withdrawal. Regardless, I feel like crap because I knew very well that I shouldn’t have done what I have done.

5: Steps \[1\] and \[2\] combine. I very well now believe I have done something negative to affect myself. I then use that information to justify continuing the addiction. The cycle keeps on repeating.

Here is how I learned how to break the cycle. I have to realize that whether I like it or not, I cannot change the past. I can either continue making the same mistake, or learn from it. Here is the hard part: Even if I learn from it, that doesn’t mean I will not make the same mistake unless I make a very conscious decision never to repeat the mistake, whether that means changing my environment, the people I decide to surround myself with, or both. This was the hardest part, but it ensured I will never repeat the mistake again: I have to do this for myself. I am going to say nearly the same idea but with different wording:

1: I am affecting the people that care about me, therefor I must change for them

2: I am affecting the people that care about me, therefor I must change myself, in order for myself to not affect them

Both technically work. \[1\] is highly unsustainable though. I have tried being sober with \[1\]’s mindset, but it was highly negatively impacting my mental health. Eventually I was bound to relapse. Once I realized that even though \[2\] is much harder, and honestly I can’t even guarantee I won’t relapse in the future, the chance of me relapsing, believing in \[2\], is much much lower than believing in \[1\].

Now I really don’t need to disclose this, but I feel like I should to help people. \[Trigger warnings galore below\].

INHALANTS (13 -18)

When I was 13 I was sexually assaulted. From 13-18 I did inhalants to attempt to forget it happened (self medication like this never works. Trust me) instead of telling people. When I was 18 I asked my dietician who was filling out my blood work which would later lead to me getting diagnosed with a gluten allergy, to also test me for HIV, and that’s how I initially told someone about the assault (fortunately I tested negative). That was a huge burden lifted from me, I accepted the mistake and learned that no matter what I did, it happened, and I can not change that. I got the sexual assault awareness ribbon (teal) tattoo’d on my right shoulder with the words “I survived” (so if you ever see a (currently) 25yr old Korean kid that looks like he’s younger than 16, it’s probably me), because not only had I come to peace that it happened, I wanted other survivors, especially male, to realize that even though the US justice system currently has a very hard time sentencing rapists to long prison sentences, you are not alone in this struggle.

BENZODIAZPINES (18-20)

So literally every addiction I’ve had during, and after this, was the Inhalant abuse, which up until recently I never bothered to tell people. I remember extremely little of these years because abusing Benzo’s causes huge chunks of time to seem to just disappear. I was not lying about having severe panic attacks. I was not lying that I never did, and still have no idea what causes me to get them. The justification for me abusing them was that this was when I started realizing that the inhalant abuse really screwed with my short term memory. No matter how many anti-psychotics I was on, every time I had a lapse in memory, I felt like I caused it due to the inhalants. The irony with this is, even though at the time I had no idea, abusing Benzo’s is another horrible way to severely damage your brain. I will come back to this topic at the end, but when I see my neurologist on 1 October of this year, I’m not looking forward to it.

SELF HARM (19-20) / SUICIDE

I’m not sure about the long term mental effects of this. I do know that all these scars on my wrist are never going to go away, and I have a huge scar on my left arm on a vein from when I tried killing myself. Unless you know that they will have no issue with the topic, if you see someone with self harm or self injury scars, please do not point them out unless you are their personal doctor, or it will probably just make their situation worse.

1: A scar is a scar, you have no idea how long it’s been there. People heal better than others.

2: Regardless of your intent, forcing people to get help will just make them resistant to them helping themselves. Like I said above, they have to get better for themselves first, not others.

3: There is a certain standard with psychologists. No one in their right mind (at least in the US) goes through all that debt, all those years of education and internships, to just screw with people. I have been in two mental hospitals. The first was McLean in Massachusetts, which is an affiliate of Harvard. Nothing but good things to say about it, it’s just that not everyone can afford it. The second one I went to, I literally had a doctor threaten to unjustly keep me there for an extra year, just because I made a complaint.

4: In the state of Connecticut, someone committed suicide at a mental hospital fairly recently. If you live in this state, you already know which city it was. Something similar happened in 1998. If the whole state feels like threatening defamation against me, I’d rather positive change to be the result of that then letting this crap continue. The city is famous for a race car driver, I’d rather it stay that way.

5: Unfortunately, not all psychiatric hospitals are equal, as evident above. So, how do we prevent people from being sent to psychiatric hospitals, or possibly jail, when we can not guarantee that the end result will will be good? Try and do everything in your power to prevent the problem in the first place, instead of trying to find a better solution. I will get to this later, but there is a way to prevent the opioid crisis. Unfortunately, it’s kind of become a business now. It is more profitable to keep trying to find solutions, than prevent the problem entirely.

ALCOHOL (21-22)

Never really became an alcoholic until I turned 21. I was still in college at the time and living in a single room so nobody could really hold me accountable except myself. Again, still having severe panic attacks, but I had abused Benzo’s so much, and had not shown I had changed, so rightfully so I was denied more Benzo’s. Instead of trying to accept I needed to both admit and learn from my mistakes, I tried self medicating (again) with alcohol. I would show up to class drunk, and just was a total asshole to the people I looked up to (Specifically Brian, who arguably is one of the best film photography printmakers I’ve ever met). Thankfully, I have little reason to believe that you need a car if you live in Boston (we didn’t live there, but the classes were there), so we just took the MBTA. A huge problem with alcohol is once people drive. Someone that went to my high school was killed by a drunk driver at 1:30PM the day after Christmas. I did not know her personally, but she was described as one of the kindest people you would’ve met. The problem with alcohol and Benzo’s, is eventually you will “blackout”. The problem is you might continue to do things unknowingly after you blackout. If you seriously want to keep drinking to that point (because unfortunately I don’t care how “dry” a campus is, alcohol will find a way to get involved), have a designated driver, call a taxi / Uber / Lyft, give your keys to your car to someone that you know will not be driving; beforehand. If you are drinking while underage (college starts when people are 18 normally), I am telling you as the son of a retired police officer, even if you call the cops on yourself, they will probably go easy on you. If you are driving while intoxicated (and trust me, it’s pretty easy to spot), you are both underage and driving under the influence. If you get into a car accident that involves another vehicle or person, not only is the law getting involved, you are probably getting sued. If you get into an accident that involves another person, which results in death, I don’t care how much fame or money your family has, you have killed someone. It is going to be very hard to forgive yourself, which more than likely turns into more addiction, and even if it doesn’t, living with guilt for the rest of your life is very unhealthy. As harsh as this may sound, addiction fuels addiction. That is unfortunately human nature.

MACKLEMORE

I have been listening to him since 2009’s ‘The Unplanned Mixtape’. “The Town” is about uniting people. Then “Otherside” came out. When a lot of songs were condoning the use of drugs, he went against everybody, just to help people from getting into addiction. Then in 2012, “The Heist” came out, and we’d rather remember the album for “Can’t Hold Us” and “Thrift Shop” then “A Wake” and “Starting Over”, where he literally says “if it wasn’t for Otherside, I wouldn’t have made it”. 2016 saw “This Unruly Mess I’ve Made” (and the singles “Wednesday Morning” and “Drug Dealer”) Again, everyone knows “Downtown” instead of “Kevin”. “Wednesday Morning” was about giving Trump a chance even though I bet he hates the man.

OPIODS

About the Opioid “crisis”, just listen to “Drug Dealer”. I don’t agree with every message he’s ever spread, but know this: Opioids don’t care if you’re white, black, asian; republican, democrat; it kills everyone if you take enough of it. As far as I’m aware doctor’s do not receive a literal commission for prescribing opioids. But if someone held a metaphorical gun to your head and suggested “If you refuse to prescribe a great way for us to make money, we will ensure your family doesn’t have a roof over your house tomorrow”, you’d probably feel inclined.

Oh, it’s the people’s fault for “abusing” them when there is plenty of supply.

Oh, it’s the doctors because they’re the one’s giving it to the people

Oh, it’s the state because they apparently need the money

Then is it the federal government?

No, because there is currently no tax, state or federal, on opioids. Granted the idea has been floated in congress because they believe it will alleviate the issue.

Is it the politicians? Surely they’re receiving money to advocate for the distribution of opioids

No, and to a certain extent it’s not even the distributors.

Allergan, Endo International, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Purdue Pharma, and Teva Pharmaceuticals are all literally putting their profits over people dying. If you think a fucking statue of a spoon is the worst of your issues, I am going to say this and I mean it: Once the government realizes this, these companies will file either be fined or sued for so much of their precious “money” that it will probably result in Chapter 11, unless they change. “Oh, we’re all so sorry, we promise to never do this again”. Do not blame everyone under the fucking sun and try and scapegoat everyone you can just to protect how much money you’re pulling in from this."

I had just graduated from college, an animal husbandry degree or something, I didn’t care I only took it to get my parents off my back. Now my parents were pestering me to get a job because “streaming isn’t a career, stop being foolish Jerriette!” Scoff, what did they know? They were old, their late 30s. I had two active watchers and that would have got me by, after all one would always donate, he’d caption the donations with “show us your boy-tits” but nevertheless, it was money. Now here I was, standing outside the door of the big boss to the largest company in all of Gnomedia, what was I thinking? I gulped loudly and leaned in closer to the door, awaiting my cue to open the door, a bizarre blend of animalistic noises coming from inside. “COME IN!” his voice boomed in an oddly confused way, almost as though that assertive command should have been a question, still I twisted the door knob I quickly focused on the centre of the room. Sitting in a big boy business chair behind a big boy business desk was the most beautiful man I had ever seen, I stood there for what felt like hours. My eyes completely wide in awe, he was gorgeous. His slimy green face glistened under the bright office lights and his speckled yellowy eyes gazing at me inquisitively, my god heart! Stop beating so fast!! His eyes following my body and face as I walked towards the chair in front of him, up and down, up and down. He outstretched his slime covered hand “sit.” He croaked, almost on command I sat down, like a good little girl, neither of us breaking eye contact. My cheeks felt like lava, molten lava and they probably looked like it too. His eyes still gawking at me for what felt like eternity. He was making the blushing worse! I could not take such aggressive looks, but my god was it sexy. I bashfully looked away hoping that it would make me feel better “So you’re gonna be my new intern, huh? Not bad. My name is Mr.Bucklington.” He flopped his long tongue out and proceeded to lick his whole face, his eyes, forehead, and his curly strands of hair that had fallen out from his manbun atop his oily head. What was this man trying to do to me? I clenched my thighs together hard, I didn’t want to get so aroused in front of him, especially on our first meeting! Quick quick, think of naked grandmas! Naked grandmas on bikes!! It didn’t work, with a man such as the one in front of me, this would never work. I could feel my boy breasts heaving and he was looking. “W-well Mr.Bucklington, sir. B-by the end of this i-interview I hope to be….” My voice shook with want, want for this sexy frog goat, I had heard of his saucy appearance and playboy antics in all them news articles and from my girlfriends at college but I never paid attention to such talk. I didn’t care, but now…now I do very much care. “No need, you’re hired. Welcome to Mold Corporations! What’s your name miss?” His voice toned down into an erotic whisper now, causing my volcanic cheeks to explode with more redness. “My name is Jerriette, Jerriette von Springwater. S-sir.” His eyes began to sparkle. “My my, your mother is the great foot model isn’t she? Kapey von Springwater. Hmmm, perfect feet.” He mumbled and then tried to bite his lip but he was a frog, he had no teeth so he failed. The sloppy noise accompanied with the visual “bite” made the river in my knickers flood. My goodness I couldn’t take this. “You will start tomorrow at 8:00AM, a car will be waiting outside your door at 7:30AM, do not be late….or else….” He seemed to trail off and whisper something underneath his breath, smirking afterwards. He kept eye contact as he arose from his big boy business chair “Here I’ll see you out” As he moved from behind the desk towards my line of vision I let out an audible gasp, his legs, and his goat legs. They looked so soft and furry, I shook my head trying to get the idea out of my head of me rubbing against them like a little kitty and purring. I was pulled out of my head shaking by a hand being placed infront of me, his greasy webbed fingers pointed like dainty ballerina feet. I took it, my head and heart thumping with excitement as well as somewhere else. I did my best to act nonchalant. “C’mon Jerriette! Just two more steps! Don’t think of yourself writhing under them long damp fingers, think about your parents! Finally!!” I thought as I finally reached the door “Safe journey…Miss Jerriette, I can’t wait to see you early tomorrow.” He gave a slow blink and a smile then closed the door. As soon as the door closed I ran all the way home, using my pent up sexual frustration as energy. Finally I reached home by the evening, they were so happy at my new job and the prospects of lots of money. I didn’t eat anything, I went straight up to my room, and here I am now, lying in bed. Hugging my frog plush pretending it is him, Mr.Bucklington. What would our future be? Would we get married? Would we have toothless monsters of our own? How many? Would he get pregnant or would I? And how many times would it take to happen? I sighed out loud, if this was what it was like on our first meeting, what on earth would our first work day together be like? With such a sexy boss aswell, my god this will be tough.

Still haven’t found a job.,chelsmeister9,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/92i70g/graduated_last_summer_still_havent_found_a_job/,"Hello! My husband graduated with a BS in ChemE last June. He got a three month internship at HP which didn’t turn into a full time job. He has been applying to stuff ever since. 

We live in San Diego and are probably unable to relocate (We are foster parents and are adopting our current placement so we can’t move cuz we can’t take our child yet). 

My husband is a hard worker. Got a 3.08 GPA. He’s not perfect but it’s crazy to us that he hasn’t been able to find a job. 

He’s been working in another field so he can help keep us afloat in the meantime but we worry that his experience and education will become irrelevant considering it’s been a year. 

Any advice? Are we asking too much? He makes just under 40k a year right now and honestly in San Diego that is very very little. He’s gotten some interviews but never an offer. We would prefer not to stoop to lab positions as they pay less than he’s making now. 

Sigh. Frustrated and need help. Thanks!

How and when did you guys first start using and why?,willywongka113,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/92i8do/anyone_here_ever_feel_like_they_had_a_naturalborn/,"The reason I’m asking is because no one I meet for the first time would suspect that I use, not even weed, but I do more drugs than almost all my friends. I’ve always been a “good kid,” with straight A’s in school and I have a current internship in the federal government (no drug test thank god). Growing up, I’ve had very attentive and loving (though overprotective) parents. But despite that, in my junior year, I suddenly had the urge to delve into mind-altering substances, and like many others, I started with alc and weed. 

I loved it, especially weed, and things escalated from there. A year after I started, I was smoking every day. I tried codeine in senior year and used percocets and hydros in college. I used to do xans, but seriously, fuck Xanax it makes you do some stupid shit. Addy too of course. But my favorite has got to be L. The beautiful unreality that those little blotters can you bring you to is like nothing else in this world. And despite having gotten way too fucked up numerous times in the past, I still love using everything I’ve tried so far and I still want to try more. My friends all think I’m crazy (I come from a pretty wealthy suburban area so the worst shit most people see here is frat boys doing some coke), but I just love the feeling of feeling different and not myself. 

Do any of you guys feel the same way? I got into drugs entirely on my own and searched for the opportunity, and I was wondering if most of you guys had some other motivating factor that got you into drugs, like peer pressure or depression, rather than just having some sort of random urge or desire to get high.

Maybe I'd say a few words to you every now and then, have a pleasant conversation, maybe even get a picture at the end, but I mostly did it to help out the potential of working in movies later on in life.

As part of my compensation for the internship, I was invited to the movie premiere. I got myself a new suit, dressed up and walked along with everyone else that was involved in the movie, getting a taste for this life and wanting more.

It was at this premiere where I saw you again, like I usually did, except this time you were alone, and you looked stunning. You were seated at the bar, having a drink, and I figured now would probably be my last chance to say something. So, I downed the rest of my drink and walked over to you.

Hey! I'm Matthew, 21 years old and I'm looking for a girl to play as a celeb on this big movie premier. Ideally the two of us flirt for a little bit before sneaking off for some alone time. This can be as vanilla or as kinky as you desire, either way is perfectly fine with me.

Favorite Celebs: Emma Watson, Emma Roberts, Scarlett Johannson, Ariana Grande, Victoria Justice, Jennifer Lawrence, Alexa Bliss, Becky Lynch, Dakota Kai, Nadine Velasquez

I hope to hear back from some of y'all, and if you want to play one of my previous prompts I'm always open to those as well!"

We first met when we were still in school. I live in the middle east, and she lives in the USA. Anyway she came around with my cousin on a school trip thing and we met then. We became close almost instantly and there was such a strong connection. After she left we stayed in touch, talking maybe once a week but it was platonic. The next time i came to see her was when my whole family went to visit my cousins maybe a year after in the US, and i got to see her there. We hung out for a good 3 weeks and it was there where we fell in love. We would talk about everything, stay up all night together, go shopping, to the cinema, swimming, basically everything together. Before , leaving we confessed our love for each other, and i still remember how it went. We were sleeping on two seperate beds next to each other, holding hands, and after a good hour of poking around she spelt it on my hand. I still remember it like it was yesterday. I said it back immediately, and the next day i went back home. 

After that school started and whatnot so we tried the long distance thing, it was all good until we talked about moving on after about 8 months cause there was prom and whatnot that year. But during all that we kept in touch, she went out with some guy, we werent exclusive by the time so it was all good i guess, but i always felt so unsettled every time she told me about him. Anyway it didnt last long for her and we started talking about us again. That Christmas after starting college, I went to visit again for the holidays and new years. It was the best 3 weeks of my life, and we ended up losing our virginity to each. We just have this strong connection i dont know how to explain it. It's like we were made for each other, always on the same page, same sense of humor, very understanding. Just perfect. Nothing ever compared. 

After that it just the same long distance thing. We talked every day, through the ups and downs. I have to say im a premed student, and the next year i couldnt go visit cause i had the mcat and stuff, and she cant come cause of financial problems. We always maintained a good relationship and we talked about getting married countless of times. She is my everything and i dont know how i coped before meeting her.

Comes this winter, and the long distance really takes it's toll. She told me about a guy who keeps on asking her out. Her sister's friend who is also a med student, asked her like 3 times. And finally she went out with him. After she sent me that text i knew she wanted to move on. She told me that and still told me how much she loves me. So i always got so much mixed feelings. AFter that i got so overwhelmed with my studies and didnt really want to think of it much, and we started talking a bit less every week. Until february came. She told me that the guy asked her to be his girlfriend. It was like a knife to the heart. I congratulated her. She still told me she loved me and well frankly i still love her. Funny how crazy love makes you. 

The semester went by and we barely talked once a week. It went by quickly and i was okay with all of it, it had been 2 and a half years since i last saw her and i had so much to do that i didnt really go through a breakup phase. I met another girl in class and we went out briefly but it was not the same at all. Anyway come the summer and i get to go see my cousins for 2 weeks again. And i get to see my love again for 4 days since she is leaving for an internship. The first day i went back and walked through the door, there she is. As cute and beautiful as ever. And there is where my brain just gets lost. It's like everything i was pushing away just came flooding in. All the memories, all the texts, everything we've been through. Everything. DUring the semester i was so clouded and here i am, with nothing to think about other than what was my perfect relationship with this amazing girl. Anyway we catch up roughly and i sleep the night there. I told her about the new girl im seeing and she told me about her boyfriend. I was still a bit numb there but my mind starts stirring up all the feelings i had. Next day we went out to the movies with my cousins and she insisted to sit next to me, and she starts poking me during the ride there and the movie. It was kind of our thing and it sends a jolt up my body i just cant explain it. I dont see her the next day, and the final day I went about 2 hours to see her before she travels. She kept on doing our old thing and poking me constantly, even when i left we hugged and we were both trying to hold back the tears. I knew it and she knew it. The next 2 weeks were hell whenever i was alone. I just kept thinking about her, a about everything and i just could not stop myself. There i was where i get to see her and she wasnt there. It was so damn hard. The day before i left i sent her a heartfelt message confessing i still loved her and she was so special to me, and that she should be with me and not her boyfriend (who lives in another state). And she confesses she still loves me, but the long term outcome would not change either way. And the thing is, she is right. I still have 4 years and she cant leave her life behind. It just sucks. That 2 weeks ago, and we still talk every day. She sends me photos of her vacation/internship and i do the same since im in canada. I still love her and think of her all the time, i cant stop. I dont know. Now she's going back home and i know her boyfriend will be waiting for her there. And it kills me every time i think of it.  What we have just runs so deep it just never compares, and she tells me the same thing about her relationship that it doesnt even come close. But i dont think it will ever work between us, and i try to forget but we keep holding on. This post is all over the place i am so sorry about that. I just had to talk about this because im gonna explode. Through the 6 years i knew that whenever everything sucked to high hell, i always had her. She always makes me feel better and is there for me, and i am the same with her. But now that's changing, and she is moving on. And in 2 weeks i start med school and will be numb and busy again. I dont know. I just think this is worth holding on to and i would wait for her forever if that was what it takes, but it is unfair to ask the same of her. I dont know what to do. Seriously. I still talk to the girl ive been seeing back home, but it's nothing serious and i broke it off this morning. I want something like what i have with my soulmate, and well i dunno if there is 2 soulmates for one person. I just feel so lost. If you read this post i really appreciate it and sorry for wasting your time. I just feel so worthless right now.  
 
tldr: Long term (6 year) long distance relationship with the love of my life very complicated, she is moving on with another guy while still holding on to what we have. Im so lost and dont know what to do. "
92j07l,6,2018-07-27,Synapse 3 is absolute garbage,WebbyGaming,razer,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/92j07l/synapse_3_is_absolute_garbage/,"Recently purchased a Tartarus V2 to replace my old and failing Tartarus. I have used game pads for quite a few years; originally had the Belkin n50 then the Belkin n52te and my last two have been the Razer Tartarus using Synapse 2.

I use the game pad mostly for MMOs and FPS games. I have always used at least two Keymaps and sometimes three Keymaps for each game. I have never had trouble with the software, until this Synapse 3 garbage. The software is extremely buggy and has a very frustrating delay in response to keys that is not acceptable when you need fast actions in a game.

Naturally, Razer will claim ***""but it is beta!""***   However, Synapse 3 is the required software for the Tartarus V2, which has been out for almost a year!  **The ""Beta"" tag is an excuse for astoundingly terrible software**. There is no genuine excuse for how bad Synapse 3 is this far in development with hardware required to use it.

Examples:

When playing a game I have it set where I press a key to swap to Keymap2 *(with it set to return to Keymap 1 when I release the key)* as I have done for years in all the Nostromo/Razer game pads I have owned. **However, now the software literally takes three to five seconds to swap Keymaps and it often gets stuck and will not swap at all!** The delay makes the game pad completely unusable in action gaming.

Also, often when programming key-binds, the software will not allow the change; forcing back to the default. I have to close and reopen the Synapse 3 software two, three, sometimes four times to get past the bug and get a key-bind to program.

I do not know who Razer has coding the Synapse 3 software *(maybe some high school interns working for free and school credit)* but they do not know what they are doing. The Nostromo and Tartarus software from five years ago was far better than this garbage.

My advice: Do not buy ANY Razer product that uses Synapse 3 software until Razer gets someone competent to code it correctly. Razer has the ""Beta"" tag on it as a free pass for their horrible software."

I’m not as social as my peers but I still do my best to socialize and not be awkward around people.

The projects I’m assigned to are nothing like what my peer is assigned too and I’m starting to wonder the reason why I’m getting assigned to tasks that are really hard to understand is because they just need an intern to bust out all these paperwork and not give me an offer. I’ve been going over budget for most of my projects because I don’t understand a lot of concepts and people probably think I’m a slow worker who doesn’t know crap.

92jm0d,4,2018-07-28,[Futa4F]Employee of the Month for all the right reasons...,Why_must_you_know,futarp,https://www.reddit.com/r/futarp/comments/92jm0d/futa4femployee_of_the_month_for_all_the_right/,"Working for a startup definitely has its benefits, especially a successful one. Me personally? I worked for a successful startup. Hours were great, the people were better, and their ""open mindset"" meant that they were very accepting of my girlcock, an absolute monster that'd dwarf any man's dick. I had the perfect skillset for the job, but I had been worried that having such a sizeable extra appendage wouldn't fit their feminist, ""all female employees"" agenda.

So what if I had a huge cock? I could just be as girly and feminine as every other woman who worked here. They just didn't get massive boners that threatened to rip right through their pants at all hours of the day. Most of the ladies here were understanding of my needs, to varying degrees of course. Quite a few were willing to give me a quick handjob in the bathroom, some would use their mouths, and the really nice ones would let me fuck them, though they seemed to enjoy that as much as I did.

That didn't really matter now, because now what I needed was release. I quietly got up from my desk, feeling an erection beginning to form. It was only 9:15, but my cock wasted no time in waking up. I nonchalantly made my way out into the hallway, the slight bulge of my slacks quickly becoming more and more noticeable. Hopefully some lady would be willing to help out in the bathroom, if I didn't run into a kinder soul on the way there.

-----

So! An all-female, hipster, modern tech company where one employee happens to have a huge cock, and the others are happy to help her out. We could do several short scenes with this one, all sorts of angles. Maybe her deskmate decides to hide out under her desk for a little bit? Or a friendly, understanding coworker is in the bathroom when she bursts in at full mast? Maybe it's an intern's first day on the job, or the CEO calls our lucky futa into her office to experience this cock she's heard so much about. As the title may have hinted, it'd be a fun tilt if her coworkers/superiors enjoyed her cock, and it helped her get professional success? e.g. a raise or a promotion? The more ideas you've got, the better!

I think it'd be fun if it was frowned upon for her to fuck in common areas, so we could incorporate that and the risk/taboo along with it.

I was intentionally vague on details so we could pick a ref for her. I have some I like to use, but if you have ones you like I'll definitely consider them! Basing her appearance off a celebrity is also an option. Same goes for any coworkers of her's you'd like to play.

Finally, my kinks(Some may not fit as well as others): Huge everything, bulges, distension, tons of cum, cum inflation, spanking, public sex/teasing, freeuse, name calling, cock worship, non-penetrative sex(titjobs, handjobs, etc.), pregnancy, lactating, tight clothes, teasing, casual sex/nudity, dirty/crude talk, and playing as youtubers/celebrities

Limits: Scat, piss, gore, bdsm, etc.

92l0w6,249,2018-07-28,Develop a positive mindset and abundance mentality. Why you keep failing in life.,flashcash12,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/92l0w6/develop_a_positive_mindset_and_abundance/,"One of the biggest problems I see among men is the lack of a positive mindset abundance mentality. This is one of the biggest and most important foundations of TRP. There are hundreds of sidebar material on abundance mentality but a huge percentage of men, even on this sub struggle with it. What do most men have in common with low abundance? Why do they struggle with it? Well because it’s simple they the mindset to succeed. Guys fail to realize that abundance mentality is a postive mindset that you should applying to everything in your life. You know what almost all of these men suffer from? These four thoughts constantly circulating through their heads.

1. Why does nothing ever go my way
2. If I just had this (job/car/girl/house) I would be happy
3. Am I good enough
4. Why does everyone always get what they want, and I don’t

Everyone at some point in their lives have suffered with these thoughts. I suffer with these thoughts sometimes.

Let’s look at some examples of how these thoughts can dictate your life.

Steve feels like he made an extra 50k a year that he would be happy because he could buy the car he always wanted, make his wife happy and his parents would be proud of him for finally making 6 figures. He no longer had to be jealous of his friends for making more money than him and could finally feel as he was “Keeping with the Joneses.” However what Steve failures to realize is that the extra money wouldn’t make him happy, it would just cause his problems to change. His wife will become unhappy because now they need to remodel their house. Steve is unhappy with his new car because he doesn’t have a newer model. Steve’s parents are unhappy because they feel he needs to now make even more money.

This past year, I became obsessed with becoming an investment banker in New York. The reason for this is because my freshman year of college I read on WSO that if I had become a banker in a top group, I would make 160k out of college and after 2 years I could move to a private equity mega fund and make 400k my second year there and my fourth year out of college. My school being on the west coast I obsessively worked and networked in order to achieve this. Because of this my grades dropped, and I started to isolate myself socially. I neglected even looking at other internships because they weren’t good enough. In the end I got super lucky do to a crazy circumstance and into a top group on wall street which would enable me to complete my goal. I could've failed and been left with zilch. However, I did it at the expense of my own well-being. I am on the verge of losing my scholarship because my grades dropped, and I lost some of my core friends for blowing them off for months. Well it turns out after all of this that I hate my internship and will turn down a full-time offer at the end of the summer. (Will delve into more details of my internship if anyone is interested).

Like Steve I put my happiness and self-worth based on career prestige. I worked so hard to get it that I neglected other important aspects of my life and let them go into free fall. I lost my abundance mindset. This caused me to develop a scarcity mentality.

Everyday 100s of new guys find TRP. They learn about all the skills they need in order to improve their life. However, guys who know red pill knowledge inside an out not making a difference in their lives. Every day I see tons of guys on AskTRP, posting the same questions over and over about what to do about this girl or how to get over/fuck oneitis or if they should wait 12 minutes and 44 seconds to respond to some text from a girl. Experienced Red Pillers like myself and others will usually give them advice or criticism to which they will refute (as if they know more) or take. But me giving some newbie 18 year old a solution to a minor question is like me giving him painkillers and a cast for a broken arm so he can keep playing in the football game. We are just putting a band aid on the problem and not fixing the root cause of rearranging or replacing the bone so it can build itself to be stronger at the core. Eventually without fixes his arm will snap in the game and he will end up even worse off as before (I’m sure you guys know what happens when low SMV or overly aggressive guys try applying red pill techniques to girls).

So how do you fix this mentality. Well the first step is to cut out negative thoughts of your life. If you suffer from the thoughts above, its time to change your mindset. If other people succeed and you don’t, instead of finding reasons to to hate on them, find out why you aren’t doing as well. If you know has something good going for them, look at your own life and see what great things you have going for you. Write down your thoughts every night. Chances are if you have the ability to read this post, your quality of life is better than 90% of the world population.

There has never been a better time to live in history than in America in 2018. Yet so many fucking people are depressed. My advice to not fall into the trap of negative thoughts above is to get off your fucking phones/xboxes/laptops and go do things outdoors. I remember good old days back in elementary school in the 2000s, the guys and I used to go airsofting in the park next to our houses. Nobody cared as long as we stayed in a certain area. Can you imagine if kids were doing this today. Police would probably come and threaten to kill us and neighbors would file complaints. In middle school we’d have bonfires at the beach and flirt with girls. Its sad what the world is coming to. Now all I see is teens sitting on their phones in circles. This past weekend, my favorite plate came to visit me. Instead of sitting in doors fucking like some guys want to do with their plates, we snuck on the roof of my building to drink champagne, rented a duffy boat so we could go cruise around the Hudson and crashed a 12 year olds birthday party in Central Park and played pickup football with all of them. One of the best weekends I've had in a very long time. Go out and explore. My best ever memories was running doing crazy things.

The final thing is stop living for validation. You know what the difference between real men vs everyone else is. We don’t need to live for validation. The same guys who post on AskTRP about how to fuck their oneitis or so are the same guys who are obsessed with validation. Why is that? Well the only reason they want to fuck them is to show them they are worthy enough for them. Who gives a fuck what your oneitis thinks. They are only bring you down. Axe them from your life. Every time I check social media, I always see the same shit. Hot girls I know posting selfies so 100s of guys can comment how amazing they are. Self absorbed guys posting pictures of their sorority slut girlfriends about how much they love them or kissing them. Cool, while your getting controlled by your slutty girlfriend, I fucked her six ways from sunday our freshman year before she started the CC and got out when I wanted to. Show them off as much as you like. So how do you fix this mindset? Start staying congruent in your own beliefs. Trust your own mindset and don’t let your ideas and actions controlled by others. So you're a Trump supporter great. I am too. You don’t need to announce about it but don’t change your beliefs so you can impress and fuck some SJW girl. Control your own thoughts and you’ll soon realize the only person you need validation from is yourself.

Putting this all together. Your lack of failure isn’t because you aren’t good-looking, muscular, social or whatever, it's because you lack the mindset to succeed. If you are deficient in the areas fix them. Develop the abundance mentality and a positive mindset, not just for women like most guys here do but in all areas of your life. I guarantee you'll be much happier and more successful in life. Before college I suffered from an extremely negative mindset and let people walk all over me. Once I discovered TRP, I began to change my mentality and soon began to do things I didn’t think were possible given where I had come from. Now instead of me being an afterthought, I became respected amongst everyone. Funny how guys who shit on self-improvement and TRP are the same guys who come to me for advice everyday. They are also the same guys who reject this advice I give them and continue to fail in life. Be a winner and a doer not a loser and a schmoozer as my grandpa would say.

I’m not gonna lie, it took me a long time to write this. I was supposed to go out tonight but ended up spending a few hours on this. Why did I spend so much time? Because I want to help you guys because I want to see everyone here succeed. In fact in writing this I learned as much about all the struggles I’ve faced over the past 9 months or so.

Edit: As I expected a lot of you have or will ask questions about my IB experience. If you're interested send me or post a list of questions and I'll happily answer any questions. I have some time right now so fire away.

More info: To all be the people asking ow you develop this mindset. First you need to recognize that you suffer from these thoughts and actions. So many of my friends and people think they are perfect and everyone else around them is flawed. In reality they are just low SMV betas who seek external validation, conformity and comfortability. 

1. Recognize the problems or things you want to work
2. Develop a course of action. Write it down before you go to bed
3. Put yourself out of comfort zone. Reject the status quo (within reason)."
92mdlp,35,2018-07-28,How full time equity investing charmed me,worldhello1221,IndiaInvestments,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/92mdlp/how_full_time_equity_investing_charmed_me/,"
I’m a student of science in my very early twenties.
I was first introduced to the world of investing in 2012. I’d see my extended family members glued to television screens, especially CNBC, watching shows hosted by the eloquent Mr. Udayan Mukherjee.

But, my immediate family members avoided markets like the plague. Because they had had a not so good experience. Losing money, like a lot of other people during the 1990s. It had been a bitter experience for them. But, it was very difficult for me to resist the market’s charm.

I too started watching CNBC, Zee Business and started following the recommendations of analysts. From 2012 to 2015 that’s what I did. There was nothing else I’d want to do.
Fortunately I did decently at academics. Hence, my parents didn’t complain.
But, as time passed it dawned on me that I had to work hard, read and study to grow as an investor.


I started reading, interacting with those who possessed relevant knowledge.
Finally, after extensive deliberation in May,2017 I decided to take a break and learn even more on investing.
Everyone advised me against doing so.
But, I was insistent.


I had 2 months of holidays and I applied for a 1 month break from academics.
So, I was at home for a total of 3 months to learn more on investing and satiate my desire to work at some firm involved in investing.


From May, 2017- August,2017:
In the beginning I was pleased.
I had on my mind that I’d read a lot on investments, travel, sometimes do nothing at all.
I started reading on fundamental investing.
Read multiple books by multiple investors.
However, as time passed i started getting weary of it. Then, I migrated to reading philosophy and psychology. Concurrent with reading I started investing a small amount I had saved over the past few years.


And, I performed well. I was on top of the world. I thought that I was the chosen one.
But, since I had nothing else to do my portfolio churning was very high. I sold some excellent stocks just because I had earned 5% gains. I ended up kicking myself later.


I had done well but that was because of dollops of luck. I was ignoring the contribution of luck to my success. It was a big mistake. I was a victim of the illusion of skill. I started meeting other investors. It helped me totally shed my arrogance. It made me realise that knowledge makes a person humble.

It was a lesson for life. After 1.5 months of staying at home and dedicating myself to investing I was naive enough to apply for jobs at asset management companies. I was dedicated to investing and started sending employment requests to mutual funds, portfolio management services, etc.


Thanks to my naivety I was expecting a quick appointment letter. To my displeasure and per my parents’ predictions I received a total of ZERO responses. Not even for an internship. To say I was shocked would be an understatement. That was a gut wrenching moment for me.

Within a week I was feeling better. But then, I reduced my frequency of reading investment, security analysis books. And, started focusing on philosophy and psychology. And, to my utter surprise I was enjoying reading it. My addiction to tracking stock prices every 4-5 minutes waned. I had developed an interest to learn more about the wisdom of people from thousands of years ago.


It’s pertinent to note that I had never been a reader until this period of 3 months. I realised that I had an interest in studying investing and being an investor. But, I had overestimated my ability to make a living out of it. I realised that I was a victim of affective forecasting. And, it mellowed me and made me humble.
Learnings:

The 3 months last year were in a lot of ways enlightening.


Developed a liking for reading.


Realised that it’s important to continue to learn. Always.


Understood that there are investors a lot, lot better than me.


Tempered my tendency to be overly optimistic.


Started making realistic goals.


Understood that my ideas, understanding can be totally wrong and should always be willing to understand another’s perspective.


Learned that even the smallest things can give happiness.


By investing full time I was doing my portfolio more harm than good. I was making my broker richer by transacting excessively.


Became more patient.


Accelerated my efforts to learn to do what I enjoy doing.


Everything is transient



What I like today may not necessarily be my liking just a year later.


Developed an interest in spirituality.


Finally, I learned that in the larger scheme of things I’m a nobody. 


Behaviorally advanced beings have existed for thousands of years. They’ve lived and died. 



Even the greatest will be forgotten.



Started writing to improve my communication skills.



Understood the transient nature of most things in life.



Realised that paying too much atttention to what others think is detrimental to my interest.




When I finally resumed my routine life I realised that I actually enjoyed this 3 month duration. I missed it. But, that’s life. Change is the only constant"

Some FUTA options included.",dppthrowaway1394,AgeplayPenPals,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgeplayPenPals/comments/92o1rl/m4am_playing_f_older_woman_as_affair_with_younger/,"I am an adult looking for another 18+ year old adult for a fantasy rolepay.

Please have the Discord app as I mainly prefer to chat on it because of all of its user friendly features (mainly editing posts if mistakes happen).

I'm a male but I’m looking to play as the older woman so I’m looking for someone to be the boy. I'd like the mother to be pretty much based off actress Milla Jovovich and I have a specific idea in mind for the boy but because of the new rules I'm not allowed to say his name. PM me and we can talk about it (if you don’t like the choice we could possibly change him if need be). She would be in her mid-30s to early 40s and he would be around 13-15.

I was thinking of three possible scenarios (all amendable) and I’m open to any other possible suggestions.

1 - Mom/step mom is about to get married and she is in her dress at the church waiting for the ceremony to start. The son/step son could walk in on her and confess his feelings for her and for what ever reason she decides to give into temptation and have sex with him. Maybe she tells him it has to be a one time thing to get out of his system but once she see's his surprisingly large dick she becomes obsessed with how it stretches her out.

An alternate take on this could be that the boy is some what evil and he blackmails the groom into writing a letter saying the wedding is off (perhaps he threatened to start saying he molested him) and when she finds out that her big day has been ruined he comes in to comfort her, with or with out her really wanting to have sex with him.

2 - Option two is that she is a married woman in a rather loveless marriage. They are fairly wealthy and the husband provides her with pretty much everything she needs...except for routine fucking. Alternatively, she could be completely single and be yearning for her next conquest (especially if it’s extremely risky). One day she comes home from grocery shopping and notices a moving truck next door and spots the absolutely beautiful son of the new neighbors and her minds starts going to dark sexual places. After a while, some light teasing and exhibitionism beings to take place and one day the next door boy comes over and overs to clean her pool/mow her lawn. She gets into a sexy bikini and goes out to the pool to tan and gives him something to look at and she starts to notice his big dick in his shorts.

This concept is highly editable and the two of them could be made to be related instead.

3 - Kind of stole this third idea from someone else’s post and made some edits since I liked the idea of it so much.

It was like any other day at the park, a comic book or phone in his hard, the same bench in the shade of the tree as he looked at the people jogging on the track. There was one woman though who decided to come and sit next to him on the bench to tighten her shoe laces and she started up a conversation with him.

""Are you alone here?"" she asked him, bending down to tie her laces.

""Umm yeah, who are you?"" he asked, lowering his comic/phone to look at her.

""Oh no one I was just doing my run there and I noticed you over here. Thought I'd come by and give you a piece of advice"" she said.

""Oh what's that miss?"" he asked, in a sweet tone.

""Well, sweetie...those shorts aren't hiding anything"" she said with the warmest smile on her face. 

It was embarrassing when she said that. Maybe she meant it like a compliment.  It was hard after all to keep a __ inch cock concealed in these shorts!

This idea could feature a bunch of different options. We could be complete and total strangers meeting my chance. It could piggyback of the theme of option 2 and we actually live in the same neighborhood and this is how we approach each other. I could be a mom and my son could go to the same school as you and I’ve seen you at parent teacher meeting and other school functions. Or I could be a teacher at your school and I’ve seen you walking through the halls before. Many options to be decided on this one.

So those are my three ideas but I'm willing to take any suggestions if anyone is interested. I’d also be willing to play multiple women and include a sister character or have a secret (or not so secret) girlfriend on the side. Group role play is also acceptable.

My only hard limits are snuff, gore, vore, and scat. 

Lingerie, feet and shoes (especially platforms) are a plus. Anal, water sports, cum shots (facials and cream pies) that are larger that normal, public/risky sex, clothed sex, handjobs, squirting, sleep/wake up sex, oral sex (especially giving while the other person is busy doing something else’s like talking on the phone or playing video games with a headset on), smoking, stomach distention/inflation, fisting, beast, tattoos and piercings and a lot more are all acceptable kinks in my book.

———————-

All the ideas above can be played as me being a dickgirl but here are some extra ideas for FUTA prompts.

Like above, I’d want my character to be based off Milla Jovovich (specially the first few photo options in the link below). The other roles can also be based off actors, models or any one else you’d like to use as a visual basis. https://imageevent.com/hailtotheking/dppthrowaway13943

A) I would be the boss or a high level executive at some kind of company. You’ve just started working at the same place (full employee or summer internship). I’m pretty demanding and have a bit of a temper while you’re soft spoken and fairly intimidated by me. After some time there you start hearing rumors about me and how I’m different and you become increasingly intrigued by what you’ve heard. Alternatively, I could be the one that take a great interest in your youthful body and my condition could be a total surprise to you when I make my move on you.

This scenario would have me be in my late 30s, early 40s with my new employee being around 16-24 and their gender could be male or female. If you want to go younger, pitch me an idea of the situation to explain your presence (maybe you’re the kid of an employee and you’re in the building for some reason).

B) I’m a teacher or P.E. teacher/coach at a school. I could be a teacher you have a class in every single day or I could be someone that teaches a higher grade than yours and you’ve just seen me around before before. This could go either way we me being attracted to you and making the first move or if could be the other way around. Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/couch maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office. I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited. 

Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing. You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s. You could be a female or male student. Age ranges could be wide for this, 13 to early 20s. For young female students we could use girls that look like Eleven from Stranger Things, Hit-Girl from Kick-Ass, Mathilda from The Professional or any number of possibilities.

C) Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where. I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place. For your character you could be someone that just got their learners permit a couple of months ago and you’re freaking out because something is going wrong with the car. You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes oh getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment. 

Another option could be that you’re the kid of the driver and that way you can be younger if you’d like or you’re a runaway or just out playing further from home than you normally do."

Maybe one day you notice something off with my skirt or pants, a lump that shouldn’t be there, and you want to find out more.

If I’m a P.E. teacher/couch maybe one day I’ve told everyone to get changed and I call you into my office and we have a discussion about your recent lack of effort in class. By the time we finish everyone else is gone so you hit the shower to clean up before leaving for the day while I stay in my office for a bit. You finish your shower and changing in the locker room and walk past my office.  I had completely forgotten you were here so I took my dick out and started stroking it to porn on my phone. At first you’re freaked out but then you start to get excited.  Alternatively, it could be me that goes to shower, thinking you had already left after changing.  You spot me in there back first lathering my hair and then I turn and you see my large semi hard dick hanging between my legs.

This option could have me be any age between late 20s-early 40s.  You could be a female or male student.

C)  Final scenario is that I’m a mechanic at a little garage in the middle of no where.  I’m the only one that works there so I’m by myself at the place.  For your character you could be a young driver that has just been in their first minor accident or you’re freaking out over an odd noise you’ve been hearing.  You’ve stopped at my garage in hopes of getting a quick fix but you’re blindsided by the cost and you can’t afford it...so we work out another form of payment."
92o6zl,4,2018-07-28,Boyfriend dumped me last night not sure what to do,Rad-ishRadish,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/92o6zl/boyfriend_dumped_me_last_night_not_sure_what_to_do/,"I’m not really sure how to start this. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for just over 6 months. I’ve known him since high school. We became really good friends, but didn’t start dating till we were freshman in college. We go to college about 300 miles apart and I only ever saw him over spring break from the time we started dating till summer. All was well we were happy he was my best friend it was great. Fast forward to summer we are both living at home and we talked about seeing each other all the time. I’m working at an internship I hate so he’s definitely the best part of my day. At first it goes well I see him basically every day we go out to eat hang out with another friend of mine all the time. I’m finally happy in a relationship again. Then things start to go south. Prior to us dating I didn’t know about any of this even though he told he everything. His dad is horribly emotionally abusive and controlling. Yells at him, threatens to kick him out of the house, steals money from him. I promise you my boyfriend doesn’t deserve any of this. He’s the sweetest kindest person I know his dad is just insane. Now his dad has decided he absolutely hates me and has even voiced to his mom that he wishes we weren’t dating. Again I can promise you I didn’t do anything to deserve this kind of anger. I’m a good person (at least I try to be). There’s a lot more backstory I could add to this, but I’m not sure it’s really relevant and will just make this post even longer, so I digress. Anyway, because of this he stops being able to see me as much because he’s afraid his dad will get angry at him again. I try to be understanding of the situation I really really really do, but it’s still frustrating to me because this is where my boyfriend’s and I’s personalities differ. I, personally, would just tell his dad to get over it as I do not like in any way shape or form to be controlled or told what to do. My boyfriend, on the other hand, wants to keep everyone happy all the time. Which is basically impossible with a psycho father and a girlfriend who is just asking for to much. Again, I try really hard to be understanding. He leaves for college in 2 weeks and he insists when he leaves his dad won’t have power over him anymore. That’s great except I will still never see him.

I think that’s enough backstory to explain the events of last night. His dad had lost it on him today randomly (it’s always random), so he comes over to my house to de-stress and we go out for a drive. I’m angry at him for a lot of things at the moment, so I don’t really say much. He begs me to talk about why I’m so quiet, but I don’t really fully understand it myself, so I just tell him I don’t know. Eventually we are arguing. I’m not even sure what or why or how it started, but it ends in my driveway sitting in my car and he tells me he thinks we should just go back to being friends. He gets out of my car and says he’ll talk to me later. I tell him don’t bother and he immediately goes “I didn’t mean it. I take it back.” I’m angry, so I tell him yes he did and get out of my car, so he does and he leaves.

I’m not trying to seem blameless in this situation. I understand that I need to be more patient about what’s going on. But I honestly have no idea what to do. I talked to him today and he said last night was an impulse decision and he wants to get back together. He also said he already told his parents we broke up, so I’d see him even less then before because he doesn’t want to tell them if we decide to get back together. I guess I just have no idea what to do or how to proceed. Honestly just writing this all out has made me feel a lot better. If anyone has advice I’d appreciate it or even just for someone to tell me I’m not crazy would be nice. Thanks.

TL;DR
Boyfriend broke up with me impulsively because of some long brewing issue’s we’ve had. I don’t know what to do now."

92oycu,3,2018-07-28,23F4A A Flavor For Everyone! (Alternative title: A Detailed Roleplay Mega-Post),[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/92oycu/23f4a_a_flavor_for_everyone_alternative_title_a/,"Hello fellow dirty pen pals! 

Okay, so there may not be a flavor for *everyone* but my thought process behind my title is that most people will find something about this post that they like. To give you all an idea of the order of this post, I intend to go over my roleplay expectations first, followed by my kinks and limits, and then I'll include a list of roles that I would like to play. I hope you find something that catches your eye!

First things first, my expectations. I roleplay exclusively here, through Reddit PMs. I don't like to use the Reddit Chat feature, and I don't care to move elsewhere. I enjoy roleplaying with men and women, I just ask that you're detailed. What is my definition of detailed you may ask? Simply put, I want you to put effort into the role. I have had roles where my partner and I both regularly respond in 1 or 2 paragraphs, and I have had roles where responses were more often 5 or 6 paragraphs or longer. All I want is effort, and hopefully enough content in each message to move the story along. 

As for response time, I don't get too caught up in that. Ideally, my partners are able to respond at least a few times a week. It would be nice if our schedules line up at some point and we're able to send several messages back and forth in the same day, but I know schedules can be tough, and in my opinion, your real life should take precedence over and online roleplay. I also like longer term roles, but I am not opposed to doing a shorter roleplay. Another preference of mine is that there is at least some element of realism in the role. This can mean that we use a real location, as in state, country, or city/town, we work for a real company, go to a real college, and so on. It also means that our characters have last names.

For my last comment on my roleplay expectations, I'd like to cover perhaps my largest pet peeve when it comes to roleplaying, writing for someone else's character or characters. As you will see, if you keep reading, I am open to roles where my partner and/or I play more than one character. When this is the case, I do not want my partner to tell me what my character(s) are doing, thinking, saying, wearing, etc. And I do not want to tell my partner what their character(s) are doing either. As for playing multiple characters, my preference is to play my 'main' character in first person, and all additional characters in third person. 

For my kinks and limits, I thought about making one of those kinklists, but I prefer to discuss them with my partners rather than just share an image. These kinks are things I *generally* like in my roles. This is not a list of 'must-haves'. Each and every single kink is negotiable! My limits however, are a bit more rigid. These are things that I simply don't care for, and turn me off when included in roles. I am occasionally willing to make an exception, but it is not very often, and not for every limit.

My kinks: Age gaps, Older men, Perverts, Oral, Anal, Cum play, Large cocks, Interracial, Group play, Cheating, Outercourse, Risky situations, Taboo encounters, Public/Semi-Public sex, Clothed/Semi-Clothed sex, Reluctance, Loss of Innocence, and I am open to much more.

My limits: Alcohol and drugs being used as a catalyst for sex, blood, violence, toilet play, hardcore BDSM, humiliation, degradation, and body modifications/transformations.

**Roles**

For this section, I'm going to try to group roles together and explain what I like briefly for each grouping or idea, but we'll see how it goes. Obviously, I'm open to everything I list here. I'm happy to discuss anything I've listed below, or anything that the below list inspires! I'm open to combining roles, and changing up anything I may have laid out. Think of everything beyond this point as ideas and suggestions, nothing is concrete and has to be played the way I have written it. Also, in almost every idea I list below, I am open to playing it as a one-on-one roleplay, or involving multiple characters (not necessarily in a group scene). 

**Family Fun**

An old cliche, sure, but a fun one! Pretty open as to the exact pairing we explore here, but some of my favorites include: father/daughter, uncle/niece, brother/sister, cousins, grandfather/granddaughter, and step family roles (step-father/step-daughter, step-siblings, etc). 

**How Educational**

Another popular setting, I enjoy roles in educational settings, namely high school or college. There are about a thousand different pairings to explore here as well, so once again I'll try to provide some insight to my preferred pairings: teacher/student, student-teacher/student, student-teacher/teacher, principal/student, janitor/student, coach/athlete, parent (possibly acting as a chaperone)/student, students, roommates, dorm hall neighbors, RA/student, Professor/student, professor/teaching assistant, student-athlete/tudor, and countless other possible pairings.

**Inappropriate, But Oh So Good**

This is a list of roles where the pairing consists of two people who should definitely NOT be having sex, but definitely will be! Possibilities include: boss/employee, employee/customer, boss/intern, police officer/civilian, neighbors, dad/babysitter, friend's father, father's friend, boss's daughter, priest's daughter, politician and campaign intern or worker, boyfriend's father, sister's boyfriend, and so on. 

**Rule 34**

This group is simply to say that I'm open to exploring roles within fictional universes! Some of my preferred fictional universes are: The Office, Parks and Recreation, The Big Bang Theory, Star Wars, Marvel, DC, Modern Family, and I'm open to exploring others. *If you're interested in a long term roleplay involving multiple characters, centered around The Office message me ASAP*

**Let's Get Weird**

Disclaimer for this group, if you're interested in sci-fi or fantasy, or tentacles, please skip over this entire section. I'm interested in exploring a role involving aliens, sci-fi creatures like zombies or mutants, or tentacles. Some ideas include an abduction scene, a post-apocalyptic world, and an alternate universe.  

**Free Use**

I believe the best way for me to describe what I'm open to here is 'light-hearted free use', where it isn't demeaning, it's simply a situation where traditional rules and expectations about sex do not exist, or are very very different. Maybe it's contained to a family, or a small community like a workplace, school, or town. Or maybe it's the entire country, or world. Maybe it's just between two people, like two friends who treat sex as a very casual act. There are a ton of options here and I'm happy to explore them with you. 

**Celebrities**

I am open to a wide variety of roles involving a celebrity. It could be one of those cliche 'win-a-date' roles, or meeting a celebrity somewhere by chance. It could be a celebrity researching a role, or on vacation, or you could know the celebrity before she hit it big. There are a lot of possibilities here, and there are many different famous women I would love to play as. Or play with!

**Porn, it's a career, right?**

There are a number of different roles that can be done involving porn, like a pornstar moving in next door, or becoming your new roommate. Discovering your sister or friend does porn, or an amateur audition scene. There's also the idea of a celebrity mistakenly getting involved in a pornshoot, or a pornstar retiring and moving to small town, hoping to put her old life behind her. I'm open to playing as an actual pornstar, or as an original character.

Some other scenarios that I didn't list out yet, but I would love to explore include: A lesbian tries cock, a role involving nudism (nudist family, trip to a nude beach or nudist colony, etc), and a role involving bestiality (dog sitting, adventurous zoo keeper, farm girl, etc.).

I think that about covers it for now. Feel free to suggest anything else that my post may have inspired, or any roles you may have been wanting to try yourself and you think I might enjoy. I look forward to meeting some new roleplay partners!"

Hi everyone, HOLO have just posted this advert on their twitter, I have been a follower and supporter of the project for a long time so thought I'd share it here, as a side note they have always been very inclusive and supportive of minorities, the LGBTQ and women in tech.


The internship is a 10 week Internship program in Denver Colorado. Flights and accommodation are covered plus a small monthly salary.


This Internship is suitable for people who:

Are at minimum junior level developers

Are familiar with distributed apps

Understand full stack

Have downloaded and played with holochain


It is also open to Non US based interns so feel free to apply if you are not US based :)

More details about the internship can be found in the link.
The goal of the internship is to help developers who may be interested in a career with holochain to learn how to build distributed apps on top of the platform.


Holo was born out of holochain and the metacurrency project. Their goal is to provide peer to peer hosting for a distributed cloud, which will in the future support and provide hosting for holochain. Holochain is basically a scaleable distributed computing ecosystem with some similarities to blockchain, capable of supporting distributed apps and mutual credit currencies.

For people who aren't interested in the internship but would like to build or test apps on the holochain platform there are lots of resources available at the holochain developer portal:

92pn0v,2,2018-07-28,F4A - Asian College Slut,sexyasiangirl,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/92pn0v/f4a_asian_college_slut/,"Check out the bottom for a last minute addition that I really love!

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

- autocad design (3D model of our campus)
- a green roof building proposal (a graded group report we all did in our hydrology class)

the thing is I have some decent coding projects as well. We learned C in 1st year, but i went beyond that and wrote a few small and basic programs. I also learned Java on my own and coded a pretty basic app using GUI

Now I know coding isn't really a big deal in civil eng, so I was wondering if I should include these under my ""relevant projects"" section on my resume.

It's really irking me alot and also hurts me because she is my sibling and if it was some other random girl or boy telling me that I'm ugly and stuff I wouldn't really care on the very least. 
TL;DR
my sister calls me ugly, that boys only look at me because of my body, says I fall for guys easily (when I have turned them down), brags constantly about herself and how guys like her.

why is she like this? what can I do myself for her actions to stop bothering me?

Wake up in my $3,000 per month jr. studio apartment. Take off authentic signed Bryant replica jersey.

Pop adderall that my roommate left on counter before he went to Coachella.

Get ready to catch the L to River North and do my job.

Pull out my Rizzo replica because he had a better game last night, and he’s my real favorite anyway. Put Rizzo jersey over my American Apparel undershirt because I’m environmentally conscious.

Head to Coffee Bean next to my apartment. It’s only 3.5 on yelp, but Starbucks isn’t woke anymore.

Order is wrong but whatevs.  Steve Jobs said coffee was poison anyway.

Hop on the train.  A homeless family tries to get on after me.

“Don’t I know you?” the Mom says.  Realize that this is the family who lived in my apartment for 4 generations before the gentrification squad bought the complex and evicted them.

Avoid eye contact while waiting for the door to shut behind me. Not my fault anyway, Ex-StepDad is the one who pays the rent.

Pull out latest iPhone. 3rd upgrade this year. Plug in dongle and Apple earbuds to listen to obscure Indie band.

Pull out iPad.

Go on Cubs Subreddit and complain that ""Our Cubbies"" would have back to backed if Kershaw hadn't pitched game 5 (I always said we should have traded for him anyway). Guaranteed 50 upvotes.

Most beautiful girl of the 3 who works in my building sits down in front of me.  She’s wearing a Maddux Jersey.

“Hey Siri, which Cub is Maddux?”

Realize I’ve only been a fan since 2016.

Now she’s switching seats. I’m too woke for sex anyway.

Decide to call in sick. It’s an unpaid internship so no one cares.

Head to the mission for brunch and bottomless mimosas.

Fucking waiter said my card’s declined. New Step Dad forgot to pay it again.

Not even buzzed.

Pull up iWatch to check messages.

New Step Mom called concerned about a robbery/murder last night. A large lower class family died and she wants to make sure we get a deposit in on their apartment.

You don’t get an opportunity like this every day.

Take Macbook out of backpack and go on Facebook. Find that girl from the train…

“Do you like Addison Russell?”

Dammit. Blocked again.

Lyft home because I hear Uber isn’t woke these days.

Get out of Rizzo Jersey. Pop an edible and throw on my $900 Yeezy limited edition Baez Jammies. Yeezy likes Trump but I’m at home now so no need to be woke.

Check under the bed for Marcell Ozuna.

What the fuck, he’s there!

No wait that’s my other roommate. Guess he called out sick too.

Now I can’t sleep. Getting the munchies.

Nearest Lyft is 10 minutes away so I hoverboard down for Chinese food.

Shit, my favorite restaurant is closed.

There’s only one other Chinese place in the area and the rating isn’t a 5. One less than perfect, What would my real Dad think of this?

Dial him up…. “Hello, you’ve reached the phone of Yad-”

Straight to voicemail. Whatevs, Mikolas is my new Dad anyway.

Fuck it, I’ll get the Szechuan chicken.

Server brings me my food but it’s way too dry. I start to yell at her, but I stop myself because I’m woke again.

Realize that in Chicago, even 4 stars isn’t enough anymore."

She was always depressed but it really got bad about 3 years ago. I did my best to support her but I started losing motivation once her inward deteriation turned to lashing out at me in the form of verbal abuse and manipulation. 

Since then we have been trapped in a dangerous cycle of: [me getting mad at her--&gt; her blowing up on me and telling me I don't care about her (or equivalent)--&gt; me just getting over it--&gt; us eventually going back to being ""happy""] 

Now we are living together while I'm at an internship for the summer and it just sucks. She works twice a week (14hrs) while I work 40. However, she tells me that I'm lazy. She also never wants to go to anything social and gets mad at if I want to.

She has me spun into thinking that I need to run everything by her, put her first over everything, and cater to her social habits. All I can think about now is how I would be better off if I just broke up with her. 

I am definitely not without blame. I let her get this way with me, for I was trying to be understanding while she was dealing with depression. I ignore her when she treats me poorly and just go to work, come back, sleep, and repeat. I snap at her frequently because I feel like I have nothing to lose at this point. 

I've tried talking to her about this but she always shuts me out saying ""I don't want to do this right now"" but never gets around to just talking to me. Even through all of this I do love her, but I really don't know if that's enough.

Should I just end things, or push to finally have that real talk with her regardless of the past?

Thanks for the help.

It had been several years since we'd seen each other, and I had grown since then. No longer the skinny little twig of a barely-teen, I had grown into a...well...slender adult. Not everything was in complete proportion, and the delight of various girlfriends had given me more than enough confidence for my age. You might even say I was more than a little cocky at times.

I'd had a bad crush on you all those years ago, fantasizing about what I'd do to you if given half the chance. Of course it wasn't like it had ever gone away, you had. I'd found new spank-bank material, but any time I was reminded of you you would go right back to the top.

You had cemented my desire for older women, and I had never forgotten it. So when you moved back, needing a place for the summer until you had your own place I encouraged it. I already wasn't going on the yearly family trip due to an internship I'd landed, and while I didn't necessarily think anything was going to happen just the thought of your delicious female flesh so close for an extended time was thrilling. Enough so that I had to spend an hour draining my balls before picking you up from time airport so I would not have a massive tent.

With the parents gone, the house and you were all mine, and if there was any chance I wasn't going to waste it.

Hello everyone, thank you for reading. I was envisioning more of a dubcon scenario with my character being the sexual aggressor.

I left a lot of details out, such as age of the aunt, marital status, and even personality. Make her your own so I can do the same.

I tend towards the more...intense scenarios and kinks and submissive partners, so please let me know what you are comfortable with.

I look forward to the conquest."

It started very early this time, but finished right on time.

My therapist suggested that I go ahead and post it, looking for crowd-sourced ideas to get a grip on it. I will warn you, it gets a bit graphic at times, so if things like mutilation or forced surgery disturbs you, you might want to skip this.

So here goes, night by night. It's a bit long...

---

Night 1 (June 8, nearly a full month earlier than normal): I'm on the third or fourth floor. The dreams normally start with me in the parking lot, so this is even stranger than normal. Most of the lights are off, and I don't hear anything.

Night 2 (June 9): Still wandering the halls, looking for a stairwell. No sign of any Interns yet.

Night 3 (June 10): Looking out the windows, and yes, it's definitely the same fucking building as every other year, just early this year.

Night 4 (June 11): Still looking for a stairwell. The lights are still mostly off, about 1 out of every 4-5 is on, at about half power, flickering and buzzing.

Night 5 (June 12): More halls, more locked doors. No sign of the Interns, at all. Maybe they aren't ""here"" yet?

Night 6 (June 13): Found a stairwell, but it leads up, not down. Going to keep looking.

Night 7 (June 14): Definitely on the 3rd floor. A window from a couple of years ago when I tricked an Intern into smashing out of it is still there. Looking down into the parking lot, I can see where it landed, rags and bones. Why the fuck is this dream so consistent year after year?

Night 8 (June 15): Found a stairwell leading down. It's full of filing cabinets and drawers, so I'll have to be careful climbing over them to get down.

Night 9 (June 16): I've managed to work my way down to the second floor. After some advice from someone on Reddit's Dreaming subreddit, I have a goal in mind: work my way down to the swamp while nobody is ""there"" and see what I can find. And I found my marker, too.

Night 10 (June 17): Made it down to the second floor ballroom. Couldn't find the stairwell to the first floor, but I know where the renovation slide is from a second floor window outside. Took it, and landed just inside the fence. Total sleep was just over an hour.

Night 11 (June 18): Now I know where baby Interns come from. Woke up, and now my entire body is aching and sore.

Night 12 (June 19): Back on the second floor. Slide is in tatters now, so I guess that means I shouldn't try that again. Just sat in the hallway and cried until I woke up.

Night 13 (June 20): Wandering the halls again, got as far as the 4th floor. Heard something like scratching several time, but haven't seen anything.

Night 14 (June 21): Made it to the cafeteria. Doors are closed and locked, and the lights are off.

Night 15 (June 22): More empty halls, walked through the foyer. 3 cars out front, all burned out. Woke up with a blinding headache.

Night 16 (June 23): Found a balcony on the 3rd floor looking out the side of the building, trees for as far as I can see.

Night 17 (June 24): Surgery is on the 6th floor, and the observation room is on the 7th. I've never been up there.

Night 18 (June 25): More hallways. Heard someone crying, but couldn't find them.

Night 19 (June 26): More scratching. Found a few of the messages from last year with long gouges through them, like something was digging them off the walls. 30 more days of this. Yay.

Night 20 (June 27): Looking out a window on the back side of the building, I can see movement down in the swamp. Looks like the Interns are gathering.

Night 21 (June 28): Interns are climbing the back of the building. So I'm sticking to hallways towards the front.

Night 22 (June 29): Floor opened up and swallowed me. This happens occasionally, and I usually end up out front in the parking lot.

Night 23 (June 30): Floating. Can't really tell up or down. Not hot or cold, no light, just wet.

Night 24 (July 1): So guess where I am in the dream. Since this shit started early this year, maybe it will end early, right? Wrong. I'm in the fucking parking lot, burned out cars, front doors to the building wide open, lights on. So it's starting all over again. Fuck.

Night 25 (July 2): Went in the main doors. The lights (what there are of them) are on. Tried heading down to the cafeteria, but no, stairwell is completely blocked off with filing cabinets. Took a stairwell up and ducked into a room, 2 Interns right behind me. The Interns don't follow me into rooms until much later in the dreams. So for now I'm safe as long as I don't go near the door in a room, or unless an Intern is already in a room I go into.

Night 26 (July 3): On the 2nd floor, and I know what's causing the gouges and scraping noises. Spotted an Intern scratching off the messages Dana and I left each other last year with what looked like a grill spatula. It was so involved with its task that I was able to sneak right up to it, watch for several minutes, and then sneak right on past it.

Night 27 (July 4): Another night of roaming the halls and avoiding Interns. I almost hate nights like this more than the ones where I'm constantly chased. Just that feeling of dread, knowing they'll grab me at any moment, and then nothing.

*Addendum (Evening of July 5, before bed): I've been debating whether or not to actually write this one down, but it does help fill in the blanks, so here goes. This afternoon while doing a bit of shopping with my girlfriend, we started down an aisle and my eye caught a ""barbecue tool set"" on display. You know, the usual bits, tongs, skewers, a novelty apron, and a grill spatula. A long grill spatula with a serrated edge. Instantly I was right back in the hallway on the 2nd floor from a couple of nights ago, trying to sneak past the Intern using a spatula to scrape off the messages Dana and I wrote each other last year. I know it had to frighten my girlfriend, me standing there, probably shaking like a leaf, while I was trying to be as quiet as possible and sneak past this thing before it heard or smelled me. Then just as suddenly, I was back in the middle of the store, and she was asking me if I was okay. I don't know if it's just lack of sleep, or what, but it's starting to bleed over into my waking moments. Last time that happened was a number of years ago, and I almost ended up getting committed because of it.*

Night 28 (July 5): Almost got caught by an Intern on the 3rd floor. Barely got away after it grabbed my arm by jumping down the stairwell. I am now physically sore, and my arm feels like it's been yanked out of its socket.

Night 29 (July 6): Been leaving messages for Dana, but no sign of her yet. Mainly hid on the 2nd floor, trying to get back to the basement and the cafeteria. Watched an Intern open a wall by pushing on it. It grew a ""hallway,"" the Intern stepped through, and the wall grew back shut. That happens from time to time.

*Addendum Afternoon 30 (July 7): Daytime naps are usually safe, since I doze and don't enter REM sleep. Apparently I did this time. I was in a stairwell, no doors out of it onto any hallways. Woke up about 45 minutes later.*

Night 30 (July 7): Stairwell finally opened on the upper end. More of the usual, Interns chasing me up and down halls. Then they went away for a bit. I decided to try making my way down to the cafeteria again. Saw a group of Interns gathered around something (someone?), eating it. Woke up, threw up, stayed up.

Night 31 (July 8): Made my way up to another floor, looking for messages from Dana. Still nothing. After the night before last, I'm even more concerned. Quite a few blood smears on the walls now.

*Addendum (July 8 Afternoon): Had to take a nap, I was dead on my feet. Of course, I was there again, running down a hall trying to get away from an Intern. Ran in an office, tried to shut the door behind me, and the Intern grabbed my arm. Trying to pull away, and the Intern bit down, taking my arm from just below the elbow. Woke up, my arm feels like it's on fire.*

Night 32 (July 9): When the dream started again, I was back in the parking lot, arm back as if it never happened. That happens often. I get seriously injured/killed by the Interns (or myself), and ""wake back up"" in the parking lot the next time I fall asleep. Now I have a choice of going back inside and avoiding the Interns until they catch me, or sit down here in the parking lot and wait for them to come drag me in. I hate this dream.

Night 33 (July 10): Went in the front doors (again), and started making my way up to the 3rd floor so I can get down to the cafeteria. Still no messages from Dana.

Night 34 (July 11): Made it to the 2nd floor. There's more Interns around than normal, so something is up.

Night 35 (July 12): 3rd floor. All the Interns are clustered on the 2nd. 3rd is almost entirely empty. I'll be heading to the cafeteria soon. Still no word from Dana, but I leave her messages every night.

*Addendum (July 13 Afternoon): Took a nap, empty hallways on the 3rd floor. Woke up from the nap, started fixing dinner (my night for dinner, usual schedule). While I was at the stove cooking, I turned around, and saw an Intern walking from the dining room, through the kitchen, and into the hallway. Sleep deprivation.*

Night 36 (July 13): Made it to the cafeteria, finally. Lights were on, doors unlocked, and people inside. I went in, and sat at the booth. Then Susan (old friend from elementary/high school) came in and sat at the booth with me. I haven't seen her in years, and told her so. She replied with ""Something is different this year. They're changing the rules."" I tried asking her what she meant, and she said ""I can't say, but things are dangerous this year. They got Becky last night and she didn't wake up."" (Susan has a younger sister named Becky.) I kept asking her what she meant, and what I could do, but she said ""I can't say, just be careful. Dana is looking for you,"" and then she walked towards the cafeteria doors, when several Interns reached in and grabbed her. As they started biting into her, she said ""Remember what I said. Be careful and find Dana.""

Night 37 (July 14): Still sitting in the cafeteria, generic people coming and going. The Interns never grab them, or even acknowledge that they're there. Of course, the people don't acknowledge me either, so it's even. I'm trying to figure out how to even get started finding Dana.

Night 38: (July 15): Couldn't sit in the cafeteria for the next 2 weeks, so I went out soon as I noticed no more Interns. Saw a new green marker arrow pointing at the stairwell, so of course I followed it. Back up to the 3rd floor, and there was another green marker arrow pointing down the hall. Made my way down, and one of the doors had ""HERE!"" written on it (yes, in the same green marker). It also had a lot of bloody hand and fist prints on it. Woke up before I could open the door though.

Night 39 (July 16): Dream picked up where it left off. Soon as I touched the door, the floor swallowed me. Again. And I found myself in a different part of the building. Something doesn't want me to open that door.

Night 40 (July 17): Apparently I'm on the 4th floor. Started working my way through the halls to get back to the 3rd, when an Intern started chasing me. Tripped and fell when it grabbed my leg and twisted. I kicked and swung my stick until I got loose, then managed to reach the stairwell. Right leg is sore now. Waiting to see if it bruises up like my arm did.

Night 41 (July 18): Dream picked up right where it left off, in a stairwell on the 4th floor. The Interns don't/can't enter the stairwells. Problem is, it's an up stairwell. So my choices are to go up to the 5th floor, or walk right into the arms of the Interns waiting for me on the 4th. My girlfriend suggested lucid dreaming my way to another floor or to the parking lot. So I tried it. It's never easy, the most I've been able to manage is to dream up a fresh marker from time to time. This time wasn't any different. Couldn't change my location at all.

Night 42 (July 19): Started out on the 2nd floor. No clue how or why, but I'm there. More endless halls, dodged Interns all night trying to get to the 3rd again. I feel like something is delaying me. No further word from Dana.

*Addendum July 20: Since last night I slept less than an hour (total sleep time 35 hours over 41 nights), I'm now into the hallucinatory stage of sleep deprivation. Everything that moves has a trail of after-images like a bad CGI acid trip. And the occasional glances out of the corner of my eyes of 4 large pale arms reaching around me isn't helping.*

Night 43 (July 20): They got me. Soon as I stepped out into the hallway, 2 Interns grabbed me. Didn't even see them there. Still don't know how they get between floors, but I'm strapped down into the operating chair on the 6th floor, just waiting for the Surgeons. Slept just over an hour and a half before I woke up sweating.

Night 44 (July 21): I'm strapped down in the chair again. I can see the Interns gathered around the corners of the room. Looking up I see the observation booth windows, people in the chairs tied down and looking down at me. The voice comes on from the overhead speakers, ""Begin Phase One"" and 4 of the fucking Surgeons march into the room. They start cutting away my pants, and my left leg gets lifted up onto the frame. They start cutting, halfway up between my knee and hip. I can feel them cutting through each layer, skin, muscle, all the way down to the bone. While 2 of them are doing that, 2 more are further down cutting from the other side, below my knee, but I can't feel that. they slice open my lower leg in the back to get to the silicon sac for my knee, and further down to get the flex sensor wiring and plate in my foot. When the first 2 finally get to the bone, their fingers change to serrated saws instead of scalpels. I can feel the serrations as they scrape across the bone. The other 2 Surgeons extract all the parts below the knee itself, but leave it attached to the knee. The first 2 stop sawing about halfway through the bone, and then start squeezing above where they cut my leg. The other 2 Surgeons grab what's left of my leg right above the knee and start pulling and twisting until what's left of the bone snaps. Then I heard the voice again. That has never happened before. It said ""We are losing the patient. We are losing the patient. Stand by until it returns."" Then I woke up, my leg feeling like it was on fire, and barely able to support my weight.

Night 45 (July 22): Still in the chair, Surgeons standing over me. The voice says ""Patient returned, continue Phase One."" One of the Surgeons grabs my left arm and pulls it out straight, while another one starts cutting in right above my elbow. I feel it peeling the skin back, and cutting into the muscles. Then it starts sawing away at the bones, cutting where the pins were put in to repair my arm. When it finished, the other Surgeon dropped what was left of my arm down onto my body. Another Surgeon grabbed my head and lifted it up while they put a frame on the upper end of the chair to keep my head in place. I feel them starting to cut into the back of my head, going after the clip back there. That voice started again ""We are losing the patient again. We are losing the patient again. Stand by until it returns."" And then I woke up with a pounding headache and my left forearm tingling and numb. This makes me feel like there actually is time passing ""there"" when I'm awake. I still don't know how to stop it though, or even why it's happening.

Night 46 (July 23): They're cutting into my head. I can't move my head, but I can see the observation booth windows. My friends are there as usual, like they're paralyzed and tied to their chairs. Then one of them stood up, and held a sign up against the window, written in green marker. ""WAKE UP WE CAN STOP THEM NOW FIND ME DANA K."" I can't see her face but she has brown hair, shoulder length. One of the Surgeons notices and motions to the Interns, who go running out of the room. Then the voice says ""Interference! Stand by until interference ends."" Then the dream stopped and I woke up, head still hurting.

Night 47 (July 24): Still in the chair, and the room is spinning. The voice says ""Patient returned, continue Phase One,"" again. 2 Surgeons have removed my brace from my hand, and are taking my hand apart, finger by finger. While they're doing that 2 other Surgeons are cutting into my chest, right around the ICD. The pain is unbearable. All I can think of is what Dana's sign said. Then the voice says ""We are losing the patient again. Stand by until it returns."" I woke up, and it feels like my chest is burning, just like an attack. I had to take a nitro to get it under control. Monitor service called right after I took it wanting to know if I was okay. They said I registered a tachycardia event, and stayed on the line with me until my heart rate went back to normal.

Night 48 (July 25): The voice says ""Patient returned, continue Phase One."" and the Surgeons start cutting into my chest again. They reach the ICD and start pulling to extract it and the leads. I can feel every inch of it being extracted. I try willing myself awake again, but it's like pushing a waterfall backwards. They finish removing it, and the voice says ""Begin phase two."" The Surgeons back up, and the Interns gather around me, grabbing what's left of my arms and legs. They start lifting me up out of the chair, when the voice says ""We are losing the patient again. If the patient continues we will not be able to retrieve it."" I keep pushing hard as I can, and I wake up, covered in sweat and shaking.

It's over for another year, I hope."
92t8f0,0,2018-07-29,20 Years Old With $100K in savings and ~$300/mo. Expenses.,MegaCrapkin,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/92t8f0/20_years_old_with_100k_in_savings_and_300mo/,"So my dad unexpectedly passed at 48 in January and, despite having little contact for the past few years (yes, I regret a lot but that's for another discussion in another place), he left me about $95,000 in life insurance. 

Currently, I am attending college as a second-year undergraduate with about three years left pursuing a double major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My mom/step-dad have a large college fund (don't know the exact amount, but was inferred it was ~$200K) so my undergrad is fully paid for. Plus, my mother recently got a job at PSU so me and my fiancée will be moving up to Pennsylvania from Texas just after Christmas. There I will have free tuition, so even less will be taken from that fund. I believe whatever I don't use will be given to me once I finish my undergraduate, but I am not clear on that. From there, I plan on earning a Master's in Electrical Engineering. Not sure about a PhD just yet, I want to see how my research goes and what I want to do. My mother pays for my housing up to $800/mo. and gives me $250/mo. for food/gas/other expenses. Currently, I am doing my best to budget my expenses and my gas, food, discretionary, and pet funds total to about $300-350/mo. I quit my part-time retail job at the beginning of June due to poor management and burnout issues. I was getting depressed going to work, so I figured I could use money I had saved in my checking account plus the monthly allowance from my mother to survive for 6-12 months before getting another job or looking for a paying research position (not likely). In conclusion

**College**: Undergraduate paid for. Master's unpaid for, but extra college fund from undergraduate can be put towards it. PhD optional.

**Housing**: Paid for up to $800/mo. including utilities.

**Income**: Currently none. Within the next 12 months I am planning on having at least a part-time job if not an internship (no look in current state, but moving soon).

**Current finances**: $350/mo. expenses - $250/mo allowance. $100,000 in savings account with annual yield of 0.30%. Enough in checking to last for 6-12 months.

**Relationship**: Engaged for two years. Waiting to finish undergrad to get married. She will graduate at the end of the year.

**Credit**: I have no credit history. I've applied for about five credit cards (Amazon, the store I worked at, etc.) but I wasn't accepted for any of them. It's been almost a year since I tried to apply for anything. I was considering simply going through my credit union to get a secured card since I can't seem to find one that will accept me. My friend also threw out Discover Student as an option, but I haven't researched that yet.

Currently, I am looking at a Roth IRA (don't know anything at all, just went to my credit union's website, read a few paragraphs and printed out the application form) and considering visiting a financial advisor as my mother has advised that since that is what she and my step-dad do (estimated combined income of ~$300,000 for them). Other than that, I don't know what to do with the money. The $16/mo. it earns in my savings account isn't really much compared to how much it is, and I want to make sure me and my fiancée can live an easy life without having to worry about money. Also, my fiancée, when she graduates at the end of the year, will have to finish paying off her car and student loans. She gets stressed easily and I figured I could take $5,000 out of my savings to help her finish that off or at least get close. Additionally, I wanted to keep $10,000 on hand to take care of emergencies my two cats may run into. My last cat took about $6,000 in expenses within eight days before she passed, so I want to be prepared if anything happens there. With the other ~$85,000 I'm looking for something to invest and maybe provide a small passive income. I'm not really sure what the best route is, what to do with it, or what I should even look to get out of it.

I don't think I've left out any pertinent information in this post, but please let me know if I have and I'll reply and update the post. Thank you all in advance for any help you can provide!"

I'm a college student who'll be moving to the Seattle area soon. I hope to score a car that will be a reliable daily driver for 4-10-mile commutes (one-way) while also being roomy enough to move my worldly possessions with (the usual stuff a student has plus a small collection of desktop PCs and other computer hardware) because my lifestyle involves periodically relocating for internships and work.

The car has to last me 1-3 years. My budget has a soft cap of $10,000 but the cheaper, the better. My main concerns are safety, interior space, comfort for tall people (I'm about 6'2""), and avoiding any unexpected costs (if a car will need maintenance or repairs, they should be predictable). In general, I'd prefer something SUV- or crossover-sized but I'm not dead-set on that.

Some local cars I tried and my thoughts on them:

- 2008 Pontiac Torrent, 72k miles, ~$6200 pretax - looks perfect on paper and felt perfect when I drove it but I've heard GM reliability is poor.

- 2010 Toyota Matrix, 68k miles, ~$8000 pretax - Handled well enough and Toyota is supposedly a reliable brand. Extremely noisy on highways and felt a little small. Near the top of my budget.

- 2012 VW Jetta, 50k miles, ~$8000 pretax - surprisingly roomy trunk and interior. Would prefer a larger car on principle but VW is supposedly one of the more reliable brands. Near the top of my budget.

- 2006 Chevy HHR, 30k miles, ~$6500 pretax - interior was impressively roomy but driving experience felt unsafe (tiny windshield, poor visibility, overly wide turning radius). Low mileage a plus but GM reliability is supposedly poor.

Opinions on the above as well as recommendations for any other car models to look for would be much appreciated.

Answers to the guideline questions:

    I require a car with 4+ doors. I do need room for cargo or passengers.

    My price range is up to $10,000 USD all-in with some flexibility.

    This car will primarily be used for commuting short distances. Occasional 200-mile trips.

    Minimum # of seats: 4

Because of getting pulled over a lot in Florida (headlights would intermittently turn off) and getting caught with expired registration twice over 4 years, I have to pay a 6 month premium in full every time to Geico to keep my insurance (I pay $900 in full for 6 months, i know, crazy). I paid $900 in May, 2018 so my Florida Geico Insurance will expire in November. I also paid for registration for 2 years in full, so it expires in 2019.

I heard I might be able to get a refund for my registration, but I can't find anything about getting a refund from Geico if I want to change insurances for my new state. Also, will my Geico insurance transfer through states easily? Will I be able to ask for a refund for my registration+insurance while I'm in Boston or do I have to do everything in person at the Florida DMV?"
92um85,454,2018-07-29,My grandparents [98M and 89F] are livid that I've told them I [26F] am quitting my job. How do I repair our relationship and get them to understand?,Solitaryconfitduck,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/92um85/my_grandparents_98m_and_89f_are_livid_that_ive/,"Some backstory on my job: I've been working there for a little over three years now. I got hired straight out of college and I've been working there ever since. In that time, I haven't received a single raise or a promotion. Instead, my coworkers, who never went to college and started after me, with the same job, have received an average raise of $10K since they've started (our position explicitly demands a college degree, but they somehow get around it). They all now make more than me, and openly discuss how ""poor"" they are, which frustrates me and makes me resentful. I've also been promised a promotion three times to officially get the title I've been doing for the past two years, but then I find out it's ""not in the budget"" every time. For the past two years, I had been acting as an editor, and I kept getting told to keep being an editor so they can have ammo to support me officially getting the promotion, but it never materialized.

In January, they switched me to a new assignment. I got switched from being a reporter and a de facto editor to a ""writer."" I was told it would be temporary. When I asked to make the salary the former employee made, I was told absolutely not. When I asked if I could go back to my old job when they officially hire a new person to replace her, which I actually enjoyed, I was told absolutely not. I'm basically spending my days doing tech support for old people who don't know anything and this is a whole fat piece of ""I was never originally hired to do this."" I was told that if I didn't stay at this new position, and tried to leave and go elsewhere, I would be blacklisted from ever finding a job again.

My new boss and I do not get along. He makes comments about my religion (I am the only non-Catholic in the office), he inquires a lot about my sick days, and I honestly just don't agree with the mission of this new department at all and it feels like it's my job to stop him from embarrassing himself and our entire organization.

Over the past month, he's put me on ""probation"" for disagreeing with him too often. He also gave me a ""strike"" for refusing to stay later, past 6:30, to work on something when I had a previous commitment (I work 8 AM-5:30 PM, no lunch break). He also keeps accusing me of being a plant in the organization to try to bring it down because I disagree with him.

On Friday, I snapped, since I found out an intern just got hired for the very exact job I said I wanted, at a starting salary much higher than my own. They created this job out of nowhere and gave it to him despite it being the job I had always said I wanted to go back to, but they told me it didn't exist for me.

I was so fed up on Friday, after arguing with my boss all day about an assignment, that I asked to just go home at 4 PM and take the day as a sick day. He flipped out and, after I left work, made someone stop by my house to make sure I was ""okay."" I live over 2 hours from work.

Onto my grandparents: My grandparents have known that I've wanted to leave my job for a very long time now. In fact, when I was visited them last month, I had to cut my trip short to rush home for a job interview I got last minute. When I told them about the interview, my grandfather said, ""Don't leave your job until you have a new one."" I did get that job offer, but it didn't work logistically for me, fwiw. I've been interviewing the past few weeks with a new position, but it requires me to take vacation days randomly that get me in trouble (especially on probation), and I think my time would be better spent home, applying for jobs, than working at this job that makes me miserable. When I told my grandmother I plan to leave, she said no, give it more time, and stick it out. I told her I spent six months in this new position and it isn't for me. She said to just give it more time, years even, and never to leave a job before I have a new one. She told me if I leave I might never get a job again for as long as I live, and I should be grateful I have a paycheck at all. I got really annoyed and told her I had to get off the phone, but she was screaming at me for even thinking of leaving a company ""after everything they've done for you."" Apparently, denying my days off for religious holidays, denying me raises and promotions, and threatening my employment are all great things they've done for me.

I know it's probably a generational thing to not want to leave a job until you find a new one, and to stay at one company for your entire life, but I really resent my entire position here. My grandfather used to clean bathrooms before he got promoted to working his actual job… But things aren't really like that anymore. People are coming in and getting hired at positions above me, despite how long I've been there, and it's not the same kind of environment nor job market that they were faced with. I'm upset I got so upset I had to abruptly hang up on my grandmother, but how do I make them understand why I need to leave?

\*Edit to add: I will NOT be on the street starving if I quit this job. I do not have any debt or recurring payments I need to make outside rent and utilities, and at my current standard of living, I can survive for a decade off my savings.

**Edit 2: Since some of you apparently think I am a trust fund baby, I am not. I went to college on a scholarship and put my money immediately into savings, CDs, etc. when I turned 18 that I had saved up from my first job at 16-18.

TL;DR My job is horrible. I get passed over for promotions and raises and I got demoted, put on probation, and threatened with ""strikes"" whenever I try to clarify anything to my boss so we don't seem like blubbering idiots. My grandparents believe that you should never leave a job until you have a new one, and do not support me in leaving, no matter how terrible it is. How do I explain to them the situation is just unbearable?"

Okay, episode 5, let's continue.


0:55 - A joke where Arin continues to slice at a wooden gate after it's already broken, asking repeatedly ""did I get it?"" Normally, wouldn't be that bad, like, some Youtubers, it'd be mildly humorous. But with Arin, you know it's just stalling for time. This lasts for a good half a minute.
It feels longer than it sounds.


1:34 - *Arin flails around randomly to kill bats*

Dan: ""That's better than Z-targeting in Zelda 64, right?""

Arin: ""Eh, it's about the same, isn't it? I don't know.""

Dan: ""Well, I mean, in terms of this feels more precise, at least.""

Arin: ""Oh, well yeah, I think the camera's a little further out. It's also wide-screen so that helps a little bit.""


What the fuck are you talking about. Z-targetting locks onto a target. Camera is almost never an issue and it *locks onto a target.* You can't get more ""*precise*"" than what is basically a homing strike.


Not that Arin would fucking know considering all the times he didn't use Z-targetting. He's literally just swinging randomly and hoping to hit and they just fly into it. There's no precision in that.


3:46 - Arin: ""Two generations after Ocarina of Time, and it just feels like a fucking Ocarina of TIme cave.""


What the fuck does that even *mean,* Arin. Please, explain, I would really love to know so that I could thoroughly rip it to shreds.


4:20 - UUUUUUUUNGH. ZELDA AGAIN. Yeah, 4:20, I wish I was fucking stoned for this shit, cause now I got to listen to Arin's *stellar* voice-over work again.


5:07 - And burps into the mic. Glad to see **that** is a live and well.


5:24 - RIP headphone users. Hope you enjoyed ear-splitting pitch.


9:00 - Again, I'm sorry for repeating it, but... the faces just don't look quite right to me.


11:30 - So they just had this conversation where they were trying to remember of the pieces of the Triforce had corresponding colors cause Dan mentioned Link's bird is red, which is usually associated to Ganon. And Arin was like ""were they?"" and eventually they were like ""eh, fuck it, can't remember.""


Now this may be just bullshit on my part, but for someone who's so into Zelda that he thinks he can fucking go all critic on it like he's a damn expert, you'd think this is something he should know by now. Like, I can understand the color purple. That one is more speculative, more fan theory, so it hasn't been canonically officialized, but green, red, and blue have been.


Now sure, you could say, ""yeah, but he's a fan of the mechanics, not the lore part,"" and I suppose that's true. This may be me just being nitpicky, but it was a thought.


And no, I'm not going to talk about the Papa John shit.


14:36 - Oh fuck me. His ""Cartman"" voice is even worse than his Zelda voice.


Aside from being a real dick about it, Groose does kind of have a point though. I mean, clearly people, Zelda included, thinks Link kind of lazes about, and he *does* get special treatment. If you think about it, if you were Groose, you'd be pretty pissed off too.


""We do all this work and practice, preparing for this huge event that's the next part of the rest of our lives, while all you do is hang around, and they delay the ceremony for *you* because you know Zelda so well.""


Anyway, that's the end of the episode.


[**EPISODE 6**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhntF0hAuos)


1:52 - Dan: ""Was I monologuing out loud?"" The best and most apt joke so far in the playthrough.


Also, like seriously, why does every antagonist like Groose have to be, like, so... cliche. I mean, why do you have to shoe-horn in a crush with Zelda, him trying to sabotage things (though at least that one is not-okay-but-still-understandable-justification), him monologuing solely for the audience. Oh well, whatever.


The writing is getting to me.


3:24 - *Of course.* Birds flying with a smoke trail. HURHUR FART JOKE! Unnnnnnnnngh.


4:42 - That's it? There's only four contenders of this supposedly huge event? In fact, I've barely seen any people around. I question the sustainability of this place to avoid genetic bottle-necking. Shit, that might explain the physical weirdness... that's my head canon now. Skyloft is actually mostly populated by inbreds. They're like if The Hills Have Eyes banged The Birds.


5:12 - Wait a minute. Hold up. This knight's academy of yours is only 25  years old? They act like it's some ancient ceremony done throughout the generations! What the fuck were you guys doing beforehand? How old is fucking Skyloft? What did they do for defense beforehand? Is that even the purpose of these knights? This raises so many questions for me!


8:47 - Okay, yeah. She wants him to roost his bird in her nest. She's ready to soar. She's ready for him to dive into her canyon. For his woodpecker to hit that tree. Gonna spread her wings and prey on his snake. Wants her feathers ruffled.


12:26 - Oh she is a tease. I can dig that.


13:00 - Arin, talking about his parachute: ""You don't even have to use it. It just does it automatically.* **IMMEDIATELY HITS THE GROUND.**


Not gonna lie, that was pretty great.


[**EPISODE 7**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmSm8at4Rtc)


Well, I had a rough night of fucking constantly awaking up and falling asleep again. Now I get to top it with Grumps. Let's see how this experiment goes. For science.


0:57 - A thought just occurred to me. Totally unrelated to the show. All these games you play as Link? Twilight Princess, Wind Waker, original Zelda... all these Links you play as beforehand are fucking dead.


Like, yeah, we knew that about Twilight Princess, but same is for all the others, too. I just never really thought about it. Cause you play a game, you're in the present, but you're not, you're playing in the past. And the games are like...


A link to the past!? We're going full meta-circle!! I'm sorry, I'm still very tired.


1:35 - Fi appears for the first time.


3:03 - Okay, that tornado was not black, okay. And you know, a black tornado would actually be *normal!* What makes it weird is it was clear skies! Come on, Japan, get on our level, nobody knows tornadoes better than the US!


Actually, thinking about it, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a localization goof. Like in the original language, it was more towards ""ominous"" but got translated as ""black,"" but in context of what you just saw, doesn't make much sense.


7:08 - Arin mildly whining about stamina again, saying words but not meaning anything substantive.


9:09 - She is officially introduced as Fi.


8:56 ~ 10:04 - I can see why Arin refers to her as a ""computer."" I'm sorry game, but there are much better ways to create the kind of artificial dialogue you want but without sounding like a robot. This just isn't good and really does not fit well.


10:42 - ""Does that information invigorate you?"" See, this is what I mean. It's such a bizarre and alien thing to say, but it doesn't really work towards what I suspect they're going for. I'm sorry that I keep ragging on the writing but it really could be so much better. I'm sorry but this does not read like it was written by a professional to me, it reads more like it was written by an intern.


14:12 - I'm sorry, she's just so badly written! It frustrates me as someone who is also a writer! It's so amateurish! I'll try to stop bring it up.


Alright, that wraps up this episode and this summary."
92v246,3,2018-07-29,Some Extra Trade Suggestions,ADAVOL,EscapefromTarkov,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/92v246/some_extra_trade_suggestions/,"Suggested one of these on this thread - https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/92oqxv/changes_in_trades/ but thought I’d expand upon it so here goes!

--------
**Prapor**

- Add PSO 1M2-1 at LL1 for x5 lvl 1 Dogtags (or similar) – Isn’t available to buy until Prapor LL2 and completing Prapors’ 5th quest. It is an incredibly useful optic and would definitely help players out during the early levels for example on woods; it is also the only available magnified optic until ~lvl 20 from the traders.

- Add Suppressed PP-19 at LL1 for x10 Black Handle Knifes (MP5 is brown handle) – Similar vein to MP5 idea below; rewards you with something you can’t easily make for a good few levels.

- Add Box of 30/60/120 pieces of 5.45x39 mm BP at LL2 for x4 Crickets (or similar) – Makes the end game ammo more accessible – this variant isn’t acquirable until LL4. Potential for discount.

- Add Box of 30/60/120 pieces of 5.45x39 mm BS at LL3 for x3 GPhones (or similar) – Makes the end game ammo more accessible – this variant isn’t acquirable until LL4. Potential for discount.

- Add Box of 30/60/120 pieces of 7.62x39 mm BP at LL2 / LL3 for x2 Cats (or similar) – Makes the end game ammo more accessible – this variant isn’t acquirable until LL4 and completing “The Punisher - Part 5”. Potential for discount.

- Alter LL2 - SV-98 Trade In to include sniper rifle scope (&gt;4x Mag) – Makes it a more attractive trade and encourages the use of those scopes; perhaps slight price buff after this change.

--------
**Therapist** - To be fair I think she’s currently spot on for the most part.

- ~~Add Toolkit for x1 Yellow Pliers, x1 Red Pliers, x1 Screwdriver, x1 Tape Measure, 1 wrench and x1 Blue Tape at LL1 or LL2 – Seems logical that you could piece together one of those toolkits from these parts - useful for trades and mechanics’ 2nd quest. Could be featured as a mechanic trade instead of Therapist.~~ Added to mechanic LL1 - 1 yellow pliers, 1 wrench, 1 blue tape, 1 screwdriver.

- Maybe add a trade for Morphine at LL2 / LL3 for something like 2x Saline Solution or 1x Augmentin + 1x Ibuprofen? Would be a useful trade in, in the intern.

- Maybe add a trade (or quest) for a Keybar at LL3 / LL4 for a collection of keys she wants?

--------
**Skier** – Again another one I think is in a good place.

- Add an OP-SKS at LL1 for 2x AVS Rigs (like the 2x Blackrock trade - AK trade from Prapor) – Similar to the PSO concept; been able to mount a sight on a gun is incredibly useful and having the combined PSO + OP-SKS at essentially lvl 1 would be an incredibly useful and powerful combination early on. Personally the (OP-)SKS is one of my favourite weapons and a suitable trade would probably see me keeping an eye out for a free SKS after a raid.

- Alter LL4 - Suppressed DVL-10 Trade In to include sniper rifle scope (&gt;4 Mag) – Makes it a more attractive trade and encourages the use of those scopes; perhaps slight price buff after this change.

- Maybe add a DVL-10 trade at LL3 for 4 Propane Tanks + 8 AA Batteries (or simmilar like the SV-98 Trade) - Brings it in line with the SV-98 / Prapor and useful for mechanic questline.

--------
**Peacekeeper**

- Add a Civilian M4A1 Variant at LL1 / LL2 for $$$ – Single shot variant akin to the VEPR at a similar cost.

- Add a Box of 30/60 pieces of 7.62x51 mm M61 + M62 at LL3 / LL4 for x3 GMcounters (or similar) – Makes the end game ammo more accessible – this variant isn’t acquirable until LL4 and completing sniper level 7 quest. Potential for discount.

- Add a Box of 30/60/120 pieces of 7 5.56x45 mm M995 at LL2 / LL3 for x2 Cats (or similar) – Makes the end game ammo more accessible – this variant isn’t acquirable until LL4. Potential for discount.

- Move MP5 and MP5 Trade from LL2 to LL1 – This would then be in line with the PP-19 from Prapor.

- Change LL2 MP5 Trade In (the 10 brown knifes) to be for a suppressed variant; consider doing the same for the MPX.

--------
**Mechanic**

- Add a sniper rifle styled weapon featuring the 2000m Night Force scope at LL2 / LL3 for 3/4/5 Bitcoins or 7/8/9/10 Gold Chains – Such as the SV-98, DVL-10, RSASS or M1A. Would be useful for mechanic quests and potentially encourage more sniper play; he also doesn’t offer any weapons like this currently until LL4 aka RSASS M1A. Something akin to this (perhaps with one of the LL4 muzzle breaks, and featuring the Night Force scope) would be nice - https://imgur.com/gallery/0Jm8Aim

- Add the RSASS Receiever and RSASS Gas Block at LL3 for €€€ – You can already buy all the parts to more or less build one at LL4 Peacekeeper, it is also required for a quest. Balanced by been less convenient and more expensive than the unlocked trade.

- Maybe trade in’s for the VEPR and suggested civilian M4A1 + additional cash (so you can’t exploit and make cash / just get an AKM for cheaper than buying it for example) for automatic variants of the guns e.g. AKM for the VEPR. Would save cash and give a serious reason for looting some of those Scav guns.

--------
**Ragman**

- ~~Add a Paca OR 3M at LL1 for x5/6/7 lvl 1 Player Dogtags or something similar e.g. figures, etc. – Armour is currently invaluable and greatly increases survivability - having something that can at least be acquired at level 1 would be incredibly useful, and was one of the most wanted things myself and friends wanted during the early grind.~~ Added - Ragman LL1 - Paca for 5 Scav Half-Masks

- Add a Kolpak Visor trade at LL1 for x2 Plex? – Similar trade to the new Altyn one; currently can’t acquire this face shield that would be fun to have at low levels.

- Add a AVS and/or Blackrock Rig trade at LL1 for 2x DVD Drives (?) – A nice alternative than having to run the Scav Vest much like the Sling vs. MBSS.

- Move Camouflaged 6B47 Helmet trade to LL1 – Rewards players and gives a good helmet early on that can be bought later.

--------
**Other (More Out There) Ideas**
Just a few suggestions that might be interesting to have:

- Add a Gold Chain for x10/15/20 Half Face Masks – Probably a good Skier or Ragman LL3 / LL4 trade in; reliable source of gold chains to fund certain trades and rewards killing scavs – also perfect placeholder until we can collect ears ;)

- Add a Bitcoin for 3/4/5x Graphics Cards + 2/3/4x CPUs + 1/2x Power Supplies – A trade for mechanic at LL3 / LL4; logical trade, source of Bitcoins for those who don’t farm safes, etc. opens up more of his trades for common use. Optionally only available after completing “Farming Part 4”.

- Add a Silencerco Hybrid 46 multi-calibre silencer for x3 GM Counters, 10 player dogtags, or something similar at LL1 Peacekeeper – The most versatile silencer usable on most of the weapons (AKs, VEPRs, M4A1s, M1As, FAL, etc.). Very expensive and I don’t see many people running them, would be nice to have a trade to encourage more of their use; especially on guns where you wouldn’t normally see them e.g. on AKs.

--------
Thanks for reading guys! As always opinions and ideas are appreciated :)


Also if I think of anymore I’ll probably add them to this list so if you see edits that’s probably why…"
92vcye,58,2018-07-29,Does anyone else regret ranking their program highly?,stingypurkinje,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/92vcye/does_anyone_else_regret_ranking_their_program/,"I’m a little nervous to write this, because I know I should be grateful for matching in my specialty at all. For reasons I won’t get into, ranked my program in the top 5 because it was a well regarded semi competitive program. I will get great training here. 

I think I need to give it more time but I’m regretting ranking this program over less competitive programs I liked much more. There is not much community amongst residents (no group outings despite 1-2 seniors making an effort, culture is most people do their own thing), I’m not liking the location and it’s far from home/SO, and the overall culture is much different than I’m used to. I’ve also been in clinical situations I’ve been uncomfortable with already and attendings have been hard to reach in those situations. 

Right now my plan is to buck up and deal with these feelings because I made this decision. I’m hoping things will improve with time and I will continue to do my best. There’s an element of grass of greener too as each program has flaws that are usually hidden on interview day. 

I guess the purpose of this is a vent thread to see if any new interns feel the same way.  For obvious reasons I am hesitant to bring this up with Coresidents. "

So far I have a verbal offer from my manager and should be getting a written one soon. 

I wanted to estimate how much I would be offered and if I’m being lowballed based off the internal SJC table. I will be coming in at a level 2 and the market reference for my position is 92k and I will be non-union salaried. 

There’s such a huge band between Minimum, Market Reference, and Maximum that I wanted to see typically what compa ratio Boeing offers, I know the lowest they’ll offer is 0.75 of the market reference and highest is 1.25 but what’s usually the typical compa ratio that’s offered?

I know this varies between Union/non-union and salaried/hourly so If you guys could comment with your function (Engineering/IT/Finance etc.), if you’re union or non-union, and salaried or hourly and what compa ratio you were offered or are at currently it would help give me a much better picture of what to expect and if I should negotiate. 

TLDR: Intern expecting full time offer needed to know what the typical compa ratio offered is based off the SJC and Market reference point. "

My credit score is 727 as of right now. I have $3000 balance. I work as an intern and earn $15/hour by working 40 hours/week until the end of August then i earn $11/hour by working 20 hours/week

Why I want to cancel it? I have used the cashback match for 1 year and i will no longer gain that cashback match, only the cashback. 

Why I want Chase Sapphire Preferred Card? I’m going to buy a plane ticket that costs me $1200 around Aug-Oct and I just checked the review of this Chase credit card and if i spend $4000 within the first 3 months opening the card, i will get 50k points = $625 toward travel. 

The plan: I’m going to pay Fall school tuition that costs me $5000 using that card (my school doesnt charge extra for paying with credit card and yes i have the money to pay school tuition). Then after i got the points, I’m going to buy the ticket, that will save me half the price of the plane ticket

Questions:
1. Will Chase accept me for this card?
2. Will this plan work?
3. Am I missing something?
4. If my plan doesnt work(application rejected or etc), do you guys think is there any other way that will help me reach my goal(save money by points/cashback rewards) by using a different card that will accept me?
5. Am i allowed to cancel Chase credit card before the end of the 1st year? I want to do it because they dont charge annual fee for the 1st year but $90 for the 2nd year and so on

Thank you for your time reading this and helping me. Peace out!"
92vxmg,3,2018-07-29,A more humble approach.,27ShipsCounting,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/92vxmg/a_more_humble_approach/,"Hi all,

Posted here yesterday and it brought to my attention that maybe I needed to humble myself 

So, I'd like to give it a different approach.

Here is my story:

I am an Accounting student at a university in NY.  This upcoming May I will graduate with my BBA in Accounting, and the following May I will obtain my MS in Taxation. I have no prior internship experience in the Accounting field; however, strictly from an academic standpoint I consider myself a fairly good student with a GPA of 3.7.  

That said, I am somewhat of an introvert. In years prior, I have not been that active on campus. I have done the bare minimum from a networking stand point, and thats something I would like to change. I know that recruiting season is rolling around again and I'd like to get ahead of the game (although I guess I am already behind). 

I won't be CPA eligible till 2020, so I guess maybe that's the only thing that might be working in my favor. That said, the time is running quickly and I feel that my effort is extremely lacking. I want to change things. I already have been in contact with BAP as far as inducting this fall. I know I need to put myself out there. However, I'd like as many tips from established professionals as I can get.

Some questions I also have are:

\- When do you recommend one start studying for the CPA, is it better to get an early start even if I won't be ready to take a part of it till next summer?

\- I have read the sidebars, the guides, etc. What else can I do to advance myself academically and professionally. How do I get in connection with alumni? How important is BAP?

Please, any advice is helpful. I know a lot of it is here already, I have done my background work on the posted threads, articles, google docs, etc. I just need to hear more from you guys. I know I need to do more, I just don't know where to start."

I heard that professors are bad at teaching and classrooms are not interesting (accent, no discussion or question, slide-speaker), though when when I looked at faculty's biographies I saw that profs got their PhD from prestigious universities and also had industry experience.

And are CS classes practical or unrelated to the industry? 

3. Is it easy to get internship /coop at least once per 4 year as an international students ? I will be in Honors college though.

Thanks for replying! "

At the beginning of the summer I relapsed. I was clean for like 6 months, but I moved to go to an internship. The internship has been excellent and very life affirming, especially for my vocation.

The trouble is, I’m in a place that I’m only here for 3 months so I don’t feel a desire to connect with anyone. I’ve been lonely, and loneliness is my primary issue anyways. So I’ve been smoking to stave off that loneliness.

My internship involves hospital work, so there is some high stress stuff going on. I’m sure that also plays a role in it, but really I feel like I’m smoking to alleviate boredom and loneliness.

I still have a month left of this internship. I’m toying with the idea of starting sober and heading to some MA group nearby even though I’ll move quickly. I know that’s why the anonymous part is in the name, so we can move amongst meetings if necessary. But I’m terrified of the boredom I’ll feel.

I definitely feel like I’m living a lie. I’m functional. I do good work and I get everything done, but as soon as I have a dull moment I hit the bong. I even skip prayer-time, which I love and I know helps me. I’m an addict and I’m so aware of the powerlessness that I feel right now.

Sorry to be a bummer, friends. Thanks for listening "

92y7up,26,2018-07-29,Harrasing the Clerk,[deleted],RantsFromRetail,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantsFromRetail/comments/92y7up/harrasing_the_clerk/,"Hi Everyone! I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, but I'm not sure what sub reddit would be best for this, and I'm still upset and need to rant! 

...

Ever have one of those great nights that gets ruined in an instant? Today was one of those nights.

My boyfriend and I decided to go to a lovely restaurant for dinner. We had a great experience, and afterwards decided to head to our local bodega.

Background content (important): The new night clerk at this bodega ,""John"", struck up a conversation with us after a few encounters, saying that we made his nights since we were always so friendly. One night he told us that a customer had offered him a job, but at the last minute ""gave it to an intern"" and pretty much BSed him to get cheap coffee refills. He told us that he needed an extra job. We have friends from his country and we knew there's a social media group that lists jobs for immigrants from his country in our city. We help him set up an account so he can join the group. 

About a week later, we show up about an hour before his shift started and he's sitting outside on a bench having a smoke and he invited us to sit with him. 

He told us that he'd been in this country (no papers)  for two months. His wife and his two young daughters are back in his country and he sends them money. He rents a room and he tells us he'd rather be early for work because he ruminates about how much he misses his family. He and my boyfriend click because John has an advanced degree from his country and my BF does too and I tell him about my career. We have a nice chat, and he sheeply asks us for a favor. He told us that he had told his wife about us and how we had helped him and if he could take a selfie of us to send to his wife to show her ""his friends."" We of course said yes.

We'd be in the bodega every other day, and he would always greet us with a smile. If there were no customers, we'd chat with him for a few.

So, about two weeks ago, we see a bike locked outside the bodega. We go in and see John with a helmet. He told us that public transportation was too expensive and that he would start riding his bike to work. (This is important) We looked at him shocked because a bike ride from where he lives to the bodega is a FAR commute. 

Cue to about an hour ago. We walk in and wave to our friend. We grab some brewskis and are about to pay when we notice that something seems wrong. John is covered in sweat, he's rubbing his face, and he looks upset (he is always smiling and jolly) My boyfriend asks him if he is OK, and he replies:

John: (Paraphrased since his English isn't that great) I was getting off my bike when these young punks started harassing me. They asked me my name, where I'm from, and ask if  I'm religious. I don't know if they were drunk, but they started laughing at me, knocked my bike over. They wouldn't leave and there's no security here. They eventually left. 

BF: Did you call the authorities?

John: No, I didn't want any trouble. I just want to do my job and they wanted to cause problems.

BF and me: (shocked)

Apparently those thugs had left about 20 minutes prior to us arriving.

I AM SO PISSED. What racist, scummy, cowardly pieces of crap target an innocent man? We live in a nice area, so for these hoodlums to have done this to our friend is so infuriating. Also, why didn't anyone intervene? I understand not wanting to get involved, but call the authorities?

Tl; Dr: Our hard working friend who works in our local bodega was harassed by racist thugs before going to work. They had already left and no one helped him. "

These probably won't be fully worked out but feel free to interpret them your own way:


(Note: I would be very interested in replies saying why you aren't interested; always looking to improve.)


____________________________________________________________________


**For F:**


This just a bit of a general overview. As well as all of the ideas below I'm also completely up for any sort of clichéd older female/younger male rp where you're the one in charge (teachers, friend's mums etc) ;)
My main kinks are: big cocks, you being in charge, lots of cum, handjobs/fingering, oral/cunnilingus, sex, anal, public (really feeling this today).


_______________________________________________________________


**For F** (Maybe M?):


I don't know if it is the good weather or what but I have been into public/outdoor/exhibitionist/voyeur stuff recently. Whether that be a secluded cove on a beach with boats going by, a clearing in the woods with an inviting pool, or a hotel with windows that can be seen for elsewhere let's show off just how hot we are. I'm also up for a nudist type rp.
No real plan here so hit me with what you got.
(Guys maybe a Nudist roommate?)


_______________________________________________________________


**For F:**


I sit with the rest of the lots waiting to be put up for auction in a small room behind the stage. Gradually the room emptied as, one by one, each of us was summoned to be taken out in front of the crowd of wealthy potential owners. Through the door we heard the gasps and applause get louder with the improving quality of each lot and buzz of excitement and anticipation growing.
Eventually I was left alone, and naked, waiting to be brought in front of the expectant crowd...
Quite why I am up for sale is up for discussion but once you buy me I have to do what you tell me to.


_____________________________________________________________


**For F:**


I like the idea of being tied to a chair and blindfolded while a woman has her way with me. I'm not talking about heavy BDSM but more being teased and used and giving up some control. When I think about this I'm usually naked but I can be clothed if you prefer.
For instance you might be my girlfriend adding a kinky new side to our relationship, you might be her friend who wants to fuck me instead, maybe you are my boss and you decide you want to use the new intern or maybe I don't even know who is doing this too me.
Let's talk and see what we come up with.


____________________________________________________________


**For F:**


This can start a few different ways.  I will outline a few but feel free to jump in with anything around this theme. The exact setting is up for discussion; I have written it like it is ancient Rome/Greece but it could easily be Egypt, the Aztecs, the Inca or a more modern cult setting.
I live in the temple of the God of fertility. I have been specially chosen by the priestesses to be part of the ritual for worship. To bring peace and fertility to the city the priestesses must make ""sacrifices"" the most common of these is that they must cum on the alter and to do so they use me. I have been blessed with a huge cock and an ability to stay hard for as long as needed and cum over and over again, perfect for busy program of worshipping that happens each day.
Powerful women also come to the temple looking to worship and give their offering to the Gods. It is my duty to help them reach the heightened state of consciousness needed to do so. It is also said that my cum has special properties and women will come to receive a blessing from me (and publicly so all can see how pious they are).
Some even see me as a physical embodiment of a God or demi-God myself; to be worshipped and pleased in my own right. Or you could, of course, play the Goddess herself come down to Earth to fulfil some prophecy or accept a sacrifice.
Again this very up for discussion and there are many different ways this could be taken with me playing either a submissive (preferred) or dominant role.


_____________________________________________________________


**For F:**


A few rule 34 worlds to play in: Harry Potter, Big Bang Theory, GoT, others. I have a few specific ideas but feel free to suggest some.


___________________________________________________________


**For M:**


I'm particularly looking for straight guys who can't help themselves around huge cock. I'm going to send you a message that could be a reply to your dirtyr4r post or some comment that you have made.
Here are the things I am into:
Having a huge cock, having it worshipped, having someone to stroke my cock and suck on it, taking things slow, hearing how my cock makes you feel and what you think of it.
You don't have to be small your self (I like domming big guys) but you do have to know your place.

Hey guys and girls! I want to play out a story with you that involves a desperate, slutty Asian college student. Girls, we can either set up an FF or FFM scenario, whichever you enjoy more :) or just chat about dirty ideas!

Note: I might not be able to play consecutively for long amounts of time, if we click I'm happy to go long term!

If you want to play, just message me which kind of scenario you might be interested in and what your favorite race of Asian sluts is your favorite!

***

I was a repressed teen going through a sexual transformation. After my incredibly virginal high school years at a very conservative school, watched closely by my helicopter parents, I was finally at college. Being a cute, slender Asian girl, I naturally got a lot of attention and, with my hormones going wild, I started going through a crazy boy phase.

My standards - what standards? I want dick. I want to fuck. All of my insecurities and resentments and guilt made me turn into a crazy slut overnight. But who are you exactly? How do you find your way to this desperate Asian chick determined to spend every night in someone else's bed?

I loooove raceplay. Please include it with our roleplay! Are you a white guy ready to pump some yellow pussy full of your cum? Are you a black dude ready to pound some Asian ass? Are you an Asian dude sick of seeing this cute Asian girl grinding on white dudes, who angrily gets a hold of me and fucks my brains out in a frat bro's room?

Kinks: Raceplay, cuckolding, degradation, rough sex, dirty talk, humiliation, spanking, oral, cumplay, dressup/outfits.

Just ideas: 

- the Professor: I come to your office hours, dressed somewhat provocatively. You're married with kids, but you flirt with me and, loving the attention, I reciprocate the interest. Bonus to old, geeky, dirty men.

- the Grad Student Instructor: Similar to the above, but with a younger grad student. Love even including predatory/grooming aspects lol.

- Frat Party Hoe: Either a frat bro or a friend of one? Grind me hard and humiliate me in front of everyone. Do I suck your dick in public at a party? Are you clearly feeling me up during beer pong? Or do you fuck me right in front of my guy friends on a bed?

- [Cuckold](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/67tpmf/f4a_asians/): Are you my best friend, my brother, my cousin, etc? Or a friend crushing on me who's only seen my good girl side? Maybe we go out to a frat or house party and you find my inner hoe when I start sucking the first white or black guy I see there.

- [Asian Gals](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/8ao86a/f4a_asian_girl/): Dirty as fuck :P so I'm going to start writing some scenario ideas for girls! Haven't gotten any yet so I hope to attract some of y'all 

- [Non-Asian Gals]:

I have so many ideas and I love brainstorming with y'all!

**Asian Women in Business Association:** AWBA is a strong club on campus for Asian girls who want to be strong business leaders. We have lots of outreach events, we get our members excellent internships and jobs, and have huge donations from industry. That's because of the great climate of supporting women and minorities, right?

Wrong. AWBA has a secret approach - targeting the yellow fever of successful white men. Sophia Chen's internship at that big bank? She was the CEO's mistress. Amy Liu? She's the ""diversity chair"", making $500,000 a year introducing the executives and top investors to ""Asian issues"". All of these members give back and all Asian-crazed white executives know about us and donate for our attention.

I know these jobs are really competitive, so I would like to do everything I can to maximize my chances of making the cut.

I know that my best bet is to get a pathways internship, so that is my current goal, but those are also competitive.  Everyone I have talked to has said that one of the best things I can do to help get an internship is to volunteer at a local office.  Unfortunately I live 2 hours away from the closest office, and drive a 24 year old truck, so that option is prohibitively expensive.

I took part in an NCAR field project this summer, but unfortunately that is the only meteorology related experience I have so far.

Is there anything I can do during the school year or over the winter to help boost my resume for next summers applications?

Additionaly with the cs side, what languages are important to the weather service?  I have quite a bit of experience with the C-family of languages, primarily java and C#, as well as python.  Are there any other languages that I should learn?

Any other areas I should work on?  Not a fan of GIS, but I have taken a couple courses in it, and did alright in them.

Also, how important is my GPA, I am a mid-low 3.x student, would boosting it to the high 3 range make a considerable impact on anything?

Thanks for the feedback."

This might be a little long because I need to provide some background.

I am currently going into my senior year at a well-known university in the North East US. My younger brother just graduated high school and will be attending a community college near my house. I've been living at home for the summer, working as an intern for a well-known aircraft manufacturer, while my brother has been at home by himself mostly, pretty much just playing PS4 or PC games. 

Mark has had a pretty rough time growing up. Our mom was diagnosed with breast cancer when we were in elementary school, went into remission, and then passed away when we were both in high school. This was my senior year, and Mark's freshman year. Our parents were divorced by the time she died, and so we were forced to move in with our dad. This forced Mark to switch schools. Mark was not at all happy with this, and fought with my dad over going back to our original high school. The divorce happened not too long before my mom passed, and so Mark was already dealing with the fallout from this, and this was the last thing he needed after her death. 

Mark was hesitant at first, however he finally started making friends. He hung out with a group of kids who I personally didn't like. They were pretty much just a bunch of pot heads who smoked up in the parking lot after school. I didn't think they were a great influence, but it was a start. At this point, I was in college, and my dad was rarely home. He has to fly out for work every week, and is gone Sunday-Thursday. This left Mark home by himself three days a week, as a sophomore in high school. 

Mark's grades were terrible. He was failing half of his classes, and my dad was pissed. Not being home half the week, my dad really couldn't do much to punish Mark. This cycle went on for the next two years of high school. Mark made better friends, and even got a girlfriend. During his senior year however, things went a little south for him. His girlfriend left him, and he ended up not graduating from high school, despite being warned of the possibility of him failing the year every week by my dad and his teachers. A month later he was able to take the GED and pass, allowing him to go to community college for the fall semester. The unfortunate thing about Mark, is that he's extremely smart. He just doesn't apply himself. 

One of the things that came with the death of our mom was the life insurance check. My mom left in her will that the life insurance should be split between us, 50/50, and used to pay for college. The check came out to around $350k. Split that between us, and we got $175k each. This is how I pay for college, and this is how he'll pay for college- hopefully. See, Mark has been lashing out lately. His mental state hasn't been great, and he's had anger issues since the age of 10. Combine that with failing to graduate high school, a dead mom, and a break up, and you have yourself a recipe for reckless spending. Now, to be honest, having that much money is hard. We both received checks on our 18th birthdays, and it's hard to keep track of it all. When you have $100 in your bank account, you're conscious of your spending. When you have $100k.... it sucks. 18 year olds have no concept of money. I didn't really get what the value of money was until I paid tuition for the first time..... that made a dent. I've been keeping a rough tally in my head, and so far I've counted about $6,000 in random purchases in the past three months. He built a PC. He bought a GTX 1080TI, and then got upset with that so he bought another one for SLI (just google GTX 1080TI, they're super expensive). Then he built a smaller PC ""for his friend,"" which I later found out wasn't true. And now the best part of this whole thing, he's been spending money on vapes.

Mark's friend told me about his vaping habits. Mark has been telling me about how his friend has been vaping. I came home the one day, and Mark was in his room, and it just smelled like cherry vape. I asked him about it, and he said his friend was vaping in his room. Mark's room is absolutely disgusting, and I doubt his friend would even set foot in it. I later found out it was indeed Mark vaping, and that he's been going through about 100mL of vape in about a day and a half. Mark also bought 4 vapes, at around $100 each. A bottle of the vape juice costs $40, and with the frequency he uses them, I'd estimate he's definitely spent a few grand on it. I don't know too much about vaping, so excuse me if my terminology is wrong. However given the amount of nicotine in the juice, he's been smoking about 3 packs of cigarettes worth of nicotine a day according to his friend.

I posted this because my dad and I are going to attempt to confront him. Whenever you even so much as challenge him, he shuts down and walks away. We're at a loss. He doesn't have any hygiene whatsoever, doesn't keep his room clean, doesn't keep his car clean (it's disgusting), and sits at home all day. He also just buys random shit all the time, according to his friend. He also got a speeding ticket (40 over) that almost got his license suspended, and didn't tell my dad. We only found out because of the letter from the DA's office, informing us his license was going to be suspended if he didn't respond. 

We don't know how to handle this. How do you help someone when they don't want to help themselves? I doubt he'll ever go to a mental professional, let alone a doctor. He's resisted this in the past, and I fear that's what he needs. He's 18, so we can't exactly do anything to stop him from spending money. 

If you read that, thank you. This was longer than I was hoping it would have to be.

TL;DR Brother is a mess. Parents divorced, mom died, failed highschool, bad spending habits, possibly addicted to his vape, and won't take care of himself. Kinda has anger issues, and we don't know how to confront him let alone deal with this situation. "
93014w,10,2018-07-29,Which advisory groups recruit new hires straight out of college?,ronswansondiet_,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/93014w/which_advisory_groups_recruit_new_hires_straight/,"About me: I attend a large top 25 university in a major metro, 3.5 GPA, business-economics major, and fairly involved on campus. My school is a target for Big 4 and a semi-target for consulting/IB jobs.   

I’m currently an audit intern at a Big 4 and while I’m enjoying my more analytical/data-driven tasks, I find a lot of the work boring. I did pretty well on my performance review, ranking above average in most categories, so I think that might give me some leverage?

My goal is to eventually transfer to advisory since the hours, pay, and exit ops all seem better. I expressed interest in a certain deals/M&amp;A focused group, but was told that campus hires are very rare and most people transfer into the group from a different line of service.

Since I enjoy accounting/finance in general, I’m pretty versatile and would prefer most advisory groups to audit just for the difference in hours and exit ops. My end goal is to get an MBA and land an FP&amp;A type role. I’m just worried that I’m not a strong enough candidate to make this feasible. 

I guess my question is - given my qualifications, would I be better off starting off in audit and transferring groups later or re-recruiting for an advisory job straight out of college? If the latter, are there any specific advisory groups that hire college grads? I want to use these last few weeks of my intership to start building a network in the advisory groups I’m interesred in.

93060t,1,2018-07-29,CS Transfer Q's,[deleted],UCSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSC/comments/93060t/cs_transfer_qs/,"Q's:

1. On the [screening major selection criteria](https://admissions.ucsc.edu/apply/transfer-students/major-prep.html#cs), it states ""a student must have completed three (3) of the foundation courses"" by the end fall and ""complete the remaining by the end of spring"" - Is this strictly the case? Under no circumstances you will gain admission if the latter and former are not the case? I know it also states you may be admitted if you are lacking one foundation course if you have completed CMPE 12/L (I have w/ an A) , etc

2. Related to the latter: I will be completing both MATH 11A &amp; 11B (we have a few calc hybrid courses) at my CC during the spring semester (taking pre-cal this summer but i've been slacking so i might have to take it in the fall rather than both calc classes in the fall) and will be completing the second course that fills the requirement for CMPE 16, hence I will only have completed one foundation course by the end of fall semester but have them all them completed by the end of the spring semester except CMPE 16 (look at next Q). All in all, I will have completed all the courses in the assist agreement by the end of spring semester except that CMPE 16 and MATH 21 (Linear Algebra). Do you think my chances are high or slim?

3. I completed the equivalent of CMPS 12B/M at my CC, though I got a 'C' in the course (despite it being the most fun CS course I have taken thus far). I talked to an advisor and he stated I will have to retake the course since a 'B' is required in order for the course to transfer. Does this hold true? It does so on the assist.org agreement. If so, would you recommend 1. I take it at UCSC when I transfer OR 2. I take at another CC prior to transfer? 

4. I have completed the UC IGETC agreement and a A.S. Computer Science degree - do you think, in terms of my application, that gives me an upper hand or is it more ""nay, it's neutral""?

5. Would love to know if you recommend one pursue a BS or BA in CS? I'm not super keen on math so I am/was aiming for BA. But I'm thinking about the intricacies - from your opinion: do you think employers prefer BS over BA? from an academic standpoint: is there not much difference just a bit more math courses? would you say: ""don't sweat it, either or is fine""? or rather: ""go for the bs, no doubt""?

6. This is how my schedule looks like for the next two semesters: fall 2018: 1. pre-cal 2. discrete structures (1/2 of the discrete math agreement) spring 2019: 1. calc 1 &amp; calc 2 2. boolean algebra and logic (second 1/2 of the discrete math agreement). i would just need to completed data structures and linear algebra. would you recommend i take both during the summer or nay because it would more beneficial taking it at UCSC? i was thinking about trying to do an internship over the summer or attending recurse.com (highly recommend this place to anyone else, check it out) to develop my skills a bit more

7. Would love to participate in cs research and TA-ing a few cs courses when I transfer - Is it seemingly doable once I transfer? Or is it dependent on having to take a course at UCSC and receive an 'A' at UCSC to demonstrate knowability and expertise to be able to TA? Or what is the case?

8. Any other tips would be helpful

Thank you! Also, my apologies for messiness of the post. Paging u/slugstructor, if he/she/etc, doesn't mind "
93096l,197,2018-07-29,[22F] roughly fucked by 2 in the room next to my date,nexttimebabe,SluttyConfessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/93096l/22f_roughly_fucked_by_2_in_the_room_next_to_my/,"this happened during the summer after sophomore year going into junior year of college when i was 20 years old. i was working part time in the summer at a small froyo store in the city and usually i'd go out to this chicken and beer bar in k-town afterwards with my coworkers (i wasn't 21 yet and this was one bar that was known to never ask for ID).

while working froyo store, this cute guy (i'll call him D) walked in. i noticed him instantly because he was very cute and dressed nicely. i was making small talk with D while i asked him what toppings he wanted to add (i was tempted to joke if he also wanted to add me on top but don't worry.. i didn't), D had just gotten off work (well an internship). he was a bit shy but while he was paying for his froyo, he asked when i was getting off work. i told him i get off at 9pm and he said he'd be drinking with his friends somewhere in k-town (he was 22) and that i should join them after work. i told him i'm not 21 yet so i could only go to the chicken and beer bar that didn't card, so he asked to exchange numbers so that i could let him know when i was done with work and he and his friends would move over to chicken and beer.

I got off work and i sent D a text saying i would be heading towards chicken and beer with a few coworkers and that if he'd like to meet us there. he said his friends were staying at the other bar for a bit longer but that he'd come by alone. he sat with my coworkers, but the entire time D and I were flirting and sitting really close to each other and being touchy. i had on a tight camisole dress and he had his hand on my thigh while we were getting to know each other. his friends were still at the other bar and we ditched my coworkers and went off on our own. i noticed that D seemed genuinely interested me. he was good looking, smart, and had a good sense of humor and around this time (due to ex bf reasons) i was feeling lonely and down lately, so i was kind of interested in getting to know him more than just a hook up so i decided i was going to only show him my good girl side tonight. we flirted some more as we walked down the streets. he kept poking my side and i was giggling and grabbing his arm and overall it was innocent, cute fun and flirting. i was getting pretty horny, but i knew i wanted to wait out and not sleep with him on the first date or in some bathroom.

a bit later D's friends called and told him that they moved over to this pool/karaoke bar that was nearby, so we went over and he introduced me to his friends who were super drunk already but seemed nice. they had bottles of alcohol and beer in the karaoke room already and so D and I both took shots to catch up. D and his friends got really drunk and were singing their hearts out. singing's not my thing so i excused myself saying i had a phone call then slipped away to the pool tables/bar area which were outside of the karaoke rooms. i was very tipsy at this point. the area was empty except for 2 older guys playing pool with each other, maybe in their late 20s or early 30s. i was feeling flirty, horny, yet lonely and mixed with being very tipsy, i didn't think twice about striking up a conversation with them and asking if they could teach me how to play. one of them (who was the manager) handed me his pool stick and let me take his turn. i bent over for a while pretending to think about which ball i should hit, but really i was just giving them a view. i turned around and asked the manager to help me with hitting the ball. while bending over to hit the ball, i pulled down at my dress pretending i was trying to cover up skin but instead i just pulled my dress down to show off a lot more of my cleavage (my dress looked like this [https://imgur.com/a/ZawwaWO](https://imgur.com/a/ZawwaWO)). so he put his hand on my waist while helping me shoot and his hands were slowly moving up while i was trying to aim, which got me pretty excited. after my shot, his hand was still on my waist when i stood up, so i took his other hand and put it also on my waist. he started slowly moving his hands around my waist and up near my breasts. i leaned back against him (i was facing away from him) and made it clear that i was enjoying it so he moved his hands cupping my breasts over my dress. his friend was in front watching and just smiled. i wasn't wearing a bra because the dress material isn't too thin. i slipped one dress strap off my shoulder letting my left breast fall out of my dress. he started kissing my neck and rubbing my nipple which made me moan and breathe heavily. i turned around and started feeling his boner through is pants but he stopped me there. he then told his friend to cover (in case any customers came in for karaoke) and he took my hand and led me to an smaller, empty karaoke room (the room was similar size to this: [http://www.julialee.me/spot/img/room/rm1.jpg](http://www.julialee.me/spot/img/room/rm1.jpg)) which was right next to larger room that D and his friends were in. once he shut the door behind him and turned the lights on, he instantly turned me around and bent me over on the couch and lifted my dress up and slapped my ass. i was surprised but i loved it. i moaned when he slapped my ass which made him slap my ass even harder. he called me a nasty little girl and told me my outfit wasn't appropriate, which got me even wetter. i asked him ""you don't like my dress?"" and he answered ""it makes me want to rip your dress off and fuck the shit out of you."" then he told me to bend over and show him my pussy. i listened and spread my legs for him like a good girl. he slid my thong down and spit on my bare pussy and started fingering me while stroking himself. i moaned while his finger was sliding in and out of me. then he spanked me, asking me to moan louder, and that he couldn't hear me over the music from the other room. i moaned louder as he fingered me and i squealed every time he spanked me. he then put me down on the table so i was laying on my back and pulled down my other dress strap so both my breasts were now hanging out of my dress. he then started slapped my tits. i squealed because it was unexpected but it turned me on for some reason. at this stage of my life (i was 20), i wasn't as experienced as i am now with being dominated or degraded and this was actually one of the experiences that made me realize i was into it. he kept slapping my tits which made me flinch and close my legs as a reflex. he slapped my tits again to punish me for closing my legs and told me i need to keep them open so he could see my pretty pussy. i spread my legs again and he told me to rub my clit and show him how i play with myself at home. he sat back and slowly stroked his cock watching me as i rubbed myself, calling me a naughty little girl and occasionally getting up to pinch my nipples. he watched and slowly fingered me as i rubbed my clit and came for him. every time i put my legs back together, he slapped my tits and asked me to keep my legs open. it hurt but it also got me reeally horny. then he asked if i was ready for his cock, i nodded eagerly. he teased me by rubbing his dick against my pussy asking me if i was a hungry slut for his cock. i slid my body closer to his dick desperate to have it inside me, but he seemed more interested in teasing me than fucking me. he asked me to say please so i said please a few times before he finally started fucking my pussy which was dripping wet. he wasn't that big so it actually wasn't as satisfying as i had hoped, but at that point i really just wanted anything inside me. after what seemed like less than 10 pumps inside me, he pulled out and told me to sit up, then slammed his cock in my mouth and came down my throat. while he took a few seconds to catch his breath, i laid back down and continued rubbing my clit and said i asked if he could finger me more. unfortunately he told me he had to go back out, he put his pants back on but said ""hold on"" before walking out the door. a few minutes later, his friend from earlier walked in. he looked at me lying on the table, with my tits out, my dress pulled up above my ass, and my legs spread. i just wanted any cock inside me, so i spread my legs wider and continued rubbing my clit and moaning. he shut the door, took his dick out from his shorts, lifted my hands above my head on the table, then started thrusting into my pussy. he wasn't as rough with me but his dick filled me up better and he fucked me for longer and made me cum again. he didn't say anything to me at all until he was getting close to cumming and asked me where he should cum. i told him i was on the pill so that he could cum inside me. almost right after, he said ""oh fuck"" and exploded into my pussy. he pulled out, asked if i could clean him up, so i licked his dick clean and after that, he said thanks and quickly buttoned his shorts and walked out. i went to the bathroom afterwards to clean his cum from out of my pussy and also to gargle water. i touched up my makeup in the bathroom and then walked back into D's karaoke room where they still had about 10 minutes left. D asked me where i was, and i said i was on the phone and then in the bathroom because i didn't feel that well.

i was a good girl for the rest of the night. after karaoke, we all went to get pizza and talk. when leaving, D gave me a hug and told me he wanted to get to know me better. we texted after that and we eventually started dating and he became my boyfriend. he was a sweet guy, really respectful.. we ended up having sex finally after like the 7th dates and it definitely seemed he was more into the ""making love"" sex. our relationship only lasted that summer because we amicably ended it before we went back to school (different universities). he was pretty sad about ending it, but he agreed that it would be hard to do long distance but asked if we could give it another try in a few months once he graduated (in the fall), but that never happened as we drifted pretty apart. during those few months we were together, i still slept with about 4 different guys and one of my fwb, but i was careful not to let them cum inside me. as far as i know, he never found out about the karaoke night or about any of the guys i slept with during our relationship (unless he reads this......). if you're curious, i do feel bad about cheating on him.. but a slut will be a slut.

**tl;dr i had rough sex with two guys in a karaoke room next door to my date who eventually became my boyfriend**

We usually get people from all over the county, but room rates are pricey so most guests are fairly affluent. 

There was this one mom with her daughter on the tour. They seemed normal enough, the mom was friendly and engaging. 

At the end of my tour, I offer additional time to answer any questions. The mom approaches me telling me how wonderful and engaging I was, asking me about my college, pretty normal stuff.

All of a sudden she tells me ""I work with a health and wellness company that allows people to make additional income.  We have students your age that are very successful with it, you'd be a perfect fit! I can get you more information!""

Immediately, I knew. This was a pyramid scheme. 

Interestingly enough, a girl the week before had started following me on Instagram and I realized she sold ItWorks. She claimed it allowed her to pay off her student loans and buy a Mercedes... yeah ok Hun. Immediately unfollowed (though I now wish I had stayed to creep!)

I politely declined her offer, stating I was pretty busy with my internship and didn't think I could handle anything else, thanking her for the offer.

I wish I could have inquired more about what it was and try to see if I could help her see the light at all, but I was at work so alas I could not.

But thanks to you all, I was immediately able to spot a pyramid pitch! It's a shame too she seemed so nice. I hope she's able to get out of it soon!"

I spend the past two months working with a great team of interns at ACS Technologies based out of Florence, SC. I wanted to post the results of what we did here!

We created an open source heatmap, using various technologies. Everything is stored inside of a Docker Image as well.

Check out the architecture here: [https://github.com/acstech/doppler-events/blob/master/arch.png](https://github.com/acstech/doppler-events/blob/master/arch.png)

We also used heat map.js by Patrick Wied to help get the heat signatures, but also rewrote a lot of functions ourselves.

The front-end was designed with a ""Live Mode"" and ""Historical Mode"" in mind. With this you could track various types of events that happen anywhere in the world and store their information inside of InfluxDB. You could view it live as it comes in, then replay that data instantly in historical mode. There were a few things we didn't get to do with it becasue of the timeline, but it fully operational!

This was my first internship and I love data so I wanted to share my excitement with you guys. Leave a comment on what you think!

Here is the central documentation on one of our three repos: [https://github.com/acstech/doppler-events](https://github.com/acstech/doppler-events)

9310g7,3,2018-07-30,Undergraduate Research Advice?,DatNoobi,AerospaceEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/AerospaceEngineering/comments/9310g7/undergraduate_research_advice/,"Hello everyone! There's this professor at my university that I really want to do work for. Their research is in the area of Dynamics and Control, which is the field that I would like to get involved with in the future. I would like to do undergraduate research in his lab but I just don't know how to approach him, and a number of things make me doubtful on what I should do:

* I emailed him in March with my resume, and he then asked for my unofficial transcript. My GPA at the time was 3.16 (Now 3.31). He then emailed me back thanking me for my interest and telling me that he would save my files in case an opportunity came up. He has not contacted me since then.
* It seems he has really high GPA expectations (GPA among his students is about a 3.7). I have been improving a lot lately, but I'm afraid if this is a hard cutoff.
* I've considered just showing up to his office and talking to him, however students that work under him claim that he is very busy and that its best to set up an appointment with him via email. 
* I haven't taken a Dynamics or Controls course yet.

I know that I could search for another lab to work in, but this is the only one at my university that I am interested in and passionate about. I've been studying Dynamics in advance, and my current internship is heavily involved in the realm of Guidance, Navigation, and Controls.  I'm not going to get too specific with his projects, but I follow the videos the lab posts and I am completely amazed at that they do there. I believe that I have skills that I can bring to the lab (hardware and software) that could make me an asset for his projects, but I fear if he turns me away for good this time.

If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this situation? How would you go about asking? How would you get your foot in the door to open a dialogue between you and the professor? 

Thank you in advance for helping this newbie. I am currently working on updating my resume to make it relevant to his research and consulting with one of his ex-students on how to do this. 

TL;DR: I don't know how to approach a professor to ask him if I can work in his lab. Does anybody have any advice or stories that they're willing to share to help with securing a position in this lab?"

I'm new to Reddit and I heard about it through my boyfriend. Checked it out and saw what a huge community it is.

So anyways, I'm a 20 yr old female, a full time college student, with a part time job. I have a small family, my mom works 2 jobs, my sister is leaving for college in 2 months and might never come back, my brother is in his teen years and is about to start high school, and my dad is dead because of a murder from 3½ yrs ago and there's no justice yet.

Since my dad died, I really haven't had a reason to feel depressed again. Everything is fine, my GPA is about average, I'm going to start studying for the MCAT. Everything is just about fine. Except me. I'm the problem. Day by day I sink back into the old cycles of depression.

I thought my boyfriend could help me get over this small hill but he's only dug me into it deeper. See, he's in a different state doing an internship, and he's been gone all summer. I've been really horny all the time but just recently he said that he doesn't feel the same way about sex anymore. And it's not because he's cheating on me, I'm sure that's not the case. And for whatever reason, call me crazy, it hurt when he said that. It hurt a lot, actually. And he emotionally blackmails me but doesn't realize he does it, and he hardly has time to talk to me. I don't think he understands what I'm going through, and he only adds to it. To make myself feel better, happier, I don't know, I asked him to love me and make me feel loved and cared for. All he said was ""I love you and you mean the world to me."" and then went offline. Like he just could not be bothered to say more, write more. 

So now here I am, spending my days waking up thinking I wish I were dead. I can't shave my legs or arms without wanting to slit my wrists or my neck. I can't take ibuprofen for a headache without wanting to down the whole damn bottle. I can't walk across a bridge without wanting to jump off. I can't cross a road without wanting to stop in the middle of the street for a car to run me over. I'm not actively pursuing suicide, but I'm getting pretty close to hammering out a few suicide notes. 

I see a therapist weekly but I don't want to be reported for this because I've already attempted suicide 3 times in high school, out of which 2 resulted in a psychiatric hospitalization and all of it was over what ended up being a 3 yr toxic abusive relationship that I finally ended. Just last week I was diagnosed with clinical depression, but prior to that I had been diagnosed with major depression (not sure about differences?) 

I'm not sure exactly what it is that I want from writing this, and why I'm writing this. But nobody knows and nobody understands. Please help. I can't sleep at night anymore with a heart heavier than a boulder. I hold so much sadness that I can't bring myself to cry anymore. 

Thanks for reading.

After I finished my first semester of college this past fall, my father announced that he wants a divorce because he wants a ""fresh start"", by which he meant a life without me or my mother or where/how we live.

The court date is today (Monday). I just don't know how to feel/I've been feeling so much over the past half year of preparation to this point that I'm just confused. It's summer break right now so I'm living with in my parents' apartment, away from my boyfriend and all but two of my friends, and it's not helping. Mom just had a near heart attack two days ago (she's fine now) and the first thing she said when she returned from the ER was ""at least it was today and not Tuesday, then we wouldn't have had medical insurance!"" (it came from my father's job originally) That didn't help either. I have awful anxiety and nightmares about people close to me dying or being maimed alive, and about being assaulted/raped. I work two jobs, one is customer service and the other is an unpaid internship, and I'm sure you, dear reader, can presume that that hasn't been helping my case either...

Last straw of posting this was the Facebook of a coworker of mine who is about to start her freshman year of college...her family is well-off and obviously very proud of her and I can't help but feel blinding jealousy. The money she has would solve many problems my family is running into. She's going to a school with a 50% acceptance rate and her family is obviously so happy and supportive. When I was accepted to my (19% acceptance) school on a scholarship that pays for 75% of my costs for my time there, my father just yelled at me about why the ivy leagues hadn't gotten back to me/turned me down. *(Disclaimer: Not saying coworker's family shouldn't be happy! Just made me resent my own situation)*

I'm full of anger, hurt, and I just feel confused and lost in general. I'm an only child and live multiple plane rides away from all extended family so I feel very much alone. I know I can talk to my boyfriend, and I do, but his parents are happy together and I don't want to burden him with talking about my situation more than I already do. I also know I can talk to my friends from uni, but they also have their lives and problems outside of my life. It's always helped me to write stuff down/type it out and I'm so glad I found this subreddit.

Please send me/tell me anything you think might help! Thank you in advance xx"

i know you love updates and even though my post didn't get much attention I like to do an update seven months after I postet this.

To see my original post: https://redd.it/7nu3ak

After the break up at new year I was completely devastated. I couldn't eat. I couldn't get out of bed for a quite long time. I was falling very deep into depressions and I hated every morning I woke up. It was everyday the same. One month after my situation still didn't improve. I was a complete mess. And I knew I had to do a major change in my life to get out of this situation.

So I applied spontaneously for an internship abroad on Crete and started there at the End of April. I was still a mess but things started to improve. I read a lot, I reflected a lot on me and my situation and why I stayed so long with someone who obviously didn't care for me and why I'm always with those kind of guys.

I realized I have severe commitment issues and also a very low self-esteem and I was only so infatuated with him because there was no change of getting real close with him and I thought I deserved his poor treatment. I worked in Crete very hard to get to the bottom of my issues, still working on it, it will be a looong way.

But now I feel way better! My self-esteem improved significantly and I realized what shitty relationship this was and what an a-hole he was thinking he deserves better than me. Actually he is so entitled that he has no chance to get a girl and struggles constantly. I heard from him a few weeks ago, only complaining how bad women are and why he is constantly failing to get a girl. I would say he deserves it :-). Afterwards I cut contact with him because I realized that I still feel the urge to proof to him I am a worthy human being. And I dont need people in my life that aren't able to see my worth.

The first time in my life I realized I don't need somebody to make me happy but that I have to be happy from within. I'm feeling very happy and content on my own by now, not relying on someone elses validation anymore. I realized that I am okay the way I am and lovable and if someone else does not see this it's on them and not on me!

Then the classic happened: You are happy on your own, you don't look for anybody right now in your life and you just accidentally meet someone. I met at my workplace of my internship a great, mature and loving guy that thinks of me as the most amazing person in the world, with my flaws, fears and anxiety. I was honest with all my problems and he was just there for me without any hesitation. He helped me a lot to progess my negative feelings. But I'm proud to say that I could also have done it without him. I don't rely on him for my happiness but I love to have him in my life, because I just love to spend time with him.

Dear redditors, even as bad as a situation look at a certain time. You'll make it, you will grow and you will be happy again. Even if it's the worst moment of your life!

**td;dr** Was crushed after leaving my toxic emotional unavailable ex, went abroad, learned to love myself, I'm happy again! Yaay!

932iga,0,2018-07-30,I (18M) am engaged to my girlfriend (18f). Need advice in how to handle the school year.,extraloverboy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/932iga/i_18m_am_engaged_to_my_girlfriend_18f_need_advice/,"So I am 18 years old and I’m a senior in high school. Or I will be school starts up pretty soon. My girlfriend is also 18 but because she took many advanced classes and summer school she was able to graduate early. She is already in her 3rd year of college.  Just for clarification I’m older and will be 19 in about a month. 

I met her my freshman year of high school and we shared most of our classes together. She introduced me to her friends and we became close. I didn’t start dating her till a little before her 18th birthday. So I’ve known her for about 4 years and we have dates for around 4 months. Long story short I proposed and she said yes. 

My parents turned justno and allowed my pervert estranged older brother to move in. A while later we moved out into a house of our own. It’s a long complicated and messed up story. 

But now I’m heading back to my last year of high school. She wears her engagement ring all the time. I wear mine as well and I’m a little nervous. I know I’m going to be the only guy in high school engaged. As well as the only one who lives in a rented home with his girlfriend. What I’m not prepared for are all the questions. I know many will say I’m too young but I disagree. I have an internship at a law firm,a football scholarship, and a good head on my shoulders. My fiancé has a really great paying job as a secretary, is excellent at budgeting and handling money and any other talents. Financially we are able to live on our own rather comfortably. 

But I know everyone is going to ask a million questions and try to see if there is something wrong with us. I’m not going to break the engagement. We work well together and have a very strong and trusting relationship. 

I just need advice as to handle all these questions that are going to come my way. 

TLDR: I am engaged to my girlfriend not sure how to handle all the questions I will be asked this school year. Any advice is appreciated. "
933fs8,2,2018-07-30,I resent dating my LTR,conflictednerd5,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/933fs8/i_resent_dating_my_ltr/,"TL;DR: Dating a perfect girl but I resent being with her so early in life because I feel I'm missing out on other people/experiences.

Background:

I'm currently dating an incredible girl: she's very attractive, super intelligent, and very ambitious career wise. Without a doubt, she is the definition of ""wife-material,"" and is perfect in every way. She very clearly loves me and consistently talks about life plans together post-college. Prior to this summer, I had no doubt we would graduate college together, move in, and eventually get married.

We've been away from each other this summer (she's on study abroad, I'm interning), and while we've been separated my mindset has slightly changed. I've been talking to other girls as friends throughout my internship and it's mind-blowing how many cool people are out there and how many actually like me. For example, I've been hanging out with one girl who shares a lot of the same interests: music, major, and social/career ambitions. I haven't developed feelings for this person, but it's been really comforting to meet someone whose personality really matches mine (honestly as much if not more than my current LTR).

Coming from a technical school in the Midwest where girls are lacking, combined with a tough major means I don't meet many girls (or people in general) let alone smart and genuinely nice ones. Thinking about it, I've actually built my entire social life around this person, and honestly don't hang out with any girls aside from her. Because of this, I feel like I've been missing out on meeting a variety of different people and actually getting some time to meet different girls (been in LTRs since early highschool) who might fit with me better than my current girlfriend.

Confession Part:

I resent dating my perfect LTR girl so early in life because I feel I'm missing out on life. While naturally, the best idea would be to end the relationship, but I'm afraid of the consequences. As stated above, going to a technical school/little social life means I'd probably be single and bored for at least a couple years, i.e. have a boring end to college. I really want to enjoy my college years, but I don't want to ruin the little social life I currently have. Alongside this, I might actually get married to this girl someday, and I would hate to ruin an opportunity to spend my life with such an amazing person. Finally, this girl thinks the world of me, and I honestly couldn't stand breaking her heart. I've been her first for everything except her first kiss, and I feel breaking up with her would severely hurt her frame of mind (she likewise has built her entire social life around me).

I want to be able to experience life and meet different people, but I'm afraid of the negatives of ending it (from now in college social life, to long-term mental effects on her)."

Backstory: I just finished up my summer internship with this company and was just offered a job post graduation. I graduate in December 2018, but I was planning on taking 5-6 months off after graduation to pursue other interests before I start my real career. I have already mentioned to them that since I have a 6 months lease to finish post grad, I was going to stay in town to maybe try out grad school. They have (informally) offered to find a way to help me break the lease. During the course of my internship this summer, I have really stood out to my company and the team that I've worked with seems to really want me to be on their team. My current offer is 62k annual, 5% rate 401k, and 12 days PTO.

Now this is where I'm at and need help.

1. How do I approach this situation of negotiating the start date? I really do want to work for this company but I wanted to take time off since I've spent the last 5 years in school.
2. I've done some research and my salary range for this position is about 58-74k. I already have an offer on the table from another company for 60k (in a much smaller city) and feel like 62k in a much bigger city isn't enough. I have overheard my bosses talk about how great of a fit I am for the team and based on that, I figured I could request 20% and ask for my range to be 72-75k with evidence that supports my worth.
3. Would I negotiate the start date and salary in the same meeting? 1 at a time?
4. I was also planning on attending one last career fair that my school has to offer in the fall, just to expand my options and see if I could get any other potential offers. I received my offer on 7/27 and was planning on responding closer to graduation. I was planning on calling in to negotiate, but I might even go out of my way to drive up to negotiate in person.

How would you handle this situation?"

I was caught by a sniffer dog, and am now facing a court attendance on the 29th of August. I was found with 0.49g (two caps) of the prohibited drug.

I am someone who has had no previous issues with the police and my school would be able to write me a good reference as I never got in trouble (except for one time in year 7). I’m currently studying Business and IT (second year) and hope to move to the US in the final year of my degree for an internship, and this would obviously be affected by a criminal record. The officer who arrested me said he would make a note on the records about my good nature and compliance, and I believe the magistrate would also find me to be well-spoken and sincere.

I wish to receive a Section 10 Dismissal. What I want to know is, should I hire a lawyer? If so, why should I, what price should I be expecting to pay and do you have any recommendations of firms. If not, why shouldn’t I and what pieces of evidence should I obtain to display my character?

935nwt,3,2018-07-30,I am incredibly alone in a new city,sandermfc,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/935nwt/i_am_incredibly_alone_in_a_new_city/,"
I moved to a new city back in may for my last internship before I officially graduate. 3 of my friends also moved to this city. I thought we would hang out all the time and that it would be great. I was wrong. I'm not sure if it's because I've been withdrawn or why. But it seems like they've cut me out. I started a group chat with the 4 of us so we could keep in touch and organise activities. But it seems every other week they're posting on snapchat about how they went out and did stuff. Never mentioning it to me. It hurts but I can't entirely blame them. I tend to be introverted so I haven't been reaching out. + They all work at the same place so it's easier for them.

I worked at the same place last summer so I had a few 'friends' from then. They don't seem to care much for me though. They're friendly enough and will invite me out to stuff but I wouldn't say we are close. I also don't want to associate myself with them as they're pretty heavy into drugs.

I have a girlfriend which is nice. She's great, but we've decided that this wasn't going to work long term for various reasons. We essentially have a planned breakup in September. Once that is over I'll have no one. On top of that (and I know this sounds awful), but it bothers me that she has so many friends and is so extroverted. She always has something going on while I'm sat at home. This is fine because she still makes time for me, but it just makes me feel like such a loser.

Last friday night was when things hit me pretty hard. I saw that my original friends were out again on some adventure without me. I reached out to that 2nd group of friends from last summer. I asked them if they wanted to meet up at a club and they said yes. I arrive and go to wait inside. I get a text not long after saying that they're sorry but they can't make it out that night as they made last minute plans with other friends. I tried staying and having a good time on my own. The alcohol didn't help like I hoped, it just made me sadder.

I went home early and cut myself for the first time. I don't know why. I don't understand why it helped.

The next day, I had plans with my girlfriend to go to the market to buy some fresh ingredients and I would cook her a meal (something I've been wanting to do for her for a little while now). At first, I felt so mentally drained I didn't want to go through with it. But I decided to force myself. I woke up and was ready to go for 10am. I get a text saying one of her old friends is in town and she asked if it was alright to push our date a few hours. I said sure, not wanting to stop her from seeing a friend. A few hours turned into her meeting me at the market at 3:30. The market closed at 3. She was very apologetic. I understand that she hasn't seen this friend in a while and it was very last minute. I don't blame her at all but it still hurt. I cut myself again while I waited. It seemed to help but I'm scared it will become a habit. I tend to have an addictive personality, which is why I'm trying to steer clear of that 2nd group of friends.

This isn't usually a problem .. I'm not always such a downer. But I'm currently in salary negotiations for a new job and I am going to be paid much less than most of my collegues. This combined with the fact that it's not exactly a 'flashy' company like some of my girlfriends friends have is a source of embarassment for me. I should be excited about this job. What I would be working on is exactly what I want to do. And although it's not my dream job, it sounds like something I can really enjoy and be good at. I just can't help but compare myself to others.

I feel so very alone right now and I don't know what to do. This weekend has just been a daze. Stress from my current job is piling on a bit as well. I'm planning to go home and cut again. It will be the last time. Then I'll start reaching out to .. something. idk maybe a new hobby or something.

Sorry for the long rambling paragraphs. Thank you for reading this far."
935w7w,2,2018-07-30,Supplementing Acorns with RH ETFs,blubber_tub,RobinHood,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/935w7w/supplementing_acorns_with_rh_etfs/,"**Background:** 

I'm 20 years old and one year away from graduating. I'm about to finish a summer internship and have a firm job offer contingent upon graduation (entry-level systems engineer position). So with that being said I would classify myself as somewhat financially stable, but will have no income for the next 8 months while I finish school (no expenses though). I would like to transfer a portion of my savings into the market, and have chosen Acorns and Robinhood as starting places. I have no plan to touch my Acorns account in the near future, but have resolved to cash out my RH holdings as money is needed to finance an engagement ring with monthly payments starting in early 2019. There's a good chance I won't need to touch my RH holdings to pay for the ring, but am just saying that if it comes to the point where I need to cash out an asset that I've decided it will be the riskier holdings on RH. Otherwise I'm in it for the long-haul. 

**Plan:** 

Roughly 60/40 Robinhood/Acorns respectively. I'd like to use Acorns as sort of an accelerated savings account on the safer side of things, and dip my toes into the world of riskier buying/selling on RH for potentially higher returns. Initially I'm going to stick with ETFs until I'm more comfortable picking individual stocks. I've done my research and picked a handful of ETFs to start with that cover the market as a whole and a number of individual sectors I'm interested in. I've taken these and back-tested several potential portfolios to find a suitable solution that will complement my ""moderately aggressive"" Acorns portfolio. Here are my hypothetical RH allocations: VOO 25%, QQQ 25%, ARKK 10%, PSCH 10%, FDN 10%, VGT 10%, XAR 10%. My idea here is 50% in the ""total market"" with the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ top 100, and then the other 50% distributed among 5 individual sectors: innovation, health, internet, tech, and defense. I'm hoping the total market half will provide some stability while the sector half will provide some potentially higher returns. Portfolio Visualizer stats based on past 5 years: CAGR: 18.36%, StDev: 12.40%, Sharpe: 1.39, Sortino: 2.66, gain/loss ratio: 1.31. 

**Questions:** 

1. What are your thoughts on the volatility of my hypothetical ETF portfolio relative to its potential return? Seems okay? Idiotic? Suicidal?
2. Are there any redundant overlaps in my ETF selections? I have no problem eliminating one or two and distributing that percentage elsewhere. 
3. I know this question doesn't have a golden answer, but given the current state of the market, is now a good time for me to jump in like this? I'm a beginner and have read that this bull may continue for a number of years but I'm not confident in my judgement on this. 
4. With the recent downward fluctuations in the tech sector specifically, is now a good time or bad time to go in on choices like ARKK, FDN, and VGT? I can't tell if this is a ""buy while it's low"" situation or ""these are going to the trash"" situation.
5. Given I may have to cash out some of my RH holdings to finance an engagement ring, do you suggest doing just that OR not investing that money in the first place? My current logic is that I might as well have the money in the market right now with a higher return than a savings account, but I'm worried about the potential volatility biting me in the butt when I might need the money for the ring. 

Disclaimer: I'm a somewhat educated beginner, but a beginner nonetheless. If I've stated something that's incorrect or am just completely wrong on something please let me know. I'd like to learn as much as possible before I do anything with my savings so any criticism of my plan is welcome. "
936n2b,0,2018-07-30,My (M/23) girlfriend (F/21) is gone for 4 months (+2 volunatry) now and I don't know how to react,MrSatan2,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/936n2b/my_m23_girlfriend_f21_is_gone_for_4_months_2/,"Hello, (TL;DR in the last paragraph)

we are together 6 months (knowing her for 3 years) now and I really like her and she constantly says how much she loves me and how happy she is that she found me (and I believe it's true). We were talking about moving in together in half a year maybe.

She has to go abroad (3000 miles / 5000 km)  for 4 months which is necessary for her studies and of course I'm not happy about it, but it is fine and I supported her the best I could. 

Whe have some sort of holiday (USA -&gt; spring break / summer break? idk) since july 2018 and she suddenly decided to work 5 days a week for her father which she hates and said before she never wanted to work there again (she doesn't need the money, but ok), so we are only seeing us on the weekends. Sure, I also support her in this situation.  

A week ago she told me she is going on vacation with her grandparents and (party-) sister 600 miles (1000 km) away for 2 weeks. Was also supporting her, but I told her that I'm slowly not ok with only seeing her so rarely. 

Today she told me she is also going on vacation with her father (which she hates) and her (party-) sister 2000 miles away on a party island also for 2 weeks right after the first vacation.

Honestly, now I'm really pissed. I hold my weekends free and make time to see her. It's hard enough for a fresh relationship to be seperated for 4 months, now shes adding another month voluntary (so 5 months) with her vacation and in the month before we are only seeing each other max 4 times in which I help her move out of her flat like some kind of cheap laborer (so basically 6 months without seeing each other). 

Sure, I'm really happy for her that she is going on vacation, and I understand that she has to do this internship abroad for 4 months and I understand that she wants (?) to work but I'm feeling like I'm not important to her at all if she is cool with adding effectively another 2 months without seeing each other. She is not a big party girl, but her sister is, and of course I have some mild trust issues when she is 1 month in a party location. I can't come with her because her father and grandparents don't want to and I have a severe travel sickness.

I'm saying to her it's alright but only because I honestly don't know how to react right now.
Maybe I should also be unavailable for a week or so. Maybe I should test her and If shes really going through with this, I maybe should just leave her because I don't need this kind of bullshit, if she has no desire to see me. Idk.  

edit: I should add that she is going abroad for 4 months right after the 2 vacations.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 6 months leaves for 4 months (+1 month voluntary on a party island +1 month working) and I don't know how to react.

936wt9,3,2018-07-30,School psych internship?,aglossy,schoolpsychology,https://www.reddit.com/r/schoolpsychology/comments/936wt9/school_psych_internship/,"Hi guys! I recently graduated with my BS in psychology and I’m interested in school psychology as a career. 

I was wondering if there are any internships I could do before I go to grad school. All of the internships I’ve found require a masters degree and I’m not really into grad school mode yet. I want to make sure I love what I’m going into before I apply! 

My GPA isn’t the best unfortunately from undergrad (I struggled in my personal life and financial life that affected my studies), and I was too busy working an almost full time job to pay for expenses during school to find research opportunities.

I really want to build my experience and resume before I go to grad school to increase my chances of getting into a program. 

So basically, my question is, what can I do? Are all internships required for you to have a masters or be in a program? 

I would like to get an internship to see if I would actually enjoy the school psychology field before I dive in and decide I don’t like what I chose to do, if that makes sense!

Any advice is welcomed and thanks in advance! "

So I have been laid-off from my seasonal position and am scheduled to return September 10th. I received my pink slip with my return to work date on 7/3 and promptly filed. I received an email that my claim had been received and I needed to complete hearing forms. I received the hearing forms 7/10 and mailed them out. I haven't heard anything since.

Since I live in CT and you cannot speak to customer service reps on the unemployment line, I went to the office to inquire about my claim..and this is where things get weird.

Apparently, a claim had been filed under my name in FL since April, but no benefits had been paid out. I worked in FL for all of 2017 for a college internship, but I moved back in December and an claiming in CT. The rep told me until my claim is dismissed in FL, my claim has been blocked here in CT.

I ended up calling FL DOL and spoke to a representative who told me I did have an open claim and that in order for me to have the claim closed I had to fax a letter to their claim department which could take a minimum of 20 days to process, which means 20 days before I go back to work, minimum.

Somehow my state either A) thought that I was filling against FL or B) someone got access to my information and tried opening a claim in my name in April.

Has anyone else ever had a situation like this occur? And if so, will they pay me the back weeks I am owed since I am still required to file in CT while my case is pending?

Thanks for any insight!"
937yqg,1,2018-07-30,It's been a pretty tough year,OnlyConversation2,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/937yqg/its_been_a_pretty_tough_year/,"So much shit has happened in my life this year and it's just been horrible. I just want to get this **off my chest** and be able to move forward in life **and not repeat the mistakes of my past**. I know I can't change the past, but **thinking about this past year** ***hurts*** and I really want to just move on, forget about what happened, but not repeat those past actions.

Here's what happened this year so far that made it not-so-stellar:

* I made a mistake in one of my college applications. I omitted a grade (we need to enter the grades into our application ourselves, the universities don't receive our transcripts) and hence got rejected from all the colleges I applied to which use that application. **I was able to turn things around and get re-admitted to two of those universities**, but this just shows how careless and last-minute I am. It sucks thinking about the mistake, not realizing I made it until rejections started rolling in, and then dealing with tension and trauma from my parents, too.
* I got accused of cheating in school. Basically, I made a reddit post (from another account which is now deleted) asking to fabricate data for a statistics project at my school. Some dickhead (who i don't know in real life) emailed my teacher and reported me. He also doxxed me and publicly revealed my name, school name, teacher's name, and other private info in the comments section of that post. I know what I did was wrong, but I realized my mistake before he reported me to the teacher. I was actually planning to delete that post later on, but he beat me to reporting me before I could delete the post. I'm pretty sure I don't know this guy in-real-life. He has consistently revealed my personal info in numerous websites and chat servers (which have later been taken down), put me down and made me feel like a loser through Discord (chat group) DMs, and is a really shady guy. He said I didn't deserve to graduate high school. He even threatened to kill my family. I haven't taken those things to heart (and quite frankly believe he doesn't deserve to graduate high school more than me), but just thinking about what he said sometimes stings. **This guy has just added a lot of unnecessary stress into my life.**
* There's this other guy on reddit. He hasn't necessarily doxxed me like the previous guy. But he did consistently spread false rumors about me, was consistently rude when speaking to me, and called me ""immature"" and stuff like that publicly. **If you something bad to say about someone, shouldn't you just privately tell them? Why put it out in the public for the world to see?** What's worse is that other people sided with him. No one listened or believed in my side of the story and my justifications as to what he said is false. And it sucked. It still sucks to know how others are wrong but you can't change their beliefs. I was recently able to get this idiot to stop pestering me and got him banned from a few subreddits. Prior to that, though, his main use of reddit was to target ME and make me feel like a piece of shit. That's pretty lame on his part. My reddit posts were sometimes trolls/memes but most of the times, related to my future/college/etc, because I was, and still am, concerned about being successful. It seems like he just likes to be a dick and a bully. He has seriously made me a lot less reputable on the internet. Apparently my real identity got leaked and linked to my reddit accounts, so his false accusations are basically connected to my IRL identity too now. **It sucks.** I'm trying to stay under cover on reddit a bit now and am trying to change my internet persona, so hopefully that fixes things. 
* I turned 18. But with that, comes responsibilities of being an adult. A few weeks ago, my family and I went on a vacation. I left my passport at home. Now that I am 18, TSA needs to do an ID check. I left my passport at home like an irresponsible adult. **It sucked balls**. I'll be taking my driver's test soon and if I pass, my license will replace the passport, but this one incident hurts a lot.
* I've been lazy and not very proactive. My college roommate emailed me saying he was going to buy a bunch of stuff for our dorm. My parents told me I need to take more initiative and figure out what I want, too. The thing is, I'm a really unmaterialistic person. I really don't care about what's in our dorm. Even just a bed, some place to keep my clothes, books, and bags, and a table/chair would  do for me. Even not bringing a laptop would be fine for me, since my college has a lot of computer labs for us to use.

I don't know what else to say.

The events that took place this year have just made me realize that I am a misunderstood lazy-ass who attracts dickheads to pester/annoy/cyberbully me.

I want to move on to college with a fresh start (leave my overly competitive Bay Area high school for good and start college at a brand new state in the midwest), forget the shit that happened my senior year of HS and this past summer, and just start this new chapter of my life in a clean slate where I don't repeat the same mistakes I did back in high school. 

Most of all, I just want to be understood, to be accepted for my character. I may be immature, but I know there is a time and place for that. In school, I am a very well-behaved and mature man. I had an internship the summer prior to my senior year and only got good remarks from my manager. With my friends, at home, and even on reddit sometimes (depending on the context of the post), I just like to unleash my inner child. **Is there anything wrong with that?**

Anyways, sorry for the long rant/vent. I just wanted to get this shit off my chest. I'm really hoping college can go a lot better and that I can create new, positive memories, and grow from positive experiences. I am glad to be leaving high school behind and don't want it to haunt me again. There are only around 7-8 other guys from my high school going to the same college as me (incoming undergrad class of 8.3k students) and only a few other people going to the same college as me know about my shit show that took place this past year (none of whom are from my high school).

So I‘ve met this girl at an internship last summer. We get along really well &amp; on the weekly drinks in the city with the other interns, we smoke, drink and share a lot of good conversations and laughs together.
Fast forward to November. It was the first time we kissed and I took her home. We both were not looking for a relationship at the time, but since we bith were going through a rough time and could use some love, we agreed to keep it going. Over the next few months, we quickly fall in love. Everything‘s great, we spend as much time together as we can.

Now, on april 8th, she leaves for a 3 month trip through south america. I already knew this day was coming before our first kiss, but I was really sad that day still. 
The 3 months, even tho missin her everyday, weren‘t all too bad tho. We were texting everyday, having phonecalls every week and telling eachother how much we missed us.

I was reaaaly looking forward to seeing her again her 2 weeks ago, right on the day she returned. I was so happy. She was too. I was sleeping over at her place and it was like she never left. 

Unfortunately, I‘ve holidays booked for myself the day after, so now I was gone for 2 weeks too.

Things started to change from now on. Less snaps, less texts, no phone call.

I knew something was off and today she told me that she didn‘t want to continue with this thing. She couldn‘t really explain it. She apparently wants to leave her past behind because she‘s gone through some shit with her ex here &amp; now she‘s moving to another city (3 hours away, I already knew that, wouldn‘t have been a problem for me) to study and start fresh.

I‘m sorry for the wall of text, but this feeling of sadness, emptiness and not knowing what to do is just so overwhelming. My life‘s been in the shits for the last year anyway and she was my last anchor that I could really hold onto.

I still wish nothing bad unto her and hope she will be happy, I hope everyone of you will be happy too and that you‘ll never have to have your heart broken like that.

She is super committed to learning and executing on a bunch of projects. 

I've mainly had her doing:

- looking up potential partners

- creating a list of industry publications and writers who target our audience

- proofreading content

- some competitive research

- researching industry events and creating a calendar

- cleaning up database (fixing contact info)

- light social media work

- auditing website for broken links and typos

- cleaning up hard bounce emails

- segmenting and preparing lists for email automation campaigns

She recently decided to work more hours, which I am happy about, but I didn't plan activities for this additional time in advance.

I'd love for her to get a well-rounded intership touching different areas of marketing, and I'm sure I am overlooking some options.

938iga,3,2018-07-30,My mom expects me to be her therapist,lilyaintaG,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/938iga/my_mom_expects_me_to_be_her_therapist/,"Within the past seven months, my mom has been on an emotional rampage.

It started off with the death of my dog in January, then the death of my grandma (her mom) in March. After the death of my grandma, my dad started a second job, so he's practically gone all day.

I'm a college student and my college is about a two and a half hour drive from home, so I'm practically never home either. The semester ended in mid-May, but I've been back and forth from campus throughout the summer to visit my friends. I just moved all of my stuff out of my old apartment on campus, so now I'm officially stuck home until mid-August when the next school year begins.

Being at home is a living hell, and it's clear my dad took a second job to get away from my mom's nonstop narcissistic rampage. Every moment with her is with her complaining about how horrible her year is, her strained relationship with my dad, and how stressed out she is all of the time.

The thing is, she willingly hasn't been employed in over 12 years, and continues to mooch off of my dad's income. My mom literally does nothing but stays home and plays computer games all day. Meanwhile, I'm entering my senior year of college. I'm applying for graduate school, balancing an internship and a job, my extracurriculars, and keeping my academics up. The fact that she tells me she's always stressed out is hilarious to me when she doesn't do shit compared to me or my dad.

This happened just now and is the main reason why I'm writing this post, but another thing that really fucking pisses me off is her tendency to rant to me about my dad. I don't get why it's so hard for her to understand that as her child, I don't like hearing about my parents' failing relationship. I tell her this, and she calls me a fucking bitch and that she has no one else to talk to. Classic manipulation techniques. She has my sister (who doesn't live with her), her extended family, my cousin, her brother, the neighbors, and my dad. I was about to run to the grocery store to get something to make for dinner when she started ranting to me about my dad. She then told me she was going to leave to talk to the neighbors if I wasn't going to listen to her. The whole ordeal got my blood boiling, and I knew I wasn't going to be in a good state to drive to the grocery if I was really pissed off, so I got my laptop out and started writing this post to calm me down.

Even though she always rants to me about herself, she honestly couldn't give two shits about me or my sister. She never asks me about how I'm doing or what I do at school. My sister graduated from college a few months ago (she's 35 and a nontraditional student) and my mom and dad couldn't even be bothered to attend her graduation. She went to school in the SAME town my parents live in. If this happened with my sister, I doubt they'll attend my graduation next year two and a half hours away. Even though she obviously is going through some shit, she never stops to consider about the effect that all the recent deaths in the family has on me. At one point, she even forgot what year I was in school. I think with the way things are going right now, I'm probably going to have to move all of my stuff into my new apartment by myself because her and my dad can't take five seconds to stop their bickering and help their own fucking kid with their things.

I'm sorry for the extremely long post, this recent argument just has me really upset right now. I try not to tell my friends about these kind of troubles because I don't want to mimic my mom's behavior. If you made it to the end, thank you for reading.

I have no accounting or finance experience other than an AP internship that i did. I asked my HR dept about an open position for a Financial/insurance investigator. I thought it would be great resume experience for someone starting out in this field. Its 9 to 5, union (same one that im in).

Heres the cons:

1. It pays 23.10 for 70 hrs/biweekly. I currently make 23.84 for 75 hrs/biweekly. The huge difference in hrs worked results in $140 net difference after taxes. So i would get $140 less biweekly after tax and union dues.

2. If its 9 to 5 then i cant do any internships while in school. I currently work 3-11.

Also i am married with kids. My wife makes less ($15/hr).

So should i take the position or stay where i am (where the most money is) and focus on internships until i graduate?"
939117,17,2018-07-30,Wife Update - New Fun,roblestion,Hotwife,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hotwife/comments/939117/wife_update_new_fun/,"So if you read my previous posts my wife and I are new to this lifestyle and she had sex for the first time with another man her intern a short while ago

So since that experience and others we’ve had I can honestly say our sex life and romantic life has improved significantly. We have the best sex we’ve ever had and we’ve taken it slow since then as I think all couples should since we are still in love and this is about our pleasure.

Anywho, this weekend we decided to make a day trip to the beach. We purposely picked a beach that was more adult oriented that we’d never been too. It’s designed for adults but they don’t enforce that so we were curious what the crowd would be like. The reason we were curious is that my wife wore a very skimpy bathing suit that is essentially a thong and we wanted to see what kind of attention she got.

We walked into the beach and saw mostly men and a few couples. We put down our beach towel and sat down. No one really looked our way. A few minutes In we got in the water and had an intense makeout session. This definitely attracted attention as my wife’s nipples were partially visible as we walked out. I saw a few guys ogling and got hard .

When we layed back down we noticed a much older gentleman was circling us so I told me wife to give him a show. He was definitely a well put together man in his 50s or more but in good shape. (We’re in our late 20s) She smiled and turned over showing her ass. The guy was basically sitting in front of us know still acting like he wasn’t staring. A few minutes later my wife decided to go in the water solo. I saw the guy get up and walk at the edge of the water. I waited to see what would happen as my wife got out. I heard him say you’re very beautiful loudly. My wife said what was that and walked upto him. They chatted briefly and she typed something in her phone I thought it was his phone number. I saw my wife laughing and blushing as she walked back to me.

I asked what he said she told me he said she’s very pretty and sorry for staring and that he asked what nationality she is she said Indian. He said his ex was Indian and that he’s on a business trip his wife is at home. He asked who I was she said her husband and he said sorry if I got mad. said he doesn’t mind and he said oh really? What doesn’t he mind? She said anything he said well he’s not really into a guy being in the room but if she wanted to have some fun he’s staying at the hotel right on the beach. He gave her the room number and said he’s heading up now just knock if she’d like. 

My wife asked me what to do. I’d recently developed an interest in letting her do stuff without me watching but for safety reasons I said no to her going alone. She agreed. Maybe it was my ultra hornyness but I suggested we go to his room and chat with him to see if he’d be okay with my presence. We decided to try it and walked into the hotel and went right to the elevator up to his room. I was nervous and shivering as we knocked on the door. He opened the door and was surprised to see me and a bit defensive I put him at ease by saying we’re interested in fun but didn’t want her to come alone. He invited us into his massive suite with two bedrooms. We sat down and he sat next to my wife saying she’s the most sexy woman he’s ever seen. I said I like watching but it’s upto him. He said he’s uncomfortable with that but I could hang out in the second room of his suite. I agreed as this was a fantasy of mine. My wife was smiling the whole time.

I went to the other room and left the door open as he held my wife’s hand and walked her into the master room. He shut the door but we agreed he’d leave it unlocked I heard light laughing and then it got quiet so I walked up to the room door rock hard and peaked underneath like a creep lol. I saw my wife’s on her knees and his feet I knew she was on her knees sucking him but couldn’t see I almost came right there I went back to the bed in the other room and jacked off thinking about what’s going on in there. I started hearing moaning and spanking as I came. Round two of me jacking off and about 20 mins later my wife walked out butt naked and sweaty. She smiled at me and said the gentleman is in the shower. I asked her how it was and she turned around showing me a layer of cum on her ass. 

We got back to our car and went straight to the backseat. We started fucking immediately as she told me details of how she sucked his cock and that he ate her pussy and her ass. She said he fucked her missionary but very hard and she came twice. She said he sucked her toes and he took his dick out a few times and asked her to “taste herself” by giving him head. She said it was really good sex.

We both came in the car and had sex twice that night. I’m glad I took the safe approach as safety and communication is key in this lifestyle. We are going to take it easy again but I loved hearing the nasty details rather than seeing them for some reason haha"

I grumbled and tossed another pinstriped dress shirt on the bed. That one was no good either. There was lipstick on the collar and perfume still wafted up from the fabric in waves, and for a moment I’m reminded of an Asian girl with dramatic eyes whose name I’d already forgotten.

*Now that was a good night.*

I sigh loudly – more of a growl now – and glance at my watch, the heavy silver band catching the light spilling into my condo. You’re three minutes late already. I rake a big hand through my dark brown hair, and continue the hunt for a shirt that is in decent enough shape to wear into the office. There would be a new crop of interns arriving any day, and I didn’t want to poison the well by showing up looking sloppy. My phone buzzes, and the caller ID shows Front desk. The message is brief: **maid on the way up**.

“Fuck. Finally.”

The timing of arriving guests is familiar and predictable. By the time I open my front door, you should just be stepping off the elevator. I flick open the locks and try to remember what your name was.

*Maria? Sofia? Chalupa?*

I actually smiled at that last one.

Looking to play out the predictable - but always sexy - stereotypes. A pretty brown-skinned cleaning girl with a fat ass and perfect cocksucking lips. And a cocky, handsome stud that wants to get off before he goes to work.  Let's work out some details and have fun.

Bonus points if you actually speak Spanish."
93a0hp,1,2018-07-30,New Rules at WeWork,[deleted],DirtyFlashFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyFlashFiction/comments/93a0hp/new_rules_at_wework/,"Jane stepped into the elevator and sighed. It was her Tuesday sigh, and she meant it. Things may have been picking up for her little firm, but that didn't make her life easier. She's managed a day off yesterday, the building was undergoing some maintenance and she didn't need another kind of stress to add to her own. There was enough going on with the deluge of new clients. She had a meeting with one of them, Hector Marlowe, first thing. A pig of a man., She groaned, and then mumbled a greeting as a few more people got onto the elevator before finding herself doing a double-take. One of her interns, Paula, was stepping in, and she did not look ready for work in the classical sense. The 24 year old's shirt was barely buttoned, clearly a size too small, and her pencil skirt was struggling and failing to contain her ass. Jane was also sure that she hadn't been platinum blonde on Friday.

""Paula?"" The woman turned to look at her, and gave a little wave and a giggle.

""Oh, good morning, Ms. Mackleby. Happy Tuesday! I just can't wait until you see what they've done with the place, it's so- *oh!*"" Jane's eyebrows almost shot off of her head as the man behind Paula grabbed her by one of her long blonde ponytails and tilted her head back, leaning over her from behind to shove his tongue in her mouth. 

""What are you doing!?"" The man cocked an eyebrow of his own as he detached his mouth from Paula, who moaned softly as he reached under her shirt. 

""Not here yesterday? Check your email when you get a chance, it'll explain everything. In the meantime you might be down an intern. Sorry."" Jane stumbled out of the elevator as the door opened, one hand clutched to her mouth as she watched Paula sink to her knees with a worshipful expression on her face as the two men in the elevator closed in, and last thing she heard was the sound of their zippers flying down as the door closed. 

*What are they talking about?!* Jane ran for the bathroom, past a couple of leering men and one woman up against the glass of one of the offices being railed by an older man. She looked like an animal, her neon blue hair clutched tightly in a wrinkled fist as she threw herself backwards onto his cock every time he thrust into her. Jane practically fell through the door to the woman's bathroom, slamming it behind her and throwing herself into a stall. She opened her email as she registered the wet thumping sounds causing one of the walls of her stall to shake, a horrifying soundtrack to her already collapsing day. She found the message, with the subject line ""Maintenance Tomorrow!"" Jane was sure she'd read the message, but she opened it anyway. Her phone's screen shuddered as she tapped on it, the message she remembered reading suddenly folding into itself and forming something entirely knew. 

*We thank you for the implicit agreement of stepping through the elevator doors and into your new WeWork experience. We thank you for your cooperation, it's really helping us grow in this saturated economy. For years we've been working to give our customers the best experience imaginable, and we're finally able to do it. This message holds the key to that little sound just outside your range of hearing, helping you *relax* in this stressful time. You're going to learn the joys of helping your coworkers with their stress as well. Doesn't that sound nice?* 

*It does sound nice*. Jane found herself thinking. *Really nice.* There was a knock on the door of her stall, and Jane dropped her phone as she unlocked it. The forgotten message lay on the floor as Hector Marlowe stepped inside with the casual arrogance that Jane had always hated about him. 

*In order to smooth your transition, we've let your visitors and business partners know your whereabouts so you can be welcomed into the new system with welcome arms. Enjoy!*

""There you are, Jane. We were worried about you."" Marlowe's large hands pushed her back against the wall behind her, unbuttoning her shirt with rough efficiency. 

""I'm... I'm so sorry, Hector, I didn't mean to cause you any trouble."" 

""I know you didn't, Jane, and you won't. Not ever again."" He pushed her down onto her knees, and Jane felt the same expression that had covered Paula's spilling over her like the load of cum she was doubtless soon to experience. 

""Thank you, Hector, *thank you*.""

93ak3k,1,2018-07-30,I dislike myself as a human being,Leaf_Warrior,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/93ak3k/i_dislike_myself_as_a_human_being/,"If this is not the right subreddit, I'm sorry.

Putting it bluntly, I kinda hate myself. I'm not sure who to talk to so here I am.

I kinda wish I was different. I wish I looked different, I wish my personality was different. I wish I wasn't so naive as a person. I'm too nice and people have stepped on me before. Sometimes I wish that I was more cruel as a person, so that way nobody could hurt me like others have before. In reality, I'm a sensitive person and too forgiving. I've gotten better, but that part of me is still there.

I feel like I annoy people too much. I've brought this up to friends. They say no, and maybe they're right, but I still feel like I am.

I wish I was smarter, and more proactive. My grades are just meh, I haven't gotten an F in any classes yet, but I'm no straight A student. In some cases I am surprised I passed some classes. I'm going to be a junior in college soon and yet I didn't even bother to apply to more than two internships. I felt so depressed and unmotivated during the spring time earlier this year that I just couldn't bring myself to apply.

I complain a lot about being single. I only had one relationship, it was almost two years ago and only lasted for a month. I keep wanting a relationship which is absurd because I should be happy with myself first. I guess it doesn't matter. I partly gave up on taking initiative, because the few times I actually have the courage and confidence to actually tell a guy I like him, I'm always rejected. I've been told they're not ready for a relationship, or that it's too soon to date me, but suddenly date another girl less than two months later. Nevertheless I keep wishing for one, even though I know there are perks to being single as well. I feel like I can't really talk much to people about this because either the person is in a relationship or they're content with being single for now.

I wish I could disappear. It's not really an urge to die, but that has been there for a while. It's not as prominent as it used to be, but some people don't know I almost wanted to end my life by jumping off a building and that I didn't because I calmed down halfway through my walk towards the building and turned around.

I don't know what to do, and I don't know where to go. I call the hotline once in a while, my friends and parents are aware of some of this and they do their best to support me, but I still feel like I'm stuck. I want to cry my eyes out. I still feel so alone and that if I talk to someone I'm bothering them. I hate myself. I wish I was different. It hurts and I feel like I'm in so much pain. I don't think I've heard someone say to me that they love me in such a long time, but who am I to say that when I myself don't toss that phrase so frequently? 

I just wish I was different. It hurts. I don't know how to feel better. Sometimes I wonder if there is something is wrong with me."

Just want to preface this by saying sorry if this comes of as a bit of a rant, and also because this is such a long post. It would mean a lot to me if you read the whole thing and offer me whatever advice you can give me. Thank you :)

Here we go.

I started fapping to porn when I was 11-12. For the next 4-5 years or so, I was just a wandering shell of a human being. Tired, unenthusiastic, you know, the usual. My grades were crap. My social life was crap. Don't even ask about girlfriends. Not a day went by when my parents wouldn't yell at me about not doing well in school, how my behavior was garbage and how I didn't respect them. They were right. Truth is, all those years, I was just wasting my life away. Mind you, I did know about NoFap at the time and how abstaining from PMO could improve my life, but failed at it miserably whenever I attempted it.

It wasn't all bad though.

Something clicked inside of me during my junior year of high school. I re-discovered my child-hood passion, specifically Physics and Astronomy. What followed was an *incredible* last two years of high school. In short, I did so well that I got into an elite university to study Physics. Unfortunately, I still fapped. I still wasted about an hour everyday on this shit. But I tried to rationalize it, by saying ""Well, I've achieved a good deal in life. This is my reward."" This sort of rationalization continued throughout my freshman year of college. I was getting immaculate grades at this point, had a bustling social circle, wrote music for fun, was involved with many extracurricular activities on campus from Physics research to organizing film festivals, and was, generally, a successful student. I'm not trying to brag here. I'm just saying that I was able to go far even though I fapped almost everyday. I just figured it was okay to fap because why the hell not?

There was one thing in my life that was lacking, however. A girlfriend. A significant other. Being at a co-ed, sex-positive university, it seemed that everyone around me was getting into relationships. *Everyone* as far as I could see was getting sex. Being the impressionable teenager that I was (and still am albeit to a much lesser extent), I felt so much pressure to get into a relationship. I also felt great sadness knowing that I was just cooped up in my room fapping to digital nonsense while people that I was close with were out there, *living*; they were with *real people.* Looking back on it a year and a half later, I can say that part of the reason I didn't have a girlfriend up until that point was my upbringing. I don't come from a very sex-positive culture. That kind of dogma, instilled in me at a very young age, created a lot of sexual frustration from me. As a result I eventually discovered porn, and in no time, I was addicted. Anyways, I felt jealousy because everyone else had a girlfriend and I did not. I always asked myself and others the question ""where's mine?"" Everyone said ""just give it time"" or ""you'll find the right girl someday"" or some bullshit like that.

I pursued a couple of girls, one at the beginning at the year and one towards the end. Now, when I say pursued, I mean I flat-out told them that I was in love with them. Yeeeeaaaah, I got rejected. That's the price I paid for my lack of experience regarding women. I had nothing. Zero. Nada. I hate to admit it, but I went r/niceguys on one of them. Thanks to porn, I essentially had a highly warped view of women at the time. I felt like I was entitled sex from them. It was so easy to get sexual gratification online so I figured, or at least my brain figured, it would be easy to get it in real life too. Obviously, I was wrong. It was nothing but heartbreak for months on end, and of course, more fapping to ""alleviate the pain""...at least that's what I told myself. Notice the pattern yet?

And just like that, freshman year of college was over. I didn't get any internships the following summer, so what did I do?Yup, you guessed it. I was still trying NoFap, but again, failling at it. Towards the end of that summer, my family and I took a vacation. It provided me with an opportunity once again to try NoFap. And this time, *finally*, I reached two weeks. I never felt better. It was like being reborn. I started to notice physical changes too. Better skin, deeper voice, sharper facial features. I couldn't believe it. For once I thought things were going to work out, that I was going to be okay. By the time sophomore year began, the girl that ""pursued"" towards the end of the year (let's call her Rose) also started to get closer to me. Despite the shit-show that I put Rose through earlier, it appeared that she put all of that stuff behind her. I may have fapped only once a month at that point as opposed to twice a day before that vacation. My libido increased, naturally, and I really felt girls were attracted to me a lot more including Rose. Lo and behold, I fell for her even more. Once again, at some point, during the fall of that year, I confessed my feelings for her, and once again, got rejected. Heartbreak, confusion, porn, masturbation, orgasm. You know the story. I was devastated. I couldn't believe I let this happen.

Later in the spring, when Rose got a boyfriend, I couldn't take it anymore. I had to take time away from her. It was too painful to be around her for hopefully obvious reasons. For the rest of sophomore year, I devoted my energy to NoFap. Hit some small streaks along the way, but still failing to reach any substantial milestones (\~30 days+). I was trying, though. I was working on my confidence. *I learned to move on from the past.* I learned to approach women. I learned to not be afraid of them, to treat them like people, human beings, not like* sex object*s. I went out on dates. No actual relationships formed, but hey, it's a step in the right direction. Sophomore year ended. I finally moved on from Rose. I had something to show for my effort and despite it being my worst semester, I still landed an internship at a Physics research facility for the summer.

And that brings us to now.

Every few days, I fap. I'm still fucking *fapping*.

My anxiety around women has all but disappeared, and my confidence is fairly high. I take care of myself by working out semi-regularly, and I'm achieving more than ever was. Outside of my internship, I'm being creative, i.e. writing screenplays and composing my own music (trying to anyways). But even after all this, **I'm still fapping!** I just don't know what to do anymore! I don't know how to channel my sexual energy. Every time I'm on a good streak, I just go and ruin it. Why am I still doing this? I'm just destroying whatever progress I've made again and again. I'm so fucking frustrated! How do I finally rid myself of the horrible cancer that is porn? How do I surmount this last mountain? What will it take to finally finish off this addiction?  Please help me. I just need some help and some guidance. I just need some practical advice on dealing with addictions. Anything and everything is much appreciated! Thank you so much. You guys (and gals) are the best!"

93axx3,16,2018-07-30,Need help interpreting text conversation with my mom,beta_emission,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/93axx3/need_help_interpreting_text_conversation_with_my/,"So what I'm about to post might seem crazy (at least I feel crazy posting it), but here goes... 

Three years ago, my mom and I got into a huge fight over text, bigger than any fights we've had since I was a teenager. For whatever reason, maybe what I've been processing during therapy, I've been thinking a lot about this fight lately. It was so confusing and infuriating to me at the time, and frankly still is. I wanted to reread it, but thought there was no way the texts would still be on my phone, but lo and behold, I was able to drag them out of my iMessage on my laptop.

I still feel like I'm too close to the situation to see the forest for the trees. I don't know if she's the asshole or if I am or if it's both of us. So I'm coming to you lovely people, who I trust to tell me the truth and give your honest opinion.

Some backstory:

This fight started over a post my mom made on Facebook. When I was nine years old, I sleepwalked out of my parents' house and woke up on the side of the road. A woman and her mother found me and started to give me a ride home, then I panicked and jumped out of their car and ran home, got into bed, and went back to sleep. The women called the police and dogs tracked me back to my house, and my whole family was questioned for signs of abuse. Fast forward to the time of this fight; I'm an adult in grad school and I sleepwalked again, this time just to my bathroom and back. I told my mom about this casually, and she posted on Facebook that I was sleepwalking and that ""THIS IS TERRIFYING."" I commented on it saying ""This is dramatic."" She deleted my comment and then sent me the first text.

Some other backstory that might help you make sense of the texts:

\- I have BPD (boo, hiss; I know). It definitely still affects my life every day, but I have it more or less under control in terms of lashing out or misbehaving. Mostly I just cry a lot these days.

\- I have had suicidal thoughts and depression starting at the age of 11. This is also under control now, but my mom always thought I was just acting out for attention and her refusal to help me when I desperately needed it is what torpedoed our relationship.

\- The speech she references was one I gave at a school retreat in high school. It was about some adversity we had overcome in our lives. She has always assumed it was about her.

\- When I was in preschool, I told my classmates that I had a dog who died and that the president came to its funeral. She references this as well.

\- The ""ridiculous"" fight had occurred about six months prior to this one. I was living in a condo my parents own while working a summer internship. On my first day of work, I texted her freaking out because I couldn't get the stove to work and I was worried I would be late. I said ""this is ridiculous"" and she said ""oh there's a LOT about this situation that's ridiculous."" 

The point during this conversation that REALLY set me off was when she claimed that my suffering was her suffering. That really got under my skin because I suffered so much as a child/teenager and she was so dismissive of it and even treated it like a joke at times.

What I also notice is that at one point, I indirectly blame her for my BPD diagnosis. That seems to be her breaking point. Also, she sent things at me so rapid-fire that I couldn't keep up. If this had been an in-person fight, I suspect it would have been one-sided screaming.

I know this is a lot...seriously, any advice would be welcome. I don't know what to make of this, but TIA for anyone who reads all these :)

93bg85,4,2018-07-31,She loves me but wants to be friends.,throw_away_pancakes,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/93bg85/she_loves_me_but_wants_to_be_friends/,"So I am posting this while almost drunk and about to lay in bed staring at the ceiling hoping to fall asleep. Hopefully it is formatted okay. 

The background. 
We have been best friends for about 4.5 years really close best friends for about 3 of those years. And by best friends I mean: have a constant text conversation, talk on the phone, hang out when possible, run all future plans by the other person, ask them about life goals plans and relationship advice best friends. For the past year and a half we have been complicated. Meaning that we have been sleeping together, making future life plans together, at least I have been falling completely in love, going on vacations together, talking about how we love each other, picturing our future lives together all of that, too much to mention.  

Further back:
When her and I started this she was about 1.5 months out of a serious relationship, I mean the he was about to move in with her, they were 1 year from getting married serious. 
And they broke up because he was cheating on her and had been for a long time. He was cheating on her so much that he broke up with her the week he was moving in with another woman. 
It absolutely wrecked her, as she was 3 months from starting law school. Any one who knows or has been close to some one who went through law school will tell you that the first year of it is hell on earth. You have no time to do anything but school. 
Also that leading up to and for the first month of law school she was flirting with other guys. And I was occasionally flirting with another girl. Then I made the mistake of realizing I was in love. 
I asked her to stop and just have me, with out titles or anything official, and she did! I was so excited to have her all to myself. I told her I love her and she told me back. She told me I was everything she wanted in her future. 
And after a couple months she said she was finally okay with calling me her boyfriend. 

We went away together to a cabin to celebrate, we tried to take a good picture together and everything. 
Then on social media she says how she spent a weekend away with her best friend. 
Which caused me to ask why she phrased it that way.... and caused a downward spiral into us going from officially dating to being complicated.
We stayed complicated for another 5 months. It had its ups and downs from her side including I love you and am going to marry you and hope we are in a good enough place in 6 months for you to move in. To I need to be single I can’t handle the pressure of not being in a relationship and you waiting on me, and I still cry over my ex and I can’t be in a relationship and plan my life around some one else and need to be single because I don’t want to turn down on internship in New York because it wouldn’t be the best for us. 

About a month ago she initiated us going back to being “just friends.”  No physicality. 
But occasionally when we are trying to cope we tell each other we love each other. 
We some how see each other more now than we did as complicated. ( ironic because she said she needed to not spend so much time together.) 
Near the end of every time we spend together there is some sort of closeness. She will put her head on my lap. I’ll rub her back. Etc etc. 

More about her...
I am all she has. Her family, while around, treats her like absolute crap. They stop by her place simply to tell her she sucks. And how she can be better. Her friends have all moved on to their just married, having kids part of their lives and aren’t very good friends. She has no self confidence and I depressed. 

What I want to know is...
What do I do? 
How can I just be her friend until she is “ready for a relationship.” Which may never happen.
Or 
How can I cut some one out of life I love more than myself and am all they have?

I want this woman as my wife someday.
I don’t know how to be her friend and hope she wants me in the future. Which she continues to say I am all she wants long term but just am isn’t ready for a relationship.

And the question I am most scared of asking.... 
Have I been and am I just being used?

I have no one to talk to about this stuff ."
93c4w5,106,2018-07-31,An in-depth look at the 2018 South Carolina Gamecocks (warning: very long),ChapinKnight,CFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/93c4w5/an_indepth_look_at_the_2018_south_carolina/,"After today we'll be exactly one month away from another[South Carolina](#f/southcarolina)**Carolina**[South Carolina](#f/southcarolina)kick off! The Gamecocks start the 2018 season against Coastal Carolina at noon eastern and you can watch the game on the SEC Network. I wanted to go ahead and post my preview of the team today to coincide with the South Carolina takeover on the SEC Network. In the preview I break down the entire roster by position along with the coaching staff and the 2018 schedule, so hopefully you won't have any questions regarding the Gamecocks when you're finished (if you finish...). I invite any other SC fans to offer input, corrections, etc. as there are certainly more knowledgeable folks out there than me (and I'm sure a Clemson fan will sneak in a comment or two).
______

South Carolina finished a quiet 9-4 last season, with a 5-3 record in SEC play. The team finished strong with an Outback Bowl victory over Michigan. The season was one of the best in school history, as 9+ wins has only happened seven times total. Under head coach Will Muschamp, the Gamecocks have added 3 wins to their season win total each year from 3-9 in '15 to 6-7 in '16 &amp; 9-4 in '17 so it's only reasonable to expect the Gamecocks to go 12-0 in the 2018 regular season. ^(/s) At SEC Media Days the Gamecocks were predicted to finish 2nd in the SEC East.

Let's begin.

**- Coaching staff -**

**Will Muschamp - Head Coach**

Muschamp enters his third year at Carolina with a 15-11 overall record and 8-8 in SEC play. Quickly exceeding expectations in Columbia, Muschamp has begun to turn the program around and has taken the team to bowl games both years. His 15 wins through two seasons matches Steve Spurrier and Joe Morrison for most wins in a coaches first two years at Carolina. Muschamp is a 23-year coaching veteran with 15 of those years spent in the SEC. He was the head coach of the Florida Gators from 2011-14, where the team went 28-21 overall (17-15 SEC) with one SEC Championship game appearance.  He has spent 9 total seasons as an FBS defensive coordinator; at LSU (2002-04), Texas (2008-10), and Auburn (2006-07 and 2015). In his six seasons as an SEC defensive coordinator, Muschamp’s units ranked among the nation’s Top-10 in total defense and in scoring defense five times. His 2003 LSU defense was the best rushing defense in the country allowing just 67 rushing yards a game, the best mark by an SEC team in the 2000s. Muschamp played safety at Georgia.

**Bryan McClendon - Offensive Coordinator/Wide Receivers**

McClendon joined the USC coaching staff before the 2016 season. He was previously working at his alma mater, Georgia, most notably as assistant head coach and serving as interim head coach in the 'Dawgs win over Penn State in the 2016 TaxSlayer Bowl. In his first 2 seasons at Carolina he was the co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach. After the dismissal of OC Kurt Roper at the end of the 2017 regular season, McClendon was given the opportunity to call the plays against Michigan in the Outback Bowl. He was soon promoted to offensive coordinator, while remaining as the wide receivers coach. Muschamp said of McClendon at SEC Media Days: ""Bryan is a guy that in two years that I've worked for, number one, is extremely bright; number two, has a tireless work ethic; but has the unique ability to be very hard on his players, and his players still love and respect him. And that's hard. Not a lot of coaches are able to have that trait.  And I watched the guy take over a very difficult situation in a bowl game with an intern tag at the time and be organized and detailed, and did a great job game planning, but more than anything, did a fantastic job adjusting at halftime, had command of the staff, command of the team."" 

**Travaris Robinson - Defensive Coordinator/Defensive Backs**

Robinson has seemingly been tied to the hip of Will Muschamp since the start of his career. An Auburn grad, Robinson first broke into coaching at Auburn in 2006 as a staff assistant, under Muschamp, who was the defensive coordinator at the time.  He stayed one more year until spending one season each as the defensive backs coach at Western Kentucky (2008), Southern Miss (2009), and Texas Tech (2010) before reuniting with Muschamp on his staff at Florida. There Robinson was able to develop some of the most talented secondaries in the SEC. After Muschamp was let go at Florida Robinson again followed him to Auburn and then on to South Carolina, serving as defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach the past 3 years.

**Coleman Hutzler - Special Teams Coordinator/Linebackers**

Hutzler, another original member of Muschamp's first coaching staff at Carolina, serves as the special teams coordinator and linebackers coach. He had previously worked under Muschamp at Florida in 2011 and again in 2014. Hutzler began his coaching career at the University of San Diego. He has also spent time at Stanford, New Mexico, Boston College.

**Lance Thompson - Asst. Head Coach, Defense/Defensive Line**

Thompson is entering his 3rd season coaching at South Carolina. He has a lot of experience coaching in the SEC, as he's worked at Alabama 3 separate times (1999-2000, 2007-2008, and 2012-14), LSU (2002-2003), Auburn (2015), and Tennessee (2009-11). He has also coached at Georgia Tech and UCF. Thompson was named the 2008 Rivals National Recruiter of the Year.

**Bobby Bentley - Running Backs**

Bobby Bentley, father of quarterback Jake Bentley, was named to Muschamp's staff as running backs coach in 2015. Bentley got his coaching career started at Byrnes High School (SC) where he was head coach from 1995-2006, and again in 2013.  He won four consecutive state championships with Byrnes from 2002-05, and was named the Nike National Coach of the Year in 2005. His first college coaching experience came at his alma mater, Presbyterian College in Clinton, SC., as head coach from 2007-08. He also coached at Auburn as an offensive analyst in the two years prior to coming to Columbia.

**Kyle Krantz - Special Teams Asst./Nickels and SAM LB**

Krantz is the newest member of the South Carolina on-field coaching staff, as he was promoted in January 2018. He spent his first two years as a defensive analyst at Carolina and has been with Muschamp for the past 5 years, as he worked at Florida and then Auburn. Krantz has also held positions at Kentucky, Northwestern, and his alma mater, Northern Colorado.

**Mike Peterson - Outside Linebackers**

Peterson played linebacker under Steve Spurrier at Florida and went on to play in the NFL for 14 years. He then returned to Florida as a strength and conditioning coach in 2013, where he stayed until moving to Columbia prior to the 2016 season.

**Pat Washington - Tight Ends**

Washington enters his 31st season coaching in the collegiate ranks, and his 3rd with South Carolina. 19 of those seasons have been spent at 5 different SEC programs; his alma mater, Auburn (1987-88), Tennessee (1995-2005), Mississippi State (2007-08), Missouri (2013-15), and South Carolina (2016-present).  

**Dan Werner - Quarterbacks**

Werner was named the Gamecocks' quarterback coach in January 2018. He comes from having spent one season under Nick Saban as an offensive analyst at Alabama and the 5 years prior he was the co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Ole Miss. In 2011, the year before Werner joined Ole Miss, the Rebels ranked in the bottom 15 in the country in passing offense. The very next year they jumped into the top 50, and while developing Bo Wallace, Chad Kelly, and Shea Patterson, Werner helped lead Ole Miss to 2 top 15 finishes in 2015 and 2016 in passing offense. Werner spent 8 years at Miami, tutoring such quarterbacks as Ken Dorsey, Steve Walsh, Gino Torretta, and Craig Erickson. Werner began his coaching career in 1986 at Cornell.

**Eric Wolford - Offensive Line**

Wolford enters his second year on Muschamp's staff, his second stint at Carolina. In 2009 under Steve Spurrier he was USC's offensive line coach and run game coordinator. He most recently spent 2 seasons in the NFL as a San Francisco 49ers assistant offensive line coach. Prior to his time with San Francisco Wolford spent 19 years in the collegiate ranks, most notably perhaps as the head coach of Youngstown State from 2010-14. Wolford also had successful tenures at Illinois (2007-08) and Arizona (2004-06). Wolford was a four year starter at Kansas State under Bill Snyder.

**Jeff Dillman - Director of Strength &amp; Conditioning**

Dillman is entering his 3rd year at South Carolina as the director of strength and conditioning. He spent the 2015 season as an assistant at Alabama and before that was with Muschamp in Florida for 3 seasons. Prior to his years at Florida he was the head of physical activities at the IMG academy where he oversaw all strength and conditioning programs. He was also a member of LSU's football, basketball (men's &amp; women's), and baseball coaching staff in 2003. Dillman has also worked at UL-Monroe and his alma mater, Appalachian State. 

**Marcus Lattimore - Director of Player Development**

Perhaps the best story to come out of Columbia in the offseason was the announcement of the hiring of Marcus Lattimore as the director of player development. Lattimore is one of the most beloved players in USC history and was one of the best to ever do it at the running back position. He holds the school record for total touchdowns (41), among many other school records, and now has a chance to continue to grow his legacy for the Gamecocks.  He is the founder of the Marcus Lattimore Foundation, which is committed to the youth through initiatives which emphasize Christian values, character, life-skills development, education, and health and wellness in South Carolina, and has most recently served as the head football coach at Heathwood Hall prep school in Columbia.

**OFFENSE**

In 2017 South Carolina averaged 337.1 yards per game (12th in the SEC and 109th in the country) and 24.2 points per game (12th SEC, 99th nationally). As a whole, SC finished near the bottom of the SEC in almost every offensive category, which lead to the firing of Kurt Roper. OC Bryan McClendon looks to speed up the tempo of the offense and wants to run [""as many (plays) as possible""](https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/sports/college/usc/2018/02/28/gamecocks-mcclendon-play-calling-offense-stay-aggressive-and-attack-mode/382559002/). McClendon also looks to improve the offense's 3rd down conversion rate, which sat at 38.01% last year. Returning are 8 starters. 

**Returning production:**

Passing yards: 100%

Passing touchdowns: 100%

Rushing yards: 98%

Rushing touchdowns: 94%

**Key losses:** TE Hayden Hurst, C Alan Knott, G Cory Helms

**Key returnees:** QB Jake Bentley, WR Deebo Samuel, WR Bryan Edwards, WR OrTre Smith, WR Shi Smith, RB Rico Dowdle, RB A.J. Turner, RB TySon Williams, G Zack Bailey, T Dennis Daley, C Donell Stanley

**Top newcomers:** QB Dakereon Joyner, WR Josh Vann, OL Dylan Wonnum, OL Jovaughn Gwyn

**- Quarterbacks -** 

Players listed by class

*Projected starters in italics*
 
**Key stat(s):**  South Carolina (read: Jake Bentley) averaged 214.9 passing yards a game last season.

**Michael Scarnecchia, RS SR** - 3 games, 1 pass for 9 yards in 4 seasons, redshirted in ’14; 3*

**Danny Gordon, RS SR** - reserve walk-on

***Jake Bentley, JR*** - 13 games, 13 starts, completed 245 of 394 passes (62.2%) for 2,794 yards with 18 TDs and 12 INTs, added 85 yards rushing and led the team with 6 rushing TDs in ’17; 7 games, 7 starts, completed 125 of 190 passes (65.8%) with 9 TDs and 4 INTs; 4*

**Bailey Hart, RS SO** - reserve walk-on

**Jay Ulrich, RS FR** - redshirt in ’17; 3*

**Darius Douglas, RS FR** - reserve walk-on

**Dakereon Joyner, FR** - EE; 4*, SC’s “Mr. Football” in ‘17

**Corbett Glick, FR** - reserve walk-on

**Position summary:**  Jake Bentley has started the last 20 games for Carolina and owns a 13-7 record.  He was the only QB to attempt a pass last season.  Michael Scarnecchia sits comfortably in the number 2 position on the depth chart but shouldn’t expect to see too much work, if any.  Jay Ulrich began spring practice with the 3rd team while highly touted freshman Dakereon Joyner worked with the 4th team.  Joyner, a dual threat player, could see snaps in certain packages that would allow him to get outside the pocket.

**Key position battle(s):**  QB2. If Joyner is able to transition to the college game quickly enough to make an impact he could take the backup role from Scarnecchia. 

**- Running Backs -**

**Key stat(s):**  South Carolina averaged 122.2 rushing yards a game last season (111th nationally) with a 3.92 ypc average.

**Caleb Kinlaw, RS SR** - 12 games, 4 carries for 47 yards in ’17; transfer from Pearl River C.C., 6 games, 34 carries for 150 yards and 1 TD in ’16; transfer from Wisconsin, 1 game, 7 carries for 30 yards, 1 receiving TD in ’15; redshirt in ’14; 3*

**A.J. Turner, RS JR** - 13 games, 6 starts, led the team with 98 carries for 531 yards and 3 TDs, 18 catches for 117 yards in ’17; 12 games, 4 starts, 116 carries for 497 yards and 3 TDs, 21 catches for 143 yards and 1 TD in ’16; redshirt in ’15; 3*

**Mon Denson, RS JR** - 13 games, 41 carries for 152 yards and 2 TDs, 1 catch for 4 yards in ’17; reserve in '16; redshirt in ’15; 3*

**Ty’Son Williams, RS JR** - 12 games, 3 starts, 95 carries for 471 yards and 1 TD, 12 catches for 32 yards and 1 TD in ’17; redshirt in ’16; transfer from North Carolina, 2 games, 19 carries for 57 yards in ’15; 4*

***Rico Dowdle, JR*** - 8 games, 4 starts, 66 carries for 251 yards and 2 TDs, 11 catches 128 yards and 1 TD in ’17; 9 games, 7 starts, led the team with 133 carries for 764 yards and 6 TDs, 15 catches for 55 yards and 1 TD in ’16; 3*

**Slade Carroll, RS FR** - reserve walk-on

**Deshaun Fenwick, FR** - EE; 3*

**Lavonte Valentine, FR** - EE; 3*

**Position summary:** Though the running back position is quite deep, without a true identity heading into 2018, it seems likely the Gamecocks will have to take a running back by committee approach. Rico Dowdle is the figured starter if one had to be named, though he suffered a leg injury last season that caused him to miss the last 4 games of the regular season. He returned in the bowl game against Michigan and had 6 carries for 45 yards with a touchdown. A.J. Turner and Ty’Son Williams both started multiple games last season as well and posted similar rushing numbers. Both are right there with Dowdle to compete for the majority of snaps. Lavonte Valentine was the 2017 Florida 4A state champion in the 100-meter dash, and his speed could help him see the field sooner rather than later.

**Key position battle(s):** RB1. Running backs coach Bobby Bentley is hoping one of Dowdle, Tuner, and Williams can separate themselves from the pack and become the featured back.

**- Wide Receivers -**

***Deebo Samuel, RS SR*** - Selected as preseason 1st team All-SEC at receiver, all-purpose back, and return specialist for 2018; 3 games, 3 starts, 15 catches for 250 yards and 3 TDs, 2 carries for 30 yards and 1 TD, 2 kick returns for TDs in ’17; 10 games, 10 starts, led the team with 59 catches and 783 yards with 1 TD, 15 carries for 98 yards and 6 TDs, 1 kick return for TD, 1 passing TD in ’16; 5 games, 3 starts, 12 catches for 161 yards and 1 TD in 15; redshirt in ’14; 3*

***Bryan Edwards, JR*** - 13 games, 13 starts, led the team with 64 catches, 793 yards, and 5 TDs in ’17; 12 games, 12 starts, 44 catches for 590 yards and 4 TDs in ’16; EE; 4*

**Tyquan Johnson, FR** - 3*

**Position summary:** Getting Deebo Samuel back healthy for 2018 is huge for this offense and the team. His 6 total touchdowns in just 10 full quarters of work last year was tied for most on the team and he was on his way to a Heisman-esque season. However, his injury did have a silver lining as it forced some young guys, OrTre Smith and Shi Smith, to step up and make an impact in Samuel's absence. The duo combined for 59 catches, 735 yards, and 6 TDs and will look to continue with that momentum heading into 2018. Bryan Edwards was a four star recruit coming into Carolina and has lived up to his billing thus far, leading the team in catches, yards, and touchdowns in 2017, on top of his great freshman season campaign. The wide receiver corp should be the strongest position group on the team this upcoming year thanks to the talent and quality of depth.  

**- Tight Ends -**

***Jacob August, RS SR*** - 13 games, 3 starts, 6 catches for 68 yards in ’17; 13 games, 1 start, 5 catches for 52 yards in ’16; 5 games, 3 starts, 4 catches for 38 yards and 1 TD in ’15; redshirt in ’14; walk-on

***K. C. Crosby, RS SR*** - 7 games, 1 start, 2 catches for 11 yards in ’17; 13 games, 9 starts, 23 catches for 217 yards and 4 TDs in ’16; 10 games in ’15; medical redshirt in ’14; 4*

**Kyle Markway, RS JR** - 2 games in ’17; redshirt in ’16; 12 games, 1 start, 3 catches for 57 yards in ’15; 3*

**Evan Hinson, RS SO** - 13 games in ’17; redshirt in ’16; also a member of the USC basketball team; 3*

**Will Register, RS FR** - redshirt in ’17; 3*

**Caleb Jenerette, RS FR** - reserve walk-on

**Patrick Reedy, FR** - reserve walk-on

**Position summary:**  Even with the departure of Hayden Hurst, the tight end position is fairly deep for 2018. K.C Crosby and Jacob August have 17 starts between them and should continue to be the top options at the position. Crosby had a great 2016 season but dealt with some injuries this past year. He's more of a down field receiving threat while August was used primarily as a blocking TE last year which will allow both to see the field.  Kyle Markway is similar to August in that he’s a traditional block-first TE and should be a reliable backup. Kiel Pollard and Evan Hinson were both used extensively on special teams last year and will need to continue to compete for snaps at TE.  Will Register will have the opportunity to show what he can do and see if he can make an impact.

**- Offensive Line -**

**Key stat(s):**  In 2017 the Gamecocks gave up 29 sacks, 6th most in the SEC and 9 different players started along the line.  

**Tackle, Malik Young, RS SR** - 5 games, 4 starts in ’17; 13 games, 9 starts in ’16; 3 games in ’15; redshirt in ’14; 3*

**OL, Dylan Wonnum, FR** - 4*

**Position summary:** For the most part, the starting 5 along the offensive line seem to be set. Dennis Daley started the last 10 games of the regular season at left tackle and will continue to hold the position in 2018. Blake Camper will man the right tackle spot and has 4 starts in his career. Zack Bailey is the anchor of the line with 26 starts under his belt and will move back to his natural position at left guard, while Sadarius Hutcherson, a top reserve player last year, will start at right guard. Donell Stanley should get the start at center, though he has no in-game experience at the position  After the first 5 however the depth chart becomes a little murky, as there is very little experience along the line. Malik Young is the only other player to have started a game, and there are 9 freshman (true and redshirt) that will compete to earn a spot on the 2-deep. Dylan Wonnum, younger brother to defensive lineman Dennis ""D.J."" Wonnum, is one of a couple freshman that could make a quick impact.

**Key position battle(s):** RG1 and backups for each position. Hutcherson is perhaps the 'weak link' on the line so it’s possible someone else is able to take the RG position from him.  With so little experience beyond just a few players, the 2 deep is open for any player that can step up in camp. Out of the 19 scholarship players, 9 have yet to play a snap.

**DEFENSE**

Last year the defense gave up 367.1 yards per game (7th in the SEC and 44th in the country) and 20.7 points per game (5th SEC, 25th nationally). USC led the SEC and was 9th in the country in turnovers forced with 28 (14 fumbles, 14 interceptions). 6 starters return. 

**Returning production:** 

Tackles: 56.2%

Tackles for loss: 65.6%

Sacks: 65.3%

Interceptions: 57.1%

**Key losses:**  DE Dante Sawyer, DT Taylor Stallworth, LB Skai Moore, CB Jamarcus King, S D.J. Smith, and DB Chris Lammons

**Key returners:**  BUCK D.J. Wonnum, LB Bryson Allen-Williams, LB T.J. Brunson, CB Rashad Fenton, and DB Jamyest Williams

**Top newcomers:** DT Rick Sandidge, CB Jaycee Horn, DL Kingsley Enagbare, LB Rosendo Louis, CB Nick Harvey (transfer)

   **- Defensive Line -**

**Key stat(s):** South Carolina allowed 142 rushing yards a game. The defensive line accounted for 18 sacks last season.

**DT/DE, Javion Duncan, RS SR** - 1 game in '17; reserve in '16; did not participate in '15; transfer from The Citadel in '14

**DT, Rick Sandidge, FR** - 4*

**DE, Tyreek Johnson, FR** - 3*

**DT, Jesus Gibbs, FR** - 3*

**Position summary:** The defensive line is headlined by BUCK D.J. Wonnum, last year's leader in tackles for loss and sacks. Also returning are starters Keir Thomas and Javon Kinlaw at the defensive tackle spots. Aaron Sterling seems poised to take over the End position, though he is more of pass rush specialist so it’s likely Thomas could scoot to the outside and Kobe Smith come in as the tackle on most downs.  Brad Johnson, Jabari Ellis, and Shameik Blackshear all figure to earn significant rotational snaps at their respective positions. Rick Sandidge was the highest rated player from the 2018 recruiting class and looks to make an impact at defensive tackle. Kinglsey Enagbare is a 4* from the 2018 class that could carve out a role as well. Javion Duncan, Tyreek Johnson, M.J. Webb, and Jesus Gibbs will compete to earn snaps as well provide depth. 

One area Muschamp would like to see improvement on the defensive side of the ball is [rushing the passer with four guys.](https://www.thestate.com/sports/college/university-of-south-carolina/usc-football/article215592365.html) The defensive line this year will be a little smaller overall, but should have better speed than the past couple of years. “What’s the one thing we need to take a step forward in defensively?” Muschamp said. “We need to rush four guys better. We need to affect the quarterback by rushing four guys."" 

**Key position battle(s):** DE. Sterling seems to be the leader right now however it would not come as a shock to see Blackshear start game 1. Blackshear has more experience and came in as a highly rated player but has yet to live up to his billing due to injuries.

**- Linebackers -**

***OLB, Bryson Allen-Williams, RS SR*** - 3 games, 3 starts, 10 tackles, 3 tfl, 2 sacks, 1 INT in '17; received medical redshirt; 13 games, 7 starts, 75 tackes, 8.5 tfl, 2 sacks, 2 INTs in '16; 12 games, 1 start, 23 tackles, 3.5 tfl, 1 INT in '15; 12 games, 2 starts, 27 tackles, 2.5 tfl in '14; 4*

**LB Sean McGonigal, RS FR** - reserve walk-on

**OLB, Rosendo Louis Jr, FR** - EE; 4* 

**OLB, Ernest Jones, FR** - EE; 3*

**Position summary:** Bryson Allen-Williams, the team's leading tackler in 2016, returns after playing just 3 games last season due to an injury suffered against Kentucky.  He and T.J. Brunson serve as leaders of the defense. Daniel Fennell and Sherrod Greene are the only other players to have earned a start last year and will need to be ready to take on larger roles.  Eldridge Thompson, Damani Staley, and Rosendo Louis all look to provide valuable depth.

**Key position battle(s):** OLB, opposite Allen-Williams. Greene and Fennell are both in competition to lock down the 3rd starting linebacker position. 

**- Secondary -**

**Key stat(s):** The Gamecocks gave up 226 yards through the air last year per game and opposing quarterbacks completed 58.9% of their passes with 14 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. In addition to the 14 interceptions the SC defense had 55 pass break ups (3rd SEC, 19th nationally)

***CB, Nick Harvey, RS SR*** - Redshirt in '17; transfer from Texas A&amp;M; 38 games, 13 starts, 109 tackles, 4.5 tfl, 14 PBU, 1 INT in 3 seasons from '14-'16; 4*

**CB, Jaycee Horn, FR** - 4* 

**S, R.J. Roderick, FR** - 3*

**S, Jonathan Gipson, FR** - 3*

**DB, Dawson Hoffman, FR** - walk-on

**Position summary:** The biggest unknown heading into 2018 is the secondary. There are plenty of questions from the group that saw the departure of three 2017 starters. Only 2 players, Jamyest Williams and Rashad Fenton, started 6 or more games last year for Carolina. They both seem likely to start at the safety and cornerback spots, respectively.  Also penciled in as a starter is Keisean Nixon at Nickel. Nick Harvey, a grad transfer from Texas A&amp;M, provides SEC starting experience and will likely play opposite Fenton at CB.  Steven Montac will also play extensively, if not start, at safety, as he saw significant playing time last year and started 6 games the year prior. Israel Mukuamu and Jaycee Horn seem to be the most poised to take back-up snaps at corner while Jaylan Foster, a talented FCS transfer that's now had a year in the program, and Tavyn Jackson should provide depth.  Rice grad transfer J.T. Ibe should see the bulk of rotational snaps at safety and Jaylin Dickerson could also prove vital at the role, as he might have started last season had he not suffered an injury that required him to redshirt. Javon Charleston played primarily special teams after converting to safety from wide receiver in 2016 and will provide some help at the position if called upon. R.J. Roderick, Zay Brown, and Jonathan Gipson are all younger guys that will look to gain experience and playing time as the season goes on.  Korey Banks is another former wide receiver turned DB and hopes are that he can contribute sooner rather than later.

**Key position battle(s):** CB2 and Safety. One positive to note about the secondary this year is the versatility of some of the players. Jamyest Williams for example started at nickel last season but will move to safety. He'll be competing with Jaylin Dickerson and Steven Montac. Keisean Nixon could see some time at corner opposite Fenton though his best role is Nickel. Nick Harvey could take the CB2 position and not look back, as he has the talent and experience for it.

**- Specialists -**

**LS, Ben Asbury, RS SR** - 13 games in '17; reserve in '16; walk-on, redshirt in '15; transfer from Berry College, 3 games in '14

***P, Joseph Charlton, RS JR*** - Selected as preseason 2nd-team All-SEC for 2018; 55 punts, 43.5 avg, long of 73 in ’17; reserve in ’16; redshirt in ‘15

**K/P, Michael Almond, RS JR** - 1 game in '17; 1 game in '16; redshirt in '15

**K, Will Tommie, RS JR** - redshirt in ’17; transfer from Tusculum; 18/29 on FGs, 52/59 on PATs in 2 seasons at Tusculum

***K, Parker White, RS SO*** - 14/25 on FGs, 26/26 on PATs, 44 touchbacks in ’17; walk-on

**K, Alexander Woznick, RS SO** - 1/3 on FGs, 10/11 on PATs in ’17; redshirt in ‘16

**LS, Matthew Smith, RS FR** - walk-on reserve

**Position summary:** Last year the kicking game struggled as the team went just 15/28 on field goals. Alexander Woznick started the first 3 games but was eventually replaced by Parker White in the 4th game against Louisiana Tech, where he hit a game-winning 31 yard field goal. White again looks to be the one to handle all kicking duties but is still competing with Woznick and Will Tommie, a transfer who is now eligible to see the field for Carolina.  White was almost automatic under 40 yards (10/11) but just 4/14 outside. Joseph Charlton is a solid punter that had 15 punts land inside the 20, with only 4 touchbacks. Ben Asbury will once again handle all long snapping duties.  Danny Gordon serves as the holder on all FGs and PATs. Deebo Samuel will handle kick return duties as he did last year where he returned two kicks 97 yards for touchdowns, and as Muschamp has stated, ""we don't plan on fair catching any"".

**Key position battle(s):** Kicker. and punt returner. For now the kicking duties are White's to lose. He finished out the season strong, hitting 11/15 field goals with all 4 misses coming beyond 45 yards. Though if he struggles like he did earlier in the year he could lose his job to Woznick or Tommie. Punt returner is a position up for grabs through camp.

Nov. 17 **UT Chattanooga**  - First ever meeting

Nov. 24  @ **Clemson**  - 115 meetings, CU leads 69-4-42, last meeting CU won 34-10 in 2017

The first half of the schedule sets up nicely with just two away games in the first 2 months of the season. A visit from Georgia on September 8th brings perhaps the toughest challenge of the season, but will provide a great measuring stick for Carolina going forward. The 'Dawgs lost some great talent to the NFL draft including their dynamic running back duo of Nick Chubb and Sony Michel and all-world linebacker Roquan Smith. Of course, they're at the point now where they reload, not rebuild. Getting them at home and early in the year certainly favors Carolina. Whoever wins will have a huge leg up in the SEC East race.

The first away game comes in week 4 against Vanderbilt. The last time USC played in Nashville it was Muschamp's first game as the Gamecock's head coach and he earned his first win thanks to a 55 yard field goal in the final minute. USC owns a 9 game win streak over the Commodores.  

The very next week USC takes on Kentucky in Lexington, who has a 4 game win streak against the Gamecocks. Benny Snell could be the best running back in the league and the Carolina defense has to be able to slow him down. This is very much a toss-up game and is a very important test for both teams going into the rest of the season as both programs are on the rise.

South Carolina gets Missouri and Texas A&amp;M at home before reaching the bye week. Last season the Gamecock defense was able to stifle Missouri's #1 scoring offense in the SEC to just 13 points (well below their 37.1 ppg avg), but the Tigers bring back 1st team All-SEC senior QB Drew Lock and their dangerous offense could provide problems for South Carolina's young secondary. USC has yet to beat Texas A&amp;M in four tries but the Aggies are in a regime change with the firing of Kevin Sumlin and bringing in Jimbo Fisher as the new man in charge. This seems as good a year as any for the Gamecocks to change the tide and get their first win against 'rival' Texas A&amp;M.

After the much needed bye Carolina is back home to face the Volunteers, who Will Muschamp has never lost to as a head coach. Tennessee and new head coach Jeremy Pruitt host Alabama the week before so the Vols could be limping into Columbia, after an emotional rivalry game. 

SC travels to the Grove for the first time since 2008, to take on an Ole Miss team that will be playing only for pride. After a tumultuous Hugh Freeze reign, the Rebels are looking for stability and leadership under Matt Luke, who faces an uphill battle. The last time USC and Ole Miss faced off was in 2009 in Columbia where the Gamecocks upset the #4 Rebels on national TV. The game is fondly remembered as [the birth of Sandstorm.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6aGnpEXcCI)

Will Muschamp returns to Gainesville for the 2nd time, having lost the first game 20-7. If the Gamecocks win in 2018 it would be just the programs third win ever in the Swamp.  The Gators are third team in four games that Carolina will face with a new coach. Dan Mullen returns to Florida after a successful tenure at Mississippi State.

Carolina finishes its regular season, like it has 115 times prior, against in-state rival Clemson. The Tigers are looking to pay back USC for its 5 game win streak from 2009-13, and they're just 1 game away from matching. Unless something crazy were to happen between now and November 24th it unfortunately looks like quite the long shot that Carolina can come away with an upset.  

I believe the games can be separated into 3 tiers:

Tier one - should wins

[Coastal Carolina](#f/coastalcarolina)[Marshall](#f/marshall)[C](#f/c)

Tier two - toss ups

[Vanderbilt](#f/vanderbilt)[Kentucky](#f/kentucky) [Missouri](#f/missouri) [Texas A&amp;M](#f/texasam)[T](#f/t)[Ole Miss](#f/olemiss) [Florida](#f/florida) 

Tier three - likely losses

[G](#f/g) [Clemson](#f/clemson)

How Carolina performs against the middle tier teams will define the season.  
____

**Miscellaneous:**

* South Carolina led the SEC and was 9th in the country in penalties per game, averaging just 4.8 penalties for 38 yards. Interestingly enough, Muschamp's Gators finished 14th, 14th, 14th, and 13th in conference in his 4 years as head coach from 2011-14.  

* Under Will Muschamp, the Gamecocks are 10-3 in one possession games including a 6-1 mark last season.

* Despite giving up 180 plays of 10+ yards (11th in the SEC, 74th in the country), the defense only allowed 43 of those to go past 20 yards (2nd SEC, 10th nationally) and just 16 to go past 30 yards (2nd SEC, 4th nationally).

* Academically, South Carolina's football graduation rate is [tops in the SEC](https://www.thestate.com/sports/college/university-of-south-carolina/usc-football/article211114254.html) at 98% (Vanderbilt is 2nd with 90%) and tied for 4th nationally, behind only Harvard, Northwestern, &amp; Dartmouth. ""We finished first in the SEC in graduation rate,"" Muschamp said. ""We have finished, in the last two years, first in the country for African-American football players’ graduation rate."" At SEC Media Days Muschamp also had this to say, ""We represent 27 different majors on our campus on our football team. That's impressive. I worked at some institutions in this league that had about two.""

93czhq,25,2018-07-31,Typical Rates for Game Dev Professionals,MassiveStallion,gameDevClassifieds,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/93czhq/typical_rates_for_game_dev_professionals/,"Let's start this off. I imagine there might be more than a few brawls over this information, so I'm just gonna post what I know personally, I'll edit based on what the results are.

# Professionals Only

This list is only for professionals or professionals in training. That means someone who has decided to make a career out of the given task and that task is their primary means of making a living. The clearest would be that person has a degree in a relevant field, but they also might have experience, a portfolio or other nonstandard indicators as well.

# Game Budgets

We typically classify the size of a game by budget.

**Indie: 0-$200k**

Indie games can be made on the personal savings of one person or a small group of people. A small team of 1-10 people typically being underpaid or paid in revenue share.

*CupHead, Rimworld, Terraria.*

**""AA"" Indie or ""Big Indie"": $200k- $2m**

These are games supported by a popular Kickstarter along with outside funding. Typically they are follow-up games for a studio that has had an ""indie hit"". Usually a team of 1-10 people being paid industry standard for their level of of experience. Whether this tier is ""indie"" or not is in contention.

*Skull Girls, Pillars of Eternity, Battletech.*

**AAA Mid Size: $2m-$10m**

A typical third party AAA release with 1-100 people. Likely involves a management hierarchy of multiple teams reporting to a lead developer.

*XCom, DOOM, Sonic the Hedgehog*

**AAA Blockbuster: $10m+**

Flagship franchises for a mid size company like Bethesda or part of a division in Nintendo or Sony.

*Skyrim, Witcher 3, Zelda*

**AAA Mega Blockbuster/MMO: $100m+**

These are the flagship properties of the biggest companies, usually ones listed on the stock exchange like Blizzard/Activision, EA or Take2.

*World of Warcraft, GTA5, EVE Online*

# Software Engineer Rates (As of 7/31/2018)

*These prices are all at AAA/Google rates for developers based in NYC/SF*

They are done in *Total Compensation*, which includes benefits like insurance, nerf guns, gym memberships, free food, et al.  Contractors will charge more because they won't get those benefits, lose out on regular work, and have to pay additional taxes.

The actual salary varies by cost of living per region and other reasons. Government and startups typically pay less.

This is the typical rate for a software engineer based on my own anecdotal experience and what I've heard from r/cscareerquestions. It varies based on accomplishments, schooling, specialization, etc.

**C-Level: $500k+**

The upper limit here is Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. The more typical example is someone who runs a successful 3rd party developer like Avalanche or a Director Of Technology at say EA Games.

**VP/Middle Manager Level: $300k - $500k**

Someone who runs an entire division or takes charge of a franchise or product. The lead on Starcraft or DOOM.

**Senior Level, 5-10+ years: $150k - $300k, $80-$200/hr**

A senior level developer has built many applications from top to bottom and requires no direction. Senior devs can typically do the work of 5-10 lower level devs. Capable of building a small game by themselves. Typical seniors devs have management experience and lead teams to create mid size games , or lead a division for a huge game. The alternative path is a ""staff"" developer who is basically a code ninja, but might not have the social skills or desire to lead a team.

**Mid Level, 2-4 years: $100k - $150k, $50-$100/hr**

A mid level dev has been working for a few years and capable of working on a team. They might be talented in a particular language or framework and can produce professional level results given good direction. For the most part they can be trusted to work independently and are reliable freelancers.

**Junior Level, 0-2 years: $70k-$125k, $30-$50/hr**

Junior devs are straight out of college, or even still in college. Finding a talented junior developer to make the next PUBG or Facebook is the dream. Typically though, juniors require a lot of supervision and will be mostly learning on the job. Hiring one as a sole developer is a gamble. They work best paired with a senior engineer as part of a larger team.

**Budget Level, 0 years: $0-$70k, Min Wage-$30/hr.**

The typical indie rate. The ideal is someone who believes so much in what you're doing they are willing to trade money for opportunity. You should supplement this sort of pay with revenue share and rights. This sort of arrangement should be temporary until the product is creating revenue.

For reference, a paid intern typically gets \~20/hr in NYC. Duties include taking out the garbage, getting coffee, and other chores in addition to doing actual programming.

**Product/Service Level**

A number of companies offer gamedev services or products at a lower cost than hiring a junior developer. These companies have developed tool chains or processes that makes the production of a certain type of game or app (Candy Crush, Subway Surfers) very easy. If you're looking for a reskin or a slight twist on an existing game, this is probably your best bet.

**A note on indie/startup pricing:** In the indie world, software engineers often make the trade off of giving up a larger salary to work on something they are passionate about.

If you aren't paying them an industry rate, then you need to pay them in flexibility. This is often some combination of authority, creative freedom, revenue share, and making their own hours.

It must be a wonderful learning experience"" ""Come along now, It is not every day that your queen pays for your education""


Kinzie was getting real sick and tired of that king and queen by this point. The pair were Luddites, they had no clue what went into magic and they outlawed necromancy, Kinzie's one speciality, in their city. And yet time and time again her little back alley store of the occult and necromantic arts always got a visit from them. At first it was fun, of course it would be, but now they are getting a little too involved. Too much meddling and next thing she knew she was basically the royal witch. And now with so many jobs being sent by those two they fear that their witch may not have the best education possible in her own art. 


They sent out requests for anyone who could teach their witch, despite her clear protests against this idea, and that evil bitch replied. Genuinely the epitome of what an evil queen of an empire could look like was to be her mentor. She used her cruel evil magic to take over city after city after city and now Kinzie was an intern for this bitch. This was the kind of woman that the king and queen would send their champion on a quest to kill, but now Kinzie was working for free under her. 


She spent days upon days sorting old dusty spell tomes, drawing runes so that that bitch didn't have to, every boring part of sorcery. But one day something changed. Turns out this evil queen had scrying charms on all of her dark knights, which meant that time when Kinzie fucked that big hung futa knight... She was watching. Not only was this severely embarrassing, now she knew about Kinzie's depraved and sadistic ass. But when Kinzie thought she was going to be mocked, humiliated, or something to that effect but no. She was taken to a door and stopped outside. 


""Kinzie, We both know I saw everything you did last night""


""Yeah... Let me guess you are go-""


""I couldn't be more proud of you. When I was your age I was too scared to hurt a fly""


""Uh... how old do you think I am?""


""Never mind that elf, there are more important matters at hand. Another attempt on my life was committed and those responsible are behind this door. I am entrusting you to show them what happens when you cross me. I will give you one chance to do this, do it right or end up in their position""


Well, it looked like kinzie had her work cut out for her


Thanks for reading this far! I have left whatever is on the other side of that door ambiguous so you can decide exactly what kind of character you want to play. You could play one adventurer tasked with bringing down the evil queen, now meeting a bad ending at the hands of Kinzie, or a whole party of adventurers. You could be anyone from a toned orc barbarian to a thick milf cleric of the church. I love a big huge cock and am a major size queen but I am willing to play with regular women too. As well as that Kinzie could definitley cast a little incantation to give one of those adventurers a cock. I am open to plenty ideas including characters and how the scenario will play out. I am both interested in short and long term roleplays and could do Either with ease. Understand coming into this however, that despite Kinzie's size, she is a dominant girl at heart. She is super kinky and a pretty on the sadistic side when it came down to it.

Kinzie, my character, Is something of a recluse. With long black hair and green eyes under forrest green robes, the girl was very petite. Her chest was flat, her build was small, but at least she had a cute butt, it was just about her best asset. Tight, perky, and round, it brought her a little bit of joy any time she saw people looking on. She only stood at about 5'3"" but she managed to make up for her small stature with her prowess in handling those she summoned from the underworld.

93e5wx,45,2018-07-31,"Visiting family doesn't need to be ""fun""",Pumpkingpin,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/93e5wx/visiting_family_doesnt_need_to_be_fun/,"Avid reader of this sub, but first time poster so... hi. Wish I didn't have to be here!

Me and my brothers grew up in heavy FOG. It was normal for us so we had no idea this wasn't the case. You see my mom is all about faaamily and holidays are obligations, and if you cannot attend for any reason it's time for some extreme guilt. She recently admitted visiting family doesn't need to always be ""fun"", sometimes you need to put your own feelings aside to make someone else (her, *she means her.*) happy. Now this never seemed a problem until I got an SO who opened my eyes and some wonderful IL's, more family! But then ones I like spending time with!

My mom is very self centered, passive-agressive, vindictive, a know-it-all and desperately needs a hobby that is not her kids, guilt tripping, wallowing in self pity or comparing us with other people (""who spend much more time with their mom!""). I rewrote this post so many times, changing the subject from my mom and my poor feelings of self-worth, to my mom and death, incessant meddling and more. But first I'd like to share some anecdotes I've gathered over the years about holidays and vacations. The rest will come later.

My IL's wanted to take the family to go skiing. Awesome! But this was during new years. So my mom immediately got CBF when she heard and said we should spend both christmas days at her place then, or it wouldn't be ""fair"". We didn't.

My SO wanted to take me on a vacation to Paris during christmas. This is time for faaamily so that's a CBF right there. However, my SO convinced me I needed a passport for Paris now (as a EU resident, I don't. But I'm gullible). Leading up to that vacation I was staying at my parents a few days a week for an internship. Me and mom got in a fight over something stupid, I went to bed upset, but she wasn't done with me yet and came in screamcrying some more. I remember it like it was yesterday when she said ""Maybe I'll tell you the surprise SO has for your vacation."". She didn't, but I was devestated nonetheless that she'd stoop so low. Me and my SO were heavily hyping eachother over our christmas gifts for eachother. But you see, my SO asked their help in how to convince me to get a passport, because you *do* need one for New *flipping* York! And she wanted to ruin that for us?

During other vacations my mom was always a bit upset we asked our IL's to take care of our two ferrets. Now my mom always complained about their smell, how they're not very interactive pets, and how it's a lot of work to clean them, and they have a big cage... But okay we asked them for one vacation to take care of them and they said they would. Great!

But upon return my mom is an ""expert"" on ferrets with a lot of unwanted and often wrong advice. And it was again made out to be such a great hassle to have taken care of them and we should be so thankful. So our IL's take care of our pets during vacations again, because they are just happy to help.

And lastly, there's the fact that if you go on vacation you need to visit them sometime right before that so she can say goodbye to her children. Sounds fair enough right? But my brother and his SO proved that this is expected regardless of whether you have time or not. Because then they haven't seen you in X time!

Did I mention she keeps count? It seems to be one of her hobbies. To count when she last saw/spoke to you last. And how many days you spend with either family. And hold all this (inaccurate) information over your head to make a point how you should call/visit more and how you love your IL's more than her and it's making her very sad and disappointed in you.

I've got many more stories and some VERY nasty behaviours I'd like to share with you (a lovely sneak peek: ""I don't even recognize my daughter anymore!"" to my face, when I told her I'm depressed). I'm hoping for some insight in how to handle my mom. I'm still hoping we can have a normal relationship one day. But I don't know how to make her see that it's her own toxic behaviour that's keeping us kids away. And hell, even without that we don't go visit our IL's very often either!"
93edlc,2,2018-07-31,"What's more important, 401k match or personal savings?",the_bagel_warmonger,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/93edlc/whats_more_important_401k_match_or_personal/,"Hey guys, quick question on savings philosophy. My organization has a 100% 401k match up to 10% of salary, which is fantastic, but it also means I have to defer a lot of money each paycheck. I'm currently deferring 10% (roth) to get the match, but as a result we really aren't able to save   each month.

My girlfriend is currently an unpaid intern, so we're a single income household at the moment. I make 40k, but we live in DC, so that doesn't go very far. We were lucky enough to get a rent controlled apartment, so our rent is only 1100, but that's still half of my monthly pay. We also pay for utilities, which come to about 200. So our monthly housing costs are about 1300 or 58% of my take home salary.

We don't really have any designated emergency fund. We do have a cash buffer of  about 6.7k which is budgeted towards the next month and a half's expenses (I use YNAB to budget) so we wouldn't immediately sink if I lost my job, but it still feels precarious. 

My girlfriend also unfortunately has 2k in credit card debt that I didn't know about previously, so we are working on paying that off this month. Other than that we aren't putting on revolving credit card debt to survive, we just aren't able to save and are essentially paycheck to paycheck.

If all goes well I will get promoted to a 50k position at the end of the year and my girlfriend will get a job next September (when she graduates law school), but those are tenuous at best.

Do you think we should bump down that 401k contribution to build up an emergency fund? Or do you think we are okay to keep treading water like this until she gets a job as well?

Edit: I'm 23 and am still in school for my Master's. I'll probably graduate either next spring or next summer. There may be an additional promotion after my graduation, but a position would have to open up or I'd have to switch organizations, so I'm not counting on it."

I am an Online student studying Software Engineering, and I also work a full time job. I know that most students are expected to get an internship at some point during their studies, but I just don't see how I will have time to fit that in around my job. Is an internship something that is viewed as a big plus when it comes to getting a job after the degree is finished? Or will the fact that I have been working full time while studying at least count for something? I know that all companies have different views and can even offer part-time internships, but I doubt there are a great deal that offer weekend internships since my time is occupied Monday-Friday.

If anyone has any experience with this and can give feedback I would be very grateful as it is quite a big concern for me at the moment."

I’ve recently posted on here about a week ago asking for suggestions regarding what sort of data to explore for my current internship assignment as HR “equity” analyst (more like human capital data analyst). I received some positive comments and advice from fellow users and couldn’t have been more pleased with the feedback. 

I am now posting again because my supervisor has recently asked me to pitch my idea of opening up an analytics subunit within the HR systems unit under the office of HCM for the city govt. I am very new to this field and I am no expert (don’t know where to begin). Therefore, I am struggling to understand how I can pitch my idea of creating a job position in HR analytics that can benefit the “nonprofit” agency. I know how it can benefit the organization, but I am struggling to understand how I can sell that idea to management. 

I remember seeing some examples of HR analytics presentations/templates, and was wondering if anyone knew how to find those online. I tried searching for some examples, but some PPT that I found were too sloppy. I just want to get an idea of a decent PPT in HR analytics and how other professionals have pitched their ideas to win over the support of top management. 

Thank you. "

93f790,33,2018-07-31,I think I figured out how Horikoshi structures the story of MHA,TheEnhancedExe,BokuNoHeroAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/93f790/i_think_i_figured_out_how_horikoshi_structures/,"I've had this in my head for quite a while, but felt like I was missing sth until I realized sth today.

Basically, Horikoshi has been using similar arc themes throughout the whole story so far. Shouldn't be a surprise at first given the obvious similarities between for example the Stain Arc and the Overhaul Arc. 

For those of you unaware, Boku no Hero Academia currently has two sagas, the U.A. Beginnings Saga, stretching all the way up to the Hideout Raid Arc, and the Rise of Villains Saga which is the current ongoing saga. Tbf, these names are all fanmade as far as I know, but it looks like the way Horikoshi intended to structure the story. I will refer to them as part 1 and part 2 from now on.

I went into it deeper though and noticed that every single arc so far has been part of reoccuring arc themes. Basically every arc in part 2 has a counterpart in part 1. So let's dive into this:

Sports Festival Arc - Cultural Festival Arc

Vs. Hero Killer Arc - Internship Arc

Final Exams Arc - Provisional Hero License Exam Arc

School Trip Arc/Hideout Raid Arc - Pro Hero Arc

(I left out the Remedial Course Arc, because I feel like Horikoshi didn't intend this to be its own arc, but rather in between arc stuff similar to Chapter 115 to 121. Because there are no clear cuts anywhere which Horikoshi usually does when he starts a new arc.)

Although you could argue that there is no equivalent to the School Trip Arc, I feel like the Pro Hero Arc may become the equivalent although it currently looks more like an equivalent to the Hideout Raid Arc. However, to me it feels like the Pro Hero Arc was just a build up for what's to come next. To me it looks like part 2 is about to end soon, however the latest two chapters looked more like build up for me rather than wrapping up sth. 

There are also a few similarities between the School Trip Arc and the Pro Hero Arc:

- the Pussycats and Kota appear for the first time in the Part 2

- the biggest one being the Dabi and Endeavour panel where Dabi refers to Endeavour as Enji Todoroki while he does the same with Shouto during the school trip arc

I feel like the Pro Hero Arc will end up being the counter part of the school trip arc in the sense that it will set up the final arc of part 2 which might start during the next chapters. This final arc will then probably end up being the counterpart to the Hideout Raid Arc. 

If I end up being wrong though and part 2 ends here, then the Pro Hero Arc probably is the counterpart to both the school trip arc and the hideout raid arc, given it shares similarities with both.



However let's continue since there's more stuff I haven't talked about yet.

Some of you might have noticed that I left out the USJ Arc and everything prior. The reason for that is because all arcs up until USJ were basically structured in the exact same way, although it's hard to notice in some cases. I will refer to all arcs up until USJ as the prologue from now on.

Entrance Exam Arc - Final Exam Arc - Provisional Hero License Exam Arc

No need to explain, since all three of them are exams.

Quirk Apprehension Test Arc - Sports Festival Arc - Cultural Festival Arc

The first one is no festival, but it is a competition in class 1-A that consists of sports. So it shares that part with the sports festival.

Battle Trial Arc - Stain Arc - Overhaul Arc

I think this is where many of you will disagree with me as there is no actual villain in the Battle Trial Arc. However what some of you might not remember is that Iida and Bakugou were playing villains. There's also to note that the story wasn't serious at that point in time. To me it looks like the prologue makes it seem as if there's nothing to worry about and everything is peaceful and easy to finally show with the USJ Arc that we were wrong about that.

Given the story wasn't serious at that point, Iida's impression of a villain looks more like the characters taking villains lightly. Especially given Iida since this is a very strong contrast to how he acts later during the Stain Arc. 

There's also to note that all Arcs during the Prologue are School Arcs unlike later where School Arcs and Villain Arcs are rotating. Horikoshi probably wanted to show that there's nothing to worry for students about in the first chapters. So the only chance for Horikoshi to make a counterpart to a Villain Arc was to make someone act as a villain.

USJ Arc - School Trip Arc / Hideout Raid Arc

Given that this is just the Prologue, the USJ Arc itself basically is the counterpart to both the School Trip Arc and the Hideout Raid Arc. Or since it came first, the two arcs are the counterpart to USJ. The School Trip Arc and Hideout Raid Arc may be two arcs, but they are tied together which is why I listed both here.
The USJ Arc acts as the climax to the Prologue just like the other two arcs are the climax of part 1. Since this is just a Prologue, it also explains why there is only one Arc. Horikoshi probably decided  to make the finale of each part into two arcs given that the parts are way longer than the prologue, so they need a bigger finale.


So now, what does it tell us about the future of the story.
First of all, there are three terms in japanese schools. 

The first goes from April to July, then there's break during August. This is where part 1 ended with the Hideout Raid Arc

The second one goes from September to December. We are in early December right now in the manga, so this goes to show that we're approaching the finale of part 2.

The third one goes from January to March. I'm assuming that this will probably be structured in a similar way to how it's been now. However I honestly don't think Horikoshi will keep repeating this same structure forever. He might only do it for the first year, but I honestly don't think he can keep up this structure throughout the whole manga.

As for how long the manga might be and what might possibly happen, I also have some things in mind. But you should check out this theory by /u/Shredjeep5 first:
https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/8njosh/horikoshis_mhastar_wars_plot_parallel_predicition/  

First of all, I've only watched the Star Wars movies when I was young, so I barely remember anything (probably should watch them again). If I'm wrong on some facts, please tell me.

Basically, there are lots of similarities with Star Wars. I think this should be of no surprise given the many locations named after Star Wars locations or class 1-B's play during the cultural festival. Horikoshi is well known for being a huge Star Wars fan which is why I think these parallels might actually happen. 

What I wanted to point out though that didn't come across that well in the theory I linked, is that Horikoshi is probably trying to make Boku no Hero Academia have three Episodes, similar to Star Wars. 

I don't take the three school years at U.A. as a reasoning because there will probably be less school arcs the closer we come to the series ending. I think, Horikoshi is probably not only getting inspired by Star Wars, but by lots of other movies as well. 

What I see happening is sth similar to Harry Potter where in their final year, Deku and the others won't be attending U.A. anymore. Horikoshi is also known as a big Harry Potter fan. Plus, I feel like the class 1-B play might actually represent what Horikoshi is doing with MHA in an abstract way: he is trying to put a lot of references and inspiration from different kind of stories into his own work and structures his story based on that. 

If he indeed structures his story based on other works of fiction like Star Wars and Harry Potter, then it might also be possible to tell when All Might will die. I think it will be inevitable that All Might dies and given that Obi-Wan dies during the first Star Wars movie, I think All Might might die during the third term of Deku's first year at U.A. There's also a slim chance that he might die during the climax of part 2, but tbh this would be too sudden because he didn't get much focus recently.

Edit: I realized quite a few more things and made a new theory that explains some inconsistencies of this one here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/93ombs/future_arcs_and_what_might_happen/"
93fq26,3,2018-07-31,"My [23F] boyfriend [26M] doesn’t want to study or get a job, spends all day on Reddit",decordetotaliter,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/93fq26/my_23f_boyfriend_26m_doesnt_want_to_study_or_get/,"Almost two years ago I moved to Europe to study. Less than a month after I arrived, I met this guy, I'll call him Nick. At first we were just FWB, we were both leaving very complicated relationships and we wanted to take things slowly. A year of that, we decided to actually be in a serious relationship. So far it’s been 10 months. 


From the beginning, we talked about what we wanted from our relationship and from each other so there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. We said we expected exclusivity, also said that we wanted to get married in the future and we both wanted to have kids after that. Save this info. 


Regarding my original financial situation: I sold my car to cover the 1st year of tuition and other expenses and my parents agreed to help me until I was able to find a job. I found a part-time job last December - after several months of dropping CVs and going to interviews - at a great international medical company as customer service.  Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with depression right after I got the job, so I ended up pausing University for 6 months. 


Having this job was a great experience, though the pay was not amazing, it was good enough to reduce my parent's help in 80% and I was able to move out from the cramped studio I was living and share an apartment with Nick. We decided we would be paying exactly the same amount we were before, but if we united forces we would be able to live in a nicer place. 


Nick's situation is not great. He's on the 5th year of a Nanoengineering program (the program is officially 3 years long), last semester he was only taking 4 classes and he passed only one of them. He is an English tutor to 2 students, so in general, he works 2-5 hours on the weekends. His mom pays him an allowance every month and that's how he pays for his share of the rent and other stuff. 


So the whole problem started happening 3 months ago when I learned that in order to apply for a Temporary Residence Permit here, I wouldn't be able to continue working (otherwise I'd have to apply as a worker, not a student). I had to decide if I'd like to finish University or if I'd like to continue working. I talked to Nick many times and we decided I'd leave my job and go back to studying full-time (12-18 classes each semester) and Nick would get a part-time job to help with the expenses I wouldn't be able to fully cover anymore. 


Two things happened in the meantime. Nick's family is really small. It used to be just him, mom, dad, grandma and grandpa. His grandmother passed away last Christmas and I think he took it very well, though he commented many times that he wanted to have a baby in a couple years because his grandfather is 92 already and he wanted him to meet and enjoy our kids. 


Right now I'm unemployed and though I applied for some positions, it's really hard to find night-shift jobs in this country and as an immigrant, I have even fewer job opportunities. Apart from that, if I'm going to finish University in 2020, I need to take at least 12 courses this year each semester and won't have much time for it. 


So though I'm willing to work, I can't. But Nick is the opposite, though he has plenty of opportunities to work, he doesn't want to. He's European, he's a national from the country I'm in, he's in a STEM course, he's also a native English speaker, he has so many opportunities, but he doesn't feel great about himself and doesn't have any motivation to do it.


We talked about his University status and he agreed that he wasn't doing much with it, he wasn't feeling great, so I recommended him to stop it for a year since he's not sure about it and try different internships and jobs to see how he feels about different careers. He agreed with me and he also got the approval of his mom. 


I'm freaking out a lot lately because I'm feeling alone. I'm feeling like he's not trying as hard as I am to get to that life that we talked about (marriage, children, etc). He spends all day on the internet, but he never looks for jobs. A couple of months ago I sent him some positions, he sent his CV to some of the companies and actually got 2 interviews and was accepted for both (!) but never followed up or gave up after seeing the reviews about them (one was a language school and the other one a laser company). 


After that, he never searched for anything and if I don't do it for him, I'm scared that he won't do it either. Everytime that we talk about it he's either completely quiet (which is weird since we talk a lot about everything), then he says he doesn't feel good about himself, he doesn't think he can do this kind of stuff (having a job) and he doesn't take any attitude to improve himself. 


I don't get why he's not interested in having his own money, in us being able to travel, in changing his 19-year-old car (his mom's car also), in saving up for a wedding or for a baby. I love him very much and he loves me too, he helped me through being here completely alone, far from everyone I know, he's my best friend and I don't want to give up on him, but I don't want to give up on the life we want for us as a couple. 

I want him to be better than just spending all day on Reddit. How do I motivate or help him get a job or find a focus in life? 


TL;DR: boyfriend spends all day on reddit, doesn’t study and has no interest in finding a job. how to change the situation? "

93fs2a,4,2018-07-31,First breakup,[deleted],BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/93fs2a/first_breakup/,"We dated for a year and a half, throughout the second semester of junior year and all of my senior year of high school and man I loved him so fucking much. I was always daydreaming about him, planning dates and fun things to do with him, doing shit for him. I drove him around a lot because his family didn’t have enough cars and I covered his meals a lot because he often didn’t have enough money. Not because I felt obligated to but because I wanted to - I wanted to spend that extra time with him.

I spent the summer after my junior year at an internship in a city 1,000 miles away from our hometown and he talked to me every night until 2 AM because I felt lonely. He even came to visit me at his own expense, which was a big deal because he doesn’t really come from a lot of money and works really hard for what he has. 

But when I came back, everything slowly seemed to change. I was having issues with anxiety and mood swings and I would call him or ask him to come over whenever I was feeling really down and he just got tired of it. He said he was uncomfortable when I cried and that it tired it out. I told him I would rely on other friends for emotional issues and he said he didn’t want that either. I resolved to just keep more to myself, which I progressively did more and more until the end of our relationship.

We started arguing more often too, about various things. He never seemed to want to have sex which made me frustrated and do and say things I’m really not proud of. I didn’t feel wanted or loved a lot of the time - he stopped planning dates, texting me first, wanting to hang out very much. We would hang out and he would just go on reddit for most of the time. I felt like I was constantly chasing someone who didn’t want me. I told him that, and he would say he would do more but then it wouldn’t happen. Or other times I would say something that upset me and he would just follow that with something I did and I would just apologize profusely, still remembering what I was upset about but feeling too guilty to bring it up again. He hardly ever apologized, and when he did, it was usually “I’m sorry you feel that way” instead of “I’m sorry for what I did to hurt you”. 

Fast forward to the past few weeks, we’ve been fighting all the time it seems like and at least on 3 separate occasions I said “please, if you want to end this just break up with me now to save me the pain” because he would say things like “I’m not sure about our relationship anymore” and it would drive me crazy. Like, are you going to break up with me or not? I felt so on edge and like I couldn’t bring up anything or he would cut it off. I was miserable, but I couldn’t bring myself to break up with him myself because I still loved him. He has been really stressed out and he helped me out when I needed it most so I wanted to try to be there for him. 

I thought maybe I just needed to be better at helping him with his problems but whenever I would genuinely ask him how he was doing he said he was fine, and then later he would admit during a fight that he wasn’t doing well at all. He would say he wanted to talk about something on x day and it would drive me crazy with anxiety waiting, because I didn’t know if we was gonna break up with me or say something else or what and then it would get to that day and he wouldn’t want to talk. I felt like I was going crazy.

Then, a couple weeks ago, after we were watching a movie, we got into a fight and I completely started sobbing and told him I didn’t think we should be together anymore and basically all of this and he apologized for real said that he would be better. He said he didn’t want to break up. It took a lot to trust him when he said he loved me and was going to prove it to me (and wasn’t going to break up with me) but I did because I thought he meant it for real this time.

I went on a nine day trip, I’m going home tomorrow. He was supposed to plan a date, he planned to break up with me instead. He broke up with me yesterday. 

I feel like absolute shit and I don’t know what to do. 1.5 years and we said “I love you, goodnight” every day, and suddenly it’s just gone? I feel so devastated. I wish he just broke up with me a while ago, one of the times I asked him to, and spared me all of this extra pain.

I want to hate him so bad but I can’t. I know I made some pretty serious mistakes too. But I feel so tricked and lead on and I just miss him so much already. Everything reminds me of him, the tv shows we watched, the places we went, little things he used to say and do, I just wish it didn’t go this way because fuck I still love him. And it feels so hurtful knowing he was planning to break up with me these past few days but was pretending to still be with me instead.

I doubt anyone will read all of this but if you do, thanks I guess. I just need to keep my thumbs busy so I stop fucking texting him like I know I shouldn’t. And it feels kind of cathartic to write it all down, even if this is just the short version. It just all feels so wrong.

Edit: I think he might know this account, so if you’re reading this, screw you for doing this all in the most hurtful way possible. I’m sorry for all the mistakes I made but if you had really loved me you wouldn’t have kept me hanging on for this long just to do this now. I haven’t felt loved by you for a long time but I thought things could be fixed, and I wanted to fix them but I guess you didn’t."
93fy6r,1,2018-07-31,I [F/25] hooked up with a guy [M/26] and can’t get over him.,maiama,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/93fy6r/i_f25_hooked_up_with_a_guy_m26_and_cant_get_over/,"Hello everyone. Thank you for reading my post. I’m so sorry is so stupid but I need some advice. I’m felling very anxious. 

A few weeks ago, I got a friend request from a guy that years ago I used to have classes with. I was happy to know about him. So I accepted. Right away he sent me a message. As we started to talk I realized he didn’t remember me. But we had a pretty good conversation. He even offered himself to help me with the application process for my internship that I’m about to start. He said “we should discuss it over coffee sometime”

We continued texting everyday. He got “friendlier” with time. He started to call me beautiful and sweetheart and love and whatnot. For some background, I used to have a crush on this guy like 5 years ago. 

While we were talking I was on vacation. So the day I came back he suggested we should meet to talk. I got ready and met him. So we chatted. Gave me a ton of great advise and who I should talk to to get a good place to do my internship. 

We then headed to his apartment. We went to his room because it was the only place with air conditioning. We watched a stand up show. We laughed. We had a great time. Then after it ended. He got closer and kissed me. He’s such an amazing kisser. And things escalated quickly. 

Now, I had never ever had that type of “one-time stand” thing. I have had 2 previous relationships. But I said yolo and went with it. 

We had sex. It was amazing. He was so sweet and caring. Kissed me a lot, caressed me a ton. He made sure I was liking it. He held my hand while doing it. Looked into my eyes. Kissed me some more. It was magical. It was also probably the first time I’ve enjoyed sex a lot. 

After we had sex we cuddled for about 30 minutes. In silence. He often kissed me. Caressed my back. Held my hand. Hugged me tight. It was soooo sweet. After the silence. We talked. He asked about my previous relationships. He told me about his. He told me I looked so beautiful that he could tell I was a very sweet girl. He couldn’t believe I didn’t have a boyfriend. I asked him if he was feeling okay, it was so weird to me that he was being so sweet (I was loving it). But also I didn’t want to get attached if it wasn’t going to last — even thought now i can’t stop thinking about him. I want to be with him. I want a relationship with him. 

We had sex again. Amazing, once again. So sweet once again. I could tell he was enjoying it too (hope he wasn’t faking it). We cuddled some more. I was laying down on his chest. And he told me while playing with my hair “I feel like I love you” and I said: “What?!” He laughed and told me again “I think I love you now, you’re amazing, you’re sweet, you’re beautiful, stay with me tonight” and I was completely shocked. 

I’m trying to convince myself that it was all the oxytocin running through his body. I couldn’t bring myself to say the same but I was feeling strongly attached to him. I like him way too much. I want a relationship. But I don’t know how he feels about it. I don’t want to be too pushy. I don’t want to scare him with me being needy or demanding a relationship. 

He continued being so sweet. I couldn’t stay. I had classes next day and I didn’t had any change of clothes or anything. I thanked him and told him maybe next time. He helped me get dressed. He helped me put on my earring. It was so so so freaking sweet, I was melting. He hugged me and kissed me some more and I went home. 

Now I cannot stop thinking about him. He continued texting but it has been so spare and disconnected, I feel. I know he is busy. He studies and works. But he feels so different from the time we were together. 

I don’t know what to think. I want to be with him. I don’t want to be pushy. I can’t wait for the next time we hang out together. I think I’m falling in love with him. I need some advice in how to proceed. And how to help myself from losing it every time he is sweet — in case he doesn’t want anything serious. 

Thank you "

I get it. But the hospital I'm working at appeared to have been extremely helpful and supportive when I first started my orientation process. I was transitioned as an 'unpaid intern nurse' for three months then I was thrown into full time night shifts. I feel as though I only have two or three staff members max that I can approach and ask questions.   


I ask a lot of questions. I know it can get bothersome, but I want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing! I'm slowly getting the vibe that I'm the most incompetent staff nurse in my unit. I'm not sure if it's because I took my NCLEX too early and all the nursing school information just leaked away, or if I'm not dedicating enough of my downtime to rereading on my school notes; I really don't feel like I leave my shifts doing all I could have done for my patients most nights. I walk away from the unit come 8\~9AM thinking that I left everyone disappointed.   


Are these just new grad blues or is there something that I'm genuinely missing as a nurse? "
93grpg,1,2018-07-31,My (23/M) Girlfriend (21/F) says she loves me but is taking every opportunity to not have to see me - What should I do ?,MrSatan2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/93grpg/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_says_she_loves_me_but_is/,"Hello, 

I hope this isn't too long, TL;DR in the last paragraph

we are together 6 months (knowing her for 3 years) now and I really like her and she constantly says how much she loves me and how happy she is that she found me (and I believe it's true). We were talking about moving in together in half a year maybe.

She has to go abroad (3000 miles / 5000 km) for 4 months which is necessary for her studies and of course I'm not happy about it, but it is fine and I supported her the best I could.

Whe have some sort of holiday (USA -&gt; spring break / summer break? idk) since july 2018 and she suddenly decided to work 5 days a week for her father which she hates and said before she never wanted to work there again (she doesn't need the money, but ok), so we are only seeing us on the weekends. Sure, I also support her in this situation.

A week ago she told me she is going on vacation with her grandparents and (party-) sister 600 miles (1000 km) away for 2 weeks. Was also supporting her, but I told her that I'm slowly not ok with only seeing her so rarely.

Today she told me she is also going on vacation with her father (which she hates) and her (party-) sister 2000 miles away on a party island also for 2 weeks right after the first vacation.

Honestly, now I'm really pissed. I hold my weekends free and make time to see her. It's hard enough for a fresh relationship to be seperated for 4 months, now shes adding another month voluntary (so 5 months) with her vacation and in the month before we are only seeing each other max 4 times in which I help her move out of her flat like some kind of cheap laborer (so basically 6 months without seeing each other).

Sure, I'm really happy for her that she is going on vacation, and I understand that she has to do this internship abroad for 4 months and I understand that she wants (?) to work but I'm feeling like I'm not important to her at all if she is cool with adding effectively another 2 months without seeing each other. She is not a big party girl, but her sister is, and of course I have some mild trust issues when she is 1 month in a party location. I can't come with her because her father and grandparents don't want to and I have a severe travel sickness.

I'm saying to her it's alright but only because I honestly don't know how to react right now. Maybe I should also be unavailable for a week or so. Maybe I should test her and If shes really going through with this, I maybe should just leave her because I don't need this kind of bullshit, if she has no desire to see me. Idk.

I should add that she is going abroad for 4 months right after the 2 vacations.

TL;DR: Girlfriend of 6 months leaves for 4 months (+1 month voluntary on a party island +1 month working) and I don't know how to react because of those 2 extra months.

Sarah is my husband's only sister. I had heard about her a few times but never officially met her until the Thanksgiving before we got engaged. To explain why, Sarah is his half sister and was never really close to hubby until they both became adults. The dad bounced on both of them, so there was no one really connecting them but the moms who get along ok.

When we were dating, hubby's sister decided to sell all her things, quit her job, and spend a year in Europe jumping from hostel to hostel. She dumped her boyfriend, gave him her dog, and basically lived without any attachments for a year. Great for her.

When she came back stateside, she had no job, no money, and no apartment. She stayed with her mom while she figured out the rest.

Meanwhile hubby and I were both in grad school and just barely managing to get by. Hubby had a lab job which just covered the cost of rent and gas, while I picked up IT jobs and internships to save enough for my portion. We learned to make our own noodles because the 3 dollar difference was like life and death. At one point we both looked in our bank account and saw we each had less than twenty bucks. I had to swallow my pride and call my parents for a loan.

Hubby decided to apply for a full time job. When he got it, he dropped out of school and began supporting us. I was able to finish my degree. We paid off our credit cards. I was able to find a good paying job and now the days of struggling are behind us.

It was during the first few months of his employment that we got the call. Sarah got her old job back but needed a car. She had gone to a dealer with 2k and the lowest they would sell her a car was 7k. She called hubby begging for 5k. We were still in the hole at the time. Hubby obviously said no.

I wrote it off as being just a one off. There had been a few things that made me raise my eyebrow a few times. The latest incident was with their ailing grandfather. He had a dog he could no longer care for and couldn't bear the thought of throwing it to the pound or humane society. We had 3 cats already and weren't really looking for a new pet. Sarah mentioned she was looking to get a dog and insinuated she might. In the end she said while she wanted to, it wasn't the right time.

We took the dog, she is a gentle old lady who mostly sleeps and doesn't bother our cats. They've decided she's a warm pile of blankets and will sleep on her. It's very cute. We love her very much and wouldn't change this arrangement.

That said, Sarah got a dog not a month later.

 I'm not sure why but this bugs me more than anything. Husband shrugged it off, and I'm trying to as well, but this is just another pile of reasons of me not liking her. I don't want to be resentful of her or hate her--I'd like to get along. But I'm struggling more and more.  What should I do?

**Tl;dr** - Sister in law is driving me batty with her irresponsible behavior and it's starting to make me resentful. How is the best way to handle this without alienating hubby's family? "
93hu2k,19,2018-07-31,dealing with difficult summer research advisor,LogicalAbility,LadiesofScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/LadiesofScience/comments/93hu2k/dealing_with_difficult_summer_research_advisor/,"Hi everyone,

I have a situation in my REU summer internship that I'd appreciate any insight on. So this summer I am doing a program where you research at a different university for 10 weeks with a stipend and free housing, along with some working lunches covered. Overall, it's definitely not a bad deal on the surface, but I have been dealing with some ongoing illness issues (both physical and mental) that have put me in the ER three times since April. When I have a flare-up, I get nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness, chills, headaches, jaw pain, heart palpitations, just an overall weird combination of symptoms. I also have Aspergers and anxiety/depression issues that have worsened with my physical health. Being an out of state student at my home institution as well as at this REU, I've seen so many doctors at this point that I might as well become one.

Now, the PI that I have been working under has been challenging, to say the least. The first few weeks of the REU, he seemed to be easygoing. Basically, my project is to try to make PDMS photo-patternable so that it can be used for microfluidic applications outside of a cleanroom environment, with the eventual goal being to use this material for a glucose sensing device the PI is working on. I am an ECE major with hopes of attending grad school in Europe and focusing on creating a medical device for easier mealtimes for neuromuscular disease patients, so this project at first sounded like a great way of immersing myself in BME related research somewhat. However, this PI has completely destroyed any sense of self-esteem that I had previously possessed. I have run the photoPDMS wafer experiment (which lasts about 3+ hours a single trial) at least 10-20 different times with no meaningful results. I am frustrated about the failure rate, yet determined to keep working until the program ends on Aug 10.

My PI has not been any help at all. When assigning me the project, he admitted he had not read any of the literature that he assig ned me. I have read countless journal articles, a 70 page masters thesis front to back several times,  yet the experimental procedure outlined has not worked at all. Whenever I ask any clarifying questions, the PI just stares blankly at me, or acts like I am stupid by answering my question in a condescending tone of voice. He ordered the supplies for the project three weeks into the REU program, despite knowing that I accepted the program in March. He also has no clue what chemical I am using to make the PDMS photopatternable: he keeps referring to it as phenobenzone when it is benzophenone. He comes into the lab sporadically throughout the day to check up on me but refuses to help at all. I have learned more from the grad student than I have from the PI (btw the grad student was diagnosed with stress-induced shingles at age 30...a red flag about the lab I would think)

To make matters worse, about a week ago he wanted to have a meeting with me in his office concerning my progress on the project. He emailed me the night before and I accepted, then replied okay, what time? He never replied to my email, so I assumed to come into the lab at the normal time. He then showed up about two hours later and yelled at me ""what about the meeting we were supposed to have????"" then stormed off.

The next day, we had a tour of the US Capitol building as a REU cohort since we also deal with science policy as part of the program. The program has a ton of extracurricular workshops built into the schedule, yet my PI gets annoyed every time I attend the sessions despite them being a part of the program. He kept demanding that I show up to his office at 10:30 am even though we were supposed to be back on campus no earlier than 1:30. I informed him of this, and no response again.

When I got back to the lab from the trip, all hell broke loose. He brought me into his office and starting screaming at me, saying that I have a bad attitude towards the project, am missing too much lab time (despite being in the hospital twice during the REU program and having a plethora of doctors notes from other visits), that the high schoolers in the lab ask better questions than me, why did I even come to the program, what my plans were later in life, etc. He also kept asking intrusive questions about my personal life (did you attend X professor's REU cookout last weekend, what do you do outside the lab...) and basically told me that I should consider going home. I just started breaking down crying in front of him, and he tried to act fake sympathetic, telling me to calm down. Well geez, I guess I've never tried that before! a magic button to cure all of my anxiety? sign me up!

This happened last Wednesday, and ever since then I have felt extremely uncomfortable in the lab. I am doubting all of my accomplishments, and I feel that I am not cut out for a STEM career at this rate, or anything for that matter. I have self esteem issues depsite knowing I have good accomplishments, to the point where I just felt like life was not worth living. Last week, I actually wanted to hurt myself. I felt like all of the other REU students had supportive professors and were making more progress, whereas I'm just a fuckup that they accidentally hired but can't get rid of since its a summer NSF program.

Since Sunday, I have had a flareup of my symptoms and have been nauseated and vomiting, so I took both yesterday and today off to recuperate and let my stomach settle as well as get some scholarship applications under my belt. I emailed the PI the night before in both instances stating that I would be absent, and he has yet to reply to either email. I just feel that overall he is a condescending asshole that has no concept of reality outside academia. For example, my last ER visit he asked me why I did not go to the hospital on campus. I told him I went to another one because the aforementioned hospital did not take my insurance. He said, so? And I'm thinking oh yeah let me get thousands of dollars in medical debt for no reason. He literally has no clue how the world functions outside academia.

Overall, between my grandma being hospitalized for over a month, my own health issues, my home insitution giving me some issues with my upcoming December graduation, my laptop breaking, and many other stresses in my life I feel that I am just drained. This experience has kind of scared me off from grad school, or at least the American grad system. I understand it's not supposed to be easy, but I don't think an undergraduate summer researcher should be taking an abusive PI either. If you have any advice or anything to say, please feel free to comment. If you need me to clarify anything, don't hesitate to ask. 

Thank you so much for reading this. I needed to rant somewhere."
93hv2n,11,2018-07-31,How bullying ruined the last 7 years of my life.,AnonGazelle,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/93hv2n/how_bullying_ruined_the_last_7_years_of_my_life/,"Before I start on this tangent, this is the 4th time I've attempted to write a thread about it. I think I've written about it under a different account before, but at the time I didn't realize just how large of an impact this has had on me. Furthermore, I would like to mention that I'll be talking about something which has happened to me in the past, in my young teen years. It's not ongoing.

Right. Here goes.

To start with, I'm not from the US, or western europe. Think more former soviet bloc. Anyway, that's beyond the point. At this stage in my life (20), I still have vague memories from my time in kindergarten. Pleasant memories, mind you. There use to be a group of us, and we'd play all the time, both when we were there, and outside.

Eventually, we grew up and had to go to school. And so I did. Along with 5 or so of the kids from my kindergarten, I ended up in the same class. That's great, you'd think, having friends around from day 1. Well, I thought so too.

Though elementary school, their attitudes changed, and so did mine for that matter. I was unpopular I realized at one point, I didn't hang out much with the other kids, generally shy, and I would avoid anyone really, since I was in a new environment and didn't know anyone. Well, that left me without much friends, and I instead focused on a core group of people.

Unfortunately, that left me a target for bullying. The kids I didn't know from kindergarten started picking on me. I was shy, so I didn't care to retaliate. I didn't like confrontation, was never much of a fighter. 

It obviously affected me badly. I started doing stupid shit because I figured, hey, it can't really get any worse. I've got little to no friends, and nobody seems to like me much anyway, so I might as well just do crazy things to piss off the teachers. Yeah, I don't know how that made sense to 10-year-old me either.

Well, that didn't help the bullying. And what I've written up so far, probably wouldn't have affected me so badly if it weren't for a few things which happened in later years. After elementary, going into 5th grade, we had a few new students join our class. And they started bullying me too, because it had become normal. I was just the classroom punching bag.

Not only that, but the kids I knew from kindergarten also joined in. Soon, I found myself really sticking to just 3 or 4 friends, who weren't even part of my class. It really hurt. Being at that young an age ( probably 11 or 12? ) with no friends really fucked me up, and I'm still dealing with the psychological problems today.

To start with, I really retreated into myself when the bullying got very bad. I just thought that any display of personality would be taken advantage of, so I just shouldn't. I communicated less and less with the other kids. And of course, the teachers didn't care. My parents talked to them as well, and that gave no result either.

When 7th grade came to it's end, it was time for me to take some exams and pick a high school to go to. That's how it works around here. Our teacher organized a get together to celebrate the 7 years as a class. I didn't go. 

As I entered into 8th grade, now in high school, I was still left with the same ideas. I didn't want to display my personality. I was afraid it would be taken advantage of, and I'd end up in the same situation I was a year prior. So, I was very quiet and shy, again. But this time, I understood why I was doing it, and I kept doing it, believing it was the best for me.

Towards 10th or 11th grade ( out of 12 ), I started opening up, but it was too little too late. I was left uninvited to most parties, and any other social occasion for that matter. Nowadays I ask one of the few friends I had during that time why that was, and he says it's because they didn't think I'd be interested, on the count of how shy and introverted I was.

It was then that I realized how much the bullying I experienced in my early life effected me. To this day, I have trust issues. I don't like speaking to people I would consider close friends about this stage of my life because I'm ashamed of it. And furthermore, I think on some level, I still believe that if I were to reveal too much about what a loser I was, I'd be treated that way again. 

Health-wise, I was fat. Throughout my teen years, I was very fat. Again, I think that's because I was too worried to go outside and play with my friends, or do sports. I didn't want to communicate with anyone, because I was worried I'd just be bullied again. So I didn't do sports, no running, no football, no cycling, just sitting at home, in front of my PC, playing games. 

My adventures on the internet during this time eventually caused me to get good at something, which is programming, and now I'm a paid intern at a software company at age 20, so at least that part is working out for me.

But all that time spent on the PC really did a number on my body. Only within the last year have I realized how bad it is. I use to be 14kg overweight, now I've dropped 10kg and I hope I'm on my way to dropping the rest as well. Because of the fat, I've also developed pseudogynecomastia. So even though I've dropped some weight, I still look fat because of my fat chest. Overall, the weight loss felt great when it went well, but now it's slowed down, I'm getting back to familiar feelings of depression.

As you can imagine, I was never a happy person with all of the above happening. Along with being shy, I was very unapproachable because I'd be very hostile about revealing anything about myself, which was understandably taken as me being grumpy on the other side. 

I'm not going to lie, I started considering suicide first when I was 15. And it's been on my mind ever since. I read a lot of existentialist literature, and that has put me into the mindset for self-improvement, but I don't know how long that can keep me going.

Never had a girlfriend, to nobody who read this whole damn thing's surprise. That doesn't make me much happier, either. 

**TL;DR** So I was shy, grumpy and fat for 7 years of my life, because of bullying which occured in grades 5 - 7. And I'm still feeling the psychological and health aftereffects to this day, at age 20. Through existentialist literature, I've recently been on the path to self-improvement, but I've started stalling. First considered suicide at age 15, still haven't acted on it, but it's always been in the back of my mind.

To end with, if you read the whole thing, thank you. I think I got more out of writing it out, than anyone would from reading it. "
93hwxh,93,2018-07-31,[S/B] [Step] Recreating a Childhood Photo,galintub,incest,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest/comments/93hwxh/sb_step_recreating_a_childhood_photo/,"You ever see those articles and reddit posts where people recreate a picture from their younger days? Sometimes they just do it in spirit and other times they try to go all the way, but given changing fashion and the fact they won't exactly fit in older clothes or find the same props anywhere, it's not always gonna be 100%. I'm gonna tell you about one of those times when it was...and then things took a bit of a wild turn.

I'm ""Gal"" (23/F/Bi). There's two things I adore most in this world: Spanish Hot Chocolate and my best bud/step brother ""Rex"" (23/M/80% Gay). Rex and I have known each other since we were basically 2 - we've lived as neighbors, school buds, step-sibs, workmates, classmates and finally housemates. Yeah, somewhere along the line in very early childhood our single parents also became really, really, really good friends and then got married. 

Rex and I have done everything together - sharing gossip, cuddling and crying about relationships &amp; our favourite characters getting killed in off in TV shows, three-legged races and all the things you'd expect from a peachy uber-cushy BFF situation. We became real siblings. As we grew older this closeness changed a little, our parents discouraged us from taking baths together a few years before puberty and made sure we didn't behave 'oddly', and our younger innocent selves didn't get it but rolled with it. We both ended up coming out to one another about our sexualities during high school. I realised I liked girls as much as I like guys and Rex supported me through that, meanwhile he discovered that he prefers men. However while Rex is pretty much gay he has made the rare exception for women in his life - he's what you'd call ""Homoflexible"". Generally though, women do nothing for him unless they are REALLY special. And the few girlfriends he has had have tended to be older women too - though even I'd admit they have been absolute vixens. And yeah, the guys have been pretty fucking hunky too. To note, I admit that he is a good looking guy, and he's been there to remind me I'm beautiful whenever I'm feeling down too. We actually got discount gym memberships together - we spot for one another in more ways than one. I can't count the number of times we've been effective wing(wo)men. And sometimes yeah, our interests in individuals align and we end up chasing the same person. There's been some dramas in the distant past but in the end we pull through for one another. Besides, I'm generally more into semi-casual relationships while he's looking for Mr or Mrs Perfect. Sex and nudity are for 'serious business' to him whereas to me they're something fun. Although I do take my actual relationships 'seriously' in that there needs to be boundaries, trust, a decent connection and a degree of commitment and support. They're a different ball-game to my one-night flings or FWBs. I've told myself that someday I probably will settle into something more serious, but likely still open. For now though? I'm young and living it up until I hit the big ""three-oh-shit"".

Anyway let's cut to the story at hand here. We'd been living in our rental together for over three months when we found ourselves in a financial pickle. Rex's boss had to let him go due to company shakeup and I was having no-luck finding clients for my cuddle therapy gig - someone else in the area was offering cheaper prices than me, and Rex thinks she may actually be sleeping with her clients too. I know right? Totally defies the point of cuddle therapy!

So an FWB of mine, let's call her ""Yale"", is a professional instagram photographer who makes sweet dough snapping instagram models. She's swimming in it (in more ways than one). Yale and I had an almost-relationship but I pulled out of it when I discovered that a) she was incredibly so far up her ass that I realised it'd be a problem in a romantic situation and b)she had a habit of cheating on her previous partners. I'm all for sharing and open-love but not without agreements and discussion between the main couple first. We stuck together as friends though and occasional fuckbuddies (like maybe once every couple months). I'm also no stranger to getting photographed or filmed by Yale, she's probably got terrabyte's worth of smut involving me and her (along with her other trysts). Cut to a couple weeks ago - Rex and I are contemplating moving back in with our folks when I get a facebook message from Yale

    Check this out gurrrrlll! 

It was an ad for a photo competition of sorts. Recreate a childhood photo, winners being the group or individual who can make it the most authentic and faithful recreation possible. 

*Huh* I thought to myself. Then I read further

    **Grand prize** 
    **$12,000 PLUS an exclusive internship**

*What the fuck...* was the next thought crossing my mind. It sounded too good to be true.

So I did some research. The organization who was holding the competition was some agency looking for high-quality photographers, apparently pretty big in the photography world and with the moo-la to fork out for it.

    Alright slut, come over and we can hash out a game-plan.

I knew Yale was a good friend and all, but the thought occurred to me that there had to be some other motive at play. I wondered if it was the internship. I eventually found out I was half-right, of course, but more on that later.

Yale came over the next night and we discussed it with Rex. We looked through whatever childhood pics we had on Facebook, Rex and I even went to our parent's place and basically stole all the old photos we could find - I found a big box in the attic where our parents have a complete treasure-trove of family history. Back at our actual place, we made up a shortlist. 

Yale took one look and just ripped into us.

""You want to guarantee a win? You need to go above and beyond."" She started tearing into our shortlist, ripping us a new one each time. It was kinda funny to be honest, though Rex didn't quite feel the same way. Here are some highlights:

* ""These clothes don't exist anymore, let alone in adult-size"" 
* ""The exposure here is terrible!
* ""They demolished that park years ago!""
* ""That Blockbuster is now a Krispy Kreme""
* ""Are you actually willing to get a bowl-cut for 12 grand, Rex?""

She opened the box from our parent's attic and started rummaging through photos, building a huge pile of rejects and maybes (but no definites).

Then she stopped, like she just found gold. I swear she fucking cackled.

""So guys...your parents never throw stuff out right?"" 

""Y...yeah?""

""So it stands to reason you'd still have all your old bath toys? And uh...what's their bathroom like again?""

I wasn't sure what she was going on about, but I do know that our parents have never remodeled an inch of their old dusty classic Americana home.

""It's exactly like it's always been?"" Yale did visit their place one time, back when we were dating. She probably remembered how old it was too.

""Perfect...""

Rex finally chirped up, after having his entire childhood fashion sense destroyed by Yale for the past three hours ""Is it? How ever will we be able to match the clothes to your perfect standard, oh master photographer Yale?""

Yale snorted. ""It won't be a problem, if this pic's any indication."" With a victorious grin she flipped the pic around for us to see. Our jaws kinda dropped.

""I've found our winner""

It was a picture of Rex and Me as kids in the bathtub together, shortly after our parents tied the knot. I was in the front holding onto a toy steering wheel, and he was in the back.

""Your hair is kinda similar length here too, or at least easy to cheat since you'll both be wet.""

""A-and naked together!"" Rex blurted out.

""We can censor it"" Yale said with a blase shrug.

""I know you and Gal have seen everything with each other but, I'm a pretty private guy and also she's my fucking sister""

""So? That should make this easier""

""You don't have siblings, Yale."" I said in Rex's defense. The money sounded nice though...

""Just don't look at each other then.""

""We'd have to literally be sitting against each other! A brother and sister naked and wet together!"" Rex said with maximum defiance. Something about that last sentence made me shuffle a little though. It sounded strangely...interesting. My mind was going in many places.

""You've seen other people naked before buddy"" Yale can be such an ass but I was seeing her point.

""Yeah but that's cause I was dating them or at least screening them, hell-o!?"" Oh Rex...

Asides from the peculiar situation of two adult siblings sharing a tub together in the nude, which was understandable, I also knew Rex was coming from a more personal place. See Rex also isn't always confident with his own body, despite looking like a lean action star without a shirt on. And he only just got out of a serious relationship a month or so ago. He's been having serious trouble getting back into the game and finding someone new. It didn't help that his ex-boyfriend was an absolute peice of shit who left him on the curb for some rich sleazebag. So that's been taking a toll on him lately. But I was starting to catch on to the idea for purely financial reasons.

""We could really use 12K, Rex"" I said now that I thought about it. Yeah, I was gonna be naked in a tub with my mostly-gay step-brother while my sorta-ex snapped pictures of us. And I'd be holding a toy steering wheel.

It took an hour of back and fourthing to finally get him on our side. When he did say yes, I swear I noticed a flicker on excitement in Yale's eyes. One I'm all too familiar with. *Fuck.*

I took her aside when she was about to leave.

""Yale...there's no agenda here, right?""

""I don't know what you're talking about"" She lied with that typical nasal inflection of bullshit. ""I mean the internship would be nice but I also wanna help you guys. You can have every single cent. That's all this is about."" 

*BULL-FUCKING-SHIT BITCH*

She wanted Rex. I knew it. I remember her asking once about his relationship status, I remember her making some comments. Rex is in a vulnerable state and she wants to sweep in. And then she could easily break his heart. I know what Rex is like, he doesn't take betrayal very well, not like I can. I love him so much that I couldn't take to seeing him fall prey to any more abuse.

*""Just remember, if Rex wants a girl he'd let her know. He doesn't just ""turn"" for whoever wants him""*...is what I wanted to say. But I couldn't risk it - I needed that money bad. God I felt like a crappy sister. I figured I could just warn Rex about it instead, or at least gauge the likelihood that he'd go for someone like Yale. She's too young and is a bit of a turd so I was hoping not.

So we sort out that game-plan. Yale took one look at the lighting of the photo and figured we needed to shoot from 4 to 5pm, and no later than that. She wanted it to be exact. My parents were going out for a regular date-night so I did my best effort to convince Dad to take Mom out earlier, making up some lie about a certain local buffet doing a ""Weekend Welcome Special"" only in the afternoons. He's gullible and ridiculously frugal so he bought it. Looks like they were having a ""Date-Noon"" (I'm sorry, those were my actual words)

I saw our parents off and called the others over. Yale set up the bathroom while Rex and I raided the attic to find all the right 'props'. This included things like an antique swan statue that needed to be perched be the faucet and an old fancy perfume bottle which dad never threw out because he thought it'd be worth good money in twenty years time. Yeah nope.

As we started filling the bathtub (It wasn't particularly full, just twelve inches or so high), Yale set up her tripod and fixed her fancy-as-fuck smartphone atop the adapter. Yes, she's the sort of person who gets all sorts of gadgets for her phone to make up for the fact that it's not a real camera.

Steering wheel checked off the list, I quickly undressed. Rex has seen me in underwear before but never in the full nude, and I admit I was kinda nervous about it for a few scant seconds.

""If it makes it easier Rex, just don't look"" I tell him, trying my best to keep him from freaking out on us.

""No I'm...I'm good."" I looked over my shoulder and caught a peek at his nakedness. His cock hung between his legs at seven fucking inches. It was a surreal split second before he immediately covered it up with his hands. I looked away quickly.

I wasn't sure what was harder to believe - his package or the fact that I was...impressed? It just stayed there in my mind long after he hid it away behind his hands. Rex was, to me, my real brother so this was definitely weird. And it got weirder because I just instinctively looked back again. *Ugh what am I doing* I thought to myself as I tore my eyes away.

He climbed into the tub first. I could tell Yale was checking him out from the corner of my eye. Biiiiitch.

I held the plastic steering wheel tightly as I was about to climb in after him. Rex just kept his eyes looking out the obscuring windows. We talked the night before and he said he was totally ready, and now I was worried he couldn't pull through. At that moment I decided to put my brother, the most important guy in my life, before the money. I stayed put, realizing I had to make a stand.

""Rex, we don't have to do this if -""

""No, I'm good. Just taking a minute to...adjust."" He said this as he turned around and saw me in full  glory. B-cup breasts and groomed, trim pubes. I've also got a bit of a 'simp' going on with the vertical lips. I understand how I'd have that reaction for any other guy, but for my step brother, one who was close enough to feel like a real brother, this was all sorts of confusing. His mouth was just agape enough for me to tell he was stunned. He quickly looked back out. He's never had such a reaction to a woman's body before.

""I'm good, just get your tushie in gear""

So I climbed in, positioning myself in front of him. We threw a bit of water over each other's heads. Rex splashed me with a devilish chuckle, giving me a bit of faith that he was comfortable again.

I struck my pose with the steering wheel. ""Alright, let's go! Vrmmmm pew pew!""

Then I took a look at Yale and saw she was analyzing us with critical eyes. ""No, no...you need to be closer to him."" God dammit Yale.

She had a copy of the photo on her tablet, and showed it to us. I sighed. Rex kinda gulped.

I pushed myself a little further back in the tub, which was kinda difficult as I nearly slipped and reached my hand backwards for support - instead I found my brother's cock at half-mast. He flinched and my hand slipped down further to between his legs as I finally found some stability.

I looked to Yale, she was busy glancing back and fourth at us and the photo.

""Nope, closer. C'mon we've got just an hour of light!""

""We're almost touching Yale""

""Just relax, you're not doing anything else to each other""

Fucking fuck. I pushed myself back some more, splashing through the water until I felt Rex's legs against the sides of my hips...and his cock sliding along my crack.
I heard his uncomfortable reaction much like my own. Normally feeling a cock like this along my butt would be tantilising. And it still was despite me not trying to feel that way.

""Sorry Rex"" I said to him. 

""It's okay..."" He said somewhat with hardcore doubt.

""Perfect! Stay there!"" Yale blurted with excitement as she pointed the 'lens'. We could feel ourselves slipping slightly in the tub, so we re-positioned ourselves a little. It didn't help much with the situation we had now, if anything I swore I felt the head briefly against my pussy lips, almost like it had a wandering mind of its own, trying to get inside.

""Wait, Rex, can you get your arms around her? Like in the photo""

I felt Rex's uncertainty as his arms came around me and under my breasts, which were a lot bigger than they were back then.

""So these weren't here before"" He quipped half-nervously.

""Not much I can do about those, bro"" I said, trying to imagine this as just a regular cuddling-over-boy-troubles situation.

""Okay you two, we'll do a few snaps to get this right."" Yale started taking the pictures, I heard the phone's sound effect each time. I also felt Rex's cock slowly getting bigger under my ass. I felt my pussy reacting in kind the whole time - getting wetter with each snap (thank fuck we were in a bathtub), as I kept trying to flush those thoughts out of my head with something unsexy. But fuck it was starting to feel good too. That actually scared me, I shouldn't be thinking that at all.

""We're almost done right?"" Rex asked, fully aware of where his cock was. I felt it against my pussy yet again as we repositioned ourselves slightly.

""Hold on Gal...your hairs looking a little off."" She has such a pedantic tone sometimes.

""Lemme take a look"" I started to get up -

""No I've got this"" She said as she came over the with tablet. She outright pushed me down with a strong hand, and I felt my pussy lips press down on Rex's cock. I felt them almost envelop it. Yale played around with my hair some more, giving the odd glance at my body and Rex's.

She stepped back, observed the situation, then went to fix Rex's hair too. ""Hey, I didn't move that much!"" he complained. But as he did, I felt him slip a little. With that, his cock started to push along my lips some more, threatening to barge right in. I leaned forward to try keep it from getting inside, while at the same time Yale helped him up and I felt his cock stroke back. I couldn't help but let out a soft moan - luckily neither of them noticed.

""Dammit we're running out of time."" She said as she hurried to the camera. She took another snap, then she looked at us (sitting there awkwardly in a mix of discomfort and repressed arousal) and she was pissed.

""Alright guys, we really need to sell the emotion here. You're both terrible actors."" Wow. ""I've got an idea - just play around in the water a bit like you did when you were kids. Pretend you're um...bobsledding or whatever you were doing back then""

""It was an X-Wing"" Rex perked up. I'm pretty sure I felt his cock perk up a bit too, and he immediately halted his every muscle when he realized. But also he was right.

""...okay. Whatever. Death Star run, aaand go!""

So we started acting out the scenarios like the old days me pretending I was Luke and he was R2. We were getting more and into it as we were splashing around, turning corners shooting down imaginary TIEs and the like. I actually almost forgot about Rex's cock for a while, although I'd come back to reality every now and then as I felt it brush against my pussy.

""Boop beep bwweee oh no luke ties behind us!"" Rex actually said.

""You've been hit, pew pew!"" Yale added like...why I don't know. So I played along with that and bounced around. And with every bounce I felt Rex's hard cock more and more, until finally it actually rose a bit as I went up a little higher then usual, then I came back down and felt the tip of his shaft just poke right in. I froze. He froze. The head of my beloved brother's cock was now firmly in my pussy.

Yale gave an odd look. ""You two okay?""

""We've uhh...got a slight problem."" Rex said.

""No!"" I blurted out. ""The light's going down outside Yale. Just snap the pic now!"" I said. Truth be told, it felt really, really good. Yale rushed to the phone while I gave a look to Rex and whispered ""We'll get out of this after, just in case it gets real messy"" Rex sorta moaned and sighed ""Okay...okay...twelve grand here we come"" I snickered. ""Come. Ha."" Rex moaned again, almost a groan. ""That'd be hilarious if it wasn't kinda creepy, sis""

Yale looked up from her phone. ""Gal, can you go a little lower"" I gulped, put on my best happy-face, and did so. Rex's cock went deeper into my pussy. I wanted to cry out but I didn't break character as I heard that miraculous sound effect once again.

She practically yipped in delight. ""Perfect, both your expressions were on point!"" I looked back, letting out a panting breath at Rex, who leaned his head back.

""Okay we're in a bit of a pickle here."" I said/gasped as I threw the steering wheel to a confused Yale, who barely caught it. I then tried to get back up, being sure to use my hand to check Rex's cock. His hands went more to my hips for support - then we slid lower again. Dammit. His cock had barely gotten out before it went right up, even deeper than ever before. Rex's hand slipped up to my breast. I felt his fingers tighten as I let out a load moan of involuntary ecstasy. Rex grunted. It was incredibly hot even though I feel so wrong for admitting it.

""Are you guys okay -"" Yale stepped closer - then I realized she could see through the clear shallow water that Rex was balls deep in me. ""Okay. This is...okay...

She clearly wasn't sure how to feel. She went to try help me up with one hand, but I slid again.

""Ow!"" Rex screamed, my butt hitting him with force. ""God, you're so tight...""

Okay, I trembled a little at hearing that from my brother.

""This is so fucked but...also kinda hot"" Yale added. ""I mean you're just step-sibs right?""

""Fuck you Yale, we...we're r-real enough..."" I said, as I kept heaving myself a little higher, but slid back down. That was a tricky old tub, it almost felt like it wanted us to fuck. Rex clearly deliberately running his hands along my breasts didn't help matters. I loved it and hated it at the same time.

Yale stepped back with a smile. She went back to her phone as I leaned back in defeat, my face next to Rex's.

""This is harder than I thought."" I said, as I moved my hips a little. ""Fuuuuck Rex, this is so harrrd""

""Let's just get it over with. This is fucking hot..."" He said, in a mixture of defeat and lust.

I coulnd't help myself and neither could Rex. He moved his hips and thrust at me. I started to ride along as he kissed my neck. Yale was watching into her phone's screen with hungry eyes. She was recording.

I kept at it, we were making no more effort to get out. We were fucking each other with no more shame. Or maybe the shame was there, but it felt so god fucking damn good.

I sat up some more, caressing Rex's hands as they played with my titties. Making sure to give Yale a good show.

As I rode him, Yale took her camera off the tripod and came in for a closeup through the water. I leaned back again to give a better view. ""Yeah, good, good, fuck your brother you little slut""

I bit my lips with as I moved one hand down to my pussy, playing with my clit while he did the work.

""Can I get you two to flip?"" Yale asked with an eager expression.

I slid off Rex's delectable cock, then I turned and leaned back on the other side of the tub. Rex crawled over to me with a dripping cock.

""I got a better idea"" he said with a smile.

I took his cock into my hands. It definitely had weight to it. I played with it, with my hands and with my lips and tongue. Teased my brother and the camera.

""Yes...yes..."" I heard Yale say. I couldn't give a fuck about her, but the thought that I'd be able to watch this later was enough.

I locked eyes with Rex as I took more and more of his cock into my mouth. He was running his hand through my hair, stroking my cheek with the other as he did so. I realized I'm probably the youngest woman he's ever slept with. I thought about how those older ladies could compare as I nibbled lightly along the shaft while tracing my tongue around the head. They'd probably be more experienced, but would they be as tight? As smooth? Writing this I realize now they'd probably be great fucks - my brother only picks the best. I started fingering myself while thinking of those women together with him, and of me in between them. Thinking of him and me with another guy too, and all the things we could do.

As he started to release his load into my mouth, I pulled off from his cock and let the rest of it hit my in the face, neck and chest. I rubbed it in with my hands and savored some of it for myself.

Rex stepped out of the tub as Yale fixed her phone onto the tripod, eyeing us both off.

She handed Rex a towel with a coy look in her eye. ""Dry your hands. You know how to point and shoot, yeah?"" She said, something incredibly devilish in her voice. Rex looked at her with a rise of excitement, then at me, and then he nodded enthusiastically. He was a little too exhausted to talk.

As he went for the phone, Yale threw off her top, then her pants. Typical of her, she wore no underwear. And I wasn't in a mood to object, already in a thrall of sexual entrancement. She jumped into the Tub with me, and helped me eat up Rex's cum. We spitballed some between ourselves as Rex brought the shot in closer. She got up and stood over me as I ate her out. I looked up at her and saw Rex step in and stroke my hair. Then Yale pulled him closer to her, and they locked lips - she spitballed his cum back into his mouth and, as I found out later, he swallowed it. They made out while I played with Yale's and my own clit, and Rex's semi-hard cock.

I could tell he was a little annoyed at first since he already nutted, but he got over it as he took Yale's tit into his mouth. I felt my body shake a little as I came. I ended up freeing my hand from my pussy and running my hand along Yale's leg and ass, still stroking Rex's well-spent cock.

As we enjoyed ourselves, I saw a flash of light through the window. Fuck. Our parents.

We hurried to get out of the tub, and in the process we knocked over the antique swan statue. It broke in two pieces - luckily a solid break, nothing a bit of glue can't fix later. Yale was quick to get dressed, she ultimately distracted them while Rex and I cleaned up and dried off.

We hid the ""props"" including the swan in Yale's big ol' gear bag, knowing they'd raise questions if we didn't. I noticed the bathtub looked obviously used so I took a towel and dried it off as best I could. Rex took the chance to go help Yale with the distraction.

I threw the towel as far back into the cabinet as I could, hoping it won't get found soon, and then I hurried out to meet my folks. Turns out Dad got into a verbal spat with the manager over ""Weekend Welcome"" deals and ended up deciding to just eat here with Mom. And then they ended up inviting us to all stay for dinner. Chicken Carbonara.

Needless to say, I started giving Rex a through-the-pants footjob under the table. I was looking at him in a new light. He seemed to be a little uncomfortable part way through though, as his mom started talking to him. So I stopped before I could make him cum in his jeans. Yeah, I was kinda jelly.

Truth is, I feel like my love's shifting away from the sibling kind to the romance kind. I don't know if it's only coming up now or if it was always there but...I wanted to be with him again.

When we got back home and started heading to our rooms, Rex and I had a moment's silence between us. I was at my door, he was at his just across from mine. We looked at each other for a while.

""Hey Gal listen...maybe this was just a one-time thing, you know?"" He said, in a moment that might as well have crushed me. ""I mean...your pussy felt great, your tits were lovely and you're definitely a welcome surprise compared to usual partners but -""

""But we're siblings?"" I said with pained inflection, feeling devastated. ""No, Step-siblings, Rex. It's not...""

""We've known each other long enough for there to be an imprint!"" Rex stepped in, closer to me. His anger was full of remorse. ""This...this isn't right for so many reasons -""

""You enjoyed it, I enjoyed it!""

""I shouldn't have. You were so fucking hot, you even made me feel wanted too but I shouldn't have. We shouldn't have...""

""Rex please it felt RIGHT"" I put my hand to his face, tried to bring him closer. ""I think we've always had this between us and just didn't realize it...""

He gave me a look of confusion, with a fair bit of shock as he came to realize what I was saying. 

""Don't...don't say it""

""I love you, Rex. I think we should give it a shot. You and me.""

My lips trembled as he stared at me. He put an unsteady hand to my chin, and then slowly leaned in. I leaned forward too, and we kissed. Slowly and sweetly, at first. Then it turned into an outright make-out. Then I was against my door as he brought his hand up my skirt and to my leggings, while I started to unbuckle his belt.

I put my hand down his pants and felt his hard cock waiting for me. By then he was already slipping off my leggings. He had them down to my knees when he stopped. He looked at me, and I saw the doubt cloud his eyes once more... 

If only for a second.

He kissed me on the pelvis, then started kissing up my body. I lifted off my shirt, he traveled upwards and we were making out again. My hands scrambled for my door handle and we found ourselves falling onto my bedroom floor, mostly because my leggings were still around my knees.

We never made it to the bed. He came back down and ate me out, doing a surprisingly good job for a guy who's only dated a few women in his life. Guess they were pretty experienced after all. Soon after that he fucked the ever-loving shit out of my pussy and finished in there, his pussy-juice drenched hand in my mouth as I sucked those fingers dry.

We retired to the bed after that and fell asleep, curled up together.

Hi guys I’m sorry that I’ve worried so many of you. It’s been a while since my last post and a lot of very emotional things have happened. 

So I’ll start with the good news although some may already know. I’m engaged, my SO proposed to me a bit after my trial and I said yes. Since we are kinda young we decided to not tell anyone till after he graduated and had gotten into college so it was going to be a long engagement. I was able to get a restraining order against my grandmother and grandparents and my stalker is serving time in jail. 

Which brings to me my mil. So I’m my last couple of post that got taken down (still have no idea why). I was living with SO and his parents. His mother, my mil was very willing to let me stay in the guest room free of charge she was very easy going. I was excited to have her as my mil. But that changed quickly. 

Now SO had briefly mentioned a Bil who was estranged and he hadn’t heard from him in nearly a decade and frankly didn’t like him. As far as SO was concerned his only siblings were Sil1 (married) and sil2 (14). We’ll shortly after we came back from Arizona Bil showed up out of the blue. 

That’s when mil went from a just yes to a just no. Bil was creepy as heck I always caught him staring at me in a sexual way. But SO would always put a stop to it. For the most part it was bec. At dinner Bil would make racist comments about me and if I tried to say something snarky back Mil would say I was being rude to her son. 

Well Bil had this sob story about being lost, in prison and reborn again. SO and I discussed this and both agreed he was going to ask mil to move in. I had already been looking for a place to move in by myself but if Bil was moving in then both SO and I were moving out. 

Needless to say at dinner Bil asked to move in and mil happily accepted. Now Bil bedroom became a guest room after he was kicked/moved out. So currently I am staying there well bil flipped. Saying that me and SO were just fuc*ing each other’s brains out. 

Needless to say mil rug swept and many other creepy events happened. First off she gave Bil SO’s bedroom meaning he slept with me. Bil trying to see me and SO sleeping at night and trying to take pictures of me in my underwear. He also asked if I would have sex with him and when I would tell mil she would say I was lying. Well after SO blew up on them for being oblivious he kinda revealed that we are engaged. 

She freaked after that and asked if I was pregnant. At this point that is impossible since I’ve never had sex. She said that her baby (SO) didn’t have to marry me if I was knocked up. I could get an abortion and she would just pay me to go away. She also said we were to young and we wouldn’t be setting a good example for sil2. 

I get it I’m 18 he’s going to be 19 in a about a month but we are both responsible. I’m in my third year of college and I’m going to get my first degree In psychology soon. I am a secretary and a very respected business and yeah I have money saved from the lawsuit I won and an inheritance. I don’t waste money and nether does SO. He has a scholarship to college, internship at a law firm and he is a huge support when it comes to family. So financially we are both very secure we have well paying jobs, we don’t go and get drunk or party ever. The only thing most people see are our ages. Also mil can’t really point figures considering she became pregnant with bil her last year of high school and that is why she married fil so her statement was like the pot calling the kettle black. 

Shortly after we moved out and that’s when her true crazy was released. Sorry if this is kinda all over the place I just needed to vent for a bit. I’ll post our move in story a bit later. Thanks for reading.

93jhb8,1,2018-07-31,why is my (18) sister (23) like this?,_crazy_goat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/93jhb8/why_is_my_18_sister_23_like_this/,"so it's been a couple of things by now, the other day my sister called me ugly she said that in all honesty she was the pretty sister and I was the one with a good body, then she went and said I only ever get attention from boys because of my body, I have talked about guys that have approached me at the table with mom and she (my sister)  says 'I tend to fall for guys easily' which is not the case because I turn them down and am not planning onto dating until I get out of college, but on the other side she repeatedly tells me and mom about how she is prettier than most girls at her uni and now about how many guys treat her specially at her college internship, (she's 5 years older than me) and I don't get angry over that but the fact that she talks about guys, and I can't, and also the fact that she's said bad comments about me out of nowhere. It's really irking me alot and also hurts me because she is my sibling and if it was some other random girl or boy telling me that I'm ugly and stuff I wouldn't really care on the very least. 
TL;DR
my sister calls me ugly, that boys only look at me because of my body, says I fall for guys easily (when I have turned them down), brags constantly about herself and how guys like her.

why is she like this? what can I do myself for her actions to stop bothering me?

93jk1s,3,2018-07-31,I Keep Coming Back to This: How Did Blizzard THINK We Would Take This?,Xenton,wow,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/93jk1s/i_keep_coming_back_to_this_how_did_blizzard_think/,"There's lots of arguments on this subreddit right now:

* She's Always Been Like That vs She's Far Worse Now

* It Makes No Sense vs It's a Military Strategy

* Horde Are Always the Bad Guys vs That's a Matter of Perspective

etc, etc

Whatever your stance though, on any of these issues.

Almost nobody agrees that this course of action is strong, empowering and interesting writing. The vast majority of the player base that I've spoken to, seen spoken about and witness both here, the forums and the greater social networking community agrees that this whole thing feels like a gut-punch.

Sure, it creates a dialogue and controversy and gets people talking about the game, but not in a good way.

So I keep asking myself;

Who thought this was a good idea? Who thought this was where anyone wanted the lore to go? Who thought taking a character with the oft quoted ""Morally Grey"" background and making her, objectively, ""bad"" was a good idea?

Forget one individual's bad writing, that can be forgiven. But this was story boarded, focus grouped, animated. This has been in the works for months.

Why didn't somebody stand up and say;

&gt;Hang on a mo' lads, this's looking a little... I dunno Shitey? Maybz we could head in another direction wif it, y'know?

----

The one upshot of this thought process is that given the work that went in, given the writers experience, the feedback here and the nigh universal response from players.....

The writers must have something up their sleeve.

That's the only explanation that makes sense.

Either the writers have some big, amazing, character rewritting story lined up to show how this all made sense and why we're not just getting 'GarroshAgain', or every single member of the writing team took a year off and Dave the Intern is writing his OC Sylvanas hating fan-fic.

Given the unlikelihood of the latter, I'm praying for the former."
