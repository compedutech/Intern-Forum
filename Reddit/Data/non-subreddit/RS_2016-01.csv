These are the men and women who comprise the O'Shyanna Corporation's board of directors. Before today, I have never met them. I do not know them. But they know me. They know everything about me.

My position in the room is central: I sit at the head of a broad oak conference table. This is not a position of honor. The directors have convened this meeting, 1:00 PM on a bright cold day in April, to excoriate me over certain recent discoveries that I made, purely by accident, while performing routine server maintenance at one of O'Shyanna's branch offices in London.

""Let me be clear,"" says Harlan Conan, Vice Executive Director of Marketing. His face is gaunt and careworn but his gaze makes me shiver. ""Asia-EU is our competitor. They have always been our competitor.""

I say nothing. Dry coughs, awkward silence. The directors flip through their files. I see photos of me in these files, and photos of my friends, and photos of my family. The files are thick. There is much text that I cannot make out with my bad eyes, and I do not have a copy of my own. I believe the directors are flipping through these files as a show of power, rather than to reference any information therein.

""How long have you worked for O'Shyanna?"" Conan asks.

""Four years,"" I say.

""Five years,"" Conan says. ""According to our records.""

I think. My start date. When? January 2011: one month after I graduated, a semester late, with a degree in system administration. Four years.

""I think your records are mistaken--""

""Our records are not mistaken,"" Conan says. ""And in fact, our records show something else. Here is a picture of you in a private meeting with Immanuel Gould and the rest of the board of directors at Asia-EU.""

He removes a photo from his file on me. He slides the photo across the table.

It depicts me shaking hands with Gould, a man who does not exist, who has never existed, a man who is a fiction, invented by the O'Shyanna Corporation. I swallow hard.

""This photo has lately come to us,"" Conan continues, ""after performing a background check on you. It provides conclusive evidence that you are a corporate spy, hired by Asia-EU, to damage O'Shyanna's market share.""

""You can't do this to me,"" I say, but my voice is small and unsteady.

""We can and we will,"" Conan says. There is gloating in his voice. ""Corporate espionage is a serious offense. In Malaysia, where you worked for O'Shyanna, it may even be considered an act of terrorism, and punished by death.""

I have never been to Malaysia in my life. I certainly never did work for O'Shyanna there. I begin to tremble and I cannot stop.

""You can't do this to me. You know I didn't do these things."" I am begging more than anything, at this point.

""Someone has to answer for these crimes against O'Shyanna,"" Conan says. ""If you are innocent, something else can be arranged. Who was that intern who was with you in the server room that day? Julie something?""

Julia, young firebrand, passionate about social democracy and open source. The things we did on slow days in that server room.

""If you are innocent,"" Conan says, ""she is the only other possible culprit. Isn't that so?""

I say nothing.

""Someone must be punished,"" Conan says.

""Yes,"" I say. I bow my head and close my eyes. ""Yes. Do it to her."""
3z038o,9,2016-01-01,How was 2015?,Sentient64,Kuwait,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kuwait/comments/3z038o/how_was_2015/,"For me, it was a year of change and evolution. I changed my life from being a lazy person who looks for excuses to justify doing nothing, to someone who chases after goals that'll get me to the next level.

I attended [Coded](http://joincoded.com)'s coding bootcamp, the first ever in Kuwait and the GCC, and possibly the second (or first, not very certain of the details) in the entire middle east! I also wrote the [Student Experience blog](http://www.joincoded.com/category/the-student-experience/) for the bootcamp, read it if you wanna get an idea of what it was like at the bootcamp.

I participated in StartupWeekend Kuwait 2015 as a developer. A few months before that, I was just a student in college studying Computer Science with a lot of desire to be successful, then Coded came along and provided me the practical opportunity to take a huge step towards success that I've always wanted.

This year, I've fixed up my personal problems more than the previous 20 years combined! I also turned 21, which means I am legally an adult, and also can transfer funds online without calling the bank (KFH) lol.

The bootcamp had such an impact on me, my productivity, my ability to focus on one thing over days, my dedication to finish a started task, ...etc, that the semester after the bootcamp I had a class which has a project and 2 presentations. I did so well in both of them that I got the attention of all the students, the TA, the professor, and now I have the opportunity to be a research assistant. With the hard work I learned to do from the bootcamp, things are getting better for my career :)

I have many plans for 2016 to accelerate my career like never before. I already have a job for summer, possible part-time job sometime in January, an internship I'm currently in that gets me involved in real world projects and applications, and my own startup project. I also might take up that research assistant position if I feel I have the time.

2015 was a year I never thought would exist for me. 20 years of being drowned in things I now have drained in this past amazing year. Who knows what 2016 will be like, it might be 100 times better than I think it is. Or 100 times worse. Let's hope and pray for the best :)


What about you guys? How was 2015?"

3z0wqt,119,2016-01-01,"My [22F] boyfriend [22M] of 4 years wants to leave me just because I got drunk on NYE, with him and cousins.",NYEsadness10,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3z0wqt/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_of_4_years_wants_to_leave_me/,"First, I have always been very happy with my boyfriend. He is extremely attentive and romantic.

We met in High School, and have roughly been dating since. My concern: we have changed along the way. I come from a very, very modest family, I had modest grades, and I am going to a public university. I work part-time with someone for 6 pounds an hour. 

On the other hand, he got the highest grades in HS, is attending Cambridge and on top, just won 100,000 pounds for his tech startup and an internship at a top bank. He is extremely ambitious and competitive, which I love and hate at the same time. He has achieved this with very hard work, and being very diligent, I admire him for that. 

The problem is that I believe it's changing him: he only respects people that are ambitious, driven, intelligent, hard-workers, etc. He says he is bored when we hang out with my friends/cousins, because ""they just dance, drink and talk about bullshit"". He says it's a waste of time. And this goes for everything: meeting with family, going out with people, etc. He goes out with me a lot, he enjoys it because we talk about interesting stuff, etc, but he feels hanging out with people breaks that.

He has special hate for people who drink, he feels that it's stupid to drink alcohol and damage your brain, body, etc to attain something (being more outgoing) you can get without it by meditating/changing your mindset. He especially dislikes people who are drunk and act ""not rational"". 

Yesterday, after 3-4 years barely ever drinking because of him, I invited him to my cousin's NYE party at their house and I drank. I got drunk but I was conscious. However, he could tell I didn't have as much memory, that I had trouble telling him where the house was, etc. 

Before bed he told me seeing me that way was one of the most unattractive things he ever saw me do, that he can't unsee it, and that I was worth more than that, and was smarter than that, and that getting drunk is only going to give us problems, and that he can't afford having a girlfriend drunk somewhere (at risk of getting assaulted, robbed, etc) while he is working at the office, that he needs me to be conscious and smart so we can ""fight"" together for having a better life.

This morning and with a hangover I feel really, really bad about this, because I know in a way he is right, I could have had as much fun without having drank, and I am super ashamed he saw me that way. I know he can have any girl now but he is staying with me, and I don't want to disappoint him. Apart from this, he is extremely nice to me, he supports me on everything (on university, on my hobbies, on my dreams) and has accepted many mistakes I made that I know other's wouldn't have. 

This morning we spoke on Whatsapp, he seems much colder and told me that we have to have a serious talk.

Should I accept his ""ultimatum"" of not drinking for the sake of our relationship? Or should I push for him to accept this even if it risks our relationship (and all he has and still does for me)?

For laughs as everybody is comparing him to Mark Zuckerberg, nor Mark Zuckerberg nor Elon Musk drank alcohol in college. I have sources but links are not allowed here.


---------

Clarifying EDIT: Everybody here is thinking he is a jerk just because of that and it's making me feel bad. As much as I am mad at him, he has sacrificed more than anybody else for me. He has helped me and accepted many things, and changed for me a lot too. He's the one who convinced me to go to university, and even paid for college semesters so I didn't have to work part time. He takes a plane the same night if I am upset. He is nice. 

I get a lot of people telling me to break up, shouldn't I try to FIX it first? At least talk to him? Sure he has an ego now after the job and the startup, but that doesn't mean he can't change that, we are kids, we can talk things out. I will at least try to talk to him and then consider breaking up if it doesn't work.

--------------------------------------

**tl;dr**: I recommend you read the text, but basically my boyfriend is very successful in his career and life. But he is cocky, and really hates people that drink. I got drunk with him and my cousins yesterday night, and now he is very mad at me (Read the text for context)."
3z10b3,5,2016-01-01,The now-obligatory personal NYD post from The Zesty One.,ZESTYTACOSAUCE,wRedditStreams,https://www.reddit.com/r/wRedditStreams/comments/3z10b3/the_nowobligatory_personal_nyd_post_from_the/,"As many of you guys have posted your personal thanks and thoughts on the channel and the friends you've made on Taima, I thought it mandatory to post my own:

2015 was a banner year for Taima, and with the beginning of 2016 comes my personal 2 year anniversary on the site. I arrived at the 2014 Royal Rumble looking for somewhere to watch, and immediately soaked into the small community that built on Cytube. I was an intergral part of CWF, the precursor to today's TCW, where I was the only Grand Slam champ, and briefly became Cesaro to Irish's Paul Heyman before the damn DMCA from a certain wrestling company based in Stamford, CT. I was lucky enough to be invited to the super secret Cytube where many of the regulars became close, since on a Monday we would only have like, at most, 30 people. Now Mondays average damn near 1,000. I did what I could to help Taima grow in it's infancy, even the occasional backup stream here and there. I'm thankful now we have the wonderful stream gang which makes things way better than I ever could. I was soon part of the mod squad, and I take that spot serious, but I'm glad my job has gotten easier with less and less spam every week. Kicking people is exhausting lol. Enough about the business side of things.

On a personal note, I, like many of you, have reached that point of personal friendship with many of you on the site. Many of us speak outside the stream, and thankfully, most of the discussion is not Taima related, because that provides a nice buffer. I don't spend much time on the site as I did at the beginning of the year, coming in for Raw, and popping in here and there the rest of the week in short bursts, mainly just to see if anyone is around for discussion or not. This wasn't a choice, just the result of transitioning from undergrad work in the spring, to getting my degree, and with the fall brought grad school, and with it, the study time goes up and the leisure time goes down. Also, for you young folk (just turned 32 if you didn't know), marriage means less computer time, more wife time than being a single dude.

So what does 2016 mean for the Sauce? Hopefully, more Taima time. Gonna try to be around more, as I know Summer will be packed because I have to do an internship all summer, which will be killer on leisure time. I am moving from north of Dallas-Ft. Worth back into the heart of DFW, where being in Arlington will be closer to school in Arlington, and I'll be in the area for anyone coming to WrestleMania. This happens at the end of January, and so this month in particular will probably be less of me in Taima, but hopefully I don't miss any Mondays at least. But once we are settled, since I won't be commuting a hour each way every day, I'll have more time for middle of the day Taima drop-ins. 

I also want to chase more success in TCW, and complete the TCW-CWF Double Grand Slam at some point. If that happens, I'll likely shift into retirement mode, and maybe one day take the book from E, we will see.

In closing, I consider so many of you guys personal friends, and hopefully, as it seems some lives may be transitioning away from Taima, we hold onto those bonds going forward. I have Skype always open, so if you aren't in the group chat already, get in, or you can always message me personally on there (same username). Obviously, there is always Reddit, which I won't be leaving anytime soon, as well as Twitter (again, same username), and for some of you, Facebook. I'm almost always on the internet somewhere, so I am reachable most of the time, and if I'm asleep, I'll get back to you when I wake up.

Here's to a wonderful 2016, and a long as fuck text post

in the Farmville area. 

1. How time consuming are the following classes: 

  -CCNA Security (ICTN 4251) 
   Do you have to earn the cert for the class as well?    

  -Scripting for IT (ICTN 2732) 
  
  -Red Hat I (ICTN 2530) 
   I heard the class got significantly easier since they started using RHEL 7


  -Enterprise Info Security (ICTN 4040) 
   Does this class involve lots of writing? 

2. Will be pursuing the co-op with Cisco next year. 

-How picky is Cisco about having experience vs. having a high GPA (Current GPA is a 3.7)? Experience is only a three month unpaid internship on a community college IT help desk  and 10 months at a small PC shop. Was laid off due to very slow business at the PC shop. Not to mention the vast majority  of the work I did at the PC shop was basic compared to what I learned in classes I took and in my own free time.

-How much do certs help with getting the co-op, would having the CCNA and the CCNA:Security cert help a-lot, compared to just having the CCNA. 
    
-Overall how competitive are the co-ops? "

When I graduate I'm very confident that I'll be going from lower class to middle class due to my field of study (computer science). Obviously not automatically; gotta do the work, internships, etc. 

I've never lived middle class, so I might be under delusion, but I'm under the impression that once you have a high enough income things like rent, utilities, food, etc aren't really worries anymore and you're more focusing on acquiring things or pursuing personal goals. 

So as soon as you're middle class you have the *time* and *money* to start pursuing goals and making money, thus making it much easier to go from middle class to upper class vs going from lower to middle where you have so many things you constantly worry about in your daily life. 

How far off am I from this? I'm personally not going to have kids  (got snipped) and I'm not a thing driven person, so I don't have goals of owning a house with a beautiful lawn wanting to impress my neighbors and having a nice car in a suburban nieghborhood.

I've never missed a day except for a few times being on vacation or literally running out and physically having no weed to smoke. Smoking has never really had a negative affect on me; I go to the gym a few times a week, am in my third year studying Mechanical Engineering (3.85GPA), and have had many friends and a girlfriend. I decided to quit not for one reason, more so a combination of a bunch of smaller reasons. I am in the process of looking for an internship, and we all know there's no shot at me passing a drug test; I don't like the feeling of having to do something and alter my state of mind, at least not everyday; I usually get stoned and eat everything in my house and wake up feeling like shit every morning; and smoking pot (surprisingly) prevents me from falling asleep at night, I'll usually just lay there and think about random shit until four/five in the morning and wake up feeling exhausted. Keep in mind that I do plan to smoke again one day, because I think it's retarted that I can poison my body with alcohol, prescription drugs, caffeine legally but not smoke a plant that does me no harm. I'm hoping to reduce the frequency of my smoking when I do eventually start again, maybe to once a week or every few days or so. Anyway so I currently am on day seven. And I wanted to discuss how I'm feeling after this week. First off i'd like to point out that quitting has been much easier than I imagined it to be thus far. I've been going to the gym more often than usual, and been putting more effort into my workouts, mainly because I'm not burnt out from being stoned earlier in the day and not rushing through my workouts to go blaze up with a friend. I definitely have been eating less, and better for that matter. Instead of getting baked and eating Cheez-Its, ice cream, potato chips, etc I've been making myself healthier meals. I've also been not eating late at night from being stoned so I definitely feel better when I wake up. I haven't noticed too much of a difference in my sleeping habits, mainly because I'm on break from school and have been staying up late anyway. I actually have a lot more willpower than I thought I would too. My brother and I currently share a bedroom, and we usually would blaze up late at night before we went to bed. He's still smoking (fairly new to it as well) and I've even been breaking the weed up and packing the bong for him, but still haven't even smoked. I even sat in a car with a friend on the way to the diner and he hit his one hitter a few times but I still didn't even hit it once. The first few days I did feel a little shitty (headaches, stomach aches, coughing) and kept using those ""reasons"" to justify why I was gonna cave in and smoke. Honestly I'm not even sure if those feelings were from quitting weed or just feeling shitty in general. But I stayed strong and still haven't done it. I also got pretty drunk three days ago and made plans with my brother and a friend to smoke when I got home, but didn't. Drinking tends to skew my judgement (obviously lol) and it's usually very hard for me to resist smoking when drunk. I'm also noticing a large production of mucus in my throat, which I have read about would happen when quitting. That is fairly annoying, but honestly my throat being scratchy and mucusy is more reason for me to not want to smoke and make it worse. A big part of why this is easy for me is because being a daily smoker for six years, my tolerance was so high that I barely got anything from smoking anyway, that I feel like I'm not even missing out on much. I admit that I have had a few strong urges to smoke, and even went as far as telling myself ""fuck it, I'm gonna hit my bong tonight"". But surprisingly my judgement kicked in and I have yet to cave. I also considered most of my friends to be ""smoking buddies"" (people who you hang out with literally only to smoke weed) but am shocked to discover that I still am hanging out with them and there's actually other stuff for us to do. A friend of mine who is also currently sober told me that quitting for him was really shitty the first week, but got much easier after that first week (he also was a daily smoker for some time). And my first week has been fairly easy, so if that's the case, this next week should be a breeze! All in all, this first week experience has not been too bad and I'm looking forward to being productive and sober this next week. "

I decided to try to just add these website back onto the chrome app launcher, but now when I go to ""more tools/create application shortcuts"", my only option is to add them to the desktop (I used to have other options, like adding to the start menu).

I started a new job a little over a year ago. After working there for a while, I met my supervisor’s boyfriend for the first time. Turned out we had a ton in common and we started to develop a friendship based on these things. We didn’t hang out at all, but we talked a fair bit over text and such. My supervisor was fine with this friendship, if not encouraging.

One day he wanted my advice on something he was working on which I had no problem with. He told me he wanted to take me out for a beer as a thank you. Again, fine with me. We meet up and I ask him where he’d like to go and he says we should go to this very fancy restaurant around the corner from my place. I was a little hesitant but he convinced me. The whole thing felt like a date. In the end, he paid in full for what was easily a $200 dinner. As we talked afterwards, he went quiet for a moment and gave me a weird look. I asked him what was up and he said “No, I can’t go there. It’s dangerous. Playing with fire.”

Despite all of that, I tried to put it in the back of my brain and assume good intent. Things mostly went back to normal, although he had started trying to initiate conversation more often and hang out, although it was a pretty natural progression of the slowly-growing friendship we were building.

About a month after the weird dinner, he messages me one night apologizing for making things weird that night, something he had never spoke about before. I told him it was alright and he assured me that it wasn’t a date. I told him I believed him. He wanted to check in on what I wanted from him and if I felt that we had as strong a connection as he felt. I did fully agree with that, but despite that I respected his relationship so I never dwelled on it. We seemed to move on.

Just after this, his girlfriend started opening up to me about the fact that he and her were considering opening up their relationship. I never had much to say about it. I told her to do whatever felt best for her.

Next thing I know, I have plans to hang out with her and a few of the other girls I work with one night. As I am on my way to the place, he starts texting me and telling me to ask her what she is doing after our plans. By the time I got to the place she was already gone and I told him. I asked him why I should be asking her about her plans. He responded “You’re not gonna believe me, but she’s on a date… We’re trying something.” He then asked if we could meet up at some point that night and talk. I agreed because I wanted to hear him out.

He and I met up and talked for about three hours. He confessed to his feelings for me and said that, now that his relationship is open, he wants us to try something. He tried to kiss me multiple times over the course of the night and I refused. I told him it was too weird for me to do anything with him when I work with his girlfriend, even if their relationship is open. For honesty’s sake, the next day I told her what went down between him and I. She confessed to me in that moment that she never actually wanted the open relationship but that he had convinced her. Again, for honesty’s sake, I met up with him the next day to tell him about the conversation I had with his girlfriend.

In this conversation, we revisited the idea of our feelings for each other. I admitted that in a more ideal situation, I would go for it. He confessed that the open relationship was all a ploy to get to me. Nothing happened until right before he left. I gave him a hug at the door and he kissed me. It was like a movie moment, the way I felt.

He confessed about the kiss to her and she freaked out on both of us. She met up with me to reem me out and tell me to stay away from him. I was told I’m not allowed to talk to him at all whatsoever anymore. As soon as my back was put against the wall that way, I realized how strong my feelings were for him. I confessed this to him and we agreed to, despite his girlfriend’s wishes, continue to see each other. He planned to break up with her.

When he tried to break up with her, she made him stay. She asked him for one month to fix the problems in their relationship (unrelated to myself). He allowed her this, mainly so that she wouldn’t make my life miserable at work and because it gave him a month to figure out his rent situation. At the end of this month, he intended to end things but we continued to see each other during that time anyway.

Over that time, I fell in love with him.

Just a few days shy of the month being up, he confessed to her that he and I had still been communicating the whole time. He was tired of the bullshit. Again, she freaked out on me. I didn’t hear from him for a few hours after her storming in on me and freaking out. When I did, he told me he was sorry, that he didn’t expect this reaction etc. He explained that he calmed her down and she is now okay with us being friends. I more or less said what the fuck? We’re more than friends, she’s not okay with that. He said he never intended for this to happen and I called that out as bullshit. He never acted like “just a friend,” even if you take the sexual aspect out. He was constantly talking about meeting my friends and my parents and stuff like that. This was happening over text so I asked to stop until we could speak in person.

So he came over and we talked it out. I told him that saying he just wanted to be my friend was bullshit. He admitted as much. I asked him what I was supposed to think and what happens next and all of that, and he said he never intended for this go to long term. I got mad and reiterated his never and then he paused for a bit and goes ""of course not never. I would never say that. I want you, but right now I'm career-focused and I'm not gonna say wait for me cause that's bullshit too."" Because he intends to leave in March for an internship and be gone for a while. I told him I'm just as career-focused and explained that to him in a way I hadn’t before and he was genuinely moved and was all ""wow I'm so proud of you. You're gonna kick ass one day blah blah blah."" All this time too, there was so much getting distracted. We'd just start joking around and talking about life and then had to be like ""oh wait. There's a reason why you're here."" So then it got to the point that we were talking about him and his girlfriend and I can't even remember what he said cause it was a lot of bullshit. But I gave it to him straight about what he should be doing with her and how I see it and stuff. He more or less admitted that he was with her for rent and I straight up told him that's not cool. I told him that I would be saying this even if there was nothing to gain for me. He said that I gave him a lot to think about because I asked questions he hadn't even asked himself. I was really drunk cause I was drinking the whole time he was there and I ended up telling him that I love him. Which I do, stupid as it is. I don't take that back. I was like ""Can I just admit something"" and he said yes and I sighed and I was like ""words are really hard... Can I say it with a lot of cursing?"" And he laughed and said yes and I went ""I'm so stupid in fucking love with you. Like stupid stupid stupid."" And then he was totally blown away and surprised and he was struggling to find words and I was told him he didn't need to say anything right now. All he did say in the moment was that he would keep it safe.

So right now, him and his girlfriend are still together and we’ve agreed to act platonically until if and when that ends. Is that the right choice? I love him, but I don’t know if I can go on like this. Please help. "
3z35ch,4,2016-01-01,"Guilt ridden teenager, [18 M], torn about what to do with his Summer Vacation",Ab-Eb-Bb-C-Eb-G-C,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3z35ch/guilt_ridden_teenager_18_m_torn_about_what_to_do/,"**Background info:** I am an 18 year old male currently going to a University at a major city in the western half of Pennsylvania. My mother, who is 58 years old works a full time job from 8 am to 5 pm. My father, who is 60 years old, also works a full time job making most of my family's money from 2 pm to 2 am. Within the past three years he has also had surgeries to remove a kidney and his left lung due to cancer. Currently clear, but not yet in remission. My girlfriend, also 18 year old, goes to the same college as I do. My sister, 27, goes to college in Eastern PA, but is hardly ever home during breaks due to traveling. My brother, 24, lives in Washington for his job. He maybe gets to fly home once a year for about a week. Finally, my grandfather, an almost 93 year old man, has recently learned he has less than 6 months to live. 


Also good to know, my mother is a very family oriented person. She loves having her children and husband around her for a good old fashioned Italian meal. Unfortunately, she only gets to see my father on the weekends, my brother when he flies home, my sister when she is occasionally in town, and me when I'm on break. It doesn't help that her father is the one who is sadly passing soon (no longer will be able to visit/call him). She also doesn't handle being lonely very well at all. In my senior year of High School, I was hardly home due to working and seeing friends. Between that and worrying about my father's cancer, she cracked under the stress and took it out on just about everyone around her (she's been handling her stress like this since I was probably 9 or 10).


**The Situation:** Currently, I am presented with an opportunity to spend my upcoming Summer Vacation (beginning of May until the end of August when school starts back up again) on my college campus (which is about a 6 hour drive away from home). It would be completely expense free (room and food), and I would be working a close to full time job for a little more than 8 dollars an hour. This would provide me with FAR more money than I would be able to make back at home, and would also provide me with FAR more chances to explore a new major city and possibly find more chances for research or internships for the future.


This is compared to if I went back home. I'd work MAYBE 15 hours a week if my manager is feeling generous for about the same pay, and I would have no such chances for making connections for internships in the future. I'm in a BioEngineering program at my college, and my hometown simply doesn't have any prospects for this field. 


So, free rooming, free food (it's cheap cafeteria food from the university but still it's free), and I'm getting paid to live in a major city? It sounds great, and normally under these circumstances I would sign up in a heartbeat.


**The problems:** Remember how I said my mother is a very family oriented person? She has been looking forward to me coming home for the summer for months now. It's hard to get into a conversation with her where she doesn't mention it, even if it is slightly. 


Also, my girlfriend is planning on staying on campus over the summer as well. Because of her family situation and the environment that our hometown provided for her growing up, she has nothing to come home to. She's staying on campus regardless of if I go home or not. 


And what of my dying grandfather? I have no doubt that if he passed during the summer I would be able to get time off and take a bus to go back for his funeral (assuming he doesn't die sometime during the school year), but the added loneliness of my mom not having him around will make me staying on campus hurt that much more I think. 


**So here I am:** Currently, I haven't yet told my mom about my plans this for this Summer. Every time she mentions it, the thought of making her upset and letting her down on her excitement makes me feel extremely guilty. Also, I'm worried about being able to convey to her that I'm not staying over the summer because of my girlfriend (it took ages to convince her I didn't pick this college all together because of my girlfriend also going there). 


My main question is this: How do I break it to my mom that I want to stay on my college's campus for the summer without breaking her heart? Should I even be considering it? Am I missing another option all together? Ultimately I'm really just stuck about the whole situation and any advice would help.


Thank you so much in advance, I hope this was worth the time to read.




   
**tl;dr**: I'm not sure how to break it to my very family oriented mother that I don't want to come home during my summer vacation from college. Advice?"

I am following the monero development since 2 months and I already have invested money into monero. Now I would like to run the updated client but my own laptop hard drive is to small. 

Is there a possibility to run it on an extern hard drive as a storage place for the blockchain? In which folder is the blockchain stored (windows 8)? I simply can`t find the data on my harddrive, but I am sure it already took some storage place as I have run bitmonerod. I would like to delete it from my small intern HD.

3z3ann,3,2016-01-01,Tyrone Macmatherson/ T-mac / Pimp-Master Swagstorm / Thunderbolt Application,KaptinKograt,wormrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wormrp/comments/3z3ann/tyrone_macmatherson_tmac_pimpmaster_swagstorm/,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeE3-rOG7i4
##Name/Alias
Tyrone Macmatherson/ T-mac / Pimp-Master Swagstorm / Thunderbolt
**Age:** 26
**Physical appearance:** Tyrone is a young, five foot nine, African-American man. He has a lanky build, with average musculature (although he’s started working out). Currently he wears his hair in a series of tight braids (Like the predator, in his words.) As a show of wealth and power, and to emphasise the persona he has adapted, he tends to wear lots of flashy and ornate clothing, with a purple and gold theme. Big grills, big shades (which must also function as prescription glasses), everything screaming big money. He has the symbol of the Midtown Thunder Crew, a dollar sign with the S jagged like a lightning bolt tattooed on his chest. He often wears two big diamond encrusted gold rings with the same symbol, one for each hand.
**Mentality:** Tyrone plays up the role of the big, machismo gangster but he is still at his heart a clinically thinking Harvard graduate in economics and business management. More than anything in the world he prefers things to be orderly, efficient and under control. Tyrone grew up in a bad neighbourhood and has reached the opinion that the best way to improve such communities is from within. If there’s going to be crime, it might as well be organised. He comes at things with a risk/reward and damage mitigation philosophy, seeking to maximise potential good/profits with minimum harm and fuss. He’s also a very people-focussed individual, knowing that investing in your people has great promise for solid returns. He spends a good amount of time building relationships with his lieutenants, garnering loyalty and love from his troops and a roguish infamy from the wider public. He achieves this through bonding exercises, acts of largesse and larger-than-life public performances. Of course gang banging, drug running, weapons dealing and prostitution are all violent businesses, with high profit margins and chances of collateral damage. Tyrone doesn’t shy away from this; he needs to look strong and intimidating to keep his position, and so when the time come to throw down he leads his troops from the front, often using his powers as a distraction whilst other gang members seize strategically optimal positions or particularly valuable assets. He always tries to build a sense of professionalism amongst his troops, so that they are more soldiers than just gang bangers. He tries to lead by example, showing that real bad asses use their temper, they don’t lose it; violence is most powerful when applied with thought and precision. Since manifesting his powers, Tyrone is a lot more confident and aggressive when dealing with other and in the pursuit of his desires.

**Backstory:** Tyrone grew up in Midtown, surrounded by violence, fear and discrimination, but was always supported by his parents who aspired to rise above their background and surroundings in order to make something of themselves. His father, Benjamin Macmatherson was a reasonably successful accountant and his mother, Julia Macmatherson taught English at the local high school. They continually strived to give him a stable upbringing and a secure future, even when his cousins were dealing blow on the street corners and his uncle was in jail for murdering his aunt. They continually impressed on him that true strength was to meet adversity and rise above it, to be better than it. He took this to heart, and natural gifting coupled with a passion for learning made him a dedicated student. He received a lot of flak for it; from middle school to graduation his nickname was “Turbonerd”. He tried to mitigate some of it by using humour and favours to try and get alongside people rather than be avoidant or confrontational. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t.

When he did graduate he was top of his class and received a scholarship to Harvard University where he studied economics and business management. He received a distinction average, and was set to start an internship the next year with a medium sized but reputable investment firm, with the hope of eventually leading his own team. Maybe even his own firm one day.

He returned home that year for Christmas in high spirits. His parents couldn’t be prouder of him; they rushed to embrace him as he hopped out of his cab, even in the pouring rain. That year they were holding dinner at his parents’ home, which was fully decked out with lights. The whole family was there, even Uncle Reggie, who had been released the year before on probation. His grandmother bought him a tie and suit with money she didn’t have, and was terrified that it might have gotten wet. Cousin Sydney joked, “Man you’re just a nigger trying to be a white man,” and Tyrone instantly replied, “Naw man, I just wanna be a rich nigger.”

They sat down around the table, and held hands to say grace. Thunder rumbled, and Grandma joked that it was God’s tummy rumbling.

And then they were all gunned down.

Tyrone never learnt why. Maybe someone had said something wrong, or maybe it was an attack from a different gang than his cousins’. Hell, maybe someone got the wrong address. But that night, Tyrone’s entire family was mowed down in a torrent of semiautomatic fire.

Being left alone at the head of the table, covered in blood and the sole survivor, he fainted. He came to a second later, filled with rage rather than fear. He ran outside into the storm and extended an arm towards the rapidly shrinking taillights. A blinding flash and crack, and the car swerved into a electric pole, its tires popped and melting. Tyrone ran to where it was crashed, ran towards the open window and punched the shrieking driver right in his face. As lightning once again coursed through his body, it was directed into the gangbanger’s body, cooking him instantly. Someone in the back swore and moved to shoot, but the sky spoke once more and his weapon was a wilting, white hot piece of metal sizzling in the hand of a corpse. Two tried to escape; one didn’t make it out of the car, the other almost made it to the corner.

That night Tyrone short circuited the security alarm of his old school’s library and slept there. He didn’t want to deal with the police. He realised that he was a cape now, but didn’t want to have to handle all that shit, not here, not now.

The night after, he bunked with a friend from school, Michael, who dealt weed. He stayed there for a week, formulating a plan for himself, before tracking down Big Joe whose dad was a pimp for a small gang, the East Midtown Crew. Joseph Nelson had been part of the family business since junior high, and Tyrone had helped him with his homework a few times, and just done it for him a few more than that. Tyrone had been pretty scared of Big Joe when they were in school, but not anymore. He didn’t have time for that.
Tyrone started small in the gang, running numbers, doing payroll, but gradually he built up his reputation, doing favours and staying cool, calm and collected under all circumstances. He came out straight to the boss about his lightning abilities, and with the extra confidence and firepower from having a resident cape the East Midtown Crew wiped out the West Midtown Crew and became the Midtown Crew. Tyrone continued to rise through the crew, until eventually the old boss started to complain about his health and retired to California after appointing T-Mac his successor.

T-Mac took around a year to consolidate his power, the gang’s assets and establish their absolute dominance over the Midtown area. He grew more and more ostentatious, and his gang evolved more into a cult, eventually being rebranded the Midtown Thunder Crew. He tightened up inefficiencies in the payroll system, cleaned up hiccups in his supply and redistribution chain and worked on his sex-work branch’s customer relations. He started making loans and insurance policies to local businesses with reasonable interest rather than straight up protection rackets, building up popular support and a steady clientele of local businesses. He organised bonding events with his top lieutenants like helicopter lessons, yacht rides, bowling and others. He paid so that his boys could go to the local shooting range, an affiliated business, on his tab, as often as they wanted and he encouraged them to do so. If someone’s grandmother was sick, he’d float the bill. If one of the crew’s dog was sick, he’d pay the vet. His crew were, and still are, his main asset, and he invests heavily in them.

These days, with the Midtown area on lockdown Tyrones is interested in expanding the business. He’s proud to say that all the dealers in Midtown answer to him, and he owns all the rehab clinics too. He goes to church every Sunday and tithes generously, and he makes sure all his hoes are well looked after during the week. He tells his crew “I’ll look after you, you look after me, and we’ll all get filthy rich,” and so far he hasn’t been proven wrong. But he knows as he expands he’s going to have to get more and more involved with all this cape shit, and if he wants the cash to flow he’s going to have to make heads roll. Getting some other parahumans on the payroll wouldn’t hurt either.
**Resources:**
Tyrone is incredibly rich. He has a tightly run business with its fingers in all the pies, and the financial sense to make sure he gets the most return for his investment. He personally owns a penthouse apartment, and his gang are in control of around six properties around the Midtown area; two safe houses, two labs, a brothel and a nightclub, as well as numerous private properties owned by gang members. Tyrone personally owns a purple stretch hummer with gold rims, dubbed “The Thunder-mobile” and is very interested in investing in a helicopter for crew operations.
**Alignment:** Tyrone tries to paint a public figure as a sort of larger than life dashing rogue, but is nonetheless a known crime boss even if he is developing a bit of an antihero reputation in Midtown. The PRT classify him as a villain and have dubbed him “Thunderbolt” (Pimp-Master Swagstorm not being deemed an appropriate name) but he is not yet a high priority, as he has taken great pains to keep under their radar until now.
**Equipment/Weaponry:** The Pimp-Master Swagstorm brings the lightning, and his crew bring the thunder. Tyrone usually carries a gold-plated Desert Eagle for effect, but in combat he normally uses his lightning redirection and emotional manipulation rather than actually shooting at people. However, he makes sure his crew are packing when shit goes down. Everyone’s got a cell phone; everyone’s got a piece. Everyone’s got a Kevlar jacket with the gang symbol on it. Everyone’s got a ride or has been assigned to someone with a ride so they can roll out at any time, to any place. Tyrone’s made sure that several gang members are trained to make homemade explosives that can be used for sabotage or distraction in the event of an open fight, and is currently trying to source some black market containment foam for if parahumans get involved.


**Specializations:** Tyrone has a bachelor’s degree in economics and business management, and has become intimately acquainted with all aspects of his personal enterprise over the three years he’s been in the gangbanging racket. He always wants to put his aces in their places; if someone has a particular skill, he wants to help them develop it and them employ it for the good of the Crew. He’s currently sponsoring some kids to go to college, hoping to hire them to fill out some administrative roles he feels his organisation is lacking. Hunnypop, who he moved from street work to his PA, and Boomer, who was moved from narcotics manufacturing to payroll and human resources, are both currently quite overworked, and he himself is having to pick up more of the slack then he’d like.

He also has a junior black belt in Karate, and is learning with his top lieutenants how to fly a helicopter.

**Versatility:** Tyrone’s hasn’t been able to find much utility in his lightning powers, and would like to find more. 
**Power:**
Pimp-Master Swagstorm is known and feared for his lightning redirection. From a clear sky, Tyrone can call lighting to strike himself, and redirect it through his body and out a pointed finger, with no harm to himself. His accuracy is decent; he practises and is currently able to hit a human-sized target at seventy feet, seven times out of ten. Beyond that, though, it gets progressively worse. He’s improving but he wouldn’t be confident to, say, shoot an apple off someone’s head. Even if he’s inside, the lightning travels to him through the path of least resistance before being redirected, often erupting from a light fitting or the like. He’s successfully used it in an underground car park. He’s resolved to try not to fight deep underground to avoid such complications. He can also redirect electricity from other sources, but hasn’t found many uses for this. He can stick his finger on an electric socket and charge an iPhone, but that’s pretty trick stuff.

He can zap people with lightning, he can shock things near them to scare them, he can summon it to himself and redirect it to the ground for visual effect, he can blow out tires and short out machines, he can run up to people and Thunder Punch them, but so far he’s frustratingly been unable to develop the wide range of applications that he hears about on Parahumans Online. He’s tried to supply power to generators and things like that, but so far he’s been unable to control the voltage and just shorts stuff out. He’s able to redirect electrical power from things other than lightning, such as draining a building’s power through the fuse box and then pushing it into the ground, which can be useful for sudden black outs and the like, but he could also achieve this by just hitting the fuses. He’s experimented with attaching car batteries to himself and then punching people for a lower voltage shock, but so far their isn’t an elegant way of employing such measures.




**Example:**
The Sons of Adolf, a rival gang, have been encroaching on Midtown and have set up a drug lab threateningly close. Not only is this an offence but The MTC are looking to move into the same area, and to do so they first need to flush out these white supremacist amateurs. Swagstorm gets together the crew he wants to take on the raid, explains how he wants it to go down, and has the boys roll out after suiting up.

They roll in at 4 am, hoping to minimise civilian interference and catch the SOA at a moment of exhaustion. Swagstorm hops out the back of an SUV and some scouts confirm that the SOA are entrenched, and look like they have been for a while.

He sends some lads around the back to take out the power breaker, plunging the lab into darkness. At the same time, He calls the lightning to himself and sends it smashing through a window in order to distract the besieged gangsters from his insertion team. Wild shots start pinging around him, so he uses the heavy SUV as cover, allowing his team at the back to breech the lab undetected and start eliminating hostiles, whilst boys positioned around the outside provide sporadic fire as cover

Unknown to him, the SOA have hired a parahuman. He figures it out though when an immense, burning figure rises from the roof of the drug lab and starts flinging orbs of fire, smashing several of the crew’s rides. Swagstorm ducks out of the way to avoid burning shards of metal and glass, and answers with a lighting bolt of his own. It misses, trailing off into the sky but reaches close enough to worry the cap. A few more, including one which blasts a chunk of roof away send the incendiary individual seeking cover on the roof. Swagstorm keeps on the offensive, blowing the front door into flaming splinters.
Swagstorm isn’t interested in taking prisoners from the SOA but isn’t willing to pick himself up the reputation of a cape killer just yet either. His boys on the inside mop up the last of the gang inside, call to cease fire from the inside and then do a room by room sweep to make sure they haven’t left anyone alive. During this time, Swagstorm keeps an eye on the roof and organises containment equipment and some boys to accompany him as body guards. His men on the inside confirm that the building is clean, and start cleaning up, bagging bodies and making out with as much product as they can before the cops come. Swagstorm motions for his bodyguards, and starts climbing the fire escape to the roof.

“Hey, you, bright spark!” he calls out, making sure he’s still out of sight for the moment. A cornered parahuman might be even more dangerous.

“Let’s be smart about this! I don’t wanna kill you, but if you do something stupid I might have to, alright? Say yes if you understand me.”

“…YES.”
“Aight, here’s how we gonna do this. I want you to lay down with your face on the floor, and your hands above your head, ok? NOT on fire! Understand?”

“YES!”

“Aight, that’s good, that’s good. Now my boys and I are going to come up there, and we’re going to tie your hands behind your back. If we wanted you dead, I would have zapped you yeah, so you know we don’t want you dead. But if you make a move, that’s how it’s gonna have to be, yeah? Alright, we’re coming up.”

They get some cable ties and tie the boy’s hands behind his back, guns at the ready. They take him quickly down the stairs, and tie him to a lamp post, and write “Parahuman” on his head with a permanent marker, before piling into the remaining vehicles or scattering on foot before the police arrive.
Later on, they’ll read the news headlines about the attack together, discuss how things went, distribute rewards for the boys who took on the job and celebrate a job well done. It will be brought up how important getting some of that foam shit will be in days to come, and Swagstorm will promise to make it a top priority, having Hunnypop make a note of it. After the heat has died down, he’ll have some of his boys move into the now-vacant building after determining that it would be a decent spot for a safehouse as he plans to expand his business into the thinned out Sons of Adolf territory.

3z3i0b,0,2016-01-01,Looking for advice on internship and potential career opportunity,Tulioooo,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3z3i0b/looking_for_advice_on_internship_and_potential/,"Hello, /r/personalfinance,

I'm a 21 year old currently working as a server/bartender whilst attending college for a degree in Marketing. 

The owner of the restaurant I work at, has given me great life, finance, and future advice since he first interviewed me over a year ago and discovered that I'm putting myself through college, while living five states away from whole family due to a multitude of disfunction. He's a very successful/wealthy man, that owns 2 successful restaurants and franchise owner of another.  He comes in about once or twice every month or so to check on his restaurant performance and other business related things but also makes sure to sit down with me and asks how everything is going with school, family, etc. before he leaves. He was in the same position I'm in when he was in college, facing the same struggles and can easily relate to me which, I guess is why he checks on me when he can. 

1) During one of our conversations he mentions that when I'm done with college, he wants to partner with me to open a restaurant with him as he has ""tons of new ideas"" for them if I was interested. I of course, was absolutely interested as I had seen how successful this guy had become, starting from where I am now, and I sort of left it at that. I didn't ask too many questions because I was kind of in shock that anyone, let alone THIS MAN sees that much in me. SO. I've come here to ask mainly;

What exactly does that mean? To ""partner in opening a restaurant."" I assume, since I'm going into Marketing, it'll have to do with marketing. He also has a degree in marketing, which I guess is also why I didn't think to ask. 

What would my responsibilities be? What would the pay be like? 

I figured i'd ask these questions when the time comes, but I just want AN IDEA of what to expect out of this. 


2) He came by earlier this month and told me he has a friend who owns a very successful natural gas company who might be looking for a marketing intern, after I mentioned I wanted to start the pursuit to obtain marketing certifications to achieve a paid internship. He said he'd let me know. 

He dined at the restaurant with his family earlier this week and I stopped by to say hello, asked about Christmas and things like that.
He ended giving me his personal cell phone number and told me to call him for details about a marketing internship opportunity. 

I haven't called him and I plan on calling him tomorrow. But wanted to ask;

What sort of questions should I ask him? 


Thanks in advance! Sorry for the long post!"

3z55r1,3,2016-01-02,Suddenly feeling depressed,not_in_here,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/3z55r1/suddenly_feeling_depressed/,"So, today I suddenly felt depressed after reading some stuff. I started reading about Gosu on r/leagueoflegends, I was thinking a bit too much I guess. Started comparing stuff to myself I think, and after reading replies on that thread and reading those of a post I made I just felt depressed out of nowhere. Ended up deleting my reddit account. This moment of depression is probably the first time in 3 years that my eyes are just full of tears, when my grandma died 1,5 year ago I couldn't even get tears out of my eyes. I only felt sadness.

Probably the prelude to this depression are the last 2 weeks.
The last two weeks I spend playing alot of LoL, other things I was doing was reading a little bit and walking with the dog for 1:30 hour straight. Besides that, it was only league and I was pretty sad at some of my poor results. I didn't really spend time with anyone else except for christmas and new years. I know a few people I talk with at school, but I see them as mere acquaintances not really as friends (expect for one person). I always play League alone, and I have no trouble ignoring the people that are referred as as 'toxic'.

But maybe this all began yesterday, on new years day. Slept less than 7 hours, and during the day I couldn't stop thinking about this year. In this year I have to choose so much and I have to do so much. Exams in 3 weeks, another one in 2 days, 'Open days' from schools to visit, making a choice in what study I want to do, the choice of the school, internships, the long list just piles on. 

I am someone who has been bullied during primary school, and it went on to the first year of secondary school. The worst what happened (at the time I was 13 years old) was when I called someone who was annoying to me a lunatic. What this guy did during the summer vacation pretty much tells you enough. He tried refilling a lighter with a gas can at a public playground, accidentally setting a part of the playground on fire. Enough about him, moving on. What happened then during the midday break, he sent a girl he knows to me asking me why I called him a lunatic. I didn't care responding, moved to class. And the next break, I was sitting at a table and suddenly a group of 15,16 and probably 17+ guys were encircling the table. The girl kept asking me why I called the guy a lunatic, some of the guys even beat me on the back. I think I was lucky having only one bruise. After this, I had purely suicidal tendencies for 2 days straight, and these tendencies have never returned. I think I am long over the bullied part of my life, but sometimes remnants care to visit my mind. 

When I was 15, at this time it was the first time I heard about autism. During primary school, there was this teacher that was supposed to figure out if kids have autism, he had no success with me as this was figured out by a 3rd party of therapists. I got to hear I have PDD-NOS, it didn't tell me much other than what I knew about myself and it might just have been a confirmation.

During primary school I was just a mere kid that was different, during this time I made animal noises in class. Went away eventually, and during secondary school I became completely quiet (after the bullying period) and only focused on school work. I only talked to teachers during these 2 years, and only helped out some others with school work when asked. At this time it was largely possible that I was the best pupil of the school, the level I was put in by the primary school was pretty much too low in my opinion. Things seemed like they were more positive. And they were.

During the period I was bullied, I pretty much went to games when I felt depressed (and this was often enough). I don't drink, smoke nor do drugs. You could say Runescape was the thing for me when I was 10 years old. I loved it when I discovered it, after 3 years of playing it I got bored out of my mind. Went to search another game. Went to World of Tanks, various console games, and then eventually I hit League of Legends. Over the time I have become pretty good at it, hitting diamond October 2015. Then didn't bother playing ranked, diamond didn't even feel like an achievement after a couple days. Wanted to get higher, got frustrated. Didn't play ranked until this vacation, and now with terrible results.

I've never stopped going to school, only during primary school I felt like skipping one or two days every 2 months or so. At the moment of writing I'm 19 years, hitting 20 in May. Writing this already made me feel somewhat better."

I'm free between May 20th and September 10th. I'd like to spend my summer somewhere on a tropical island, preferably doing an internship or a summer course. Ideally, I'd have a job where I could earn some money (hopefully breaking even at the end). I study Computer Science and Economics, so any programs related to that would be great, but I'm also interested in the environment and conservation.

Can anyone suggest anything? I've applied to a couple programs in Hawaii, but I'm open to anywhere.  I'm 19 and female, so I'm a little concerned about traveling and living alone, so I'd prefer an arrangement where I could stay with people my age."
3z67bb,2,2016-01-02,[College Math] Optimization,Lightbikemaster,HomeworkHelp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp/comments/3z67bb/college_math_optimization/,"Upon Googling my question, it turns out that my professor has compiled a variation of a seemingly common Calc 1 question concerning optimization and firebreaks.

""Your group is a group of interns for an environmental engineer, Jerry Harris, who works for the National

you consider a model forest, a square that is fifty kilometers on each side, and that you use the calculus
technique of optimization to determine some advantages and disadvantages of using firebreaks in certain
configurations. The text describes two configurations: (a) equally spaced horizontal strips, and (b)equally
spaced grid. You should consider one more configuration (e.g., grid with different spacings horizontally vs.

As of right now, I've deduced a function for part a, but part b and the other configuration are still yet to be solved. I think that part b is involving multivariable optimization, and that's what's throwing me off. Any pushes in the right direction would be appreciated, along with a brief overview of optimization. In my mind, I think I get it, but historically that never applies on exams, especially when I have an upcoming final. 

EDIT: I thought I might include my answer to A if anyone wants to verify it, and it is:

A good explanation of what optimization is would also be helpful, the last thing I want to do is walk in to an exam with finished homework but little understanding of the topic itself. I do know that optimization has something to do with global minimums and maximums, but not much else."

So I have been lurking here for the past four months without ""officially"" introducing myself. I must say, thank you everyone on this sub for helping me transition to the world of motherhood and deal with life outside of cyberspace. This site kept me sane and relatively Google free, especially when our little girl was a secret!
BF and I announced on Facebook today, and it gave me the courage to say hello on here.
I'm a 23 y.o. FTM, currently in a secondary education credential program, and getting ready to take over from my mentor at the end of the month! My BF is a 30 y.o. FTD, currently in school for computer networking, and will be starting an internship with the state this month. We just found out on NYE we are having a little girl, and couldn't be more excited.

I am not going say i am poor, but in my current condition i am about to extremely poor. In my parent's bank account they said they would help me pay. We have a total of 18,000 dollars in our savings account, or primary account. I don't really know but that seems like all the money we have.


I have NO money, i spent my whole summer doing intern work at offices, hospitals, and museums, to boost my resume. I made almost no money my whole life.


After the 4 years of colleges, and i am planning to spend 2 more years to get my Masters, i know i would be more than $50k in debt. 


I am 18, and i am TOTALLY clueless on how to make the money to repay it. I don't really want to burden my self because of financial problems, and i don't want to have my parent pay it off. 


My teachers told me while he went to colleges majority of them earned small bits of money, either it is tutoring middle schoolers, or waiting tables they made some money. I am planning to work at a restaurants that give carry out because they usually pay under the table. I don't really know how to make the money because I was never told to work for money, i was ALWAYS told to work for educational purposes and honestly i didn't learn jack.

3z7ebe,2,2016-01-02,18F4A - Little Asian Fucked by Monsters,AsianBitchToSnuff,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3z7ebe/18f4a_little_asian_fucked_by_monsters/,"Today is my first day as Professor Stone's assistant at M.I.T.  Even though I'm only a sophomore in high school, my acute interest in the sciences compelled my physics teacher to arrange a summer internship with Professor Stone, a researcher and physics professor who is on the cutting edge of theoretical physics, particularly with regards to time-travel.


Considered to be a fringe scientist by many, Professor Stone has hypothesized that time travel is very possible but that the conditions in the present time must be perfectly-attuned so that travelers from the future have a safe point to travel back to.  With that in mind, he created a vacuum chamber in the basement of M.I.T.'s applied sciences laboratory where an empty vacuum of space can be created.  He hypothesizes that providing a pocket of un-interrupted space - where no particles, energies or gases can interfere with a future time-travelers attempts to cycle backwards in time - will offer travelers a safe and uncomplicated port of call.  Imagine traveling back in time and suddenly displacing a pocket of atmosphere, or even worse, a solid object.


Today is the first time that Professor Stone will be powering up the chamber, and I've been recruited to assist.


I arrived at M.I.T. earlier today and was greeted by Stephanie, Professor Stone's TA.  She stands around 5'5"" and looks like she stepped out of the pages of Playboy rather than Scientific American; a crazy figure, blond and blue-eyed, huge round breasts, tight backside, all of it far too obvious through her white blouse and black skirt.


I would be intimidated - especially since I only stand a hair below 5'0"" tall - but my cheerleading-toned body, dark and tight, along with my bubble butt and big, round breasts - practically fake-looking and the nearly the size of my head - should be making *her* jealous, if anything.


She leads me to meet Professor Stone, who awaits in the laboratory.  ""Ah, you must be Brittni Vu,"" he shakes my hand, taking in my appearance.   I tried to dress professionally, with my long, jet-black hair tied off in a pony-tail that dangles to the backs of my calves and my big brown eyes masked behind a pair of thick glasses that rest on my soft cheeks.  Dressed *very* similarly to Stephanie, in a straining blouse and a knee-high skirt, I certainly fit in.


Professor Stone certainly wastes no time getting straight to work.  He has Stephanie monitoring the power levels to the chamber as he explains to me the basic function of the device:  once activated, the chamber becomes sterilized to an atomic level, providing a kind of singularity.  If time-travelers want to come to our time from the future, they would already know all about us and about this experiment, and could use the chamber as a safe travel point for teleporting.


When the chamber finally powers on, it is only for a split second, with a sudden darkening power surge.  For a brief moment, everything is dark and quiet, and then the lights bloom back on.


The chamber is sealed by a thick airlock with just one observation window, only two feet tall by two feet wide.  Professor Stone takes a quick peek inside, after that first test, to assess any changes to the interior.


""Preparing for a second test,"" Stephanie says, looking me up and down with a catty expression painted on her face.  ""Perhaps your little assistant would like to actually help me with some of--""


Stephanie yelps, her sentence cut short, as a huge, long-fingered hand smashes effortlessly through the chamber's airlock window.  Professor Stone reels back, nearly falling flat on his back.


Astonished, we all watch as the hand, warty and mottled and hideous, grabs the upper edge of the airlock door and rips it clear from its massive steel frame.


Stephanie screams.  I'm frozen in terror, eyes wide, as a half-dozen... *creatures*... emerge from the chamber.  Each one at least twelve to fifteen feet tall, they are grotesque monstrosities.  Naked and gaunt, their skin is covered in scabs and warts, their faces are ghoulish and bug-eyed, mouths vile things bristling with what must be hundreds of sharp teeth.  Their spindly fingers terminate in razor-sharp talons.  Most horrifically, their uncovered penises, with testicles each as big as a grapefruit, dangle between their legs.


The creatures let out cackles as they spot Stephanie and I, speaking to one another in a strange language - as though they recognize us - and licking their lipless mouths with long scaly tongues, salivating.  Their penises begin to harden and grow, each as big around as my arm, with some so long they could easily reach from my thighs to over the top of my head; three, four... maybe even five feet long.


Some of the creatures start to remove gear from the chamber; tools and devices the likes of which I've never seen.


Suddenly, Professor Stone snaps out of it and runs for the exit, itself a high-security steel door, as thick as the airlock to the chamber.  Stephanie and I break into a run to follow but as Stephanie passes she deliberately trips me.  I hit the floor, hard.


Professor Stone reaches the door well before Stephanie and slams it shut behind him, sealing Stephanie and I inside the lab.  With a huge magnetic shudder, the thick emergency bolts shunt into place, trapping us.  Through the small observation window, Professor Stone watches in disbelief.


""Professor Stone!!!""  Stephanie screams,  ""Let me out!!!""  But before she knows it, two of the things have crossed the large room to snatch her up in their vile clutches, giggling and cackling as she screams in fear, lifting her clear off the floor with ease.


Face-down on the floor, my round butt stuck up in the air, my skirt hiked up over my ass, I turn to see you, the leader of these things, towering over me.  Fifteen feet tall, grinning down at me with two of your companions, your cocks long and massive and throbbing, your evil eyes taking in every inch of my tiny body.


Some of the other creatures start unloading tools and devices, some of it looks like advanced computer machinery, some of it looks like medical tools or torture devices.   I don't know what to make of all of it, but there's no way we're getting out of this room alive.



**Turn Ons:**

* Torture/Violence/Cruelty

* Non-con sex/gangbang/face-fucking

* Gokkun/tons of cum

* Snuff/death-by-cock



**Limits:**

* Extreme gore (light stuff is totally fine - cuts, broken bones, teeth etc... just not gutting or pronation stuff, ew)

When he was born, the child had no name. He came into the world, seeing nothing but the red of his mother’s womb, the blue of the doctor’s latex gloves and the piercing white of the hospital room’s fluorescent lights. He came into a world of urgency, where all of the babies like himself, and all of the adults like his mother and father needed names to identify themselves. When the child was born, he was taken from his parents, down a long corridor which twisted and turned, revealing the mysteries of the universe to this new child. In the doctor’s sterile hands, the child came to the end of the hallway, which had two doors, but only one of them opened.
	   
The child and the doctor came into the room and were immediately overcome by brilliance of a new light, which was not fluorescent or incandescent or tungsten, but something new; something mythical which emitted the subtle blue tone of a heavenly body. The room was narrow, but long, like another corridor, but without any doors or windows. All that was in the long, narrow room was a woman with pale skin and long, straight red hair, who sat peacefully on a towel on the floor. By some accounts, this woman had as many as six arms; she was the mystic of the hospital; the maternity ward’s etymological expert; the name-giver. She held the child in her arms, delicately, with the ethereal patience of a saint.
	   
“Woodrow,” the mystic said, then set the child on the clean floor and allowed him to find his way back to the door, to the doctor’s arms, and eventually back to his mother and father.
	     
The first memory that Woodrow can recall is an incident between his father and the neighbors when he was still in kindergarten. In the days leading up to the single most significant event in Woodrow’s developmental stage, he noticed his father acting strange. He would sit in a chair near the window for long stretches of time, and say things like “What they hell are those degenerates doing over there?” to Woodrow’s mother. In that time, his father began to smoke. All that Woodrow can remember is the package the cigarettes came in, which had a green illustration of a four-leaf clover, and a long box full of tiny scribbles and foreign symbols with a cartoon of a skull and crossbones. The other thing Woodrow remembers is that his mother didn’t like that his father smoked. But she was timid and said very little of it. The only time she ever verbalized her feelings about her husband’s smoking was when she was bathing Woodrow. She looked him in the eyes and said “If you ever bring cigarettes into this house, I will stop loving you.” Woodrow didn’t understand what this meant.
	     
One afternoon, after his mother had taken him home from school, and Woodrow was sitting in the dining room drinking a glass of water and coloring in a page from an old book, his father burst through the front door, mad.
	
“Darlene!” he yelled out, and Woodrow’s mother came to him. “The neighbors are filming us.”

“What?” asked Woodrow’s mother.

“The Chinaskis have a camera set up in their upstairs window, pointing down into our bedroom, They have one in their garage, pointing into our living room, and they have one in their bathroom, pointing somewhere that I can’t tell.”
	
“W-why?”
	
“They’re a bunch of perverts and voyeurs! They’re creeps, and they want to know what the normal people who live next door are doing 24/7.” Woodrow’s mother didn’t say anything. She was overwhelmed by the situation, and she was timid. Woodrow’s father let the situation play out for a few more days. He started staring out the window more, and smoking a pack a day. Woodrow knew that eventually his father would’ve had to take some sort of action against the Chinaskis; he wasn’t going to let these people invade his home with their video cameras.
	
On a day when the sun was out, but the wind was blowing hard, so it didn’t seem so hot out, the Chinaskis opened their garage. Inside of the garage were three long tables full of boxes of VHS tapes and laserdiscs. This caught Woodrow’s father's attention; it sparked his rage, and acted as his call to action. He put on his windbreaker and made a beeline to the neighbors’ garage.
	
“What’s all this?” Woodrow’s father asked, knowing full-well what the answer was, but still genuinely curious as to how these creeps would answer.

“Garage sale,” said the male Chinaski, who was about twenty-years old and had a coarse neckbeard, and smoked clove cigarettes.

“Yeah,” said Woodrow’s father “what are all these boxes?”

“It’s a bunch of tapes,” said Mr. Chinaski.

“Tapes of what?”

“Y’know, like movies.”

“What kind of movies are these?”

“Y’know, like...y’know man, movies, you put’em in a tape-player and you watch em on your television, y’know!” Woodrow’s father placed himself menacingly over the complacent Mr. Chinaski.

“Stay the fuck out of my home, you rotten pervert.”

“Hey, man, what’s the deal with all the accusations--” before Mr. Chinaski could finish the ‘s’ in ‘accusations’, Woodrow’s father flipped over one of the long tables full of VHS tapes and laserdiscs, and threw Mr. Chinaski to the hard concrete floor of the garage. He stomped on his leg once, then crouched down and began to yell vicious, feral and inhuman noises at Mr. Chinaski. Woodrow doesn’t remember everything that he saw from the dining room window. Now the whole experience comes to his mind like an impressionistic painting, with bright colors, grandiose movements and broad gestures; with the sounds of an anti-symphony; and his father’s face, resembling that of Francisco de Goya’s most inhuman characters.

There is a long stretch of Woodrow’s life that he doesn’t recall. His next memory formed at the age of thirteen, when the Chinaskis had long-since moved out and a new neighbor moved in. He was just one man; an old man named Billiam Belafonte. Billiam Bellefonte was tall when he was younger, but as the years added pressure to his spine, he got shorter, and now stands at 5’9 fully-extended, but 5’7 with the slouch with which he normally walks. Every saturday afternoon, Billiam Bellefonte would leave an unsealed letter in Woodrow’s mailbox. The letter contained a list of complaints regarding Woodrow and his family ranging anywhere from “music too loud” to “you remind me of my death” signed “Regards, BB Bellefonte” at the bottom.

Walking to school one morning, Woodrow passed by Billiam Bellefonte’s house. He was sitting on his porch, smoking a cigar. He was the only adult Woodrow knew who smoked cigars, but not cigarettes. As Woodrow passed Bellefonte’s house, he heard

“Hey, boy, come over here, and talk to you friend Billiam.” Woodrow was distraught. He felt like he was being attacked by Bellefonte’s words, but because he was at least sixty years his senior, he figured he had to oblige Bellefonte’s request.

“Where are you headed?” demanded Bellefonte.

“I’m going to school,” said Woodrow.

“School? What grade are you in?”

“I’m in 7th grade.”

“Where do you go?”

“St. Jermaine Baptist downtown.”

“What road do you take there?”

“Dixon.”

“So you pass right by the Golden City then, right?”

“I don’t know what that is, but no, I don’t think that I do.”

“You don’t even know what the Golden City is?” Woodrow regretted talking to Billiam Bellefonte this morning. He knew he was going to have to listen to a story, and he knew that Billiam wasn’t going to be any good at telling stories, and he knew that he was going to make him late to school, and he’d get yelled at and his parents would get a call, and the day would turn out terrible. But he had to listen.  It was the only time he’d ever spoken to Bellefonte in his life, and he never did it again after that day.
	
As Woodrow remembers, Billiam Bellefonte recounted the story of the Golden City. A public housing project which began planning in spring of 1932, started construction in September of 1937, and was abandoned entirely by the winter of 1938, a full year before construction was due to be completed.

The outcome was three half-finished tenement buildings, circling a flat concrete pool with no water in it, which was planned as a community welfare center. Woodrow did not know why Bellefonte was so interested in this Golden City until he began to explain the reasons for its conception.

“Population control!” Woodrow remembers Billiam Bellefonte beginning his explanation. The Golden City was a no-income housing district meant to control the city of Topallia’s homeless population. The theory was that with every homeless person living together in one great big housing unit, the city would be free of the “imposed burden of the lower-low class” as Bellefonte put it. He also called them the antiletariates because they didn’t have jobs, and therefore, weren’t part of the upper class, the middle class, or the working class; they were a class of their own, so they got their own homes.
	
Bellefonte explained the plan of the Golden City in philanthropic terms, as though the entire community was pitching-in to help these victims of circumstance fulfill their every dream, but even at the age of 13, Woodrow could tell that this plan was a violation of even the most basic of human rights. The Golden City, at it’s core was essentially a concentration camp, where government officials would round up the homeless, and force them to live, without food or clean water in unsafe tenements until they died; which Bellefonte contended “solved the homeless problem.”
	
This sentiment made Woodrow sick, but without saying a word, he left when Billiam Bellefonte finished his story. Woodrow was late to class, his teacher yelled at him and humiliated him with a call home to his parents in the ear-range of all of his peers. His father answered, and on the speakerphone declared “Woodrow, you ain’t my child.” Woodrow cried.
	
For some time, Woodrow was depressed. His discovery of what he believed to be the ultimate cruelty in the world, the genocide of America’s homeless population, shook the foundation of his world. He was devastated, and nothing seemed important anymore, not even his own health. He stopped eating more than one meal a day, and in less than three weeks, he lost fifteen pounds.
Woodrow wanted to confront his demons. He needed to see this Golden City. He needed definitive proof that humanity couldn’t be so cruel as to build a town to intern innocent people; to let the homeless die. He needed to find this world, because he needed to prove that it didn’t exist.
	
In early July, Woodrow set out to find his demon. Based only on the information he had from Billiam Bellefonte, he knew that the Golden City was on the way to school. It was near Dixon Street, so that’s where he went. He left his home early in the morning to dodge the suspicion of his parents, who would’ve asked why he was leaving the house. And if Woodrow explained that he was looking for the homeless internment camp, they would’ve asked why he was doing that, and he would’ve had to explain how his world was torn apart by his recent discovery of humanity’s incredible lack of love. If he explained all of this, he didn’t know what his parents would’ve done. That was an area of emotional intimacy to which he’d never explored with anyone. Because of his severe melancholia, Woodrow had to become a lone wolf.
	
He had no map when he went out to find the housing project. He felt like a blind man, waking up in the morning in a strange hotel, with no bearings, with no landmarks to judge where he was, with no sight and with no information. He was wandering, when he happened upon a small farmhouse, painted firetruck red with a freshly-painted white fence surrounding a large area of trimmed grass. In the large area of trimmed grass was a metallic silo, reaching far into the sky. It had an antenna on the top.
	
A young man emerged from the front door of the farmhouse. He looked like death. He had pale skin and long blonde hair, tied lazily behind his head in a ponytail. He stood about six or seven feet, and his posture was brilliant, and he carried himself like a giant, and walked towards Woodward, who stood frozen at the side of the road, watching this figure of death approach him.
	
“Who are you, young man?” asked the figure of death.

“I--I’m Wayne,” Woodrow said. He told the figure of death that his name was Wayne. The comfort he took in this existential deception was greatly outweighed by the terror he felt when confronted by this man. “And who are you?” Still walking slowly towards Woodrow, the man took his time to respond. When he reached the mailbox, which stood between himself and Woodrow, he responded.
	
“I’m a farmer, a scientist, I dig holes on the sides of the road for the federal government, I designed a weather-modifying silo which I keep stored in my backyard, and when I was younger, I was a folk-rock musician. I played The Troubadour in California every Wednesday night in the eighties, but now, I guess now, you’d call me a farmer. You can call me a farmer.” The Farmer spoke without any inflection. He wasn’t stoic, but he was calm. There was no deception in his words. “And what brings you by my farm, Wayne?”
	
“I’m...I’m not here for your farm. I’m looking for the Golden City Housing Project. Do you know where it is?”

""I know where it is. I was an architect and a contractor for the Greensboro Estate. That’s the folks that funded the project. But I’m sure you know that by now.” The Farmer leaned against the mailbox. It didn’t look too comfortable, and Woodrow was shocked that it’s flimsy pole could even support the giant farmer.

Woodrow had begun to doubt the reliability of the Farmer. Could this possibly be true? What is the power of coincidence? How could it be that, as Woodrow begins to search for the Golden City, he happens to find this enigmatic architect. He didn’t know how things could line up so perfectly, that he would have to put no effort into his search; he didn’t believe that things could just go right for once, with no obstacles. He didn’t believe the Farmer, but it was all he had, so he decided to hear him out.

The Farmer explained the conception of the Golden City. It was never a humanitarian project; it wasn’t just low income housing. At it’s core, the Golden City was a concentration Camp for the homeless, and everything that Woodrow had assumed was correct. It was conceived by soulless bureaucrats who held money and efficiency in a higher regard that human life and any form of empathy. Woodrow’s hopes were once again dashed. Sadness exists in the world. Cruelty exists in the world.

The Farmer continued his story far beyond an explanation of the Golden City. He began to talk about himself. 

His music career (which, never really failed, but just sort of ended), his time serving in the coast guard, and his eventual foray into applied agricultural physics, which culminated in his invention of what he called “The Monolith.”
	
The Monolith was the large silo penetrating the sky in his backyard. He used it to manipulate the weather in the area immediately surrounding his ten acres of land. The Farmer grows tobacco year-round in a climate that is technically very hostile towards tobacco crops. He makes a good living off of his tobacco plants.

The Golden City was desolate. There were two large, unfinished towers, surrounding a deep hole filled-in with concrete. Weeds grew over everything. It was dilapidated; a dream from the mind of fascists which culminated in nothing. A dream which would have been a nightmare had it come to fruition. Woodrow found some comfort in this. There is bad in the world. Somebody at some point in time had this dream, and convinced other people to follow them. Somebody led a group to the low-income holocaust of the Golden City. Somebody had enough hate--or perhaps indifference--in their heart to make them take action; to make them develop their hate. But there is good as well. Because somebody stopped it. Either somebody realized it was wrong and campaigned to end it or enough people just lost interest in it. Either way, Woodrow theorized that because people weren’t actively pursuing hateful endeavors any longer, there must be some grain of good in the world.

Woodrow hitchhiked his way home. A man picked him up who drove a baby blue pickup truck, wore tattered white clothing, and called himself Killa Chief. Woodrow thought he was the Zodiac killer. Killa Chief assured him that he wasn’t. He assured him that he transcended any interpretations of life and death; presence and being; that he was an immortal, in mortal terms. That when he was young, living in Taiwan in the early sixteenth century, the electric stingray god granted him with the gift of being. He would never die, and his life would drone. He would continue to ride out his presence into eternity. He would see the world around him die, he would see time itself die, then both, at once, be reborn as a Cosmic Egg. Killa Chief was grateful for the electric stingray god, and told Woodrow to look into it. He told Woodrow that life is good. He told Woodrow that he needed to just roll with it.

When Woodrow returned home, he told his parents he was leaving them. 

“I’m not running away,” Woodrow said. “I’m leaving. I don’t want to be here anymore. I haven’t liked my life so far, so I’m moving away. I’m going to Tijuana. I’m going to convince a nun that god isn’t real, then I’m going to start a noise-rock band. If you think this is immature, then you aren’t fully-realized. I’m leaving you, and I’m not saying goodbye.” His parents didn’t respond, but now Woodrow remembers hearing Bill O’Reilly on the television talking about healthcare reform. That’s the last memory that Woodrow ever formed."
3z8mc7,3,2016-01-03,How to (re)learn iOS programming?,ehochx,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/3z8mc7/how_to_relearn_ios_programming/,"Hey there,

first of all: I apologize should this thread be inappropriate but I believe my situation is a bit different from similar posts.

Back in 2009 I attempted to teach myself iOS programming but the resources weren't quite there yet (at least for my 15-year old self). 

I eventually managed to release some mildly successful apps (~60,000 downloads) and it got me started with programming which led to a bachelor's in computer science and funnily enough an upcoming internship at Apple. 

While I greatly and rapidly improved my programming, CS &amp; software engineering skills, I moved further down on the programming stack - I'm doing lots of reverse engineering and exploitation but rarely write an entire application from scratch nowadays and at my last job I wrote real-time code on the OS layer. 

During that time I picked up a variety of programming languages - I'm really comfortable with C++, C, Swift, Python, Java and a few more (my Objective-C skills are a weird mix of ""I now exactly understand why this is being done"" and ""well, I've used this since I saw it in a tutorial in 2009"") but my Cocoa skills really suck since I never formally learned the concepts. 

iOS and its respective frameworks have evolved a lot since iOS 5 (which was the last iOS I professionally wrote code for) but I would like to catch up with it again and learn the concepts properly (and it's a good opportunity to get some practice with Swift which I'm going to use at my internship). I already watched most of the Stanford course but felt like it was too basic for me.

Just as an assessment of my skills: I'd probably be able to contribute to a project but I'm missing the expertise to create my own project (in a proper way that wouldn't want you to throw up, that is).

I guess I'm looking for some resources that briefly explain the concepts (and how they relate to each other) and especially get you lots of hands-on experience, i.e. guide you through many different projects. Udemy is currently offering courses for 10€ each and I'd consider buying one if you could recommend any. Can you recommend any other resources? I also wouldn't mind a book but I'd probably need something modular where I can skip the chapters about loops or classes.

Thanks for reading and I'm really sorry for any grammatical mistakes.

**tl;dr**: Have a thorough understanding of programming, am familiar with the basic concepts of iOS programming, how can I connect the dots and become a better iOS developer?"

The problem is that everywhere I look there really aren't summer internships in BI here in Canada and graduating without internships under my belt seems disastrous. In addition any IT/systems analyst internship that I find wants an engineering/compsci undergrad which is further limiting my options. I'm planning on developing my knowledge of tableau and so forth but it would be great if you guys can give me some advice on what positions to target to enter the field as an undergrad and what internships to target. It would be great if you can provide personal experiences. Thanks!!!!

Tl;dr As an undergrad which internships positions do you suggest I target to enter the field and which entry level positions should I focus on getting? Personal experiences more than welcome."

Susan Walsh is a mother, exotic dancer, journalist, and missing person. Susan was 36 years old when she went missing in Nutley, NJ under mysterious circumstances on July 16, 1996. I hope you find Susan’s case as intriguing as I have. (Warning: Long post ahead!)


**Background**

Since her childhood, Susan wanted to be a writer. In the 1980s, Susan attended college at William Paterson College, where she started working as a stripper to finance her education. She also became heavily involved in alcohol and drugs. By the time she graduated from college in 1984, she had attended rehab and gotten sober. She remained sober for about 11 ½ years. After graduating college, she married Mark Walsh, and in 1988 she gave birth to her son David. She never forgot her dream of being a writer, though, and Susan worked as a journalist, starting out writing for scientific trade journals. 

By the early 1990s, Susan and Mark’s marriage was deteriorating, and Mark and Susan split up. Mark continued to live in the same apartment building as Susan but on a different floor. Susan began dancing again as a way to support her son. Interestingly, working as a stripper helped to boost Susan’s journalism career. She obtained an internship at The Village Voice, an independent NYC newspaper. She used her connections in the industry to help her expose a story about Russian mobsters forcing Russian woman to work like slaves in NYC strip clubs. The article earned Susan critical praise. James Ridgeway, Susan’s boss at The Village Voice, described Susan as an incredibly hard worker who went to extreme lengths to cover a story. However, Susan became paranoid after the article’s publication and acclaim, and told friends and others that she believed she was being stalked. Susan apparently received threats following the article and also believed she was being followed. 

After the successful article about the Russian mob, Susan went on to investigate vampire subculture in NYC. Susan became entranced with the subculture and began dating a man who believed he was a vampire. She submitted an article to The Village Voice, but it was rejected for publication due to its lack of objectivity. At this point, Susan went back to dancing full-time.   

Susan was a graduate student in writing at NYU. She often wrote about her experiences in the sex industry. 

Shortly before her disappearance, Susan appeared in a documentary called Stripped produced by her friend, filmmaker Jill Morley. In interviews filmed for the documentary, Susan speaks of a “stalker” and makes reference to a recent relapse from sobriety. 

Susan suffered from mental illness as well as from drug &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; alcohol addiction. Her friend Jill Morley states that she knew Susan had stopped taking medication for bipolar disorder in 1996. Morley also states that she believes Susan was using Xanax during the same time period. James Ridgeway, Susan’s boss at The Village Voice, also noted symptoms of mental instability in Susan. Ridgeway apparently noted that Susan’s wrists were bandaged at some point in 1996 - possibly a suicide attempt or self-harm. He also learned that Susan was taking tranquilizers and had started drinking again. When Ridgeway confronted Susan about her drug and alcohol use, she brushed him off and told him she would seek help if she needed it. 

Susan also had a history of volatile and inconsistent relationships with men. She was apparently involved with several different men at the time of her disappearance.

Christian Peppo is a 21-year-old man that Susan was living with at the time of her disappearance. He was the one watching Susan's son David when she disappeared.

Susan had alleged prior to her disappearance that she had been the victim of domestic violence. One of Susan’s boyfriends was apparently obsessed with her and had gotten into a physical altercation with Christian Peppo on at least one occasion. A few weeks before her disappearance, Susan filed a restraining order against this boyfriend. 

In the days before Susan's disappearnce, friends and others say her behavior was more and more erratic. She was increasingly paranoid. She was in poor physical health and her loved ones feared she was emotionally unstable. 

**Disappearance**

At around noon on July 26, 1996, Susan left her apartment to make a phone call, leaving her 11-year-old son David to watch a movie with Christian Peppo. She told her ex-husband Mark that she needed to contact her agent who booked her jobs dancing in go-go clubs and that she would be back in half an hour. (Susan's friend Melissa believes that Susan's agent may have also been dealing drugs.) Susan did not have a phone in her apartment and frequently used a pay phone less than one block from her apartment. At other times, Mark allowed her to use his phone in his apartment, but Mark disapproved of Susan stripping and did not allow her to use his phone to make any phone calls that were stripping-related. Susan apparently used the same pay phone on a daily basis.

When she departed from the apartment, she left all of her belongings, including her wallet, ID, and pager. 

Susan’s friend Melissa Hine became concerned when she failed to return a page that afternoon as she normally would, so she drove over to Susan’s apartment at around 3:30pm on July 16. She found a door in Susan’s apartment that was usually left open was locked shut, and all windows were also locked shut (it was a 90+ degree day). Mark and David were not at home when Melissa arrived, instead having gone to Staples to buy school supplies. David and Mark stated they did not know where Susan was. 

An employee of a pizza parlor across the street from Susan’s apartment says he saw Susan returning to her apartment the afternoon she disappeared.

Susan was reported missing by her ex-husband Mark on July 17, 1996, at around 12:15pm.	


**Aftermath**

There were no phone call record available from the pay phone that Susan was supposed to have used that afternoon. 

Police determined that Susan’s ex-boyfriend with the restraining order had not violated the order. Police have also cleared Susan’s live-in boyfriend, Christian Peppo, of any suspicion of wrongdoing in relation to Susan’s disappearance. Peppo was allegedly watching a movie with Susan's son David the day of her disappearance. At about 1:45pm, Christian was waiting for a bus to NYC for work. 

There are multiple theories regarding the cause of Susan’s disappearance. Some of her friends believe Susan’s disappearance may have been drug related, and some believe that that Susan may have collapsed and died as a result of her drug addiction, depression, and physical ailments. Susan was apparently in poor physical and mental health at the time of her disappearance. Susan’s friend Jill Morley said that she saw Susan less than 48 hours before her disappearance: “She said she had bronchitis, emphysema, and an ulcer. She said she’d been in the hospital twice that week. She talked about her mood swings and being depressed and about just holding on to live.” Susan’s former boss James Ridgeway  also thinks drugs may have been involved, stating, “I think she went out and probably called somebody to come and get her and then she went and she may very well have O.D.ed.  And she may very well have O.D.ed in the presence of someone who knew her and was frightened to do anything about it.”

Detective John Rhein of the Nutley, NJ police department, has stated, “I believe Susan Walsh is alive. For some unknown reason to me at this time, she opted to leave her family and home, which she has a perfect right to do.”

To complicate matters, several people claim to have spotted Susan after her disappearance,  including her friend Melissa. Melissa claims that about one month after Susan’s disappearance, she THINKS saw Susan standing next to a black limousine. Melissa says she yelled out Susan’s name, and that Susan and the men she was with got into the limo and sped off. The license plate number was tracked, and the driver of the limo stated that he was with a woman matching Susan's description at the time of the sighting, but the driver was only ""pretty sure"" it was Susan. 

A number of tips came in to police shortly after Susan’s disappearance, claiming to have seen her working as a prostitute in the Nutley, NJ area. A prostitute in Newark, NJ says that she took Susan into her home and told her details of her life that had not been released to the public. Several prostitutes were apparently able to pick Susan out of a lineup as a prostitute who was working the streets of Newark to support her drug addiction about a month after her disappearance, but all leads to find Susan all turned up cold. 

Additionally, many of Susan’s peers in the exotic dancing industry believe that Susan was the victim of the Russian mob as a result of her article for The Village Voice. 

The police believe that Susan Walsh left July 16th on her own accord, but her case remains unsolved. 

**My Thoughts**

This case intrigues me because there are so many possibilities as to what may have happened to Susan Walsh. Did she commit suicide due to her deteriorating mental state and drug addiction? Did she collapse and die, as purported by some, her body just yet to be found? Did she leave to pursue her drug addiction and get caught up in a bad crowd, becoming a victim to the sex industry? Was she targeted by the Russian mob? Or was she targeted by a lover, perhaps her ex-husband Mark, her boyfriend Christian Peppo, or the obsessed ex-boyfriend with the restraining order? 

My instinct is that Susan may have gone out to pick up drugs and either OD'd or gotten hurt as a result of a drug deal. 

I really don't know what to think, but I'm really interested to hear everyone else's thoughts!

Disappeared, Season 5, Episode 2 “Dancing Into Darkness”

EDIT 1 - for clarity

EDIT 2 - I'd just like to add in some more of my thoughts on the case after thinking about it a lot last night. Here's my personal breakdown of theories in Susan's disappearance, in order from least to most likely:

**Russian mob hit**

Susan believed that Russian mobsters were out to get her. She received threatening letters after her article about the Russian mob and the sex industry. Her friend Melissa says she also believes Susan was truly being followed and claims to have witnessed Susan being followed while riding in Melissa’s car. 

I do not think this is what happened. I just don’t think this is the most likely scenario given all of the other information we had. Also, paranoia can be a symptom of drug abuse/addiction as well as certain mental illnesses - which Susan may have been suffering from. If Susan was being followed, I think it is more likely that it was the obsessed ex-bf or another unstable lover from that time. 


**Crime of Passion**

Could Susan have been a victim of a jealous ex-lover, like the boyfriend she had filed a restraining order against a few weeks before her disappearance? We know this man had the potential for violence as he apparently roughed up Susan and got into a fist-fight with Christian Peppo. If Susan was following a general routine on July 16, it would not have been hard to follow her. She used the pay phone on a near-daily basis, so someone looking to find her outside the apartment might well know to wait around there. Nutley Police say that they don’t believe the man had broken the restraining order and apparently cleared him of suspicion.

It sounds like Mark Walsh is not considered a person of interest in Susan’s disappearance; there must be a reason for this. If anything, the odd living arrangements between Susan and Mark and their recent (within past several years) split made me immediately assume it must have been Mark. He was also said to disapprove of Susan’s exotic dancing. Perhaps Mark became angry with Susan during an argument and killed her. David was on a different floor of the building, watching a movie with Christian Peppo. But what would Mark have done with Susan’s body? David and Christian finished the movie at about 12:45pm. That’s not a lot of time to clean up a crime scene, which I imagine takes a long time and great physical effort. 

Christian Peppo was accounted for at all times on the afternoon of Susan’s disappearance, from what I have gathered. He has been ruled out as a suspect. 


**Suicide**

Susan had been acting erratically leading up to her disappearance. She talked about her struggles with severe mood swings and depression. Jill Morley felt that Susan was “barely hanging on” when she last saw Susan two days before her disappearance. Susan had a history of self-harming. Perhaps Susan left the apartment that day in an emotionally unstable state with the intention of committing suicide. No one mentioned that Susan’s behavior on July 16 was particularly wild, though, which seems important. I have to believe it would have been mentioned if she appeared completely unhinged at the time of her disappearance. Although her behavior leading up to her disappearance was erratic and unstable, it seems that Susan’s actions before noon on July 16 were more or less in line with normal routines for her. She apparently used this same pay phone almost daily to return pages. 

The other option is that Susan left the house for some normal activity and decided to commit suicide after having left. I don’t find option to be likely for the simple fact that I think it’s relatively unusual. Usually there is some planning, foresight, and also subtle hints that someone is going to harm themselves. All signs right now point to the idea that Susan left at noon on July 16 intending to be gone from the house for a short time, and that this trip was not in any way unusual for her. 


**Ran Away of Her Own Will**

It seems unusual to me that if Susan was leaving on her own, she would have left her wallet, ID, and pager. She wouldn’t have told Mark she would be back in half an hour, which seems like an exceptionally short period of time to give yourself before people start to notice you’re not where you’re supposed to be. If she was going to run, wouldn’t she want to be as far away as possible before people realized she was gone? By all accounts, her movements leading up to noon on July 16 were normal and routine for her. Susan did not intend to be gone from her home for more than a few minutes. 

On the other hand, if Susan was suffering from a severe, untreated mental illness, her reasoning at the time of her disappearance was most likely affected. She may have made a snap decision to run away and failed to rationally think the decision through. Perhaps her drug addiction was even worse than people realized and she willingly decided to leave her son so that she could pursue her addiction full-time. Friends close to Susan find this option to be extremely unlikely. 


**Drug OD**

I think this is the most likely answer. Susan was physically weak at the time of her disappearance. She was suffering from illnesses like bronchitis and emphysema which affect the respiratory system. It sounds as though she was taking some type of depressant. James Ridgeway mentions “tranquilizers” and Jill Morley mentions Xanax. I wonder exactly what type of drugs Susan was on. The term ‘tranquilizer’ is sort of old-fashioned and doesn’t actually refer to one specific class of drugs. It’s sort of a layman’s terms for anti-anxiety drugs (like Xanax), sleeping pills, or antipsychotic medications. At any rate, mixing these types of drugs with alcohol (as Susan was alleged to be doing) is a super bad idea as alcohol potentiates the already-serious side effects of these types of meds, like sedation, confusion, dizziness, and mental state changes. If Susan had relapsed fairly recently, her tolerance was likely quite low. Relapse is a common time for drug addicts to OD on drugs as they fail to take into account their new lowered tolerance. If Susan was using opiates, these drugs cause respiratory depression. Add in the fact that her respiratory system was already compromised by illness and it seems that a lot of evidence points to this possibility. If she accidentally overdosed, others may have disposed of her body to avoid getting in trouble. 


**Unanswered Questions**

--Who did Susan call from the pay phone on July 16?

--Did the pizza shop employee really see Susan re-enter her building the afternoon of July 16? This would change the whole timeline and shift my suspicions to being either her ex-husband Mark or bf Christian Peppo. 

--What kind of drugs was Susan using?

--Was Susan really being stalked? Or was her paranoia a symptom of a worsening mental/emotional state or drug abuse? Even if she WAS being stalked, that doesn’t mean the stalker was involved in the disappearance.

--Were there other men in Susan’s life at the time of her disappearance?


We may never find out the true story of what happened to Susan Walsh on July 16. It’s been almost 20 years since she disappeared. I think it’s extremely unlikely that Susan is alive today given her multiple risk factors - even if she was initially intending on running away. I think it is most likely that she was incapacitated or dead by evening time on July 16. "

Not only that, I await the response to my internship programs I have applied one being the Graphic Designer Intern, Tespa for Blizzard Entertainment. Also this year marks the Grand opening of the Wizardly World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Hollywood!

Despite my Anxiety which can lead to panic attacks I always remember one quote that Dumbledore said ""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."" As much as it may scare me sometimes I am constantly looking forward and for the better continue living the life I want to live. 

I am awaiting the day the elders try to contact me, since they do it every year, I for one am not scared of them anymore and will be ready if they try to contact me into coming back, but nonetheless this year is a good year and I will not let anything or anyone ruin it for me.

Topics include - finding an ally, being responsible, and avoiding shitty big business habits.

**Body**

This is a general advice post to those young men entering the workforce, particularly in the business fields - investment bankers, big law lawyers, stockbrokers, and big insurance / energy. Here, your balls are at the mercy of headhunters, throatcutters, backstabbers, rabid feminists, etc.  Your academic accomplishments mean nothing once you step through that door. That A+ in business law means dick, as does your European vacation and tai chi classes intended to show how worldly you are.  Here are a few pointers on how to build your network and your value in this environment. I'm sort of riffing a bit, so feel free to ask or add. Advice has been learned either the hard way through much trial and error or observed in the wild.

*Axioms*

1)  You have learned the fundamental lesson that *time is valuable*.  You *can't* do it all, no matter how many episodes of Suits you've watched. Everything you do should be done in conjunction with reflection on whether it is a good use of your time.  This must become second nature if it isn't already, I'd suggest getting a journal to the disorganized, and record everything. Also, a calendar you can write on with erasable markers which show a month or two is very useful.

2) You've read How to Make Friends and Influence People. This is self-explanatory.

*Advice*

1) FIND ME.  

The first thing you ought to do is find a medium-senior employee who is on top of shit, relatively approachable, and generally a decent *man* all around. This man ideally will turn into a mentor, officially or otherwise, it is absolutely essential you find this person. It must be a man as well, do *not* make this mistake and I will tell you why beyond the obvious - the workplace dynamics between men and women differ substantially and substantively. Men are in competition with *other men* and women are in competition with *other women*.  There are several reasons for this but just suffice it to say that men prefer high financial benefits in their work, while women prefer more flexible working conditions. If you want to succeed, you better be ready to go for the former. You want a bonus and promotion, not an extra week's vacation, that comes in time.

Benefits include giving you the lay of the land, internal gossip (the useful kind, not the bullshit), a source for advice, and don't discount the value of someone you can blow off steam to.  Your friends are not in this world, and they will not be able to relate when you want to rant about that bitch who stole a file from you when your back was turned. 

2) BE A ROCK, MIND YOUR REPUTATION 

For some reason, popular culture has turned where the backstabbing power-broker who slits a few throats along the way is idolized. House of Cards maybe? I dunno.  *Mark my words* - Your reputation is worth *far* more than your pay cheque. This world is a lot smaller than you think, and it loves gossip because frankly, there is nothing better to do and the work itself is pretty boring most of the time.

Being a *rock* is what you want to be. Your office should be immaculate. Keep your door open (if you have one), and every time someone comes in you look on top of shit, and not stressed. This optic is enormously important.  Your role in the office is the *role-model*. Being the role-model means that other interns (particularly women) will come to you to blow off steam, gossip, complain, ask for advice, etc.  Do not backstab these people, and keep your word. You're their ""rock"" and you want them to gossip about you in this way.

Benefits include you will begin to learn everyone's secrets and where they stand vis-a-vis their competition with you. You will be respected by your peers, and if you're good to your word your *reputation*, which is worth your weight its weight in gold, will pay dividends later on.  The neckbeard who is a mess that came to you for advice could very well become the next Zuckerberg when he realizes that this wasn't for him. You want to be there down the road when he has business to transact, a lucrative job to offer, or a summer place in Italy you can stay in for free (this latter one happened to me personally, not Mr. Facebook,  but still).

3) KEEP YOUR PRIORITIES

As you know, your time is valuable and it's just about to get even *more* valuable. I say this in a qualitative way - you will likely be able to actually calculate your time, whether its by the hour or otherwise. But also a quantitative way - you're simply going to have less of it. When you're going to the office for 7:30 and leaving routinely around midnight, it's less and it takes getting used to. This actually helped me realize the value of my time because I created a function where I calculated the value of my time on a personal level with work by reference to my hourly rate, taking into account the marginal value of personal time.  Here are some tips:

a) Keep lifting, running, boxing, whatever your bag is. It's hard to fit in, I know, but you need to think about it in terms of *weeks* not days. You will need to have the flexibility to stay late on any given day. However, you need a back-up plan to make up for that some time later in the week. 

b) DO NOT PICK UP BAD HABITS.  I am looking directly at you - alcohol, cigarettes and bad food. You will see that most of the 35 plus types are not in good shape due to some combination of these three things (or more sinister vices). Just because everyone else is going for a smoke, doesn't mean you need to.  Also, many of these office types have ""traditions"" i.e. drinking at the first floor bar on Friday evenings, or something like that. Because you are new and trying to make an impression and be seen, you will feel pressured to attend every on of these events. What you need to do here is consult your mentor and ascertain which of the office events are ""mandatory"" and ""optional"", and cut appropriately.  What I did was I attended the casual Fridays one every three weeks. This way it is either once or twice a month tops. People don't care that much, and the best escape is *just leave*.  When your friend nervously comes in to ask if you are ""going to that thing"", just don't be there. Plan B is have something scheduled in advance and make it healthy and awesome - ""I have my boxing class tonight"", or ""I'm playing pick up later, so I can't"".  Avoid these unhealthy traditions.

Benefits include being looked up to for maintaining your health, keeping your own mental sanity (mental health is a very slippery slope in this world, do it for this reason if nothing else), and not being there all the time like a leech because you're doing cool stuff is a positive attribute.  You look like less of a loser.

**Lessons Learned**

Lesson 1 - Wall Street, Bay Street, whatever other street, *is* a brutal world. I would actually say it's probably not worth it in the long run, because it is TRP on Insanity Mode. It's not for the faint of heart.

Lesson 2 - Find a *male* mentor.

Lesson 3 - Don't be a dick (overtly) and always think of your social interactions as a long term investment into your reputation

Lesson 4 - Keep being TRP, be healthy and don't pick up shit habits like the rest of the depressed, typically overweight, squalls. 

EDIT - Emphasizing that this is for big business interns - Wall Street-types.

EDIT 2 - Again, this is specifically for big business.  If there is anyone out there who can't find said mentor, feel free to PM.  I'm a big law lawyer (oil and gas these days), but I have done Wall Street and Bay Street.  Also, my best friends are pretty much all at Sachs or Morgan Stanley.  If it's a last resort, please feel free, might take a couple of days but I'm happy to help.

3zahty,28,2016-01-03,She [23/f] wants to take a break because she does not feel ready for marriage. I [25/m] was about to propose.,GunzBlazin90,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3zahty/she_23f_wants_to_take_a_break_because_she_does/,"This is a long story and as best I try to write it all out and explain it, I don't know if there is a good way. That is my disclaimer. We've been dating for 2.5 years and things have been good for the most part. We've had ups and downs, but its been mostly good. She has been wanting to be married for awhile now and I was not quite sure so we waited for a while. 

Currently, we just barely finished about a semester worth of time apart. She was student teaching and I was doing an internship. Things were not easy, but I visited her twice for about 2 week periods. Both times were great and we felt very in love. The second time I went, I even had the ring with me, but I did not propose because I wanted to do it in another place besides her current location. She was really expecting it and wanting it, and I regret not doing it and I hope it does not forever haunt me. She has been wanting to get married, and perhaps was a littler discouraged. 

She was living by herself and made some good friends. Some of these friends were guys, but we have always been true to each other and shes had guy friends since day 1 without any problems. She started hanging out with this one guy about the time I left for my second and last visit. I noticed the next few weeks things began to be a little off. She did not cheat, but she found herself falling for this guy. I think what threw her off the most was that she became interested in another guy, who wasnt me. This guy believes he loves her, and she ""loves"" him in a friendship manner. 

The sad thing is this all happened about a week before she was supposed to fly out for and early christmas, and then road trip across the country to her parents house for christmas and new years. I figured when we were together again things would go back to normal and she would be like, ""oh yeah I remember how much I love this guy."" That happened to an extent but now she has doubts. I was literally a week away from popping the question. We are just about to end our vacation and she is planning on going back to her area and instead of moving to where I will be (like we originally planned) she is thinking of staying there. She also is highly considering going on a break. She tells me that I am the person she wants to be with. And that she loves me more than the other guy, but she cannot go forward without wondering if she is making the correct choice. She wants to take a break to be sure.

I on the other hand, do not want to take a break. But I do not know what to do. Ive tried everything, and we have been making progress, but not enough to get married. What do I do? I feel like if we take a break now and its long distance then things will just get crappier. 

She says if we take a break I can still visit her (ill be closer than during our distance to be able to drive). She said we would probably still kiss and stuff, but be on a break. Is that a good thing for me? Should I just keep on trying to visit and take advantage of those feelings she has for me and hope that things will work out? I really do not know what to do. A lot of her friends/family have suggested a break to her. She wants to find herself and etc. 

I really just do not know what to do. She is very reluctant to take a break, but also feels like it might be the only thing to make sure we are back together and happy. Any advice or anything would be great. She's told me and I trust her, that she really loves me and wants to end up with me in the end, but just can't do it right now. 

Also she has been stressing a lot about working and where to live. Plus getting pressure from both parents that she needs to figure it out. 

Tl;Dr
My girlfriend loves me and wants us to be together, but might have feelings for a guy she met while we were long distance. She wants to take a break. What do I do?"

As the title says my best friend (we'll call her Betty) kissed me on NYE. I've known Betty for three years now (our sophomore year of college). Over 2015 we got really close and during the fall semester we became literally inseparable. We do all of the stereotypical college best-friend things, call her my wife, and without a doubt in my mind I love her to death. 

On NYE I and a few other friends drove out to her place to spend the night. We got fairly drunk (not the most drunk we've ever been but still pretty drunk) and did all of the typical NYE activities. Nothing unusual happened between us until shortly after midnight when we were cuddling on the couch laughing about something and she kissed me on the side of the lips (not unusual, she kisses people's foreheads all the time and whenever we drink we kiss each other's cheeks and foreheads and stuff). I must have said something to her because she laughed and told me not to make a big deal out of it (not the first time that we'd kissed each other by accident). 

Later that night we were getting settled in to sleep. I was on an air mattress with a friend when Betty told her family (who'd come home just a few minutes prior) that she was going upstairs to where we were and told her fiancee to come and get her before he went to bed. Betty comes in and lays down between us and we start cuddling (this is super common for us, we're a cuddly pair). 

Something feels different though. We're more cuddled than usual (at the time I thought that it was just because there was three of us on the bed) and she starts kissing my cheeks. At this point everyone else is passed out. Slowly I realize that it's not the normal sort of kissing. Its slow and long and her hand is moving against my waist. 

At first I think it's just because she thinks I'm her fiancee (similar height) or something but she doesn't stop and we can hear him downstairs. We're still very drunk and I must've moved my head because the next thing I know she gives me a small kiss. It happens a couple of times. I don't know how much time must have passed. We hear her fiancee coming up the stairs and it stops. He opens the door and we lay still and he walks away. Betty lays there for half a minute and then gets out of bed and goes to her room. I lay there, feeling like an absolutely awful person and confused out of my mind. 

A half hour passes and I'm laying there trying not to cry. I felt sick to my stomach. Suddenly I hear creaking and the door opens again. I'm laying still trying to decide what to do and Betty comes over to me and leans over looking determined. I reach up to take her hand and she leans down, kissing me again. We stare at each other for a bit and I tell her that I need to go to the bathroom. After I finish Betty comes in and takes my hands as I lean against the counter. She's kissing my cheeks again in the same slow way. She keeps asking me if I'm alright and I say that I am and ask if she is and she says she's fine. I ask her what she's doing and she doesn't answer. I tell her that I'm drunk (as if that makes what happened any better). 

I tell her that she should go to sleep. She kinda nods and walks me back to the room I was sleeping in. We stand out there for awhile asking if the other's alright and then I finally tell her that she should go to bed. I watch her walk back towards her bedroom and then just kinda sit in the hallway. 

I decide that I want to ask her why she came back and walk towards the bathroom and then worried that it might be her fiancee walk back towards the bedroom I'm in and sort of stand there. Whoever was in the bathroom goes back to the bedroom and then Betty comes back out. I ask her why she came back and she said it was because her fiancee told her that I was out here. I don't really say anything after that. We kiss again. I say that we should go to bed and she finally nods and leaves. 

I barely sleep that night because I felt (and still feel) like shit. The next morning she came in the room everyone was sleeping in, avoided eye contact with me, and didn't sit with me (which she normally would have). We didn't say anything to one another really and the rest of us left within the hour (some of us had to work). We haven't talked since really aside from the usual got back safe and all of that. I don't think she's told anyone. I snapchatted her a table that I got for Christmas and she snapped me back a picture of her and her fiancee (not uncalled her, just a little unusual). 

I am first off confused out of my mind. Over this past year I've explored my sexuality. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm not completely straight (I'm a D2 on the Red-Purple Scale). I had my first crush on a girl this summer. I've never been in a long term relationship. I've been on dates with a couple of different guys this year but nothing long term. 

Further complications: She's moving into my apartment after break (internship fell through and only had a 6 month lease). We decided this at the very beginning of the school year. We are going to be sharing a bed. It really wasn't weird at all.

I'm in her wedding happening at the end of the summer. 
   
**tl;dr**: My BFF kissed me after midnight on NYE. She's engaged. I'm in her wedding. She's moving in with me. 

(Please don't bash me or her. I know what happened was wrong. I haven't been able to sleep or eat since it happened. I'm just need someone to listen to me and give me an analysis of what just happened.)"

I interviewed twice for an internship leading to a full time position at this amazing company last November and December and I still haven't heard anything back, I called them and they said that they would get back to me, but still nothing, I'm really worried that I won't get the job and that is getting me really stressed out about my future career. My fiancé just got into a car accident tonight, he's alright thank god, he hydroplaned and hit a pole, but he did get a ticket for careless driving.

The worst of it though is last night we noticed that our bunny, Bilbo, was lethargic and hadn't been eating since yesterday (even though he seemed perfectly fine yesterday). We took him to the emergency vet and got him some medicine and food for us to give him. It was going to be a long night, he needed to be syringe fed every two hours, but I was willing to do whatever it takes. We stopped at Wal-mart on the way hoe to get him some Pedialyte and a heating pad (to keep his temperature up). I stayed in the car with him and he died in my arms. We've had him since he was a baby and he was almost 4 years old. He was our first pet together. I know that most people don't think that bunnies are ""real"" pets like dogs, but he was a member of our family and we really miss him. We tried cleaning his cage today but we just couldn't. Someone came and took him to get cremated, his ashes will be spread out over a butterfly garden. We wanted to keep them and take them with us to go to New Zealand so he could rest in the Shire but the extra cost was too high.

We've both cried so much since last night and I'm just feeling so overwhelmed."

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/3uv41b/boyfriends_sister_ruined_thanksgiving_24f_how_to/

I went home (Texas) to see my family over the holidays and just came back to New York. It was a relief to not have to put up with their drama....

However there's a new situation and I don't know what to do...

In early November, my boyfriend and I had to stay at his mom's a house for a few days due to a situation at our apartment. When we came back, I noticed I was missing quite a few things. An expensive sweater I wear to work, a black work dress, jewelry, and my naked 3 palette. Before stuff with his sister and mother blew up, I kept asking my boyfriend if he could please ask his mom where my things were. She said she cleaned and maybe didn't see them and we probably just didn't look for my things. 

As the weeks went on, I kept asking my boyfriend if he had maybe been able to ask again or go look for my things. I didn't feel as though it was appropriate to call her and ask to go look for my things myself given my history with his mother. My boyfriend sent her photos of what the palette looks like... it says urban decay naked 3 in huge unmissable letters on the front.

I especially wanted my make-up and jewelry because A) i wear it everyday and B) it's expensive. 

Today, my boyfriend went over to her house while she's out of town to look for my things. He found my naked 3 palette in his mother's bathroom after she swore up and down she had never seen it. The eyeshadows are completely destroyed, looked like someone dug their nails into the colors, one of the colors is completely missing, as well as the brush that was in the box.

He called his mom and sent her photos. She still says she's never seen it, she has no idea how it got into her drawer, that maybe one of her interns put it there, that people give her so much stuff she doesn't notice things...basically every excuse. 

She also said that maybe i took an apron of hers without noticing because she couldn't find and that we (she and I should be even). 

This isn't the first time she's basically lied about something... just the first time my boyfriend believes me. Recently she's claimed to not have my phone number eventhough she's texted me and called me multiple times. My number hasn't changed in 7 years. Before I went home, she showed her phone to my boyfriend and said, 'See I don't have her number!' She had texted me while we were at her house in early november... I told my boyfriend she deleted it or did something to save face in front of him. I felt crazy even saying that...

His mom also didn't call/text me at all for the holidays, but was sure to leave me a super aggressive voicemail today. She mentioned to my bf she frustrated i didn't reach out during the holidays.

Today was the first time my boyfriend believed me... He got angry and just offered to replace the make-up. It's not just the make-up it's a crazy situation. He's mad at me for telling him to stand up to her about this. 

Is it time to walk away? I don't know if I can put up with this...   

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend's mother is taking my stuff/destroying it and lying...is it time to walk away?"
3zdd0t,5,2016-01-04,Jamie Fischer/Junkie,mehmuffin-,wormrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wormrp/comments/3zdd0t/jamie_fischerjunkie/,"##Jamie Fischer/Junkie

**Age:** 17

**Appearance:** Jamie's a mostly average upper income bracket white girl/high school senior. Patterned leggings, jeggings, skinny jeans, super-oversized sweaters, short short short shorts and the like are all the mainstays of her wardrobe.

Well, they were a month ago. Now she sports a scar inside her mouth beyond any sort of healing, one that pulls her mouth off at an angle into something like a permanent scowl, although when she smiles it probably looks more like Nat Dormer's smirk thing. Her clothes, minus the two or three outfits she has from home, are now utilitarian and cheap, and more often than not insufficient to keep her five foot eight frame from shivering in the winter. Her hair--light brown and wavy--is a confused jumble of knots down to her waist. It frames a face that apart from the scar seems to be trapped with an expression somewhere between mournful and hungry, that is, a desperate face.

**Mentality:** Mentally, Jamie is not in excellent shape. Let me try that again: Jamie is a mental fucking *trainwreck.* She's depressed and fatalistic which is a nice way of saying suicidal but she won't admit it. To be fair, things are better--since she left home, she's been significantly more okay, and her power essentially prevents her from doing anything too crazy as long as she still doesn't have the nerve to attempt in a more direct way. Most of the time she's on top of the world, however, or knocked out on top of it, drugs are her time killing (massacring, really) method of choice. But she needs good to make drugs and money to buy food (Also, food is very nice on its own), so any sort of odd job or chemical someone needs, Jamie is happy to provide.

**Background:** Jamie comes from old money. Her father is a wall st fat cat from a long lineage of slightly slimmer cats, her brother is attending Harvard to many oohs and ahs like her father and his father before him did. Her mother works in pharmaceuticals, making those oh so rare decisions significantly *more* morally bankrupt than the sort her father makes.

None of this ever rubbed Jamie the wrong way. She still can't point to anything that signaled the turning point in all this. But it did turn for the worse--depression, maybe something else, maybe just something sad in her. Bleach seemed as good an exit as any other, better because she'd feel it, be punished for failing at living--and she knew that she deserved that punishment.

She triggered in the hospital, when they were still trying to save her throat and stomach, still telling her that it would all be fine. There were a lot of back room discussions about how the *hell* Ms. Fischer had recovered, none of which saw much resolution. Her father never found resolution, too--he never even managed to track her further than the hospital doors, never heard about the other suicide attempt a few blocks away or the girl who survived it because her power wouldn't let her die or how she got picked up by a rehab clinic and then a shelter, thanks to her ID being safe back at the hospital.

**Resources:** Jamie does not have undue current material resources. Aside from a duffel bag and backpack of clothes + assorted belongings, she's got some scavenged chemistry supplies (most storage and distillation equipment) and maybe a few thousand bucks cash from recent sales of highly illicit substances. The primary reason she's not rolling in the dough from that sort of sale is that she's far too fatalistic and apathetic at this point to either want to give anyone say a pile of explosives or actually try to make serious money herself. 

**Alignment:** Rogueish. Jamie is open to being recruited but naturally not exactly hanging around the sort of place that Wards recruit. Also I'm sure they have something against her substance (ab)use. 

**Equipment:** A dark set of clothes with a heavy hood and upper-face mask + makeup to disguise her looks is pretty much Jamie's whole costume. She carries a knife and phone, wallet, etc, at all times as well. Not carrying any fancy chems around really, although it is my intention for her to eventually start doing that sort of thing. 

**Specializations:** Jamie does know chemistry, actually, insofar as a pretty damn successful high school career and maybe some internship work can teach you. She's also looked into it more online and at the library since it became (extremely) relevant to her. She's done Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since she was a little kid, and now does more along the lines of slightly illegal fighting rings looking to get beaten up (refusing to admit that she's practicing), although she still wins more often than not. More on her physical abilities later, because that ties in heavily with her power.

**Versatility:** Quite. Jamie is new to this and not exactly an expert, so it seems like every little thing she tries is something new. It's not exactly a tightly limited power. 

**Power:** Jamie's internal tissues, mostly mucous membranes and parts of her circulatory system, can reorganize matter around them on an atomic and molecular level, with almost unlimited control. Matter around them means ""things in her body,"" not ""lick the hero to melt them."" In a given day, she can probably consciously affect no more than 35kg of *stuff*, and at no faster a rate than say 1kg/minute, although for complex syntheses probably quite a bit slower. (those seemed like good numbers to start but balance away I didn't really put much thought into how broken or not that could end up being)

All of these things are produced in her body and thus need some sort of way of getting out if she's going to use them: expect her to spit on a lot of opponents. More importantly, though, this means bad things she makes *do bad things to her too*. In many many cases, like poisons, etc, she can mass produce counteragents just as quickly, effectively nullifying their effect on her. For things like corrosives, she can produce buffers fast enough to prevent serious chemical burns, but this doesn't last long before she's melting either from the heat or from the acid--no storing a half liter of acid in her tummy, unfortunately. 

What she *can* do, though, when she has time to think, is say store a liter of *relatively inert substance* in her stomach, along with *also relatively inert substance* in her mouth, but when she jams a finger down her throat to vomit up that first substance and it hits the other on the way out, well, now there's a liter of acid on the ground and she's got minor burns on her lips only.

Most of the time, she needs to understand how to actually make the stuff first-off--either reading about it or playing with a sample she gets to touch, lick, swallow maybe, etc. Not before each use, but just to know a chemical exists at all. For biochem, things are slightly different, because all of those chemicals are already in her body--this is the more interesting secondary unconscious effect of her power. Her passenger actively works to keep her alive and as well as possible, which more or less amounts to the world's most incredible nutritionist and pharmacist having minute control over the chemical balances within her body. Her athletic physique would have been lost within a week after she left the hospital, but her power keeps it going with as little effort from her as necessary. Her diet essentially doesn't matter, as her passenger will break it down into whatever she really needs, and it will also speed up her healing to an almost supernatural level--not an ""while you're fighting"" level but more like she can recover from anything short of serious, serious injury in under a week. 

It also works to prevent whatever shit she pulls with her power--well, protect her from it. The buffers that form where she uses her power to make acids/etc, or the stuff that encapsulates drugs she makes, those are all things her passenger has perfected over time as Jamie did more and more things with her power egregiously inattentive to her own good health. Foremost among those being her suicide attempt by acid-in-body, but we don't talk about it (that scar, tho).

Ummm.... I think that's it. 

**Example:** 

""Ms. Fischer. I'm here to take you to the Baumann Parahuman Containment Center.""

Jamie nodded at the PRT guard, as if she was giving him permission to proceed. He grabbed her, carefully, almost gingerly, resting his hand on her arm rather than holding it, and walked her up the ramp into the back of the armored van. 

Her itchy prison sweats let the cold of the metal bench soak into her legs, not that she was paying attention to her body, right then. She'd licked the off-white cuffs before being led from her cell, and whatever ceramic they had used in them was *incredible*. Strong, resistant to most corrosives, the sort of thing you'd use when you wanted to restrain someone who could use acid. 

Of course, they probably didn't know what toys she'd tried out when she broke into the university a few weeks ago. Sure, hydrochloric, maybe even sulfuric acid wouldn't do anything to these cuffs. But fluroantimonic? The fluorine solution tasted, well, *toxic* as it built up a bit in her mouth, or maybe that was the neutralizing agent lining her tongue and gums. It wasn't needed there, anyway, she was just toying with the ceramic particles left in her mouth. The van was moving now, too, the PRT guard looking at her the way you might watch a bomb you had no hope of defusing or escaping--angrily, frustrated at the simple injustice of the situation.

That wasn't his fault, though. Her friend within the PRT bureaucracy's fault, yes, but not technically Jamie's. She stooped her head, letting her chin drop almost to her sternum. As the buffer built up over her eyes, the world turned white and gray, and then she started to form the acid on top of it. Just a few drops, and she could feel the heat, the burn about to-- 

*Drip, drip.* The tears dropped from her eyes, and the burning sensation with them. As she rubbed the buffer off, she could see a tiny bit of steam where the drops had burnt her lashes. Not enough for the guard to see, but in a moment he'd notice the slowly increasing hissing from the cuffs, and then Jamie's scream. 

Scream she did, drowning out whatever words he managed to get out--she had a ill-fitted PRT muzzle over her face, the same white ceramic plates, so spitting was mostly out of the question, but the second tear hadn't landed on her cuffs, and now, with the cuff chain completely burnt through, still pouring off smoke, she raised the source of all her pain--the hand where the other drop had fallen--to meet the PRT officer's gloved hand. Smoke boiled off of the kevlar on contact with her blood, darker and thicker than nighttime. 

Jamie's eyes and mouth were already sealed shut again, but she could hear the hacking cough the guard gave even as he grabbed her arm and twisted her around, trying to restrain her, prevent the inevitable. She let him choke her, for the moment, she had more important things to focus on, anyway, and-- there. He collapsed, faintly breathing, although the smoke from the kevlar wouldn't leave him that way for long. This next bit would probably use up enough of it to save him, though, if she didn't miss her intended target. A little blood on the rim, while her wrist started to scab up, and the muzzle was slipping of of her face.

It turned out, once you had done it enough times, projectile vomiting became almost *clean*. Hand in, out, just before she started to feel it, and then down, facing the floor of the van with her eyes closed, letting the chalky goo spill out of her stomach. It was thick and grating like a smoothie, with just a hint of something else, but she was already stepping away, mouth clean, could already feel the heat as the makeshift thermite ignited, started to burn through the floor of the van. 

*Five, four, three, two.... two again... * **one**.

*Thank god for swim lessons,* Jamie thought, as she dropped through the freshly-burnt hole in the floor. She hadn't used to be able to hold her breath for nearly that long. She grunted in pain, resisting the urge to roll as she hit the pavement--the van was still moving. But she didn't, nor did she bounce, and as she opened her eyes to the deserted street (apart from the van still moving away, chalky smoke billowing out from underneath it), she couldn't help but let a smile paint her face. *Free at last*. 

(None of the chemical thingies she uses here would be in her repertoire at the start, of course, unless you know of a kevlar based knockout smoke?)"
3zdlw9,2,2016-01-04,Is my [24F] relationship with my boyfriend [25M] is hitting a rut or is it time to move on?,natsq91,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3zdlw9/is_my_24f_relationship_with_my_boyfriend_25m_is/,"I've been with my boyfriend for almost 3.5 years now, most of it long distance. We met during an internship in college. After graduating I took a consulting job.  Since I travel every week, I was able to visit him around once a month on the weekends (he works for his dad in his home state of Ohio).


Around 2 years in, the honeymoon period wore off and I started having doubts here and there, to where we nearly took a break last February, but agreed that we both loved each other and that it wouldn't be fair to our relationship, we would give it a real chance since we were planning to finally move in together. Since I travel, I compromised and made the move to him in September (I'm from Texas) since he already has his job here, friends, etc. 


So...our issues...


SEX: Elephant in the room here. He's the only person I've ever had sex with and I've gotten bored to the point that we rarely have sex anymore.  I feel like he doesn't want to try anything new and he feels like I get stuck on one thing he doesn't want to do, and so we just stopped talking about it. To give an example, it took months for him to even agree to shower with me because he had ""tried it once and didn't like it."" The second main thing is that the only time I ever come during sex is if I handle it myself; for instance he's never gone down on me and every time I've tried to have this conversation I just hurt his feelings or he is offended by what I say, or thinks my expectations are too unrealistic.


COMMUNICATION/DRINKING: He has depression and has a tendency to keep issues to himself, we barely fought for a long time when we first started dating until he let it out one day and I realized he was just holding it all in.  This issue tends to come to a head when we're drinking - his style of drinking is a chill, sit around the house with a couple friends and just hang out and get smashed on a Saturday night. It's a fairly normal thing for him to have a beer before bed, especially if he's having trouble sleeping.  I personally don't like alcohol that much and only like to drink in social, energetic situations like a party, or if we're going out to a bar, etc. I tend to just fall asleep if we're sitting around. When he gets really drunk he has a tendency to get mad at me over some random issue or under-running issue and we usually fight about it all night and then he can't remember a lot of it the next morning.  It's conditioned me to hate drinking with him even more or to pick up his phone calls late at night when I know he's been out.  He switches back and forth between gushing love and anger and I hate it. (Note: he has never been violent). 


TRAVEL/FRIENDS: I feel like the longer he stays in Ohio, the more complacent he gets. His friends aren't going anywhere, they are nice people with good enough jobs but they're boring. I want to travel, and I invite him a lot, which he mostly turns down due to money/vacation time/etc. I try to take this with a grain of salt because I can afford travel much more frequently doing what I do, but I consistently feel like he would rather be at home than travelling with me. I've started noticing that I often prefer to take trips without him too, but it also goes back to the ""don't really have any mutual friends"" thing. 


FUTURE: We have talked about this in the past, and he says that he would be willing to move somewhere else (I don't really like Ohio), once I leave my consulting job and settle into a fixed job where I'm not travelling all the time. I get it - he doesn't want to be somewhere new, alone, while I'm gone. But I LOVE my job. I don't see myself quitting for another two years or more, depending on where it goes. I don't want to continue living here for two more years. He hasn't decided if he's going to take over his dad's business or not, but I'm worried that if he does, we'll be stuck here. I'm also worried that I would be a key factor in him choosing not to take over. I went to California with a couple friends to check out the business school there since they were interested in doing their MBA, and he freaked out and said he was NOT moving to California because he hates the state for some reason but would go anywhere else...which for me threw a lot of doubt into his promises that he would want to leave Ohio some day.  Since neither of us know where we're going or what we'll be doing it seems silly to throw a relationship away for it, but it does continue to be a nagging issue in both of our minds.


I do love him. I have complete trust in him, he's funny, he clearly loves me like crazy, everyone who's met us thinks we're great together, and we're best friends. It's just, I'm starting to feel like maybe I love him as my friend and we're losing that romantic spark. How do I know if this is something temporary that happens in long term relationships, or that it's not going to work anymore and I need to break up with him? 


Since we live together now, breaking up would be a drawn out and awkward affair, as it would take me time (weeks, considering my work schedule) to pack and figure out my living situation if it does happen. 
   


**tl;dr**: Now living with boyfriend of 3.5 years in his state, having doubts about whether this is the one or if I'm just hitting a low point in the relationship.  Sex isn't so great anymore, and we have concerns about where the future is going for us, but we do love each other and he's my best friend. I don't know what to do."

Any advice!?,ChicagoFlyer,golf,https://www.reddit.com/r/golf/comments/3zdsmn/looking_to_get_new_custom_fitted_clubs_any_advice/,"This past season I started to really get into golf as my internship through the winter provided me with the funds to not work and play golf all summer (college kids dream)! I started the summer shooting around a 95 on average. My swing I always thought was fairly good as I took lessons when I was in highschool and what I needed work on was 100yds and in shots/chipping/putting/course management. Come to the end of the summer my score dropped considerably (Low 80s consistently) because I was playing 18 holes 5-6 times a week combined with range practice.

I have never had a set of golf clubs that were mine. Going through highschool and college I had a set of about 9 clubs (Driver, 5, 7, 8, 9, PW, SW, 60, putter (brother's clubs). That was until my senior year summer (2014) in college when my dad gave me his 1990 old Wilson Gear Effect irons when he got his new clubs. I just graduated college and my amazing parents are giving me the gift of brand new golf clubs (PGA Superstore giftcard)! 

I am sure the difference in 25 years of golf technology will have a tremendous impact, which is why I am freaking out on such a big purchase. I have no idea what to look for in a fitter, how to pick out new irons, going with the best feel, etc. I have checked out this sub and noticed high reviews regarding Mizunos and I will definitely be hitting all of them in the store. 

If any of you have any experience at any of the PGA Superstore locations in Illinois I would greatly appreciate it. Also, if any fellow redditors, could share their experience or any tips with club fitting would be great!

Thank You!"

When it comes to inferential statistical methods etc., and the principles of data, I consider myself an expert.
I have had a difficult time finding permanent full time work in this field (of course many of us have). I do however have a permanent fulltime job in sales/banking/finance that pays OK, but of course it is an extremely challenging job and requires some shitty hours.  
At any rate, I have high functioning autism/ autism spectrum disorder, and my poor social skills have certainly been a barrier for me finding fulfilling employment in a job that matches my education and intellect. With that said, most people won’t assume that I am someone with a disability when talking to me. They will just assume that I am a weird dude that they don’t want to associate with.
About a year ago, the extent of the liability presented by my social skills dawned on me for the first time, and I spent months in reflection trying to map out what I should do that would be my best strategy for finding fulfilling work in the long run.
What I have come up with is that I need to get better with programming languages and the information technology side of things, in order to pursue a career in data science.
I am currently studying programming languages and the principles of computing, non-stop. My intention is to compliment my research/data/analytical skills with programming and computer science skills. 
My theory is, that armed with this knowledge, I can pursue a career as a data scientist/ analyst and circumvent the barrier presented by poor social skills. As soon as I am confident in my ability with C programming and SQL I am going to pursue an unpaid internship if I have to in order to start building a solid reputation etc.
Am I correct in thinking that Data Scientist/ Analyst is a good field for people who are socially awkward? And honestly I’m not the type who is going to do a whole ton of nutty inappropriate shit in the office. But I desperately need an environment where I can be a quiet person who keeps to themselves, and is allowed to sound a bit awkward or odd when I give a presentation to co-workers or discuss some findings with my manager.  
Or perhaps you people out there have some different advice for me? Perhaps I should pursue a different field where social skills are not as imperative, or maybe you think I should invest in improving those skills.

3zf0oj,22,2016-01-04,"Me [22 M] with my Girlfriend [22 F] of 18 months, are we at the point of no return?",howdoifixthistaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3zf0oj/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_18_months_are/,"Hey guys. This is a wall of text, so I'm sorry. Today she told me we're breaking up unless I convince her otherwise. It's pretty awful right now and I feel sick. I love her.

My girlfriend (we'll call her Lacy) and I met in English class about two years ago. We got together six months later after she had messaged me over the summer asking if I wanted to get dinner and we ran into eachother at a party. 

I had been involved with a girl over the summer and basically broke it off to be with Lacy. We quickly became best friends and while I didn't want to enter in a relationship so soon after being in a quasi-relationship that summer, things got serious. There were a few instances where I wasn't as into us as she was, and she told me she needed more out of me. Every time this happened, instead of leaving I realized how much I cared for her and apologized and changed my behavior. One example is that at first she felt like I was ignoring her in public, then she talked about wanting to be in an official relationship. I was concerned that things would change with a title, but she told me everything would stay the same and that the title is just a title. This was music to my ears, and soon after we started dating. However, it wasn't long before I made a terrible mistake and hooked up with another girl. Three weeks later, I broke down and confessed, and she gave me a second chance. I couldn't believe it and put my best effort forward. 

On New Years last year, she returned from a trip with friends and I had missed her immensely. I realized I had started to fall for her and when she returned I told her I loved her. Everything for the next few months was absolutely beautiful and amazing. We were both in school but were spoiled by how often we spent time with one another. It was magical.

However, around mid-April tragedy struck. Lacy's best friend and roommate was murdered by a man subletting their house. It was a complete shock that nobody saw coming. The next few weeks saw a whirlwind of emotion with the funeral, me graduating college, Lacy getting accepted for the internship of her dreams and us moving in together a few hours from home. I was there because I loved her and wanted to, but it was also true that she needed me there to help her through her intense grief and trauma. 

Over the summer she worked at her internship and I quickly found work as a camp counselor. It was a tumultous time but we made the best of it as a couple. I hated my job and didn't feel fulfilled by it while she was in the job of her dreams and using her work and me as outlets for her grief. 

When the summer ended, I moved two hours north to my parents house while she returned to school. It was hard for us to be apart, and I realized I had some issues that were pent up causing me to rely emotionally on her. Overall, we were both emotional wrecks for a lot of this time but we still loved each other. My issues ranged from depression to insecurity about finding work despite being a college grad to worrying about my sexual past. I have only slept with three women and realized that the track we're on (talking about engagement, marriage and kids) would leave me feeling like I am missing out on something in life. These issues came up every other week or so but we agreed that once I find work and visit therapy it will be better for me. 

I visited therapy and made an effort to find work. I went to two sessions, and they helped. But I realized that my insurance was not covering a lot and it was too expensive for me to maintain. In terms of work, I started working as a part time teacher and made good hourly wage, but lacked a lot of hours. Lacy was tied up with needy roommates, a dog and a heavy course load, while of course also juggling her emotions with me and trauma. She did a lot for herself, including visiting therapy, church and doing a lot of cleaning and selling of old items. 

The semester ended, the holidays arrived and our plans together solidified. We would move in together back in the town where she had had her internship, because she was now doing a co-op. It was hard for me to abandon some of the prospects for work I had at home, but I resolved to keep doing my part time teaching on the weekends and commute up three hours every Friday. Luckily, we were also able to find a fortituous housing arrangement that would save us quite a bit of money. 

Reddit, I haven't been happy the past few days. I feel depressed and antsy for not having a job, and while I'm happy for her I'm jealous that she's starting work now. I understand these are negative feelings. Furthermore, I feel trapped. The theme of not having enough experience came up again and I told her I wasn't satisfied with the amount of people I've been with. I know this is hurtful for her to hear but I had to say it. I love her a lot but it seems so hard to trade up having casual encounters and sexual freedom, something I've never really had, to be with her forever. I'm so conflicted. She told me it's basically over. I told her today I loved her and she said go fuck yourself. I've never see her like this. 

Guys sorry I'm rambling... I feel like I'm going crazy. Is this relationship doomed? Did I fuck it all up? How can I forget about being with other women? I feel shameful thinking about it but it plagues me. This is like torture right now. 

TL;DR: Complicated relationship with a lot of emotions. I'm not my best self. I feel like I've fucked it up. GF told me its over unless I truly convince her otherwise.

3zfjx0,3,2016-01-04,"Law School Grad Confused About How To Prioritize Loans, Refinancing Loans, and What Monthly Amount to Aim For",lawgradconfused1416,StudentLoans,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/3zfjx0/law_school_grad_confused_about_how_to_prioritize/,"Hi everyone, thought I would write this up (I did try to search for very similar situations, but I was having trouble finding all my answers and was admittedly overwhelmed by reading so many posts - I'm happy to read links to other posts too):

I graduated from a private law school in May 2013. Struggled with internships and a small law firm stint gone bad, and I didn't have a stable position until April 2015. I didn't really do loan payments until this May 2015 (lots of IBR being zero at most points). I now work at a stable government job. I acknowledge one option would be the 10-year forgiveness plan, but if I don't go that route (I don't think I would wanna be in government that long, but I suppose it still could happen)... and if I assume I will join a new position with a better financial situation in a few years (and one that won't give me loan forgiveness), I am struggling to figure out how to best attack my loans. 

I'm making 53k annual. I have about (1) 162k in both Stafford and Grad Plus loans (about 70k at 6.8% and about 90k at 7.9%) with GreatLakes and (2) ~13K in Perkins loans (at 5% for 6.5k from my undergrad and 7k from law school) on ECSI. IBR has me at $389 a month for GreatLakes, along with monthly payments for Perkins loans. This total minimum requirement adds up to about $554 required. As is, paying this amount only covers interest on my GreatLakes loans, no principal. I realize I need to change this if I don't go the forgiveness route.

I tried to refinance with CommonBond and SoFi, to no avail. CommonBond wants a co-signer, and I'm not sure I can do that, while SoFi declined. I didn't try Earnest yet, but their prelim check didn't seem too confident. I also see some posts that seem to make me think refinancing isn't the way to go, but I'm not sure. 

I pay about $650 a month for rent/utilities. No car payment (it's paid off). I have little in savings, so I have wanted to send $100 a month to an AMEX personal savings fund and about 200/mo to a Roth IRA (just started doing that in May 2015). Then, I was thinking of trying to pay $1000 a month in loans. That seems tough to pull off, but something that I should strive for. And I don't even think $1000 is enough to do much damage to my loans as is. But I can't keep just paying the minimum payments unless I plan to stay for 10 years, right?

Should I try for $1000/mo or a different plan for attacking loans? Keep it at minimum IBR payments while I figure out next steps, whether or not I stay in government? Is there something I'm missing in terms of refinancing loans? Should I stop doing my AMEX savings since its so much lower interest rate than what the loans are doing to me? What about the Roth? Perhaps after a certain point to give myself a nest egg/security blanket? I feel very indecisive about what I should do. "
3zfn6v,10,2016-01-04,"Canadian moving to your city next month, and I'm looking for places on Craigslist. What are some typical Craigslist scams I should avoid?",marsmel,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/3zfn6v/canadian_moving_to_your_city_next_month_and_im/,"I'll be moving to LA with another person, and being Canadian we're looking for a two bedroom (hopefully) furnished place within the Silver Lake area for under $2000.

We're going to be moving there for internships and are hoping to secure a place before then. Problem with that is, we won't be able to be physically there to tour the place/meet the landlord, so we're relying on Skype tours.

I've contacted one listing, located in a good area and saw some pictures. Two bedroom listed for $1600/m. Landlord says there's a few other people interested, and the current tenants don't leave until the 20th so he can't tour it until then. If I want to secure the place, then:

*To secure the unit for your move dates you will be expected to make a reservation booking payment of only the first month rental fee of $1600 plus the refundable security deposit of $1600, total $3200. This will enable me remove the unit from the rental market and have it secured for your entire dates accordingly because of the rush from other prospective tenants.*

*Reservation payment are strictly made securely via the bank so that my property account officer can have your payment documented and issue you a receipt upon confirmation of your payment in the bank.*

*Before any form of payment, you will have to fill the rental lease agreement and reservation form, have it signed and sent back to me via my email or fax for my records.*

*When I receive the filled lease agreement form from you and everything is OK, I will now allow you to proceed for reservation payment.*

*The reservation payment is fully refundable in an event where after viewing you change your mind (which I strongly doubt) so you do not have to be worried about this as it will be clearly stated in the rental lease agreement form and it binding between us.*



I've read on other posts this seems scammy, a typical bait &amp; switch. So how do bait &amp; switch scams work in LA? I've read over the leasing contract and it definitely states the fees are refundable if I back out. I would of course love to secure the place, since I've read here as well that good apartments go quick and you need to act fast.


Any knowledge on avoiding traps would be appreciated. Thank you so much!"

Thanks!

If you asked my parents when they first thought I would be an attorney, they would probably point to when I was five years old and tried to get out of trouble by exploiting what I thought was a loophole. “No Mom, I was just swinging my arm in a circle and he just ran into it. It’s not my fault, see?” -My- moment of realization was far less devious. Perhaps at some level, it was when I realized that I masochistically enjoyed researching state statutes and administrative regulations. Or maybe it was when I realized I was pretty good at the whole writing and speaking thing. In all actuality, the moment I understood that I found my calling was when I realized that all the talents and traits that I possessed could be coalesced, could be formed into a rational plan of life, one that involved a career in the law, one that would allow me to do the most good for myself and my community. To understand why this is the case, I look to a few key factors in my development; extracurricular involvement in public policy and “real-world” experience working in banking regulatory compliance.

It was with my external experiences, beyond the safety-net of college, that I was able to start developing my plan. Over the past two years, I have had leadership experiences in student government that pushed me outside into the world of public policy. As the Student Governing Association’s Chief Economist and the State Relations Director, my major initiative was developing a medical amnesty policy for our university and our state. To this end, I threw myself into reading every state law and university policy that I could find. Building on these, I crafted a policy and a state law. However, I knew that for this to truly work, I needed more than a stamp of approval from our student government and our administrators. I made sure that we reached out to the community; the police officers who arrested these students, and the doctors who saw the dangers of underage drinking. I wanted more than anything for my personal work to become a collaborative, community based solution to a community problem. That wasn’t enough for me, however. The policy wasn’t going to be able to save students beyond the walls of campus or a high school student in Lindsborg. When it came time to write the legislation, what I submitted, despite scrutiny from attorneys in the Revisors Office, emerged virtually the same and became Senate Bill 133. After introduction, I spent several months working tirelessly with lobbyists, meeting with legislators, providing testimony to committees, and monitoring committee action. As a result of hard work and some tense moments, the bill passed the Senate with a high margin. My work will continue on this law in the 2016 Legislative session and I will continue until this becomes a law that can save children across the state of Kansas. I am driven to make sure that I leave an impactful legacy on my organization, my institution, and the state that I call home.

Although my time in SGA government relations was certainly influential, the capstone of my time in public policy occurred during my internship with the Kansas Association of School Boards. I had an experience that most students working in Topeka never did. In large part, this was because each of my bosses took it upon themselves to treat me more like they were mentors rather than employers. Rather than ordering me to get coffee or make copies, each one taught me valuable skills. Scott took the time to give me advice on writing press releases and allowed me to eventually publish my own. Mark , the director, made sure to involve me in meetings with other lobbyists, senators and the interviews with the media and pass on his knowledge about school finances. Tom showed me the reality of the process. A former history teacher, he enjoyed quoting Bismarck and his core philosophy, “Laws are like sausages. It is better not to see them being made”. He stressed to me that as a future attorney, I would be wise to be unafraid of the process (perhaps like a butcher at sausage making). If I knew how laws were truly made I would be better at interpreting them in the long run. He made sure I understood every detail of the complicated nature of lawmaking, from the backroom deals to the best ways to present testimony before a committee. Tom helped me excel further in the reading between the lines of the law, the importance of legislative intent and the communication of complicated issues. Thanks to these mentors, I was able to articulate analysis on KPERS, tax proposals, and school finance to everyone from my peers to elected officials. They truly made me a capable policy maker, negotiator, and leader.

Although the extracurricular activities I took part in gave me a love for public policy, it was my experience in the “real-world” of employment that gave me a more practical sense of what I wanted my future career to look like. Within the first month of school I began a job at CFNB. At a basic level, employment gave simple yet invaluable experience on working in a corporate environment, quarterly reviews, office politics, reports and so on. It was within my duties themselves that I seemed to find a niche. Starting as an “imaging” clerk, I realized that I could use the job as a way to learn about how banks exist in the legal world. Over a few months, I had to learn hundreds of different types of documents. In my free time I would read over the documents I scanned, learning about how loans were to be built, what made up mortgages or deeds of trusts and so on. Three months later when I was thrown into the auditing world with nothing more than a regulatory guide book, this experience made the transition much less painful. I excelled in compliance work, not only because I enjoyed it, but because my intimate knowledge of our documentation helped me understand what was right, and more importantly, what was wrong.

My work on real estate loans forced me to dig into files, look at them as a complete picture, trying to understand what the officer was doing so that I could then properly apply the law. I learned how gray areas of the law could be and the thought process and research necessary to properly apply the regulations in our work. Even something as “simple” as determining the purpose of a loan or property type required skills that I could have only learned with experience. As I looked more to a career in law, I realized that my experience working in compliance would give me an edge if I were to work in banking law. I have been in the trenches, I know the struggles that audit departments face, the demands of regulatory agencies. Whether I worked for a Treasury agency punishing wayward banks or for a firm representing a financial institution, I would be able to see from all sides involved in a way that many others may not.

As I look forward into the future, I can see now what I want to accomplish. I want to build off the successes I have had, I want to continue to benefit the public, and I want to continue working in a field that I enjoy. To this end, pursuing a law degree is the perfect culmination of all of my undergraduate experiences. My work in public policy and experience in the banking world can be combined with training as an attorney to finally round out my rational plan for life, to finally accomplish the dreams that I have had since childhood and help make sure others can accomplish theirs as well."
3zgr72,0,2016-01-04,Close friend (24F) is a sugar baby to a married man and I can't get past that.,throwawayforever987,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3zgr72/close_friend_24f_is_a_sugar_baby_to_a_married_man/,"My friend (let's call her B) and I are really close. We met in uni, but our friendship feels like I've known we've known each other for longer.

She's been with me through some terrible shit (breakups, nasty exs, fights with parents). She's someone I could talk to about anything and give me solid advice. During our 3rd year, B confided with me and our other friend (who I consider my closest friend/sister, who'll I'll call C) that she was diagnosed with mild depression. She's since then gone to therapy and I can see that it's helping her.

During uni, B never dated anyone and she's never had any boyfriends before. She did have a major crush on a guy in our program though. Like a lot of crushes, it went away when he graduated (he was a year older than us). Since him, she's never shown interest in guys. We (C and I) ask her if she'd want us to introduce her to anyone, or help her set up a dating profile for a couple of sites, but she shrugs it off.

She's met C's husband and my ex bfs during the years, but she never gave off any interest in meeting a guy for herself. She admitted that she's trying to be self-confident, so she rather work on herself than get involved with another person.

B took longer to graduate because of her depression, so she graduated 2 years after C and I did. During her last year, she got an internship in the field she's interested in and that's where she met someone. She swears this isn't a relationship, but they've now been together for more than a year. The thing that really threw off me and C.. he's 48 years old! (We'll call him D). D is an executive for a company that B's company was contracted to work for.

She lost her virginity to D, and he also was her first for many other sexual milestones. She seems pretty happy, and he's given her a lot of expensive gifts (no allowances). I'm worried that for someone who went from 0 dating/relationship experience to having a ""fancy FWB"" thing with a man twice her age, it isn't healthy?

She swears it's purely sexual and I believe her. And before ""daddy issues"" comes up, I've met her dad plenty of times, and she's basically the female version of him personality wise and they have a good relationship. He's the one who suggested she go to therapy for her depression.

Since after meeting D (who she's still seeing), she met another old guy (she never disclosed how old he was, but she said ""older than my dad"") at an expo her internship's company was participating in. She swears she didn't do anything sexual with him. C and I grilled her, but we believe her since she was always honest with us before. After B graduated, he landed her a job through his connections.

Now she works full-time in her field, but through the old guy, he introduced her to a man (E...), who AGAIN is much older than her. Like D and the old guy, E is an executive (who C and I think is the more ""famous"" one of the three). He's given her ""cash gifts"" (which C and I concluded were allowances), and plans to take her travelling, but C and I are upset that he's a married man (D on the other hand, is divorced).

B was very nonchalant about his marriage, which surprised me because it seemed very out of character for her. She isn't a prude or conservative by any means, but I thought she was someone who valued monogamy. She's never spoken ill about his wife, or anything about his wife for that matter. From what she's told us, I feel that they're estranged (or that's only the side he's sharing with B). B's words were ""if it wasn't me [that E wanted], it would have been somebody else"".  That rubbed me the wrong way, but C and I dropped the subject.

Other than her 'romantic' relationships, B seems the same. She's still focused on her career, she plans to go for graduate school. She says that her being with these men (D &amp; E) won't last forever, but she wants to ""enjoy it while she can"".

tl;dr: Close friend went from 0 dating/relationship experience to sugar baby for a married man. Her apathy towards his marriage rubbed C and I the wrong way."

First of all, happy new year :)


So, I'm a 24 y.o. Brazilian and I graduated in Biological Sciences. Since I didn't quite like the course, I took a 1 1/2 year of Graphic Design classes (the intensive course, since the other one lasted 2 years) and I created my portfolio. However I have an aunt who lives in the US and I honestly wanna leave my country, so I'm aiming for portfolio schools in the US that have a good job prospect.


I have visited MAS Miami location last year and the place was really nice; the director was super kind and all. I also loved the fact you could study and intern abroad for such a long period of time. The biggest issue for me is the tuition cost, since 1USD = 4 BRL, which is a lot :I But I'm saving the money to be able to attend a really nice portfolio school.


I was looking at other threads here on reddit and seeing divergent opinions about MAS, CC and VCU.
My biggest issue is that, since I'm not a citizen, I would have to get a job right after I finished the classes (while I still have a visa). MAS told me they can provide a visa extension for some students to be able to go to agencies and try to apply for jobs? I have talked to Miami, Hamburg and Madrid campuses about this. Hamburg said they can extend the visa to 6 months or so, but I would have to check with the embassy first. Madrid said 3 months, and Miami 6 months.


I would like you guys' opinions on that, please? As detailed as possible? I just really wanna go to a great portfolio school that will give me the chance to be employed in USA.


If you have attended any of these schools, how was your experience and how easy was it to get a job when you were done?


If there are any foreigners that applied to any of these schools, then how was it??


Overall I guess I just wanna listen to what you guys have to share with me, because since the tuitions are so expensive, I wanna make sure I choose the right school for me. And the more experiences I read, I guess the easier it is :)


Btw I just mentioned MAS, CC and VCU because those were the ones I saw most people commenting on!
If you attended any of them and are willing to donate a bit of your time talking to me about it, I would also appreciate it very much! I would really like to go into a lot of details since the decision is crucial to me!


Thank you so much :D"

Most of you wont follow these posts, and even more of you probably don't give a shit, but I am doing this for myself. I am not doing this for you.

For those of you that do stick with me for the next 14 days...I promise I will do the right thing and show all of you my junk at the end of the 14 days..maybe by then I'll be able to at least get a half chub goin!

I am not quite sure how to write this, and this is also most likely going to be my happiest, most optimistic post on this..considering I am faded right now.

Alright, so for those of you that stuck around;

*Who:*
	I am in my mid 20's. I have a degree from a decent university in Structural Engineering, despite being hooked on dope for 3 out of the 5 years I spent in college. I have a very loving and supporting family, and we never fight/argue. They put me through college so luckily I have zero debt! I have started my career as a project engineer for one of the largest construction companies in the world, and I have an amazing girlfriend who I plan to marry in the next year. I am good looking (not trying to be conceded. I am by no means ""hot"", but I am attractive in my own ways. In other words, you would never suspect I'm a junkie.

*What:*
	I have literally done just about every drug out there. From shrooms/acid to meth. I started smoking weed at 13, and have smoked just about every day since. I tried Coke for the first time when I was 16, and have never really been a fan. I only do it when my friends offer while we are out partying. My brother introduced me to oxy when I was 18, and god damn I loved that shit. I got hooked pretty fast, and within 3 years I was almost failing out of school. I took a semester off to do an internship in a city I have never been, and quickly found an oxy dealer. it wasn't long before I was fired from my internship, and I confessed to my parents and moved back home with them. I transferred to a school near by, and of course an old buddy from my hometown sold oxy. It was a few months before he told me ""hey dude I don't sell pills anymore, but I got boy. It's hella cheaper for a better high"" I remember saying ""nah, I'm good"" while driving through my neighborhood after turning around because I could no longer pick up pills. I remember the moment I parked on the side of the street and said ""you know what? Fuck. I'm sick and I'm going to try heroin"".

You all know how it goes from here. I never went to class other than test day, but luckily I am good at last minute cramming, and I made A's on every test I took, but had 0's on most all quizzes and homework. I graduated with a shit GPA by the skin of my teeth. I didn't know I was going to graduate literally until 3 days before the ceremony when my teacher called me and told me he bumped my grade up from a 32% to a 89% (because I wrote him an excel program that he can use with the students every semester to save time on building tables, graphs, and analyzing data...so I graduated, failed a drug test for my first job offer, and passed it for my second, better, job offer. (I interview well). A few months into working a getting paid very well, I relapsed again bad. I am in the middle of that now doing a gram a day/every other day of ECP.

*Where:*
	U.S.A - Southeast....that's all I'm tellin ya

*When:*
	Day 1 is tomorrow, 1/5/16. Day 14 (my final day of the documentation a.k.a Dick Pic Day) will be 1/19/16.

*Why:*
	First and foremost, heroin/drugs are going to ruin my life, and I am planning on living a kickass healthy life with my future wife and children..which leads me to reason number 2: I absolutely LOVE my girlfriend, and for some reason..she LOVES me too. God damn it is an amazing feeling to be loved by somebody this fucking amazing. I can't go into too much detail, but she is also an engineer. Valedictorian of our graduating class, straight A student, smartest girl I have ever met, DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS, funny, extremely loyal, loving, kind-hearted, beautiful. If she found out I was still using drugs she would most likely leave me, and even if she didn't I would die knowing that I am putting her through that pain.

*How:*
	Right now I still have about 0.5g of good ECP. I ""plan"" on spreading that out over the first week, then using lope for the second week....but to be honest I think I am about to go to a little bump right now. I only snort, and have never used a needle..so I guess I got that goin for me. I have about 4 Xanax bars as well to help me sleep. Maybe I'll just pop a quarter of one now instead of doing a bump so I will pass out. But from then on it is going to be cold turkey. No drugs, no weed, no cigarettes.



To everyone who read all of this, thank you. In about 4-5 days when I run out of H and the actual withdrawals kick I will be singing to a different tune lol.

I am not sure how to continue this for the next 14 days..should I do an update (Day 1: ~~~) (Day 2: ~~~) in the comments section here? Or should I make a new post every day? I might need a little help from you pros out there. I am on mobile and really don't know how to go about doing this.

I really think this journal/diary(gay)/documentation is going to help me stay on track, and hold myself accountable. Any encouragement from you guys would really make me happy.

My daily posts will NOT be this long, I swear lol. This is just an introductory post to let you guys know who I am, tell you about my habit, and explain what the purpose of this is.

Wellllp. I'll talk to you niggas tomorrow for Day 1!!

I promise to reply to each and every comment you guys leave me here. I look forward to taking this final step, and documenting the whole thing for myself, and hopefully for some other struggling addicts.

Cheers everyone!

Goodnight,
H

One morning, he received a tip about a new patented algorithm that was predicted to revolutionize the app market as we know it. Anyone not on board would be left in the dust. He knew in his gut this was his next big break. He set up a bitcoin transfer and bought the rights that day. It soon became apparent however that the algorithm had ruined the app. The team knew it, but Kurt remained optimistic. They listened in silence as he told them not to worry, it would push them straight to the top once the other tech companies started catching up. ""It's all about the long term,"" he said.

As mentioned above, I am an American college student who has been lucky enough to travel for work for a month. To make a long story short, I have an internship that allowed me to pick an international component and I have always been incredibly interested in visiting Scotland. I have heard nothing but amazing things from all my friends and family who visit there frequently and I could not be more excited to be there for a month. My questions for all of you are pretty basic and straight forward:

What are the things I have to do while there? What should I avoid? Are there any stereotypes of Americans that I should be aware of? Where do I get the absolute best scotch? Things to do during the week as well as weekends. Anything of that nature.

On a side note, I come from a very very cold climate and I'm used to winters being in the -35 degree range (celsius) so I am fully prepared for the cold. 

On a more important note, I am a huge football fan. Although I mostly follow the Premier league, la liga, bundesliga, etc. I need a Scottish club to support so what team should I begin supporting? 

Thanks for any help/advice/comments anyone can share. Like I said, I have always admired Scotland so I just want to make the most of it while I'm theres."

3ziwin,2,2016-01-05,[ROLEPLAY] Ahmed's version,mailorderoctopus,worldpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/3ziwin/roleplay_ahmeds_version/,"Ahmed sat and watched this mess unfold, interns scrambling with copies, people shouting in Arabic, papers flying everywhere. It truly was chaos in every sense of the word. He had hoped that organizing a rally for the SLC would be an easier task, apparently not. But it would certainly help him in his bid for President he supposed. Ahmed Al-Assam was a organizer for the SLP and was one of few people who were in line to become the new president of Palestine. He was chosen due to his ""outstanding charisma and passion towards the cause of the SLC"" which was a nice way of saying ""you were the last guy on the list"". 

""HEY BOSS!"" a man shouted over the ruckus

""What is it Mahmoud?"" Ahmed said calmly as he sipped his coffee.

""SOME ASIAN LADY WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. REPORTER OR SOMETHING""


He had a negative experience with reporters, they had always tried to undermine him as ""inexperienced"" or something like that. But he had a feeling that maybe this time it would be different?

""Let her in won't you?""

""YES SIR!"" Mahmoud ran off.

Ahmed then sat there with a blank stare. He hoped that this reporter was cute. He had been hassled by his 3 brothers over a lack of a wife for the last 3 years, this infuriated him and always caused him to storm out of lots family reunions. Perhaps if he was able to snag a foreign girl he'll be able to make fun of their, to be quite honest, ugly wifes. The reporter walked into the chaos. Ahmed swallowed hard, yep, she was cute. Black hair, freckles, and she was fairly curvy too. She looked quite stunning even if she was only in a t-shirt and jeans. She approached his desk and he stood up and stuck his hand out. 'Don't fuck this up' he thought to himself.

""Hi! I'm Ahmed Al-Assam, I mean... you probably already knew that but... whats your name?"" He fucked it up

""I'm Maria Chan, here's my Virginia press pass so that you know that I'm not a spy or anything."" She giggled. He smiled

""Oh don't worry, I'm sure you're not! Uh... Please take a seat!""

""Thank you Mr. Al-Assam""

""Please, call me Ahmed.""

""Well I only have a few questions to ask you today Ahmed so I won't be long.""

""Sounds good to me, but I wont be missing much..."" He gestured to the kerfuffle in the background. Maria giggled quietly but quickly put a serious face on.


""So, are you surprised by the Socialist-Liberal Coalition surging in the polls recently""

""To be honest yes and no. I'm not surprised that people are supporting the only officially Anti-Roman parties after their actions in the balkans and neglect of our country. But I'm surprised to see so many people joining our cause, what do the polls say now? We'd get 57% in an election.""

""I see, do you think that the Socialist and Liberal parties will remain in a coalition? Or is a split possible?""

""This is off the record, but if the socialist party gets a majority of seats we'll dissolve the coalition. On record, our two parties will never break and our loyalty to each other will remain strong forever! ... Wow, I sound like one of those crazy people up in Europe right now! He laughed and Maria cracked a small smile.

""And last question, are you in a bit for the head of the party?"" She asked

""Yes, I wish my colleagues in the bid for head the best of luck as well."" He didn't mean that, his colleagues were a bunch of assholes who just wanted the head role because it looked good on a resumé.

""Alright that's all Ahmed! Thank you for having me at your office and I'll be in touch if I want to ask any more questions.""

""Well its less of an office than it is a death trap..."" Ahmed muttered and Maria looked him in the eye and said

""You're quite charming I must say, I can see why they want you in the race for leader."" Ahmed was a very good looking man, 6'7"" had a slight beard and was fairly well dressed. Something about his demeanor seemed very attractive to Maria and she wanted to get to know him better. SHe had always been cautious when choosing men that she was romantically interested in, but she wanted to experiment. What happens in Palestine stays in Palestine she supposed.

""Hey, do you want to go out to grab a coffee or something sometime, off record of course. She asked nervously. Ahmed looked at her shocked, he had never been asked out by a woman before, it must be an American thing...

""Uh... Sure! Yeah here's my number if you want it, to further elaborate on our plans or whatever"" He wrote his number on a piece of notepad and gave it to her.

""Thanks, I'll text you later about it.""

""Alright! Uh yeah sounds good. See ya!""

""Bye!"" She gave a playful wave and started walking to the door.


-----


When Maria was outside of the building she held her watch up to her mouth and said

""Red leader, Code: 36221 Valens""

""Authorized. What news do you have Agent Colombera?""

""The SLC headquarters is disorganized and messy. They don't seem like they could run an effective campaign, let alone if we sabotage it."" 

""Good work Agent. Did the target suspect anything?""

""Not a thing sir. I'm going out with him at a later date to ascertain more information about him for discrediting him.""

""Perfect, continue on your course Agent. Glory to the Imperator. Over.""

""Glory to the Imperator""


----
21:47

Ahmed felt his phone vibrating in his pocket. He saw the name Hajar and almost threw his phone at the wall in rage. But he had to pick up, he had no choice

""What?"" He said angrily

""Hows the politics coming?"" Hajar said his words very deeply and slowly

""Great. What do you want?"" 

""Well a little birdy of mine just told me that you had a visit from a reporter....""

""And?...""

""Well I don't think she'd like to know who you used to work for..."" Ahmed nearly snapped his phone in half.

""You fucking terrorist son of a bitch fuck off!"" 

""Well I didn't make you join our 'organization' did I?"" He said mockingly

""What do I need to give you so that you keep quiet.""

""An extra $200 a month, but $300 would guarantee that I keep quiet...""

""I'm already paying you $1200 a MONTH! How much more do you want?!""

""Shut up! You got yourself in this situation bomberman, so shit the fuck up and give me the money or you're done for!""

""You're fucking despicable.""

""Says the famed Cafe Bomber.... $1500 next month, or else.""

Ahmed hung the phone up and threw it onto his desk. And fell into his chair and began to cry.

3zki7f,1,2016-01-05,I (20F) want my (23M) S/O to move in with me. How do I convince my religious parents(who are also my landlords)?,mer0ma,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3zki7f/i_20f_want_my_23m_so_to_move_in_with_me_how_do_i/,"** REPOSTED FROM YESTERDAY TO INCLUDE MORE INFO. **

I am in school renting a room in a house that my parents own(but they do not live in). My boyfriend has graduated and makes enough money to live on his own, but I would like for us to move in together, and not because either of us are in financial trouble. I think this is essential when you get serious in a relationship to see if you are compatible when it comes to living arrangements, chores, finances, etc.  We have been together for over two years. I have 3 semesters left.


My parents are against us living together. They are not against our relationship. I have been telling them that I think this is a great step in a serious relationship since before I was dating my SO. 

I live in a 5br duplex (3br on my side, 2br on the other). I have one other roommate and one unleased room. The girls on the other side are more like neighbors than roommates, so they wouldn't care. My SO has similar habits and we are all very tidy people. My roommate is completely open to the idea because they get along as friends, and it would make our rent/utilities cheaper per person. 

I need help convincing my parents that this is a good decision. Leaving them out of the process is not an option because they control the leases and help me with my tuition. I already work almost full time (when my unpaid internship is included) and I am a student. My parents do not profit from my rent, so it's a beneficial financial situation. I want them to understand that I am a responsible adult capable of making my own decisions based on my morality. 

   
**tl;dr**: religious parents own the house that I rent from, I want boyfriend to move in. help.

I did a search but noticed that my case is rather unique so I typed out this post.

**Some quick info:** I'm turning 22 next year, Chinese Male and was born in Phoenix. For the past 10 years I have lived with my Parents in the also sunny city of Singapore (South of Malaysia). 

After some reflection over the past couple of months I have decided to move on from Singapore and start afresh back in the States. Currently, I have around 8,000 USD in savings along with a GCE 'O' Level Cert (Equivalent to a High School Diploma) and a Diploma in Mass Communications which I earned from a Local Singaporean Polytechnic (Some credits are able to be transferred). Furthermore, I have experience working in a Public Relations agency for around 6 months as an Intern.

As of the moment, I have no friends or family over in Tempe and will be touching down with not much help. Thus, I am looking at roommates rather than renting a place on my own for the first 6 months to help me make contacts and friends in the area. My mid-term plan is to work part-time or full-time for about a year to gain some Residency rights and then take my SATs to get into a Communications Degree at ASU. Long-term wise, its get into the field of Public Relations/Media which I love and am comfortable with.

I will be moving sometime in March/April so I'm wondering if its too early to be searching for rentals/roommates at the moment?

**Couple of questions:**

* Do you guys think my plan is viable thus far?
* What kind of neighbourhoods are suitable for someone like me?
* I notice the rental is around $500 - $700 a month with a roommate is this viable with me working full time? Wouldn't want to touch my savings much except for initial start-up costs.
* I chose Tempe because of its reputable Public Transport system, does it live up to the hype?
* Other than that, I would love to know about the Nightlife and culture in Tempe, I decided to moved out of Singapore because of my desire to find myself in a more culturally vibrant place as well. Does Tempe fit that bill?
* Lastly, what is the right pronunciation of 'Tempe'? 

Cheers and have a good day ahead."

3zl4cm,83,2016-01-05,"""I just got a job in advertising"" advice thread",mikefaley,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/3zl4cm/i_just_got_a_job_in_advertising_advice_thread/,"Recently I've seen a lot of threads announcing new jobs or internships in advertising and seeking advice. Someone recently announced a new job asking for advice -- I jotted down some advice and the OP deleted the thread. Womp.

It might be worthwhile to coalesce advice for new folks just starting out -- my previous notes are below. Please add to/disagree below if any vets have advice -- or if you're new, ask specific questions.

Congrats on your new gig! Getting the foot in the door in the agency world is one of the biggest challenges. From here, progress and forward momentum are generally a bit more fluid -- so that should make you feel pretty good. I speak from a background in analytics, account management, and strategy, with about 6 or 7 total years of experience based mostly out of NY.

-I imagine one of the biggest learning curves for you is going to be adjusting to working at an agency as a whole as opposed to adjusting to your new job title and responsibilities. I say that because agencies are weird. Almost all of them. And the industry has its own quirks and oddities that take a while to catch on to. Don't worry about this though -- just keep your ears and eyes open. Watch how people act. Specifically, watch the most successful people and how they act. Track how they speak with confidence, research things ahead of time, ask a ton of questions, offer to pitch-in and help others, and lead interesting lives outside of work. These are soft skills that will be incredibly important as your career continues taking shape -- and advertising more than some other professions relies very heavily on your reputation and your personality.

-Seek out mentors. No one starts out good -- but the people who wind up being good in this industry are those who aren't afraid to ask for guidance. Figure out who you connect to, who you admire, and seek their guidance. This will snowball eventually and before long, you'll have a nice little rolodex of awesome people. As your career takes shape and you begin thinking about your next move, this network will be absolutely vital. Not to mention the osmoses that will take place of simply being around great folks.

-Start following the industry. Advertising is absolutely chock-full of people talking about themselves, so never stop reading about what people are saying. You're obviously doing that on reddit already, but follow adage and other like-magazines, as well as follow other agencies that you think produce good work. This will help you begin to form a barometer for what is good work and what isn't, as well as helping you develop the language of the business. Eventually, when you overhear some folks say ""did you see droga's new whatever-the-hell"", you'll be able to contribute to the conversation.

-Expect to work. A lot. Really. This can't be understated. Junior employees in this industry are the coal that gets chucked into the fire that moves this industry along. It's awful but that's the way it is. Most agencies will expect you to work long hours for very little pay, with a ton of pressure. The positive side of this is once you do this for a few years, you'll be cut from stone -- meaning, you'll be good at job your and marketable-as-hell. The pay will start going up as you go from title-to-title and agency-to-agency, and before long, you'll be the one throwing the associates into the furnace. I'm being dramatic here but the point is to expect long hours.

-This industry is hectic. Just about everywhere. Unless you're going to a stodgy PR firm, expect little organization. Expect last-minute-asks, ad-hoc requests, unreasonable clients, and too-short deadlines. This happens everywhere. It's not unique to your agency and won't be solved by going somewhere else, most likely. You'll start to notice that the people complaining about this stuff are relatively young, and the people fixing the problem or just getting work done are the industry vets. Just get the work done, try your best, and go home. The industry insanity never goes away.

-Most important piece of advice I can give: be positive. This industry is full of self-important people that love to put other people down. Don't let it get to you and don't turn into one of them. Being aggressive in your career is good, but do it with a smile. Help out others. Don't sabotage your coworkers or talk shit about them. This will help you out in the long run by giving people you work with a positive experience, but also will make you stay alive inside in an industry that can gobble some folks up and turn them into industry zombies.

-When it comes to your job and responsibilities, because of your level, your job should mostly consist of being a sponge right now -- soak up as much knowledge as you can from literally everyone in your department (and outside your department). Listen well. Do your best. Hardly anyone gets fired when they're trying really hard -- so just keep trying your best and the rest will fall into place.

-Also, don't get too drunk at the parties and throw up everywhere. It turns you into a punchline. Every agency has someone that does that and it hurts their credibility. If you want to get hosed with your agency friends, go to a bar without everyone else. This sounds silly, but it's actually pretty important. There will be lots of parties and getting too wasted makes you look young."
3zl6kk,1,2016-01-05,Addendum Opinion,ijustwantaJDugh,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/3zl6kk/addendum_opinion/,"
My GPA is pretty low. 2.6. My major GPAs (English Literature and Political Science) are higher, it was mostly my beginning GECs that killed me. I also have a full resume with several internships, great recommendations from my professors. My first LSAT was a 158. I took it again the next registration, 159. Took off a year, poured myself into it, did it again, 165. I increased 8 points and 14 percentile from my first. 

A lot of things changed within these four years. I grew up in a really abusive household, and for me to be able to go to college, my father made me live at home. It was a difficult environment to try to thrive in, and although I've been dealing with the abuse my entire life, it peaked in college around my junior year. My GPA is so low because I wasn't able to attend classes sometimes, or I was too distracted by things at home. Attempted suicide, lots of recovery time. As it goes. I was depressed, but I came out of it pretty solid. My GPA has an upward trend after I returned to school, my best LSAT was taken after I went through all these changes. My last semester, I retook the courses I had scored the lowest in, and I got As in all of them. (I'm not sure this was a good idea or a waste of a semester. I had enough AP credits when I came into school that I was ahead two semesters. Instead of graduating early from college, I added a major (Political Science), and somehow still had my last semester open to do whatever I wanted. My advisor said it would make a minimal effect on my GPA, but I still wanted to do it so I could point to something and show that I was capable, that what happened before wasn't the best of me.)

SO. In conclusion, I'm nervous as hell. I'm smart, I'm capable, and I'm dedicated, and it breaks my heart that my GPA doesn't show that. But I'm a little lost as to how I can convey everything that was going on. I know a lot of people have awful family lives, and they handle it a lot more gracefully than I did, so I'm not sure how to convince law schools that I'm better or that I'm worth taking a shot on.

Here's what I have for my addedum so far. For the love of God, rip me to pieces. Let me know if it sounds whiny or as if I'm searching for pity or if I think I'm some angel. None of those are true, but times are hard and law school is unfortunately the dream. Let me know what you guys think!
_____________________________________________________________
""I grew up in an abusive household, and that continued throughout college. The first two years were very trying. I had a job, and I paid my own tuition - taking loans out for what I couldn’t cover - but I had to live at home. My parents don’t come from a culture where a 17 year old girl was allowed to be independent, even for her education. So our agreement was that if I was going to go to college, I had to live under their roof. 

Some days, I had to miss class because there was war breaking out in my household. My parents were screaming, and my mother was crying, and I would stay home to take care of her. I would stay home to make sure he didn’t hurt her. Some days, I couldn’t go to class because the bruises my parents gave me were too visible. Some days, the ones I gave to myself were. I became really really depressed the beginning of my third year, and I tried to kill myself. It was miserable and terrifying and lonely, like all tragic things are. It took me 8 months to recover. I learned a lot. And I came off stronger than I could have imagined on my best days. It was very hard, it was very trying. But once I knew what I wanted, my life became a lot easier. I needed to be in control of my life, I needed to live for myself. I’m so incredibly blessed to be where I am now. I’m only sorry that it came later rather than sooner.


I committed to going to law school at the end of my junior year. I knew it was what I wanted with every ounce of me. I wanted to have a legal education that gave me the power, resources, and ability to enact change. But I was afraid that I decided too late, that I wasn’t going to be able to do my best. I took the LSAT in September of 2014, and I got a 158. I shook it off, and I blamed nerves. I took it again in December. 159. The day I got that score, I sat on the floor in my bathroom and cried. Usually when I was disappointed, I gave up. I’m happy to say this time was different. I decided to sit out a year after graduation, and pour myself into studying. 

This december, after 18 months of LSAT based nausea, I got a 165. I went from 77th percentile to 91st. And I’m so pleased to be able to show proof of my commitment and ambition. 

I love my education. And I’m devastated that my GPA doesn’t reflect that. If there was one thing I could tell you, one thing I could persuade you of, it would be that my education means more to me than anything else. I think, often, humans don’t realize the value of something until it’s taken away. And I’ve had mine taken away. The day I graduated was one of the happiest of my life.""

3zldlq,6,2016-01-05,"Well, it's happened, and I can't understand my state of mind..(I'm 23m, she's 20)",thesacred0ne,survivinginfidelity,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/3zldlq/well_its_happened_and_i_cant_understand_my_state/,"This is unfortunately the first post I'm creating on Reddit. At this stage, I'm just feeling extremely isolated, with nobody to talk to which has never happened to me, and this really felt like a place where I could try and find some peace/vent. I also apologize in advance because this post may be long. So, this is my story, being written at 3 am, at my girlfriend's parents house...

I met my current gf at university, 2 years ago and I just graduated this October. Funny enough, I met her through being thrown out of one of the campus accommodation houses (for partying a little bit too much), and by moving into a new place where she just so happened to live. So in a sense, even at the very beginning of our relationship, we sort of lived together. This would become the single best thing that has ever happened to me. She was the best thing I could've ever asked for, and everything was just...perfect. Amazing experiences together, great sex, and what seemed like a great future ahead together. She is my first and only girlfriend, and I just so happened to be her only serious and long-lasting relationship, and the only guy her parents ever liked. We got our own place in 2015, with two more mutual friends. Life changes though. I definitely wasn't going out as much anymore, considering it was my final year. I was looking for jobs/internships, while sorting out visa issues after I graduated because I was making this big decision to move countries for her. However, mind you I made sure I did not neglect this girl even for a second. Spontaneous dates, flowers, gifts, weird sex stuff - it all happened. She took me on a ski trip where I got to touch snow for the first time (originally from the tropics!). I hit a really hard spot when the weight of visas and jobs hit me near graduation. She really got me out of it though, and gave me that push to just go all out and I did, acing all of it. Got my visa, got a casual job before graduation and had an extremely well paying internship at a top finance firm which I'm doing now.

Now this is the sad bit. My very 3rd world parents came over for my graduation, and I introduced my girlfriend to them in person for the first time. It was amazing. They loved her, and she thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent together. My parents, for the first time in my life, saw me as an adult and not their little boy. And she had a lot to do with it. 

I leave with my parents for a week though, to take them around big cities. I then noticed that SO, suddenly has become much closer to one of the roommates who's an absolute slut (no ambition, in debt, regular drug use etc), which was surprising as they always had their issues. SO starts going out more, and there's a lot of drinking. I come back, and I definitely notice this change. Because I had more responsibilities and a general lack of interest for partying at that stage, I didn't go at all. 

That is until one night, where I decided I just graduated so screw it, I'm having some good fun. Pre-drink with my SO on a bottle of vodka, most of which I drank and we head off to a club. I didn't know what hit me. I was extremely drunk, and both of us met up with other mutual friends who were already there. I mostly didn't manage to hang with her that much this particular night as others were pulling me away. She was mainly with this friend of mine I had known for a long time, longer than her actually. Soon enough, I had reached a point where I had no idea what I was doing, so my SO puts me in a taxi and send me home. Only thing I remember was asking the driver to go through drive thru. 

We live our normal lives for the next couple of days. One day during a conversation that I can't exactly remember, she says something about the point of my life. I say it's you, and she bursts into tears, claiming she doesn't deserve me. I thought it was quite adorable and gave her love because man, my words were sweet enough to make her cry! Fast forward, this drinking and going out habit continues, and one night she stays at my neighbour's (best friend) house till 6 am after a night out. This was the turning point to me starting to connect dots. She tells me all of them drank and she passed out there. I think...sure, it's extremely weird but I've been there, but I still remain suspicious. I've got to point out that we have always been extremely open with phones and social media. So one day, I just randomly see my best bud message her on facebook about our mutual friends going out and a party being rather dead. Normal stuff I guess. The next day, I check her phone because I was curious that he was messaging her individually over the group chat, and I couldn't find any messages from him. She had deleted them. That was it. I go straight to her, and ask why the messages weren't there. This caught her completely off guard, and at first she tried to say the stupidest thing. 'Cause I just wanted to delete them'. I was very persistent and she finally says 'We had DM's the day she passed out at his and he started getting too attached afterwards'. Sure. But at this point I was just extremely suspicious, and it finally all made sense when she comes home one night from going out, and saw the huge bunch of flowers I had brought home from work for her. She drunkenly bursts into tears. I knew with all this alcohol in her, this probably wasn't a good time. So I waited till the next morning and told her unless she tells me whatever it is that she's hiding, I'm not going to have anything to do with her. She sits on the bed, bursts into tears and hesitantly says 'I can't tell you, because I'm scared of you'. I'm assuming this is in reference to me always saying that if she ever cheated on me, I would dump her on the spot. 

Turns out, she cheated on me that night at the club where I was sent home, with my friend. They talked, kissed, went to the carpark or whatever and had sex. I could not for the life of me believe it. Everything just instantly got destroyed and even writing about that day feels like going straight back and at this stage you're already getting bored of reading this. First thing I tell her to do is text this dude's girlfriend and confess. That happened, and I learn a couple of days later that they broke up, to which I get a nasty message from this absolutely delusional deadbeat who thought there would be no consequences. My SO claimed that she was very stupid, and alcohol definitely played part in it. She desperately wants to make it work with me. And my best friend? He was the only other person who knew. Messages were deleted to prevent me from finding out as they discussed this. I've done my research enough to know that nothing happened between them.


Through all of it, feeling like my heart was being ripped out of my chest every second, I saw her face covered in tears and remembered who she was. She sure didn't come off as the love of my life, but deep down I knew I couldn't just stop loving her like that. My life as I knew it was turned upside down from that day, but we talked a lot and decided that slowly, we should give it another shot.

A month later, here I am. How has the relationship changed? Lots of rules. She no longer drinks, and on the rare occasion she does, she asks for permission.  No going out, and I generally know exactly what she's doing. We are slowly trying to do things together too, although it's been very hard for me to be the initiator I've always been. Physical contact is hard, telling her sweet things is hard....it's almost as if I see someone I love and the cunt who put me through all this pain at the same time. And I have nobody to help me deal with it, as all our friends are mutual, and I can never ever tell my family.

How have I changed? I can't even explain it properly. I have moments where I get angry and fantasize about huge wolves tearing my SO and that dude to pieces while it was happening (I asked her to tell me details, which was a mistake). I have moments of deep depression where I just can't take on life anymore. I don't trust anyone and I don't like anyone. Sometimes I pinch myself to feel ANYTHING. I feel like I am pretending to live life. I used to blame myself most of the time, but now I have begun to move past that. My future seemed great, and now the whole getting married bit we always talked about is not there, purely because I can't trust her. These holidays got even worse as I got invited by her parents for Christmas, and it really hit me hard, pretending to be part of this 'perfect' thing. 

As for her? She really is trying. Anything and everything really. She cries to me about how much she regrets that one moment and how much she loves me. I am at the point where my mind I think, is starting to heal a little bit and I am trying to move forward with everything....but this weird loneliness is just overwhelming.

This made me feel a lot better though. Nobody might read this, but I felt like I was talking to someone. It scared me that a lot of relationships that go through a second chance don't work out. But I love this girl so much, that through all this pain I'm giving it another shot. Apologies again for such a long post, and thanks for any replies :)"
3zlev4,5,2016-01-05,"Me [19 F] with my crush[24 M] have hooked up a couple of times, is he insecure/hesitant, or am I nothing more than a booty call?",lekkerdekker,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3zlev4/me_19_f_with_my_crush24_m_have_hooked_up_a_couple/,"I've gotten involved with this guy, and I know I want something more. I have the feeling he might, although I lately have been getting the idea I'm a booty call.

It started after a party. We'd all taken a variety of drugs so we were aftering at a friend's house. My phone was dead, I didn't know the way home, and I was extremely tired. One of the guys, let's call him John, offered that I could crash at his place and he'd take the couch. I'd spoken to him before but I didn't know him all that well. While I was changing he got into the bed, asked if I didn't mind. I got the feeling at that point he would try to make a move as he was flirting with me (changed spots to sit next to me, arm around me, checking me out). Shut him down, but the next morning we ended up having sex. It was surprisingly intimate, with a lot of foreplay and kissing, showering together and getting a cup of coffee afterwards.

Didn't hear from him for two weeks, and never gave him my number. He ended up getting my number from a Whatsapp group I was added into and texted me that day. It was a weird text, saying sorry he disappeared on me and that that wasn't nice of him. The day before this happened a friend asked me about him, under the impression we hooked up, but that he was far more interested than I was. The conversation was pretty weird as it was a little bit flirty, but very opaque as to his intentions.

I was more direct after we texted for a bit, nothing really serious. I'd asked him to keep the hook up secret as I don't want a reputation, but friends were talking about it. At another party we went to, I was being chatted up by a guy and he was subtly watching me and avoided greeting me for as long as possible because I was talking to this other guy. Hence I figured he might be interested, and flirtly hinted at the next time.

As soon as I said that, he said it couldn't be at his place because of his housemate and whether he could come over. I said sure, just that I had to shower etc. When I took over an hour, he got pretty impatient. It's about 15 minutes between our places, but he cycled it in 10. However, we had sex, chatted for a while. It surprised me how much he shared about himself, struggles at his internship to which bus he took and so on. But he didn't sleep over, saying he forgot his laptop at home and what an idiot he was. Next morning still got a text saying his work issues had been resolved. Mixed signals in my opinion.

After he cancelled on going to a party with some mutual friends due to health concerns, I texted him asking how he felt. He ended up inviting me to hang out with some mutual friends of ours. When I got there he was looking at me the entire time, telling weird jokes and gauging my reaction, talking about series we'd both watched.

We hooked up once more, him staying the night even though we both had issues falling asleep. I was tossing and turning in my sleep, having nightmares and he held my hand and calmed me down when I jolted awake. We'd talked, him mentioning he went out with some friends the day before and how his friend was hooking up with all these ugly girls. He explicitly said he hadn't done so, not being interested that night. So for me it was confirming he was interested, namely because we always cuddled after, kissing a lot, and him telling a lot about himself. Now he was evenn implying monogamy. On the other hand, he texted me on the day itself, getting a little pushy about meeting up when I said I couldn't. My plans ended up falling through so I was able to make it, but that made me feel a little like a booty call to him.

During my holidays he texted me once asking what's up. I've gotten the feeling he's a shitty texter, always giving short replies even when he initiates the conversation. I also think he's pretty insecure, being rather surprised I'd have sex with him. A mutual friend even mentioned it, saying he was rather insecure and hesitant about girls. We do attend a technical university, so guys lament the fact that any attractive girl has a line of guys giving her attention, so why join the line and get lost in the crowd?

Now I've texted him asking if we could meet up this week, and he responded saying he was going to be rather busy for the next couple of weeks due to his internship and working on some academic papers to submit, and that he wasn't sure if he had time. This is making me alarmed. I've been getting mixed signals the entire time. On the one hand, every time we meet up it's decided on the day of. He is quite busy and always has a lot going on though. He doesn't text regularly, and the convo's are short. He'd actively avoided planning for a couple of days from now. On the other hand, he once expressed concern at our age difference. Why would it bother him if I'm nothing but a booty call? We talk quite a bit with eacher when we see each other, and he always with quite a bit of bravado as if he's trying to impress me. If I were to describe the physical side, it's really sweet, sweeter than with my ex-boyfriend. He likes positions where can look at each other. He markets himself as available. He makes sorry attempts to start conversations that won't lead to us having sex. I get the idea he's quite nervous when we're together as he asks if I find it annoying/offensive/insulting when he teases me or makes a joke etc.

But I still have a nagging feeling I might be a booty call. 



   
**tl;dr**: Got involved with a guy. Mixed signals all the way, not sure if he's insecure and hesitant, or if I'm nothing more than a booty call. What's your take on his feelings towards me?"
3zljrr,9,2016-01-05,Does anyone else feel completely stuck?,Fuckingthrowaway88,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3zljrr/does_anyone_else_feel_completely_stuck/,"Even though I technically could be honest about my feelings of depression and the misery that I am currently experiencing, I can never bring myself to do so. I can't believe that I'm still too scared to change my life, even though I hate it so much. I knew college was not the right choice for me after I finished my first year, yet I was too afraid to disappoint my parents, so I continued to go. Now I'm on winter break, and it's my junior year, and the thought of going back terrifies me. I have no friends whatsoever, nor any interest in my major. To make matters worse, my parents are dead-set on me finishing internship applications before the end of my winter break, and I have no desire to get an internship, mostly because I don't have any desire to be at school in the first place.

I've had a few nice moments of catching up with old friends and family during my winter break. I miss having people in my life so much. But even in these few moments of ""fun"" that I've had over the past couple weeks, there is always a dark cloud hanging over my head, because I know that my life is going on a course that I absolutely hate. But the problem is that I'm completely STUCK. As much as I hate what I'm doing right now, I have no idea what else  I could do... I feel like I've gone too far down this hole and I can't climb out at ths point. I doubt I'd feel any happier working a shitty job or going to a different college. But at the same time, what I'm doing now is so obviously not working out for me. If only I could just walk away from the path I'm on without any consequences, but it's just not that easy. I'm stuck."
3zm0uy,51,2016-01-05,Starting to love pharmacy again. Been a rough year.,OOTPDA,TalesFromThePharmacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/3zm0uy/starting_to_love_pharmacy_again_been_a_rough_year/,"Life is good. 

Last year I did my internship, which was long and stressful, made even more so by the fact that I worked in a busy pharmacy for award wage (which is easily $10 an hr else than what some of my mates made).
This pharmacy consisted lastly of one off customers we never saw again, who wanted quick fixes but gave no info, and addicts. So. Many. Addicts. And about 85% of the customers were rude and pushy- so much worse than any other pharmacy I've worked in.

 I had another job lined up after the internship with an acquaintance from work who left to run his own pharmacy, so light at the end of the tunnel.

Anyhoo, I get registered and go to see my prospective employer about that full time job and he tells me he hasn't got one for me any more. And he's known for a few months. And he didn't tell me. 
So, I was pissed. And stressed. 

After a week or so of frantically applying everywhere I could think of (and puking my guts up cos I thought I'd become jobless and homeless and starve to death), I got 3 full time days a week at a sole pharmacist pharmacy, which I start today! And I'm working on some more part time jobs too (I did 2 locum shifts yesterday and the day before at another place and they said they'll keep me as their back up). 
And I have 1 day a week as a receptionist in a medical centre, which isn't pharmacist work but it pays.

So, its looking much better. I won't starve to death. And the customers at these new pharmacies are very sweet and open to listening and generally lovely. It's so great to feel like I'm helping and doing something rewarding again!

And I applied for my honours on clinical pharmacy this week!

And it's my cake day!!! 

Life is good. It's not perfect, I still need more work, but I'm getting there. Just thought I'd share."

Having suffered with insomnia for my entire life, I was no stranger to two-a.m. television. In fact, I consider myself something of an infomercial aficionado. Most people don't believe me, but I swear on my mother's grave that I once saw a Billy Mays commercial where he didn't have the beard.

So when I heard the long, flat tone of the Emergency Broadcast System, I didn't pay it any heed. Stations were required to test it periodically, and if they could do it when most people were sleeping, they did. But what got my attention as I debated between the Cool Ranch or Spicy Nacho Doritos was a familiar voice calling my name. Through my television, at that.

""Uhh... Is this Steven James Pratt who lives on East 6th street in Des Moines, Iowa?"" the voice asked, accentuating each part of my full name as if he were reading from a cue card. I stared at my television in horror. In the muted background, a semi-attractive housewife was smiling about how easy cleaning up a pile of quarters was with her spiffy new vacuum. But in the EBS banner, instead of a test message, it simply repeated my name and address over and over. I wondered if everyone watching could see this.

""Yes, that's me,"" I eventually answered the announcer.

""Listen,"" he continued, ""I tried calling you, but it went right to voicemail, and you're clearly not reading your emails. We were about to send agents to your door, but since we're already paying for this service, we figured it might be faster. There's simply no time to lose."" It suddenly struck me who I was speaking to.

""P-President Obama? Is that you?""

""Yes it is, Steven. Listen: America needs your help, and we need it now.""

""Wait, Mr. President. Sir.^your ^majesty? How are you doing this?"" I paused for a second, a thought having just occurred to me. ""And how can you hear me?""

""Steven, I have the NSA and a personal access code to the Emergency Broadcast System. Every television sold since 2002 has a wiretap and two-way screen installed. Do you really have to ask?"" he said, his voice suggesting that this was all common knowledge. ""As I said, we need your help.""

""Yeah, of course I'll help, Mr. President. Whatever my country needs."" My head was beginning to swim as visions of invading hostile nations alone danced through my imagination.

""As you may know, two weeks ago, you posted a recipe online for purple sweet potato ice cream. Michelle wanted to know if we could substitute Splenda for sugar instead.""

""Umm... No?"" What kind of emergency was this?!

""Damn. Looks like I'm sending an intern to Wal-Mart for real sugar. I don't know why she insists on keeping this fake stuff around. I mean, I understand that it's better for you, and I can't tell the difference if I put it in my coffee, but it just doesn't work in recipes. I can taste the difference, the girls can taste the difference; Hell, even Philip Mpango can taste the difference, and that man can't taste shit.""
""Umm... Who is Philip Mpango?"" At this point, I was completely confused by his long-winded rant.

""The Finance Minister of Tanzania. Nice guy, can't taste anything. Well, anything except Splenda. Listen, I think we'll try a batch each way, see what happens. Have a good night, Steven."" And with that, the EBS banner disappeared, and I was alone with my Doritos and vacuuming housewife once again."
3zmc08,1,2016-01-05,20F4A The Hucow Facility,TimidTigeress,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3zmc08/20f4a_the_hucow_facility/,"Emily and Olivia shared a giggle as they walked down the labyrinthian corridors of The Facility, with Arianna crawling fast behind them. Well, as fast as a girl can crawl with the ankles and wrists chained up. And of course, she hadn't heard the name 'Arianna' in some time now. She tended to go by Hucow 0021 for the most part.  
  
""Of course, Hucow 0021 was a rather special for us to acquire here,"" Olivia informed Emily, the new intern. ""She was handpicked up our CEO, Scarlett Williams as a personal Hucow. She worked unknowingly with us under the guise of a Secretary whilst we secretly fed her a concoction of lactation-inducing foods. One day, she complained of milk dampening her blouse, we hooked her up to the milkers, assuring her that the procedure would not take long. And that is when we chained her gagged her, and well; you can see the rest"" Olivia beamed as Emily kneeled down to stroke the blushing Arianna / Hucow 0021. Arianna of course remembered the day vividly, however many months ago it was. She would have uttered a complaint, if she were not ballgagged.   
  
The days since working in The Facility blurred into one, however. ""She is usually strapped to the metal apparatus we found her in. A tube in her mouth to feed, a tube at her nipples to milk, and a tube up her bottom to... Urm... Cleanse, enemas, that part isn't quite my speciality."" Olivia trailed off as Emily nodded.  
  
Arianna's blush deepened in shade. The enemas were the worst part of the day, of course.  
  
""And because this little Hucow is just so beautiful, some of the girls come in to her own room during their breaks to play with her; plait her hair, give her a spank, train her how to moo, whatever they see fit! Oh, as long as Mistress Williams approves. Arianna... I mean, Hucow 0021 is her personal cow, after all.""  
  
""So what about the other hucows? Were they all tricked here?"" Emily asked inquisitively.  
  
""Of course they were, silly!"" Olivia admonished back. ""Why do you think we keep them gagged? We offer ripe girls jobs as secretaries, administration, whatever anonymous jobs. After some weeks of controlled feeding, we deem them necessary to Hucowify... And yes; that is a verb."" Emily laughed in response.  
  
""And if they misbehave?""  
  
""Oh, you needn't worry. There is not period they are not tightly bound. But there are some punishments; caning, electrocuting, public humiliation, whatever incentivises them to keep producing. We keep our girls healthy for longevity, so you will notice their breasts do not grow beyond a D-cup at the absolute limit.""  
  
Emily scribbled note in her handbook.  
  
""But what about the boys you capture?"" Emily asked as they approached a double doorway at the end of the corridor. The hair's on Arianna's body stood up as she trailed behind on her leash and collar.  
  
""Watch and learn"" Olivia grinned as she opened the doors to reveal a warehouse with 50 men, all bound to chairs, with identical tubes running through their gags, and into their bottoms for waste. ""We can be a little rough, farming semen,"" Olivia explained. ""Mistress Maisenbacher, our German farm expert specialises on discipline on both Boys and Hucows, but she finds a natural concoction of vitamins appropriate for Cows, and viagra and no visual-stimulus for boys a necessary procedure"".  
  
Upon closer inspection, Emily gasped as she noticed the intense expression of anguish on the Men's faces as they were milked, tubes stimulating and sucking the semen straight from their raging cocks. It was collected through transparent pipework to a tank in the ceiling.  
  
""Marvellous, isn't it?"" Olivia smiled to herself. ""So, where do you fit into all this, Emily?""

I was just wondering, how do people here survive after school?

I'm a highly-ranked junior CoE and even I don't feel like I learned anything that I can offer the market. Applying to internships I realized I *really* don't have anything to offer.

And so many of my colleagues are like failing or barely passing, meaning they have even less to offer. Some don't even know basic programming, which is wtf because they literally don't have any other jobs they can hold.

And let's not get started about the CS students. Literally all of them are scrubs, copy-paste 100% identical code cheaters, or both. Yeah a lot of CoE's are cheaters too (i.e. 100% of IEEE members are 100% cheaters), but at least many others fail tests with dignity. Also it's worse for CS because their entire careers will involve writing code.

Those cheaters skate by because professors don't give a fuck, but what about the real world? Alumni, tell me how your colleagues survived.

Regards,

SmallCokeDaddy"

December 2014: So december 2014 my (now ex-) boyfriend broke up with me, after we had both had a long period of stress with university and exams. We were living together in my apartment, so he had to move out. 

December 2014: Afterwards I decide to try to move on and after a week of constant crying, I'm finally starting to feel a little better. Then the day before christmas eve he starts messaging me, saying he still loves me and wants me back. I still loved him, so I said yes and we agree to try to work on our relationship after new year's eve. 

January 2015: Then we enter 2015, and suddenly he takes it all back. He claims to be confused and does not want to see me nor talk about it. He says he's not sure what he wants. I try to wait for him to make up his mind, but he sends very mixed signals; he texts me that he misses me and loves me, but also says he's afraid of getting back together and being seen with me. He is very concerned with what his friends will think if we get back together. I'm naturally very hurt by his behaviour, and I tell him to either prove that he cares more about me than what other people think, or to leave me alone so I can move on. He says he wants to win me back and prove his love.

February 2015: For Valentine's Day he asks me out and we have a wonderful date. I finally think that he has made up his mind, and casually ask him what he thinks about our situation. He tells me that he is still confused and not sure if we should get back together yet. I'm shocked but I give him a chance.

March-June 2015: We text and sometimes call and talk to each other, and our relationship is very stressed. At times it's really great and we talk a lot - other times he ignores me, won't answer my calls or my texts, and I get frustrated. 

We go out a bit more after this, but we mostly end up seeing each other once a month. It often goes like this: We text/talk really well and I start to think that he's finally trying to get back together, then he ignores me for a long period, I get frustrated and tell him I can't deal with these mixed signals, he says that he loves me and that he will prove it ""soon"", then the circle repeats itself.

June-August 2015: During the summer he's away for a few months (for an internship abroad), but we plan for him to visit me for my birthday. I ask several times if he will be able to make it, to which he says yes. Two days before my birthday he cancels. I'm heartbroken. He convinces me to come visit him in stead, and so - for stupid ""love""-reasons - I go.

We spend the weekend together and have a great time. When I come home we continue to talk a lot, but he says that he is still not ready to be a couple. I'm baffled and extremely frustrated. 

September-October 2015: I end up telling him that I'm done with this and that I can't let myself be treated this way. I start ignoring him and try to focus on my studies. He then starts being more persistent - he comes by once a week to hang out and slowly but steadily he manages to convince me, that he is serious this time. Then of course one day he canceled our weekly date, then the next one... and the next one. Back to not seeing each other and minimal communication via phone/facebook.

November-December 2015: I decide to move on without telling him - after all, every time I had told him that it (whatever ""it"" was) was ""over"", he would send flowers and act nice for a few days, and thus convince me to wait for him again, only to be ignored for weeks afterwards. It was a brutal loop that I needed to get out of.

December 2015: By December I'm feeling strange. I realize that a year has passed and that I haven't moved in any direction since the break up. I still have very strong feelings for my ex, since I truly and honestly believed that we were meant to be together, but I can't ignore the fact that he hasn't shown any true interest in fixing our relationship. He is able to be romantic once in a while, but he is unable to keep a spark going and when he finally promises to talk more and call more often, it only lasts for a few days before it ends.

I haven't mentioned all the times he canceled our dates or didn't show up at all. All the times where he promised to ""prove his love"" and then did nothing. Or when he promised to send a text every day (he managed to keep that up for 3 days). We had been together for 3 years prior to the break-up, we lived together and had even planned on getting a dog (his idea). It felt like he wasn't at all willing to put any effort in fixing our relationship, but he always talked about it. Always talk, but no action.

And so, in December 2015 I removed him from my facebook and told him that it was over. He reacted by inviting me to the movies; we had a great date. Then new years hit, he sent me some very sweet messages.

And now here we are. January 2016. I've decided that I don't want to repeat 2015; I don't want to wait for a guy that is clearly unable to do anything. I've waited for 1 year for him to prove to me, that he loved me and wanted to get back together. I can't deny that I still have strong feelings for him. But I've been hurt and disappointed too many times.

If I could I would go back in time and prevent our break-up, because I was happy with him before and I could be happy with him again. But I'm tired of feeling like I *need* him. Because I don't. Do I? I don't even know why I've waited a year for him. And even if we get back together *now*, we will only be together for 6 months; because then he will go back to his internship and stay there for another year! So why bother? 

If he can't show me that he loves me... if he can't make me believe it, then I shouldn't give him any more chances, right? And if his lack of communication frustrates me and makes me so unhappy, wouldn't it then make more sense to just move on? He has clearly proven to me, that he can't change.

It would make sense to just forget about him, wouldn't it?
Then why can't I?
Am I going mad? Why is this happening to me? What should I do? 

So many people tell me to forget him and move on - and I want to! I want my sadness to end. But I just ... can't leave him. And I don't understand why... It's like there's only him in the entire world. And although a part of me hates him for what he has done to me, I still love him because I know he's not doing this to hurt me. He is just an idiot who can't prioritize. At all.

  
**tl;dr**: Ex-BF made me wait for him for a year while he figured out what he wanted. He sent me mixed signals and it has been killing me for over a year. I finally decide to move on, but now I realize that I might not want to move on without him. What should I do!?


EDIT: Thanks for all your support and helpful comments. I've finally found a friend to talk to, and he urged me to see a therapist. I've scheduled an appointment on Tuesday and I really hope this will help me. "

I've been seeing this girl(let's call her Claire) for about 6 months. She is really smart, ambitious, just great to be around. We met during the summer when she was in my city for an internship. Our first date was amazing and for the whole summer things were great. Back then Claire wasn't skinny but she wasn't really fat either. 


When the summer ended she went back to school which is only like an hour away so I've visited her from time to time, staying weekends etc. But every time I've visited her since she looks like she has gained more weight. 


I'm pretty fit and like working out and eating healthy so having a mate that enjoys these things are fairly important to me. I've made subtle comments asking her if she's been to the gym today, how's her eating etc. Claire says she's been going and eating well which I'm not sure I believe. 


So now it's January and I recently saw pictures of her from a recent trip she took and she looks very overweight. I'm supposed to visit her in a few weeks and I cringe at the thought of having sex with her at this point. I'm by no means trying to be shallow but I just don't feel that sexual attraction to her anymore.


Now I don't want to give up on her and leave her but I want to give her a chance and help her reach her fitness goals. 


So Reddit how do I tell Claire that I'm losing my attraction to her in a nice way and have an upbuilding conversation about losing weight?



   
**tl;dr**: GF has gained a lot of weight and I'm losing attraction to her. How do I tell her this?"

**#1: The Intern**
I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom).

**#2: The Office Affair**
Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...
***
I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

3znbbr,294,2016-01-05,The September 10th or 11th Disappearance of Sneha Philip Part I: Who Was Sneha?,Douchemuffin,UnresolvedMysteries,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3znbbr/the_september_10th_or_11th_disappearance_of_sneha/,"I hope for this to become part of a small batch of write-ups about the disappearance of Sneha Philip. She was one of the topics brought up on /u/sceawian's recent ""which case(s) would you like to see detailed, serialized posts about?"" board which took inspiration from /u/hysterymystery's in-depth/wonderful takes on the case of Casey Anthony. My thanks to the both of you!

Overview of Case:

Dr. Sneha Ann Philip was thirty-one years old and living in New York City in September 2001. She was a resident M.D. at Staten Island’s Richmond University Medical Center (which in 2001 was known as St. Vincent’s Hospital) and was married to Jacobi Medical Center emergency room resident Dr. Ron Lieberman. The last confirmed sighting of Sneha was on September 10, 2001 at 7:18 P.M. She was recorded by a *Century 21* department store’s security cameras. Sneha and her husband lived in an apartment on Rector Place in the neighborhood of Battery Park, which was around 0.3 miles, or roughly a seven-minute walk, from the World Trade Center. Her family believes she was killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but others question this theory. Other speculated reasons behind her disappearance include being murdered the night of September 10 or Sneha using the chaos of 9/11 as an opportunity to run away from her life and “start over”. This post and the following will attempt to flesh out Sneha the person, the possibilities of what happened to her, and hopefully allow for discussion of users’ own thoughts on the mystery.

Who Was Sneha?

Sneha was born on October 7, 1969 to Ansu and Philip (I only saw her parent’s names in one source, I’m inclined to believe the family changed their last name to Philip after the father’s first name when they immigrated to the States, or, Sneha’s father’s name might really be Philip Philip, who knows?) in the southern Indian province of Kerala. She has two brothers, John (in one source, supposedly written by Sneha’s brother, his name is listed as Kevin Philip; I would assume that she has three brothers, but all public family photos only show the parents, Sneha, and two brothers) and Ashwin. Ashwin is the eldest, Sneha is the middle, and John/Kevin is the youngest Philip child. Kerala is, like most of India, mainly Hindu (making up 54.73% of Kerala’s population in 2011), but also has a somewhat significant Muslim (26.56%) and Christian (18.38%) population. I believe Sneha and her family were either Hindu (based on statistics) or Christian (based on one reporter who interviewed Sneha’s mother in her home describing a portrait of Jesus hanging up next to one of Sneha), but I am not totally sure. I know it doesn’t really matter per se, but I think sometimes missing persons are only thought of in terms of how/when/why they went missing and we sometimes forget they were real people with histories and personalities and such. 

The Philip family moved to New York (first to Albany and then to Hopewell Junction) when Sneha was still a child. According to her brother Ashwin, Sneha was a creative individual whose hobbies included painting, writing, and music. Sneha graduated from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland and then decided she wanted to be a doctor like her father. In 1995, she entered the Chicago School of Medicine. Chicago is also where she met Ron Lieberman. Ron was originally from Los Angeles and a year behind Sneha in the medical program. In order to travel around Italy and to be able to graduate the same year as her then-boyfriend Ron, Sneha took a year off from school. The two graduated in 1999 and both received invitations to do their residency internships in New York City. Ron was placed at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx and Sneha went to the Cabrini Medical Center located in Manhattan. 

The couple rented an apartment in the East Village together. The two married in May of 2000 in a traditional Indian ceremony with Jewish themes (Ron is Jewish) in Sneha’s main home base of Duchess County in southern New York State. The newlyweds shortly then after moved to a one-bedroom apartment in Battery Park. Nearly a year later, Sneha was effectively fired from her residency program at Cabrini when her contract was not renewed due to “tardiness and alcohol-related issues”. Since Sneha’s chosen specialty was internal medicine, it was a three-year residency requirement and she had only completed two years. 

After her removal from Cabrini, Sneha reported being inappropriately grabbed by a co-worker (I am not sure if this was a past co-worker from Cabrini or if Sneha had begun her new residency position at St. Vincent’s Hospital by this point; I’m leaning towards it being a co-worker from Cabrini due to the Manhattan legal authorities later getting involved) while out drinking with friends/colleagues. The D.A.’s office of Manhattan were the investigators of the case, but concluded that Sneha had lied about the groping and turned around and charged Sneha with filing a false complaint. They told Sneha the chargers against her would be dropped if she recanted her story, but she refused and subsequently spent a night in jail. Her final court appearance relating to this incident actually occurred on the morning of September 10, 2001 when she pleaded not guilty to the chargers. I could not find any information about it on the NY Courts website, perhaps because it was thrown out after her disappearance? I will always believe a sexual assault victim at face value till evidence proves otherwise, but I do not know what the D.A.’s office found that made Sneha’s account seem false. By willingly spending a night in jail, she obviously felt her account was true or felt she was in too deep in the lie at that point. After her disappearance, Sneha’s family and husband made statements that Sneha was also the target of sexual harassment and racism in the workplace. Cabrini Medical Center later stated they had no records of Sneha ever reporting this to hospital officials. Still, it’s possible it did happen and she only felt comfortable telling her family and spouse about it. She may have known she was already in hot water with her supervisors due to the lateness and alcohol issues and did not want to rock the boat any further. Which is unfair, because even if she was a poor employee, she still did not deserve to be treated with disrespect based on her gender and/or ethnicity. Or, on the other hand, she lied about the mistreatment at work to prepare Ron and the rest of her family for the termination of her contract (using a it’s not me, it’s them sort of tactic). 

Sneha starting doing internal medicine residency work at St. Vincent’s Hospital in Staten Island after her contract with Cabrini was ended. This was her place of employment at the time of her disappearance. While there, Sneha was in an alcohol counseling program and shortly before she went missing she received a suspension from her supervisors because she failed to attend one of her counseling sessions. I do not know if being hired at St. Vincent’s came with the stipulation that Sneha must seek substance abuse treatment or if it was a later requirement made by her supervisors. I do not believe she attended counseling willingly since she got into quite large trouble for missing one session and because her family reports she did not have a drinking problem. Of course most families would say that, but I believe if she had voluntarily entered into treatment she would have let her family know and instead of them later saying, “Sneha did not have a drinking problem, she was a normal/social drinker only” they would instead say something along the lines of, “Yes, Sneha did have a bit of a drinking problem, but she was working on it and entered into treatment on her own accord.” 

Ron, in his own account, knew Sneha drank and went out to bars and clubs. He sometimes joined her or she went out to see him perform (Ron was a jazz musician/guitarist at least when they were dating and married). Sneha also went out on her own quite a bit- usually to lesbian and gay bars- and often crashed with either friends, her cousin Annu, her brother John (also possibly known as Kevin, but I will call him John from here on out), or with women that she had just met that night. I will go into these possible extramarital affairs with women in another post, because people usually cite this possible aspect of Sneha’s life as the biggest indicator that she was unhappy with Ron/her life in general or that she met foul play at the hands of a lover or hookup. In short, yes I find the actual going home with female strangers a bit odd, but do not think her hitting up gay and lesbian bars is all that strange. She was a married woman, who at least publicly, was not looking for dates/hook-ups and loved music. What is more, she stated she had been groped at a bar. If the groper was a male co-worker (and it may very well have been a woman, I have never found out one way or the other), she might have become uncomfortable around heterosexual men in close situations/places like clubs, but still wanted to go out and drink and dance and relieve some stress. I’m a straight woman in my twenties, but I too much more prefer gay clubs than “regular” clubs myself. It just seems more relaxed on the whole in my experience. 

At the time of her disappearance, Sneha had been fighting with her brother John for two weeks. Yet, she was on good terms with her mother and had actually had a sleepover filled with Chinese food and a movie and good talks with her mom the Friday prior to 9/11. As for her relationship with Ron before she vanished, I have seen two complete opposite retellings. According to her family and Ron himself, him and Sneha were doing great. She had gone out with him and his colleagues the Saturday before and cheered him on as he played guitar. Ron also accompanied Sneha to her September 10 court date. He says afterwards he told her goodbye and went to his work (Sneha had off that day). The police report compiled after her disappearance says the couple got into a ginormous fight outside of the courthouse and that Sneha was indeed an alcoholic bisexual adulterer and had gone so far as to sleep with her brother John’s girlfriend. I think the state of the Philip-Lieberman marriage could have been either be bliss or on the rocks. Or, like most marriages, somewhere in between.

I’ll end this for now because I want to get into the timelines of Sneha and Ron on 09/10/2001 and 09/11/2001 in their own posts if you guys are interested in hearing more about the case. I would love to hear your thoughts on Sneha and her life because I always find that r/unresolvedmysteries users bring in such interesting perspectives on individuals and cases. Thanks for reading!

Chapter 1

Hal was a perfect citizen. He couldn’t remember a time where he had broken a rule. If one checked his monitor, it said that Hal had a rule proficiency count of 100%. That meant that in the 16 years of his life, he had never broken a single rule. He was a member of the State Youth and would be proud of his accomplishments if he was allowed to be. Being proud was a clear deviation from Rule 67G5D1E, which stated that expressing pride or hubris was an element of  individualism, one of the most terrible  crimes that a State citizen could perpetrate. And it was because Hal Waters was such a good citizen, he got rather worried when the Commissars called him in.

Hal sat in the waiting room of the St. Ludolphe Commissary for over an hour before his name crackled a little too loudly over the intercom. He nervously glanced around the office, but his vision revealed an empty, drab gray room illuminated by drab gray light slanting in through small, slit-like windows.Well, empty save for a small woman dressed in a graphite-gray shawl with an unhealthy-looking stain on it, who stared at Hal with squinty eyes planted in a squat, rodent-like face. “Boy,” she called out in a rasp. Hal glanced at the tiny woman, then continued onwards. “Boy!” The woman called again. Hal turned around and nodded at her. The little lady waddled up to Hal and tapped Hal’s monitor. “Your monitor, boy. What is your Rule Proficiency Count?”

Hal touched his monitor to display the 100% and turned it so the little woman could see. Her eyes widened and she stepped back. “Shame.” She smiled and chuckled. It was a disgusting, mirthful noise. “I thought that you could help me. But you’re the worst I’ve ever seen.” She shuffled out of the building, cold moisture slapping him in the face as the woman disappeared behind the corner. Hal was confused. Usually people were vaguely jealous that Hal was such a good rule-follower. Hal shook it out of his head and walked into the one open door that he could see.

It was, unsurprisingly, a gray room with a small gray desk in the center of it. A slim man with a shaved head sat behind a sleek silver monitor and barely glanced up when Hal walked in. “You’re late,” he peered at the database that he was referencing on the monitor, “Hal Waters.”

Hal scratched his head and then spoke. “I apologize. Someone stopped me and asked me something.”

The Commissar clicked a button and his eyes widened a little. He swiveled the monitor and asked, “Was this the one?”

The screen showed a picture of the shawled woman. From her squat, rodent-like face to her stained, gray shawl, it was exactly her. Hal, not for the first time, was astonished and impressed by the State’s extensive database. Underneath the picture was the woman’s name: Primrose Tyler.
“Don’t talk to her.” the Commissar said. His face was flushed  and his voice stern, commanding. “She’s a deviant. If you see her again, report her.”
Hal nodded, internally confused. Was he in trouble? So far, this meeting had been quite strange.

The Commissar leaned back and folded his hands on the desktop. “So, Hal Waters. You’re probably wondering why we called you in.”

Hal nodded.

“Well, Hal,” the officer continued, “you have one of the best rule proficiency counts in the entire State. You have never broken a rule in your life.” He stopped and glared into Hal’s eyes, as if trying to detect pride. There was none, so the Commissar continued.

“We have reports that your roommate likes to disappear a lot under suspicious circumstances. His RPC is rather low, and we are worried that he could be potentially become an enemy of the State. However, since we know that you are one of our best citizens, we know that you can’t be corrupted like your roommate.”

Hal tilted his head and thought of his roommate, Garrison Owen. “Are you saying that Garrison Owen is a deviant?”

The commissar nodded. “We think so.”

Hal sat for a moment and collected his thoughts. He stared into the dull eyes of the Commissar and wondered if that was what the old lady had seen in him. Someone who followed the will of the State and only the State, and didn’t allow for individualism. But then Hal remembered what the Fuhrer’s ideology was an eon previous. That individualism was what tore nations apart, and sowed the seeds of injustice and hatred in the hearts of men. And then Hal stared back at the Commissar and tried to reflect those cold, steely eyes. “What do you want me to do?”

The Commissar allowed himself a brief smile. “Your role is simple, Hal. Watch Garrison Owen and anyone else he spends time with and report them immediately if they deviate from the State any more.” The officer then typed a command into his computer and told Hal that if he needed to report any acts of deviation, he simply needed to tap his monitor three times in rapid succession. The Commissar stood, shook his hand, and that was that.

Hal left the Commissary that day feeling nothing. Reporting Garrison for his actions was simply a step toward bettering himself as a citizen, and raising his chances of entering the Fatherland. It didn’t matter that Garrison had been the closest thing to a friend Hal had had in his entire life. It bettered the State. It bettered the Fuhrer. It didn’t matter. Hal went home, happy to betray his only friend.



The Story of How It All Came to Be
by Minister of Propaganda P.J. Goebbels the 26th
 
In Time Immemorial, the Fatherland was suffering from war after war and tyrants from above that refused to let the poor people in the Fatherland follow their own path. Then a man named Adolf Hitler became leader of the Fatherland and confronted the tyrants. Hitler’s ally Japan attacked one of the tyrants named America, and then America’s despicable allies Britannia and Russia began to help her. Adolf Hitler began to fight for the Fatherland and pushing into territory held by Russia, and Japan, into America’s territory. Hitler became the Fuhrer of the Fatherland and he was the one who realized that the only way the Fatherland could live again was if the people within could give up their differences and individualism. Individualism was the scourge of the earth, Hitler taught. It ripped people apart. He convinced his friend Italia to join him on his quest and united the Fatherland. They began to fight back against the tyranny of America and her Allies. Hitler and his Axis of Truth began to liberate the people trapped in the Allies’ hegemony. But it was not enough. America and ungrateful citizens of the Fatherland who didn’t believe in the guiding light of Hitler’s teachings attempted to hurt him. The Fatherland nearly collapsed.

But it rose again, and Hitler decided to retaliate by unleashing the four beasts of truth upon the Allies. The V1 caused destruction in the air and ground, the V2 caused destruction on the ground in territory held by Britannia. The V3 rained panic down upon the barbarians that toiled for Russia and the Allies’ armies in the west. The final beast of truth was the V4. This beast had been created by Hitler himself and was the ultimate step in implementing the rise of the Fatherland and the downfall of the tyrants and barbarians. The storm of V4’s which followed destroyed the Allies with a rain of fire but there was a consequence: the world was flung into a violent winter and the world has stayed grey and dismal ever since. However, the Fuhrer’s teachings prove that this doesn’t matter. As long as we better the state, and better the Fuhrer, we all are bettered. There is no room for the individual. There is only room for the Fatherland and the Fuhrer in our hearts.

HAIL THE STATE HAIL THE FUHRER  HAIL THE FATHERLAND 








Chapter 2

Hal was mad at himself that he had never realized how much of a deviant Garrison was. He returned to his dormitory that day to discover that his roommate had torn the surveillance camera off the wall and dropped it in the sink. Hal stared at the sparking wires that hung out of the wall, then into the sink where the camera, now with a long crack in its casing, lay. Then he turned around to see Garrison lying on his bed, tossing a rubber ball in the air.

“What is this, Garrison?” Hal asked quietly.

Garrison smiled, a big wide one that exposed all of his teeth. “You like it?”

“No, I don’t.” Hal said. “Your RPC is bad as it is. It’s going to go down more!”

Garrison hopped out of bed and he walked up to Hal. For a second, Hal thought that Garrison would hurt him, seeing as he towered over him and easily had the advantage. But no, all Hal’s friend did was show Hal the monitor imbedded in the back of his hand. Where Hal’s monitor displayed his RPC in gleaming white, Garrison’s displayed his in a sickly yellow: 47%.

“It already has gone down, bud.” Garrison announced proudly. That was true. It was 48% that morning.

Then something else hit Hal. “Those cameras are worth thousands of Statemarks!”

Garrison shrugged, flopped back down on his bed, and tossed the rubber ball at Hal. Hal caught it and hurled it out the open window.

“Aw, come on!” Garrison yowled in dismay.
“No, no!” Hal said angrily.”You’re an Underling. You barely make money as is, regardless of your RPC. And you know that being an intern doesn’t pay well. We can’t afford to pay thousands of Statemarks!”

Garrison muttered something about Hal being a willing slave to the fascists that ran the State, but when Hal asked him to speak up, all Garrison said was, “I told you not to call me an Underling. It’s insulting.”

Insulting it may have been, but it was also true. Garrison was half Aryan, but his other half was Slavic. His parents had been eliminated for being devants simply by falling in love. Garrison thought this was an atrocity, but Hal could see why Garrison’s parents had been executed. Slavs were barbarians. They were no better than beasts. Every child had been taught that in school. Any Aryan caught polluting their blood with a Slav was no better than a Slav. Anyone who wasn’t Aryan, therefore, was legally an Underling, not a full member of society. Hal couldn’t understand how anybody could argue with these rules. First, they were totally logical, and second, they were as old as civilization itself. Garrison, as an Underling, could only be assigned menial labor, and could only get paid if his RPC was 85% or higher. Garrison’s RPC, of course, was about 40 points too low.

“You’re being stupid, Hal.” Garrison murmured. “You follow the rules of the State so blindly, not even noticing the huge ideological holes in them.”

Hal just stared at him. “First of all, I don’t notice these ‘holes’ because there are none. And second, are you questioning the State and the Fuhrer?”

Garrison glared at Hal for the better part of a minute and then responded by saying as his face twisted into a sneer, “So what if I am, Nazi?” Then Garrison Owen left the dorm, making sure to make an even bigger mess of the place as he did.

Hal stood there for a moment amid the papers scattered on the grey floor of the grey room in the grey dormitory, and considered what he had just said. He could imagine Garrison’s RPC dropping ten points. That word that he had just uttered, Nazi, was the worst insult that anyone in the State knew. Nobody would dare to say it. Hal glanced over at the sink and saw the remains of the camera sparking and buzzing annoyingly. He decided that if the State couldn’t see where Garrison was going, he would have to. And so Hal Waters hurried out of the dormitory, preparing to tap his monitor three times in rapid succession.

The day was colder than usual, with a freezing humid wind slapping Hal across the face as he hurried toward Garrison, trying to keep sight of him. Winter had just set in, and as a result, the late afternoon sky was a gloomy blue, with no sign of foggy brightness which indicated the location of the sun overhead. The streetlights hanging over the concrete venue hadn’t turned on yet, meaning that the only illumination the street had were candles or poor-quality electric bulbs behind the mostly shuttered windows of the rows of grey apartment buildings. Cold sheets of freezing rain blew across the street, instantly soaking the only jacket that Hal had. The only light on the street that Hal could see were the spotlights illuminating the flag in the town square. The flag was rigid in the wind, showing the blood red banner and the black swastika emblazoned on it; the only color in the entire town.

Hal suddenly stopped and panicked. He’d lost sight of Garrison! It took a few tense minutes of sleuthing to realize that he had gone down a small alleyway between two identical dormitories. He could hear Garrison's voice and see a small lantern’s feeble orange glow in the alley’s shadowy depths. Slowly and quietly, he crept toward his target in the alleyway.

They didn’t see him. They didn’t hear him. But he could.

“Your roommate is the Nazi with the perfect RPC, huh?” a strangely familiar rasp of a voice said.
Then Garrison responded. “Yes, that’s the one.”

“How do you live with him?”

“As of late, it’s been getting pretty difficult, I must admit.”

“He knows nothing of our plan, right?”

“Of course not. Though he is getting suspicious, I can tell.”

“Well, make sure that he knows nothing. We execute our plan tonight.”

There was a pause before Garrison responded. “All right, all right. But what exactly is our plan again, Primrose?”

 Primrose. That name was familiar to Hal.

“It’s quite simple, actually. You know what a Molotov cocktail is, right?”

Garrison chuckled. “Of course I do, I’m half Slavic. And I’m a deviant!”


Primrose, whoever she was, laughed in a disgusting, wet gargle. “All we do is throw Molotov cocktails at the Commissary, the town hall, and the flag. Then we escape into the mountains.”

Hal’s jaw dropped. He remembered now who Primrose was, and he also realized how treasonous Garrison and Primrose’s plan was. The State Youth in him kicked in, and Hal ran out of the shadows and found himself face to face with Garrison, whose eyes widened, and Primrose Tyler, the woman from the Commissary. She blinked twice with her already squinty eyes and then said, “Garrison, you said you weren’t being followed. Especially not by this little Nazi!”

Garrison replied angrily that it wasn’t his fault. Hal looked at both of them. “You’re both traitors to the State! You’re both deviant! If you follow your plan, your RPC’s will plummet!”

Primrose smiled  a devilish grin and turned her wrist to show Hal her monitor, a mirror of what had happened at the Commissary only an hour before. Hal gasped with shock and disgust as he stared at Primrose’s spidery hand. Where the monitor should have been imbedded in her skin, there was nothing but a rectangular pit which was covered by thin, papery scar tissue. “That’s the thing, my little Nazi. The State has me on record and calls me a deviant, but they can’t track me. They can’t see what I do. And if anyone reports me, I just walk away. I’m invisible.” 
Garrison smiled sadly at Hal. “Do you think I care about my RPC, Hal? It’s already too low for me to recover it. I may as well waste the rest of it doing what my heart wants me to.”

Hal spluttered with outrage and confusion. “Your heart wants you to be a traitor?!” He raised his fingers to his monitor. Apparently, Garrison knew what this meant and gazed at Hal. “Don’t do this, man.” He implored. “Don’t do it.”

Primrose Tyler slapped Garrison’s hand. “Stop hesitating, Garrison. He’s not going to hesitate, Garrison. If you don’t want to be arrested, you need to take him out!”

But Garrison hesitated, pleading with his eyes, trying to tell Hal not to betray his only friend. But to Hal, friends were nothing but something that got in the way of the populace’s quest of ridding itself of individualism. And it was then that Hal looked down at his monitor and tapped it three times in rapid succession.

Many things happened at once. Primrose muttered, “idiot” under her breath, and walked past Hal and out of the alley. Garrison’s monitor lit up scarlet and he slowly collapsed to his knees, overcome with what his future held for him. Voices and the roar of an engine sounded from up the street where the Commissary was. And Hal himself left the alleyway and Garrison Owens behind him. Hal was astonished that Garrison thought that he wouldn’t turn him in. Hal Waters was a State Youth. Hal was a perfect citizen. Hal was headed for the Fatherland. Hal was a-
“...Nazi…” Garrison’s voice seeped from out of the shadows. 

Hal didn’t bother turning around. 
















Chapter 3
The next few weeks were quite normal. Hal attended his intern job at the town’s library, and made sure to be present at any State Youth rally within the area. He did not see Primrose Tyler anywhere. He made sure to look for her everyday, briefly investigating the alleyway before attending work. Within a week, Hal had completely forgotten about Garrison Owen, but he hadn’t forgotten his and Primrose’s plan. His fears were compounded when he watched the news broadcasts on his wall. All they spoke of was unrest across the entire State: flags being burned and officials being injured. The Fuhrer was put under heavy security. He hadn’t been seen by the press in days. But that was far away, across the sea. In the small town of St. Ludolphe, things were quiet. That is, until Hal was called into the Commissary again. And this time he wasn’t invited by a slip in the mail. He was greeted by a Commissar at his doorstep.

Hal was surprised to see the very same Commissar he had met before.

“I don’t believe I got the chance to introduce myself, Hal Waters.” He said, grasping Hal’s hand and giving it a firm shake. “My name is Commissar Jones.”
“What do you need me for, Commissar?”

I'm officially an employee at the company which will be my first real ChE-related work experience!

So I took initiative and asked the CEO of a small chemical manufacturing company with less than 10 people to hire me as a part-time intern while I finish my last year of ChE studies. He discussed how having an intern would benefit the company with his team for around 3 weeks and now he and a colleague has arranged for an interview with me for tomorrow. 

This is virgin territory for me because whereas normal interviews have me competing against other people, I'm competing against myself and their possible notion that they shouldn't hire an intern at the moment. How should I approach this differently, if at all? What are some general things I can tell them I can offer so that they can hire me (like doing basic manufacturing and quality control while they do R&amp;D)? Should I be worried that this is just a courtesy interview where he has already decided not to hire me?"
3zo537,1,2016-01-05,Love or growth?,-wander-,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/3zo537/love_or_growth/,"I don't know how to begin.  Despite my depression, I have great things going on in my life.  I just graduated from a master's program with a 4.0.  I have a good internship that may turn into a full time position soon.  I am also considering applying to other positions, with different options spread all over the country.  I have a wonderful partner, who loves me unconditionally.  I can share ever single thing with her.  All my insecurities.  My fears. My mental illnesses that I am battling with.  My troubles with my family.  My thoughts of suicide.  She has supported me through grad school financially and morally and I would probably not be alive today if not for her. And I am thinking of leaving her.

When we met about 5 years ago she told me that she was almost done with her master's program and was thinking about law school.  She had to take a break from school for financial reasons.  When she got a new job, I would try to talk to her about finishing her masters but she would brush the subject off. We decided to move in together two years ago.  One night when she had a little too much to drink she started crying and said that she was skipped over for a promotion because she did not have a degree.  I said what are you talking about?  You have a bachelors and are almost done with your masters.  She said she never finished.  She told me she is not even close to being finished with her bachelors much less almost done with a masters.  She said she was afraid to tell me before because she thought I would leave her.  She had kept up this lie for 3 years.

I was shocked by this.  I thought it was unfair to wait to tell me this once the ink was dry on our newly signed lease. But I felt for her.  We had been through a lot and I knew it wasnt her fault she didnt finish.  So I promised to help her finish once I was done with my masters.  

Two years later.

I have just finished my masters and options are abound for me.  Since we had moved in together 2 years ago she has taken one three credit BS core writing class toward her bachelors.  She is not taking any classes this coming semester.  She says she will take classes again in the fall.

Meanwhile we have been talking about the future.  I have been thinking about proposing.  She has been talking about having children while we are still young (we are currently in our late 20s).  All my close friends are either married or heading in that direction with their long term girlfriends.  A pretty crucial time in life.

Am I jerk for not wanting to be in this relationship any more? It's not just school.  She has been promising to lose weight for a long time too.  She makes promises that she never keeps. When I remind her of her promises to herself to go to the gym of eat healthier she gets defensive and acts as if I am some oppressive teacher or disciplinarian.  But I'm getting tired of her standing up for her right to stand still while I have grown tremendously disproportionate to her in recent years.  I feel like she is dragging me down and has no intention of keeping any promise to herself, whether it be get healthy or finish school.

I have battled with procrastination myself, but I have always been driven and achieve many of the goals I set for myself. I try to empathize with her in overcoming fear and getting things done but it is getting to the point where it seems like she has no intention of finishing school or being healthier and is just saying whatever she can so I will stay with her.  The lie she told me on the first night we met is still perpetuating despite the reality right in front of me.  When we first met, I was not so much attracted to the status of her fabricated education and goals, but to her character for being the kind of person with the strength, willpower, and tenacity to do big things in the world.  All that admiration that started this relationship has turned almost completely in to pity and obligation.  But there is still trust. And shit load of genuine love that is the closest thing to sacred I have ever experienced.  

So I feel like I am at a checkpoint in my life where I have to chose.  I don't want to lose my best friend.  I don't want to think of her trying to make ends meet and help support her parents heartbroken and alone while I continue to grow without her.  But then I look at myself and I realize that marriage and life long partnership is serious shit.  This isn't the dating scene any more, this is the time for life long decisions that will determine the course of the next few decades.  And I cannot afford to be casual and ""lets see what happens"" anymore.  A soul mate should be your best friend: someone you can trust and feel natural around, but also someone who should challenge you while the two of you grow interdependently.  I don't think she has any interest in growing.  I think if money were not an issue she would sit on the couch, order seamless, watch netflix, and eat ice cream every day for the rest of her life.  I feel like I need more than that in a partner.  I feel like she is cannibalizing my success as her success and getting complacent 

Thank you for listening guys.  Any feedback or perspective would be greatly appreciated.  But mostly thanks just for listening.  My head feels a whole lot clearer now.

My first reaction ... ""really?"" I've waited 3 weeks to hear back from support about all my missing legacy offhands going MISSING that it's a bug and no help will be provided.

I've heard they're relatively quick about punishing people who use the game mechanics to their advantage, but no real helpfull support is given on player-level help.

I'm just curious how support people work because I find it hard to comprehend these actions / or lack thereof.

Heck, I even guess I would be willing to do an internship where all the support magic supposedly happens, but then again I live in Europe...

As is ever in customer service, the bigger the business/corporation, the smaller their cares for customers.

(but then pay me back)",pastelglitterbug,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/3zov61/oh_well_just_buy_you_a_new_one_but_then_pay_me/,"First off, thank you to everyone who commented on my first post. whether it was advice or a witty remark, it was so very nice to have a welcoming place to vent. I HAVE FOUND MY PEOPLE. :D

I briefly mentioned in my first post that my FFIL and FMIL help out FH(23) and I(22) financially, as we're post-college but still kinda poor. We moved in together when we were 18/19, partially due to tension between FH and FMIL, and we had no idea how to be adults. We *didn't even know how to write a check*. We're doing much better now, but we've suffered a few setbacks.

For the first several years, I took classes full time, as many as I could, to get my degree out of the way quickly. I worked, but almost less than part time. FH worked full time, but they were fast food and retail jobs, so we always barely scraped by. Savings??? *HAAAA*

We have shared a car since we started dating. My current job is close to home, close enough I can walk to work if I want, and FH has his first **real** internship starting soon at a company just as close. (I am so very excited for him!!!) However, there were times when sharing a card was hard.

Mid-2014, the company FH worked for went under and the store he worked at shut down. Very suddenly, we were living off of my income only. It was a *struggle*. 

Then during FH's mad job search, our car died an agonizingly slow and painful death. We had fought it for months, even taking out a credit card (we had never done this before, we *hate* the idea of spending money we don't have) to pay for the repairs. After several months and a couple thousand dollars worth of repairs, the fucking *head gasket blows*. Was told it would cost $1,500 to repair, didn't have even close to that but we couldn't go without our only car. So FH calls FMIL to see if they can help us out with the repairs, and she cheerfully says ""Oh, we'll just by you a *new* one!!!"" So we're thinking another used car, just newer than our 15yo rust bucket, right????

**WRONG** She buys a brand-freaking new 2015 corolla. We're absolutely stunned. FH brings up that we can't afford a $250 car payment or the hella high insurance that goes with a brand new car right now. FMIL?? ""Oh don't worry, we can take care of payments and insurance until you're financially stable!!"" We're shocked and of course **super** grateful.

We giddily drove home our majestic new ride, it's an absolute dream. We were amazed that the same woman who had constantly complained about paying for FH's phone bill, even though he told her she could cancel it (""But how would I contact you?!??!??"" ""Well GlitterBug has a phone and we live together, so you could just call her."" *anxious sighing*) had given us such a lovely gift. 

Really, we just *couldn't* believe it. Once the amazement wore off, we were slightly suspicious. The next time we visited, FH went to the bathroom and I was chatting with FMIL in the kitchen:


""Really, we can't thank you enough for the car, it's the greatest gift we've ever received.""


""I'm glad you like it, we'll work out the payments later.""


""Hmmm?""


""Oh, we'll figure out how you guys will pay me back later down the road.""

I actually felt my stomach drop. She had ""gifted"" us a $22,000 car that she expected us to pay her back for. We **never** would have accepted it if we had known that. If she had told us upfront that we would have to pay her back, we would have gone for a much cheaper used car or just fixed our old one. We had only asked for help fixing our old one in the first place!!!!!! 

When I told FH on the way home, his response was ""Yeah, fuck that. My *dad's* the one footing the bill, how much you wanna bet he doesn't know she's asked us to pay *her* back?"" So, next time we visit, FH started to mention it to FFIL in front of FMIL, she started panicking and changed the subject. FFIL is a **great** guy and doesn't give two shits about us paying him back, just wants his only son to be happy and safe, and she knows it. He did joke ""The back seats big enough for a car seat!!"" with a shit-eating grin, but considering that's the only comment he's every made regarding babies and he *actually* gave us a new car, I let it slide. 

I've got more regarding her weird financial manipulation, as it's only gotten worse since the car thing. I'll try to remember all the times she's tried to con FH into moving back home because ""money"". Ahh and I guess she needs a name lol. I feel like I'll be back here often.


**TL;DR: FMIL bought us a $22,000 car using FFIL's bank account and expected us to pay HER back. Not happening.**"

So I went abroad at the end of August. I abused oxycodone pretty heavily over the summer (a few times a week at around 60-150 mg). I never really got withdrawals because we wouldn't do it two days in a row, I guess. 

When I was getting ready to go abroad I finally pulled the trigger on 2 Kilos of kratom from herbal salvation (I believe its red vein sumatran or some other red vein known to most closely mimic opiate effects). I did this because A) I knew I'd miss not having any access to opiates for 4 months and B) because I'm anxious and the xanax I'm prescribed doesn't really kick my anxiety like an opiate or pseudo opiate does. Anyway, I developed a fondness for my red vein - which is both good and bad. My tolerance has stayed pretty steady, and I settled on an average of 2-3 (usually three) tablespoons of powder in the morning, when it was a kratom day. I can count the number of times I've dosed twice in a day on one hand; this might be relevant as you continue to read. 

I ended up burning about every other day, and I've continued to do so since mid September. Sometimes I'll burn two (3 was the most) days in a row; sometimes I won't for 2-3 days. Now I'm back home for winter break and I brought back the rest of my last kilo with me. I have to be applying to internships / getting back in shape / return to the non-european wonderland way of life I grew to love while away. Though being abroad was much less stressful than school at home, I know kratom CAN be a useful tool for me to combat my anxiety this upcoming semester. For one, it stops me from seeking out other more addictive opiates. Two, its less physically addictive than xanax or other benzos IMO. And three, it kicks my social anxiety's ass, which is my main source of anxiety. 

I'll apologize now for all of this prefacing. I like to be thorough :]

Here's my main point, I guess: 

**TL;DR - took around 12 grams of red vein sumatran almost every other day for 4 months. only once a day. dose size has stayed pretty static. I stupidly dosed 3 days in a row last week which is something I've almost never done, and today when I didn't dose (like I normally wouldn't on an off day) I had a lot of diarrhea, more anxiety, and the worst (IMO - I know its laughable) aspect was my constantly runny nose and sneezing fits. Now, I know I should have expected some rebound effect after 3 days in a row, so I don't want to appear thick-headed. However, I also could attribute the diarrhea to extreme dab-induced over eating the night before, the shivers to the vyvanse I took today to get work done, the runny nose to a cold, etc. I guess I haven't experimented too much with giving up kratom for more than 2-3 days, so I don't know how dependent I am. I guess I'll find out when I run out of it soon.**

I got the most concerned when I realized the sneezing was likely from withdrawals because it validated that I was actually feeling a withdrawal for the first time. Now, I know I could be jumping to some conclusions here, and that runny noses aren't the worst thing ever.

**However, kratom is important to me and I don't want to ruin a good thing. In your opinion, was 12 grams every other day (on average) for 4 months enough to give me a nasty tolerance? I always hoped that having one or two break days, only dosing once, and not raising the dose would protect me pretty well. If I want to cut back to say, 2-3 times a week instead of 3-4, what's the best way to do this without feeling shitty on off days? As I write this, this sounds ridiculous, and I know I've spouted off a lot of information, but if someone has a moment to read my overview and spew some knowledge I'd be very thankful for the peace of mind.**

I was wondering if you could help me out something. I am looking for an online site where I could find remote research internship opportunities.

I have got an M.a. in sociology with a focus on quantitative methodology. Specifically, cluster analysis, factor reduction in SPSS. The problem is that I had never conducted a proper research by myself while in Uni and I have went into Banking immediately after school and had been writing scripts to spew out basic crosstables and colourful charts ever since.
I am 29, and I would like to catch up with my chosen carrier before it is too late.

I am looking for a research project I could work on. Will work for free,  but I am since from Eastern Europe, being physically present might be a problem.  

Do you know where can I look for such opportunities?

Thank you,

I just started at a small firm and do mail outs, flyer creation etc. by myself, no secretaries or interns running around which I actually prefer so I can make sure it's right and It has a personal touch.

Just need to vent and would love any input from others that have been where I'm at and see the light at the end of the tunnel. TLDR at end, but I'll give the long version if you want to hear it. If nothing else, I get to vent, which I can use desperately sometimes.**

Wife (28f) and I (27f) have been together since high school. Decade anniversary a few months back, married for about five years. We have been each other's rocks; helped shape and keep each other sane through family, school, and professional hell; and are about as close to perfect for each other as I can imagine. I'm not one that feels there's ONE perfect person for you, I understand there are always others with similar interests, backgrounds, etc. but I really do feel we're great together intellectually, emotionally, sexually, etc. But, all that time and dependence I think had definite co-dependency creation issues and independent self-image consequences, which is what probably what led in part to this last October.

We've been long-distance since June due to her having to do a year internship a couple hours away. Five interns: two females, three males. They all get along great, and I was happy she had the support when I couldn't be there for her. The internship is very stressful, as most are, so I knew she'd need to vent to them. And I had no issues with her spending time with any of them in group or individually. She's especially close with the girl, but the girl is a bit conservative for her personal tastes, but she got along great with two of the guys... and you might see where this is headed.

In Oct I noticed a few texts on her phone that seemed a bit inappropriate with one of the guys. But, I know they're close, so I probably was just reading into it. A few days later though I noticed she'd deleted all of them. Alarm klaxons and red flags! So I confronted her, she admitted things happened when they were alone, I drove to meet her, she ""confessed"" (over clothes stuff and kissing), we hashed it out, and I told her that she had to be absolutely honest with me. We discussed potentially changing to an open relationship, but I would only consider it further after counseling, the other guy's wife knowing about it, and my side being open if I wanted as well. Well he won't tell his wife, as he's pretty sure she'd leave him and take their kids, so that's not happening.

But something still felt off on the way home. So, being a paranoid person, I got home and convinced her I knew she lied and that she hadn't told the whole truth. Yes, I know, manipulative, but I could tell she was still guilty about something (she's not a great poker player). Turns out it was actually about 20 minutes of oral between them as well. She was ashamed and thought that withholding that would somehow be better. I believe she felt that, but I almost ended right then and there. She lied, again. And I correctly guessed that yes, he suggested they potentially continue behind my back. They decided to cut their ties and restrict their activities to work-related things, and I got a therapist that I see weekly. I didn't really think they could restrict that much, as they all hang out together, but at least they wouldn't be alone in an apartment anymore. I decided not to tell his wife, as I didn't want the kids to have to go through that, but otherwise she would've been the first person I called. But it anything happens again, he doesn't deserve to get off scot free. For all I know this is/will be an ongoing issue, and she at least needs to have to ability to have someone that deserves her. But I really don't want to go down that road, no matter how much I hate the piece of shit or the fact that he gets to run around without consequences.

She gravitated to hanging out with the other guy more, which of course set me off, too. He's not attractive, and definitely not her type, but the emotional connection is there still, at least in my mind. They would watch movies, go out to eat, bitch about work, etc. Imagine a college roommate, sorta like that. So, after several blowups, she no longer hangs out with him alone either. She was extremely resentful because she viewed it as taking away her support system. Her view has gotten better on this, but it's still shaky, and I think that's where the codependency issues come into play. We've always had each other, but now we have to either grow up or cling to others. I chose the former, she chose the latter thus far.

Fast forward two-ish months and it's still such a minefield. We've massaged our work schedules so we're together most Thursdays nights through Sunday night. We text frequently. We do our best to express our emotions, be honest, and visibly show how much we love each other. Sex is great, and we make the most of our time together to be close and intimate. I'm working on getting us into couple's therapy, which she's all for, but the holidays and long distance made appointments impossible. I've tried to keep my hands out of her daily life (I've got issues with wanting to control to feel secure), but every day is a struggle. Had one minor suicidal episode, but luckily got it under control and worked on it with my therapist. I try to use my time being active, getting back into shape, improving myself and surroundings, etc. But damn is every day a potential for blinding rage and sorrow.

Like she went to lunch with the cheater the other day. Just pick up a sandwich, come back to the office, and eat it. I thought she'd gone with the other guy, eventually realized it was with the cheater, and was thrown right back into that pit of feeling lied to. She said she didn't tell me because she had no idea that it would upset me. We talked about it for about three hours that night, with each side doing their best not to yell, blame, etc., but it's almost impossible when your mind is so messed up. I eventually gave her several hypotheticals where I had no intention of cheating but was chatting with other girls, hanging out in their apartment alone, etc. and she admitted it would make her feel insecure. And I responded, ""So why do you do those things after you DID cheat?"" And it felt like she got it, maybe for the first time. Put yourself in my shoes, feel the chaos and pain, live it in, and imagine me doing it to you. Would you want me to do X? No? Then why would you do that to me?! Jesus, how would you expect me to react? How do you expect to do that for the remainder of the internship and not drive me to leave you because I don't feel like you care or are willing to try?

And it's on those days, those mad, insecure days, that all the automatic thoughts fire. Don't you realize what you did? You fucked up OUR relationship. You obliterated every ounce of trust I had. I know you feel guilty, but I want you to feel how lost, confused, and angry I become. Do I have to cheat on you, destroying who you are and everything you hold dear, to make you get it? It's not just lunch because I don't trust that you didn't say anything inappropriate, touch, etc. It's always the worst case scenario in my head. I'd walk through a burning building for you, but you don't even care to think about ME instead of YOU. Can't you see I can't do this for another half year? Can't you see the only thing I want from you is YOU. Reassure me, don't put yourself in situations that you wouldn't want me in, love me, and work with me. That's a lot, I know, but isn't our relationship worth it?

We both genuinely love and care for each other; I know that. But it's so hard to continue to hold onto the relationship when a decade of trust is gone in an instant. That everything she does is a potential mine to blow up in my face. And I know that she would do anything I told her to do, albeit probably with some resentment, but she would. So it's just hard. It's three steps forward, two steps back, one step forward, three steps back. She seems to get it, but then she does something that seems so objectively stupid and potentially hurtful that I question my own sanity. And then we talk, try our best to hear each other, make sure we know that we do still want to be with each other and stay married, and reassure each other as best we can while moving forward.

**TL;DR** - 10 year relationship, 5 year marriage. Long distance (see each other most weekends though) internship. She got along great with the other interns, and ultimately had affair with another intern (wife and kids). I found out, she tried to cover up the whole story, I found out the whole story, divorce almost occurred, and reconciliation occurred. She doesn't (usually) spend time alone with the cheater, and now is not allowed to spend time alone with another intern that she was getting too emotionally close with for me. We're doing our best to work through every day, but it's always a challenge and it's hard to not feel like she's a child sometimes for the situations she puts me in emotionally. The love is there, but the trust isn't, and it's very hard reconciling those two things. We both want to make it work, but every day is a struggle, some more than others.

**I would truly love to hear from others that have been here, especially the long distance part. How did you and your SO work through this seemingly endless minefield? What hard boundaries did you set, especially when there's the whole coworker/friend aspect?**

Thanks for letting me vent anonymous others. It means a lot to know there are others like me that know what hell it is to go through this."
3zsieq,7,2016-01-06,To My Mother,newaccount21,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3zsieq/to_my_mother/,"I've always known that you've struggled with things emotionally.  I watched your screaming, uncontrollable anger at store clerks growing up, watched your heart wrenching deep depressive episodes while we were in the car, watched my father try to temper your intensity at the world with his arms and his words.  Everything you felt, you felt hard, deep in your person, fully; it was like your emotions stemmed from your soul as well as your body and your heart.  And I knew that when you loved, you loved with the same strength, with the whole of your body, completely and without reservation.  As difficult as it was for me to relate and bond to someone so full of volatile reactivity, especially as a child, I knew that at arms length you were my mother, and that I had a kind of support that few other children experience.  

While I was in rehab, I found a new kind of support coming from you, and discovered that in the time that we weren't talking (while I was running the street, doing drugs, struggling in an abusive marriage) we both had matured and could approach our relationship differently.  Seemingly gone was my teenage angst and your confusion and disappointment at my actions.  Seemingly gone were your obsessive ideas of ""what was wrong with me"" and ""what I needed to do' and with them, the anger you always had for me when I wasn't fitting the convoluted, self-contradicting box that you had designed for me.  When I was in high school, you used to go through waves of internet-proclaimed diagnoses for me and solutions you had designed and believed in with your typical consuming intensity.  I struggled with my own issues - anxiety, trouble completing my homework = but your ""fixes"" seemed like one tidal wave after another.  You decided I ""just hated"" homework, and that you would monitor my calender, my binders, and my assignments to make sure everything had gotten done.  When my mid-B grades didn't improve, you decided that I was staying up too late at night and that I was probably sleeping during my classes, despite my repeated protests (and my teacher's word) that I didn't.  You took away my laptop and started making sure I was in bed with the lights off early.  Then you decided that I had a problem with organization and tried to set up a budget for the money you gave me, as well as my paychecks from my job at the mall folding jeans.  When I failed to produce every receipt for every transaction and a log of my corresponding activity, you took my money and I was back on the bus, despite making enough for gas on my own.   

None of these things were a big deal, just a daily struggle for me to try and fit myself into a system that left you always disappointed in me, and me disappointed with myself.  It was humiliating to sit through parent-teacher meetings and have you talk at length about how you were sure I ""had autism"" or what you were doing to try and ""fix my ADHD"" or describe how I had what you liked to call ""just a resistance to doing work.""  I wasn't lazy, I was trying my best, and to that you always responded that I ""wasn't doing anything!""  You just didn't know the struggle that was going on in my head, and how could you?  You refused to listen, since it never fit in with any of your ""revelations"" of what my problems were.  Maybe I didn't have any problems at all - maybe I was never broken - and that I just struggled with anxiety since schoolwork was such a big deal to you.  I always hated returning home at night, always hated walking through the door and wondering what fresh hell was in store for me behind the door.  You never hit me, but the vision of you and Dad circling me, screaming about my homework or my grades or my budget while I put my head down and sobbed was never far from my mind.  

Finally, when I got to college, I was able to set up a study system that worked for me, and threw my heart and soul into the grades and the resume that had alluded me for so long.  I called home all the time, sure that you would be finally proud with what I had accomplished, because even my high school was proud of me finally, and had asked me to come and speak to graduating seniors about engineering.  But you decided that my life still was not what you wanted for me.  You had wanted me to get good grades in high school, get into a better college than I did, and have a fun time there, meet a nice guy, and get married.  You were disappointed - again - that I was spending too much time in the library and not enough time at sorority pledge events, that the guys I was spending my time with were engineers, not businessmen, and told me that you wished that I would dress ""like a girl,"" despite how inappropriate that might be for my engineering classes.  I tried to make you happy again.  I took a yoga class at your insistence, and tried to ""better balance my time"" like you suggested.  My grades took a hit.  You advised me to quit the research I loved, the research that had propelled my limited success in my major, and spend my time ""more wisely.""  

I don't know exactly when, but about the time I failed out of graduate school, I gave up.  I was drinking far too much, studying far too little, and was constantly wracked with guilt and hopelessness and loss.  I had an outstanding resume with six glowing internships at amazing companies, but barely had a 3.0.  I was heart broken, lost, alone without a plan.  I reached out to you for help and direction.  I had no one else.  For once, you had no ideas of what I should do, and little sympathy.  You left after a short meeting to make dinner for my little sister and help her with her homework - just like you had been doing daily since before I can remember.  After you left, I sat in my bathroom with a six pack of beer and a couple Vicodin I had bought from my neighbor and cried and cried.  It's horrible to have no one.  

After that, I fell into drugs and got lost within myself.  My husband systematically and purposefully destroyed what little self esteem I had left, and I lost even my confidence in my own perception.  

So imagine my surprise when I reached out to you in rehab and found someone sweet and caring and attentive.  I loved being able to call you every day, tell you the things I couldn't tell anyone else, complain to you about how horribly sick I felt without the fear of your reply.  At my lowest, I learned for the first time to trust you, and prayed thanks to God that I had finally found a handle on all this disaster and chaos that had overcome me for so many years.  I relapsed and the guilt made me physically sick for days.  The thought of losing our friendship was catastrophic and plagued my every thought, my every feeling.  I couldn't bear the idea of letting you down.  

But then, today. 

The old you has finally slipped through.  You're telling me again, that I am not getting enough done, fast enough, and in the right way.  When I call and tell you I'm suicidal and lost and struggling to get out of this hole, you tell me that I probably wouldn't have such bad anxiety if I could just get the things done that you're asking me to do, on the day and time that you think I should be able to do them.  Nevermind that I have PTSD.  Nevermind that I'm trying to deal with drug dealers to get what little stuff I have back out of trap houses.  Nevermind that the things on the list I have are things that I proposed.  I have had two job interviews.  I'm not living in a trap any more.  I have a working car.  But you scream at me that I didn't set up a P.O. box today because you decided that today was the day that you think that it should get done.  When I told you I was crying, you asked why it mattered so much to me if I cried in the post office.  

Yesterday, I took you to my lawyer and asked you to trust me.  I was worried that you'd do what you used to do when I was young, and that's exactly what you did.  You sat down with a man I had an established relationship with as an adult and told him that you think ""I have autism"" and that ""I have a problem working on a to-do list"" and that you think that I would ""fail less"" if I could just ""listen like I'm supposed to.""  Why would you ever tell anyone, much less a lawyer, that you think I have autism.  It's humiliating enough to have my mother with me and have to explain that I'm newly clean.  But you made me look like a failing teenager, and my protests, livid anger, and straight embarrassment only helped cement that image.  You felt the need to tell this man that you had found a group that takes art from people with severe mental health disabilities and you just don't understand why I have such a resistance to getting something done and contributing.  You also described the volunteer position you found for me at a facility that employs ""people with problems.""  I can't describe how that made me feel. 

i don't understand why you would throw away this friendship that we have forged, this miracle of God that has come out of the chaos, and over something as trivial as the day that I decide to get my P.O. Box set up.  I keep trying the trick that got me through the end of college and removing myself, trying to see things through your eyes, and remember that your intensity comes from a place of love.  But it's beyond that right now.  I thought I would lose our friendship over my relapse, but you said today that you just ""don't care about our friendship if I am incapable of making progress.""  I spent literally all day with you yesterday, running at break-neck speed, trying to accomplish the things that you've decided that I need and will make you happy.  But because I had some hang-ups today - legitimate reasons why I can't get the things done on this list, reasons I've told to you repeatedly but you have decided don't matter - you have decided that I still am not good enough.  Today you told me that you don't like the new medication I'm taking - the medication that is helping drastically with my PTSD - and that you want me to go on the medication you take.  I said okay, because I just didn't know how to cope with all this any more. 

I went to my second doctor's appointment without you last week.  The doctor said she was glad you weren't there, that she couldn't handle your intensity, and that she doesn't know how I haven't relapsed having to deal with you.  And this was before, when I thought things were still going well.  "

Hi there! Nachokage here, introducing you the latest update to the Fan-fiction I've been working on for the past year and ~2months.

This started with a piece of LoL-related text that I had to write for applying for an internship. Even though I didn't get the internship, I had a lot of support from the few people who had read that first piece ([the prologue] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/2014/12/the-fall-0.html)). That, paired with my need to practice my writing while I worked on setting the world for what will probably be my first novel (it will take years though), helped me to start this project. Now, a year and more than 25.000 words later, this story is coming to an end.
 
The plot is centered around Runeterra's death; the land, corrupted, is being killed by the will of men. Anger, revenge, fear and despair lead humanity to an endless battle against magic itself. Only a few will realize what is really happening, creating bonds between characters that would have been impossible otherwise.

The last three chapters will be published once I'm done with my finals. If I can I will get Concussive Blows rolling before it, but I can't promise anything. Meanwhile, [here's](http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/2015/12/the-fall-snow-day.html) a short Snow Day chapter for this festive days that come to an end.

What can you expect from [The Fall] (http://nachokage.blogspot.com.es/p/the-fall.html)? It is a tragic story, with its own dose of romance for those who like it, filled with a lot of the League of Legends characters we all know and love ^(or hate). The mix is completed with a lot references based off well known fan works (like ZedXSyndra), Rock and Metal music, literature and more.

Here's the full list of published chapters. Note that the first 20-30 chapters include a short list of the featured champions  which is not added later on for avoiding spoilers:

This is my first time posting anywhere on the internet for financial help, but I'm kinda at the end of my rope. I'm a recent college grad who is currently interning in the DC area, and I make a pretty meager wage, but I'm working for the experience so that someday I can pamper my pooch. At the end of the month, most of my money is gone to rent and groceries, but I always make sure my Ellie, my Frenchie/Boston mix, gets to eat.

She's got a sensitive tummy and can only eat grain free, which does tend to cost a little more than the regular, but I'm always happy to spend as much on her food as my own. She was a rescue from an irresponsible breeder and I am forever grateful to have my sweet baby here with me while I spend these 6 months lonely in the big city for this internship. She's the best thing to come home to.

She just turned 2 yesterday and celebrated with the very last of her wet food.

Since I'm paid hourly as an intern for this non-profit, I was unable to make much money over the holidays due to how many days we were closed. On top of that, the holidays also messed with our regular pay period, and right now it looks like I've got less than $15 to get me through until the 15th. I need basically all of that right now to pay for my transportation to and from work, although I am looking at alternatives.

I have enough food for myself stocked up in the pantry, and I don't eat much anyways, but basically my only plan for Ellie right now is to cut up my roommate's forgotten hot dogs in the fridge and feed her those and rice until I can scrounge up some money. Given her tendency to puke left and right though, I really do wish I could stick to her usual food.

I would be forever grateful for anyone willing to provide us with some canned food for her. This whole going-completely-broke kind of thing has never happened to me before, and I guess it's just part of becoming an adult that I wasn't prepared for. I just didn't expect the holidays to be so draining on my wallet in so many ways, and I feel awful that Ellie has to suffer too. I can't wait till I actually have some savings to put aside for times like these, but as it stands right now I'm just going paycheck to paycheck.

[This is the wet food she usually eats](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RVMMWTM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2FVS7OK5KM81G&amp;coliid=I28VSLKNJ3194Z) but any of the Purina Beyond flavors/types of wet food will do. I know it's a little pricier to buy it on Amazon than it is in the stores, so if you have another preferred way to buy, I'm open to anything! Just PM me for my address.

[This is the dry food she eats](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YXSNXQ8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2FVS7OK5KM81G&amp;coliid=I162BUCCF9W1DR&amp;psc=1), but she doesn't eat that for every meal like she does the wet, so it's less urgent and less necessary to her tummy health. (I basically feed her one can of wet food divided into two meals, and she snacks on the dry throughout the day, usually eating around a cup by the time I refill it the next night.

[Here's a few pics of us / her from the past few days, to help sweeten the deal.](http://imgur.com/a/kQLte)

Anything helps, and I'm really grateful that there's a community out there like this that would even consider helping out a young dumb girl on her own in DC."

**MOLEMAN'S EPIC RAP BATTLES!!!!!!!**

**VINCE MCMAHON…**

**…VS…**

**…CHRIS MCLEAN!!!!!**

**BEGIN!**


**Chris McLean:**

Today on Total Drama Island-Action-Musical-Whatever,

Watch me make McMahon mincemeat, then off some interns for good measure.

Do what shouldn't be tried at home? You'd best believe that I'm prepared to;

Think you're boss enough to cross me? Well, I triple-dog *dare* you!

I'm the hottest host this mad, mad, mad, mad world has ever seen;

As tough as Nailz, with words as fiery as your faulty limousine!

I've got full-time invincibility; there's no way I'll be toppled.

How can you expect to Trump McLean when you got beat by Donald?

You'll come in dead-last when you race me, and end up like Team Victory:

A bigger fail than your foray into the football industry!

No chainsaw's in my grasp, and there's no hook strapped to my arm,

But I'm as fierce as any psycho killer; always causing harm!

The Alejandro to your Justin, obsoleting you with tricks galore;

Shake up World Wrestling something worse than when your Owen hit the floor!

You're losing it, old man, and I'll retire you for good:

Entomb you here, achieving what the Undertaker never could.


**Vince McMahon:**

I'm stepping back into the ring to lay some Raw Smackdown on this crude snob,

And end this match so fast, call it the Wawanakwa Screwjob!

The promotion's patriarch; Authority runs in my family.

Like pineapples in lava, my mere entrance brings calamity!

This boasting host who thinks he's got the most's in for a roast,

'Cause I'm a Federation's father; you're a wannabe Jeff Probst!

I represent a higher power than your whole cast of Canadian idiots;

You've no chance in Hell once *Mr.* Vince McMahon starts spitting it!

Dropping bigger trauma-bombs than any goth-and-punk relations;

When my superstars show up, it's every teen's elimination!

Haul it down the Dock of Shame, or better yet, straight off a cliff;

I walk the walk with attitude: a god is what you're messing with!

Your lips against my ass is how we'll end it; this I say with confidence:

The thought of this dirtbag defeating me is plain Ridonculous!

I'll skewer you for real, and put you down like Hollis Mason,

When I bludgeon you with your own gilded likeness; bash your face in!


**Chris McLean:**

Dock of Shame? Come on; I'll make your ass a human cannonball!

Flush you right down the drain, then take a dump in the confessional!

I'll Hatchet off your balls, then feed 'em to the boys and girls for brunch!

Man, I can even make marshmallows pack a truly toxic punch.

My island makes jackasses out of everybody like *Pinocchio*;

Step up to me, and your career's as finished as Hulk Hogan's, bro!

Make like your son and call it quits; the votes are in: you're beaten,

And a million bucks says that won't change in any broadcast region!

Unlike Courtney with her lawyers, I'll make good on every threat;

I'm a Hitman on a McMahonhunt just like your old buddy Bret.

My franchise spotlights Amazons and breezes through the Bechdel Test;

Even Ezekiel knows your show's a chauvinistic sausage fest!


**Vince McMahon:**

Your talk of ""Amazons"" is all a ton of chatter, just like Rita;

Even Eva's an amoeba next to any of my Divas.

Fresh TV is going stale, and it's apparent that you're fired;

Should have caught the 3:10 back to Fametown back when Don was hired!

You remind me of my stepdad, and I'm glad you're not deceased,

'Cause now, not even Chef can bail you out from what I'll soon unleash!

I'll decimate your legacy entire: damnatio memoriae;

Once you get to oblivion, say ""Hi"" to Chris Benoit for me.

Your Wreck-ening's at hand, and the contestants best be scared;

Watch Rey Mysterio fly-kick your jumbo jet down in midair!

I'll sic ol' New Jack on your Owen, then neglect to ring the bell!

A legend then, now and forever!

**John Cena:** McMahon wins, LOL!


**Chris McLean:**

Tell Rickroll 2.0 his time ain't now, 'cause mine's not up, you cheater;

I won't let you screw me here, nor will I screw my own self, either.

Prime up for a Royal Rumble in this very ring, tonight:

I'm summoning some All-Stars; dropping two H-bombs, to be precise!

**Harold:** The peak of geek's back from the Aftermath, so hold on to your pants!

**Heather:** …And he's allied with this queen bee who's stinging like a bullet ant!

The wicked, two-faced and backstabbing lying little bitch is back!

**Har:** …And unlike Austin, she be rocking Stone Cold sober; that's a fact!

My name is Harold Norbert Cheever Doris McGrady the Fifth, bitch;

Funky Steve's Rhyme-Busting Camp gave me the skills with which I spit this!

A yo-yo-nunchaku master who can kick some major backside;

Needn't even rig the votes for us to win this by a landslide!

**Hea:** Wanna duke it out with Heather? What's your damage?! This witch brews doom;

Vinnie Mac couldn't even manage besting me beneath a blue moon!

No one trolls the queen of mean; my haters know this to be true.

Hell, I can even keep more dignity when shaven bald than you!

I've got your diary on hand, and don't know where I should begin!

**Har:** Perhaps his little daughter snapping into Macho Man's Slim Jim?

**Hea:** The steroid trial failed to bring you down, but let us tell you something:

**Har + Hea:** When we prosecute you lyrically, there's no escaping judgment!


**Vince McMahon:**

Heather seems to think this dweeb's her friend, and understands her truly,

But it's clear that all he wants from her's another peek at boobies.

Plus, if so-called double H-bombs are the best that Chris can muster,

I can top that in more ways than one; come on, now: take it, Hunter!

**Triple H:**

When you talk shit 'bout the boss's girl, you cross the King of Kings, bitch:

An ass-kicking's what you've asked for, so I'm stepping in to bring it!

Watch the terror in your unhappy campers rise when they see me.

My killer's blood runs cold and blue; that's why they cast me in Blade Three!

Now, are you ready to be buried by combat's NXT Evolution?

I'll assassinate you through cerebral verbal persecution!

Try to play me, and you're bound to lose! My Pedigree is vicious;

Straight-up shatter suckers' faces easily as Chyna dishes!

I'll atomic wedgie Harold 'til it's his obliteration;

Make him blow up like the namesake of his source of inspiration!

Then I'll have my way with that fat, gassy cow he calls his Venus;

She'll let me be her sledgehammer, and the hammer is my penis!

Frankly, I'll turn these two pussies Inside-Out fifteen times over;

Call me Thirty Hs, then, although I lack a chainsaw-boner!

I'll sink you for good, McLean; this is the day the drama died,

While I was singing: *bye-bye, Mr. Canadian guy!*


**WHO WON?**

**WHO'S NEXT?**

**I DECIDE!!!!**

3ztasq,3,2016-01-06,Freshman Adventures: Spring Break,ronald87,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/3ztasq/freshman_adventures_spring_break/,"Spring Break is, ideally, a gigantic powwow of not-yet-adults baring their bodies and rubbing their skin together as it drips with clear ocean water like they are in a Gatorade commercial (and maybe they are), while muffled hip hop surrounds their souls like an ecstatic Stockholm Syndrome and colors flash in the sunlight that never goes away and beer cascades through the air in slow-motion.

 But that isn’t what my spring break was, exactly. By the time my bud Dirk and I arrived at the beach in Miami, large swaths of it were closed off, most people had packed up and left, and it was colder than you’d ever think, all because our college lets out for spring about a week and a half later than everywhere else. By the time we got to the beach, we just stood there, staring. Dirk said; “Let’s go to the hotel.” We did, and we slept.

 The next day was a little more interesting. We stood in a Tiki bar talking with two girls. One of them was Adrienne, who was a senior at Florida State University, where she studied creative writing. The other was Anjali. She was doing an internship with a law firm down here in Miami. Her college was in California. She was originally from India, but she had no accent, so she must have moved here at a young age. She wore a blue blouse and bluer jeans, with a tear on one leg. I recognized the tear in her jeans was a desperate plea for male attention. Her hair was black enough to create dark contours against the tacky brown oak of the bar. Whenever a drink flashed in the light, her hair countered it. I was playing it low-key. I started off with Adrienne, but Dirk consistently elbowed his way in there, and ultimately I gave him the ground. While I sipped my Jack and Coke (don’t even ask if they bother checking IDs in Florida), Anjali said to me; “So, like, do you get free passes to concerts and stuff?” I’d told her I was a roadie for The Dave Matthews Band. She loved it. I’d guessed she would. 
“No,” I said. “Not really. Dave and I don’t get along too great.” 

“Why’s that?” 
I sighed while I came up with something.
 “Oh, you know, me and his daughter,” I said. “We may or may not have had something going on. It’s all good now and me and her are totally friends. It’s just, when her Dad found out, you know…” 

Her eyes bugged out enough to stick to the ceiling. 
“Oh my God,” she said. “You can’t be serious.”
 I nodded. 
“Let’s just say I keep a bat in my apartment.”

 The more I told her about Dave Matthews being a deranged psycho, the closer she moved toward me. As soon as it got to the point where I came back from the bar with two drinks and slid my hand down her shoulder after handing her drink over, I could see the deal was sealed. At around this time, Dirk and Adrienne split. Dirk’s a pro.

Anjali and I sat on the steps outside the bar, passing a joint. 
“I just, I can’t believe it,” she giggled. “My Mom would flip her shit if she knew I smoked pot. If she knew that I’ve already had three boyfriends and actually had…you know, relations with them…she’d kill me.” 
Three boyfriends. 
I took a puff and pushed back a strand of her hair. A tear was in her eye. 
“You seem like such a special person,” I said. “An interesting woman, with such big ambitions. How could your Mom possibly not see that? Everything will work out fine.” She kissed me and her breath smelled of alcohol and something like breath-spray.

Women’s lingerie kind of fascinates me. How do they manage it? I can't imagine this silk or cotton thing pressing in to my skin, strapped on my chest all day, itchy and annoying as shit. That’s why, before I fucked Anjali that night, I instructed her, after I pulled her panties down her slim dark legs with my teeth, to leave her bra on. I planned on removing it myself. She took her hands away from her back and scooped them under my head and pulled me up to her mouth. I ran my hand across her un-groomed mound and slid two fingers inside. She was already wet. She jerked her head away from mine as if totally surprised that any guy would finger her. Her wide-eyed expression—not far off from her Dave Matthews expression—compelled me to slide in a third finger.

 I swished my index finger far enough up the folds of her clit until I felt the ridged area near the back and it was like Columbus discovering America. I’m convinced that not all girls have a G-Spot. Anjali did, and the way she flung her head down on my shoulder made me doubt any of her three boyfriends had given her this memo. I stroked the ridge with my finger and she gripped the nape of my neck like she was holding on to a ship’s mast and moaned and panted as if making a confession. I stroked until her G-spot swelled in to a blob pushing against my fingers. My pinky was missing out on all the action, so I changed up my fingers, giving the index finger some fresh air. Ever seen the movie ""The Blob?"" There was a remake being filmed inside her vagina with my finger as the protagonist.

Amidst the mucky queefs squelching out from between my fingers, Anjali bowed her head to my ear to tell me a secret. It was ""aaah aaaah! Aaaaaahhhh.""
 She reached between her legs and grabbed my wrist and pulled my fingers away. 
“You’re going to make me cum if you keep doing that,” she whispered. She stepped backwards to her bed, eyes shut, and half fell, half-lay down on her back. Her vagina glistened messy in the dark light, agape from the work of my fingers. I heard the sounds of a female moaning the next room over. It was Adrienne. Dirk and Adrienne were at it. 
“Oh God, I can hear them,” Anjali whispered with a grin, eyes still shut. 
I took the condom out of my pocket and rolled it on. I stepped toward her. 
“This is awkward,” she laughed, reaching out to me as I leaned in to her. 
“It’s not awkward at all,” I said. As I heard the springs of the bed in the next room creak and Adrienne’s theories of language being tested, I thought, This is war, Dirk.
 As I entered her Anjali, I stared down at her tits. She wore a crimson red bra which was tight against the dark skin of her tits, probably a perfect D cup. I was inside her and holding her hip with one hand, but I barely focused on what my cock felt like in her pussy. I focused on how to get that bra off, what to do with it, and how to beat Dirk. Adrienne was loud as shit. Dirk himself was kind of loud. Anjali only sighed and breathed in and out, nervously enjoying herself. When I heard Dirk growl “Come on,” I knew he was talking more to me than to his dick.
So here's what I did.

 I slid my hands under Anjali’s back like I was caressing her. The redness of her bra betrayed how super-insecure she was; I knew she would let me do what I was going to do. She arched upward and shut her eyes tighter, and said ""Ooooh! Ooooh."" I felt around her skin until my fingers pinched the rough bulge of the clasp on her bra. I flicked my thumb against the clasp—just as Dirk had shown me years before—and the hooks unfastened. I took one strap in one hand and she extended her arm to help me remove it. I yanked it off the other arm and held it in the air to my right like a trophy for a few moments while I kissed her and shifted deeper inside her. Her legs curl around my waist and her arms inched across my back. I almost said something like “You can thank me later,” but that would have been gay.

 I buried my face in between both her tits while I moved harder and she got a little louder. Her tits were like an airplane movie; it's fun, it kills time, whatever.
 In the other room, it sounded like Adrienne had yelled ""Daddy,"" so I knew I had to move. I slid the bra between our stomachs and curved it around where my groin met her’s. I stuffed it down on the sheets and the silk grazed her pussy. I maneuvered it right under my balls and when I felt it grazing my balls, I knew it would be tickling her. 

Anjali was busy tightening her arms around my back. She began giggling, trembling upward from her legs with shivers. It was working. She opened her mouth wide and I stared straight down her throat while she began screaming repeatedly through her perfectly ovular mouth. Her mouth opened her mouth wider, and even wider, in total silence while I worked her. Then she jerked in to a ball as she rubbed her face against my chest and said ""Oh God"" again and again between spasms and sighs. She bit my nipple. 

Adrienne screamed louder. Someone banged on the wall. I wasn’t sure if it was Dirk or Adrienne. My body had moved away from Anjali’s crumpled bra by this point, but I still pulled out of her while still shooting my load and smacked my condomed cock on her sheet. When I moved backwards I felt my balls and cock flutter against wrinkled, stringy silk; her bra. I lay my head on her chest. My nose faced the direction of her vagina and I smelled sex drying on her and listened to her heart rate return to normal.
 “I think,” she said after several minutes, “that my bra was really…tickling me.” 
“Damn,” I said. “That’s what that was? I’m sorry, babe.”
 “No,” she said, caressing my head. “It felt so, so good.” 

I stood in her bathroom and flexed my muscles as I looked in her mirror. Now at least my ribcage was no longer visible; I’d been purposefully eating more fattening dining hall food at school. But my abs did jut out, if not quite enough. I backed up and flexed my legs. They were the strongest part of my body. My cock was sore and red, tired of being rammed in to vaginas. I hadn’t masturbated in over a month but had still gotten off inside a girl five to six times a week; that was the kind of spree I was on and I had no intention of stopping. 

I tore off some toilet paper and rubbed the sticky condom glaze off my cock, threw the condom in the toilet, put on my boxers and went back to Anjali’s bed. Anjali sat on the edge of the bed, looking in the mirror, playing with her hair when I passed out.

The next morning, I stayed with Anjali long enough to watch an episode of Mad Men. Jon Hamm cheated on his wife again and got drunk again and did his wide-jaw grin again. I couldn’t understand the appeal of the show. Why would I just want to watch an hour long show about my Dad? But Anjali was transfixed. She wore a shirt and her underwear. I placed a hand on her bare leg and moved it up to her thigh. She took this to mean I was a tender guy who wanted to get to know her better, and I let her think it. I was actually retaining a sense memory of what her legs felt like when they violently spasmed.

 I left the room, saying that yes, we would hang out again and took out my phone as soon as she closed the door and deleted her number. I saw two foreign girls in only their swimsuits and sunglasses, speaking in German, I think, and made eye contact with one of them. I went to my and Dirk’s double bedroom. He wasn’t there. I read some of Portnoy’s Complaint. I got some more rest.

“I bet you think you actually won that game,” Dirk said. 
We sat on the beach, smoking cigarettes. 
“Yeah,” I said, shrugging. “I do.”
 “Did you fuck her only once?” 
I looked at him.
 “Yeah,” I said. “Did you have anybody knock on your wall yelling at you to keep it down?” 
“No…” I said.
 “Great, because I’d already fucked Adrienne once by the time you two got started, and during the second time someone banged on OUR wall, too. Dirk; 1. Dennis; 0.”
 Dirk took a long draw of his cigarette. 
“Doing it once before is cheating,” I said. “And you know it.”
 “I taught you the moan game, kid,” said Dirk. “Don’t tell me the rules. When I showed you, you’d gotten laid, what, once, two times?” I said nothing.
 “It's only been like three years since then,” Dirk said. “And I doubt you play it with your secret-frat buddies up at school.”
 “That lasted about six weeks,” I said through clenched teeth. “Whatever.” 
“We have to figure out who to go for tonight,” I said. 
Dirk stared at me. 
“The same chicks,” he said.
 “What? Dirk are you nuts?”
 “No, but I have a couple swinging from my dick. Those same women need more of our attention. And they want it. Don’t be such a misogynistic ass, Dennis.” 
He almost cracked up as he said this. Dirk tossed his cigarette on to the sidewalk near the sand. 
“Shit,” he said. “Smoking is bad for you.”

3zu2vw,2,2016-01-07,My boyfriend [21M] got accepted into medical school and wants me [24F] to move with him but I want to move back closer to my family.,confused33,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3zu2vw/my_boyfriend_21m_got_accepted_into_medical_school/,"Hi all,
My boyfriend and I have been in an LDR for 2.5 years except for the first 3 months when we met during a summer internship.  I am finishing up my Masters on the East coast and was looking forward to moving back West where my tightly-knitted family lives in addition to me loving the area. I used to love moving to new places but my parents are getting older (60s) so I really want to see them more than twice a year. This is my own feelings, my parents doesn't guilt trip me about this at all.

My boyfriend is a wonderful guy, extremely mature for a 21 years old, very serious and committed and I can tell that he cares for and love me, as I do him, and we have discussed future plans together.  We've also met each others' families and we all get along great.  We were excited to have an opportunity to be closer together once he finished undergrad and me my Masters this coming year. But he recently got accepted into medical school (an amazing accomplishment!) 2500 miles from my home state and my family.  He has a couple schools left on the West Coast to hear from, so we're still holding out hope but it's unlikely.  If I don't move with him we'll probably break up, which breaks our hearts, but I'm not sure if we can endure 4+ years more of LDR. I just wish he'll get in somewhere on the West Coast still and it'll be a win-win.

So when August comes, I need to decide between:
1. Move with him to a new city that I've never been to, don't know anyone there, no set careers, seeing my family maybe twice a year for at least 4 years, but I'll have him (depending on how busy he'll be with med school I guess) OR 
2. My original plan: move back home close to my family, in an area I'm familiar with and love, and possibly more career opportunities, but lose this wonderful guy. 

I know we are both young, especially him, but this is still an extremely difficult decision to make and to experience as we've been so happy together.  Ultimately, I'll have to decide for myself, but I would really love to hear stories from anyone who has gone through a similar situation and how it has turn out for you.
   
**tl;dr**: He's going to medical school 2500 miles away from where I'd like to be (close to my family) and I know if I go with one I'll be missing or lose the other."

3zujsr,8,2016-01-07,Warning: Biking in North San Jose,SushiWarrior,SanJose,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/3zujsr/warning_biking_in_north_san_jose/,"Edit: After discussion, I would like to say that no, San Jose is not the worst ever. I used a lot of hyperbole and did indeed rant quite a bit. I realize that most problem areas in my commute fall under Santa Clara, not SJ. I've also seen road crews in the last few days adding bike lanes to the residential streets - awesome! However, my rant about the Montague still applies. It has bike lanes, but it is not meant for biking. For those new to the area, please consider your proximity to the trail system and be cautious about what roads are on your route, because any large road/expwy is not advisable for biking. As I said, these are things I wish I knew more about before I moved here. Yes, it could he much worse! 


Hey everyone, I'm new to the area, here for an internship like I'm sure a lot are. Now, I'm not sure what other people moving to the area expect, but I'd just like to point out that this area (North San Jose, most areas north of the airport) is NOT ADVISABLE for biking unless you really know what you're doing. I live on the north side, along the Montague Expressway. This city has the worst biking I have experienced in my life, and I am starting to regret every second of choosing the plan of biking to work. I have never experienced such poor city planning and lack of consideration for both pedestrians and cyclists, although my experience is admittedly limited. But I am certain that even as an experienced cyclist, attempting to commute along the Guadelupe trail with limited excursions to the major roads (Central expressway, Montague, Trimble etc.) will be the death of me. The high speed roads combined with poorly defined lanes (bike, acceleration/merging, bus, or otherwise) are a very dangerous combination and there are often no safe routes possible to get to your desired destination. 


Whether it is the absolutely brain dead city planning which places bicyclists totally unprotected along highway onramps and right turn lanes along with 45MPH traffic, or the lack of any pedestrian crossings along the roadways, or the inability to cross streets to actually get to where the fuck you are going, this is absolutely shocking to someone who was coming to the Bay area expecting a reasonable commute for any other option than driving. There are a lot of glaring flaws with the bike lane planning and amount of possible options for someone trying to commute who doesn't drive. 


The recent rain has caused all of the bicycle underpasses to flood along the San Tomas and Guadalupe trails, which forces you to cross a 6-lane road with a median (impossible) to continue along the trail whenever it crosses a road. So you are forced to continue down the road (perpendicular to the direction you want to go) further to an intersection, where you could hope you could pull a u-turn or otherwise get going back the opposite direction. Except many of these intersections require you to cross multiple lanes of traffic (going 45MPH) to get into the turning lanes, which isn't possible with rush-hour traffic. Obviously, these turn lanes don't have anything like green boxes or anything either (but that would be wishful thinking for bike infrastructure this far behind). So I stick to using the pedestrian crosswalks and doing it the long way. Except many of these lights simple opt to NOT have any pedestrian crossings, leaving you to pull awkward maneuvers like going across the crosswalk, only to kind of swing around and pull into the left turn lane going perpendicular to the crosswalk. I wish I had a better option for getting to work that could avoid these major expressways, but I can't get to my workplace without crossing highway overpasses without bike lanes (again, with 45MPH speed limits) where you simply CAN'T take possession of a lane and expect not to be turned into a smear on the road. I may be forced to alter my route to take multi-mile detours or something just to ensure my safety. 


The Montague expressway is the biggest insult to pedestrians I can imagine. [This isn't news to the DoT](http://moderntransit.org/expy/m-peds1204.html), who have been receiving complaints for years by the look of it. I don't understand why this city advertises itself as ""bike friendly"" when it couldn't be further from the truth. When I first moved here, I simply had no other option besides walking down it to go get groceries. There was no real parallel road, so I had to awkwardly walk along the shoulder while cars blew past, often using the shoulder as an acceleration lane to merge into traffic, which is the perfect storm for a distracted driving looking over their shoulder while you are turned into a bloody pulp while walking on the shoulder in front of their car. 


I strongly advise anyone moving to the area to reconsider their transit options if they're in the north side. As in, don't move to the north side if you don't drive. The public transit sucks ass, the bike lanes suck ass, and walking sucks ass. It's abysmal. The trail system would be nice if it wasn't submerged, but even barring that the planning of the bike lanes leaves so much to be desired that I absolutely understand why there are so many complaints about people going the wrong way in the bike lanes (I had to do this this morning to get around a submerged underpass). There simply aren't many viable options to get anywhere without at some point having to cross a dangerous overpass without a bike lane or without going a short distance down a major expressway to get to a safer route, off the roads. 


On another side note, what is up with the traffic lights? I estimate most lights at intersections with major roads, particularly a major road w/a smaller road, take over 5 minutes to change, often going from green-green (in the other direction) to advance-advance to green-advance on each side, before going back to green-green again - even if you hit the pedestrian buttons a million times, which we all know often does nothing. It doesn't matter how many cars are lined up either, and I've noticed quite a few drivers completely miss their light changing because they got so bored waiting that they got lost in their phone instead... but I digress. At many major intersections, this can leave you waiting for 3-10 minutes just to cross the road - and if you wanted to go left, you're going to have to do this twice if you don't want to risk your life getting into the left turn lane! (although obviously going the other direction, along the major road, is usually a much faster light)


Frankly, I'm not even sure there is anything they could do to salvage the lanes. The most important thing IMO is protecting (or at least defining) the bike lanes during right turns and highway onramps - currently, they just kind of disappear and show up again when the turning lane ends. This is very dangerous because I have to look over my shoulder (often while travelling at speed, and while trying to cut as close to the curb as possible, while dodging debris along the shoulder) in order to spot spaces between cars. Even worse, on some overpasses these crossing are on a downward slant with a very limited amount of forward visibility for drivers and the cars coming to enter the onramp could never possibly see me trying to cross the road in time, leaving me to awkwardly sit while waiting for a chance to cross (I usually use the strategy of waiting for a large enough gap in cars that indicates the light turned red further up the road). Oh yeah, and some of these on-ramps are 2 lanes wide as well... 


So what would you guys suggest? Do you think it's safe enough to keep sticking it out, provided I ride with a helmet and a bajillion lights? I'm not a slow rider by any means (usually going ~20MPH according to my tracker), so I can't imagine how poor souls who don't ride seriously manage to get anywhere with such a large speed delta between themselves and the traffic. Is there someone at the DoT I should complain to? I have some relatively specific problems with the roads pertaining to my commute, but to be honest it sounds like they don't care about bikers or pedestrians and they would rather we just fuck off and die or whatever. I have noticed most drivers being quite courteous generally, waving me through etc. but I am worried that even the most courteous driver will still end up killing me if they just don't see me in time. 


My apologies for the long rant, but YEESH! I wish I knew this before moving here!"

3zumrg,1,2016-01-07,Squishwersh's Dankicide (AKA The Homicide Rat sequel that no one wanted),Pikapikarai,Trollpastas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trollpastas/comments/3zumrg/squishwershs_dankicide_aka_the_homicide_rat/,"I just want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. I was just too lazy to write one, lol.

I was an intern at Gamestop for a year in 2666 for my degree in dank memes. It wasn't paid of course, but it did have free weed.

Now, since I worked directly with the Spooky Scary Skeletons, I got to view the new memes centuries before they existed.

They had very recently made the latest Call of Duty game and the entire staff was stoned so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more dank reasons. There was a problem with the Half Life 3 demo that set everyone and everything back for several thousand years.

Me and Gabe Newell were in the gaming room along with the Troll Face and Snoop Dogg for a test run. We received the copy that was supposed to be Half Life 3 and gathered around the screen to play. Now, given that one of the employees is Troll Face the demo title screens often have the title changed as a dumb joke, such as ""Water: The Game"" instead of ""Pokemon: Alpha Sapphire"". Nothing funny but Troll Face needs something to do when he runs out of weed. So when we saw the title ""( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"" we didn't think it more than a stupid joke. We just passed around the Doritos and unzipped our pants.

The story began with Shrek practicing his airhorn, hitting a few swaggy notes like normal. We hear a hipster laughing outside and Shrek stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a Bee Movie screening that night and needs to get laid. The hipster says whatever and goes to Starbucks. The raining weed transition screen comes up and we see the ending of Shrek's Bee Movie viewing. This is when things began to seem off.

While he's blasting his airhorn in everyone's ears, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn't (the animators must've been frickin' lazy that day) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes 5 seconds after that (more laziness). There is some screaming in the crowd before they begin to No Scope him. Not normal No Scoping that is common in the series, but you could very clearly hear my mixtape in it. Shrek's in full nude and looks completely stoned. The shot goes to the crowd, with the hipster in the background, and he's just casually sipping his Starbucks coffee, very much like him. That isn't the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had really fake looking eyes. Clearly not drawn in MS Paint, but something a bit more fake than Photoshop. The eyes were red, probably to indicate heavy weed smokage. Some of us looked at each other, obviously turned off, but since we weren't the writers, we just shrugged and began snorting cocaine.

The shot goes to Shrek in his underwear, looking very high. The view out of his stained glass window is of a fiery explosion so it isn't very long after the movie screening. The unsettling part is at this point there were no Doritoes. Literally no Doritoes. Not even the cheese powder from the empty chip bags we left all over the floor. It's as if the speakers were turnt up, though their status showed them being perfectly sober. He just sat there, laughing stupidly, in this silence for about 30 years, then he started to  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) softly. He put his tentacles (a la hentai) over his eyes and made 8-bit sunglasses appear, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from slightly annoying to ear-bleeding. It sounded like a build-up to a bass drop, except every instrument was replaced with airhorns.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his butt. By slow I mean it's only noticeable if you look at shots 100,000,000 hours apart side by side. His swag gets swaggier, more full of swag and more swag. The screen then explodes a bit, as if a random green screen effect was inserted for a split second, then back to memes. The ""smoke weed everyday"" sound gets quickly louder and more dank, as if a flame war is brewing somewhere. The sexy part is this sound, and Shrek's ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) sounded real, as if the sound wasn't coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were portals to the fourth dimension. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don't do much more than get drunk and make stupid Wikipedia edits all day.

Below the sound of the Wilhelm Scream and the Old Spice guy, something sounded like 10,000 bees having a spontaneous orgy with a firetruck. It came loudly (haha) and lasted more than a year so you had a hard time hearing it (we played this game twice, so pardon me if things sound too explicit but I've had lots of time to think about them). After 13 seconds of this, the screen flickered like strobe lights and something flashes over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

Uncle Gaben paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was dope. It was a still photo of a Doge. He couldn't have been more than 666. The face was freckled and nerdy, cocaine being snorted deep within the depths of his nostrils. He was naked down to his underwear, the bulge in said underwear impossible to miss. He was laying on some bed that was probably a king size (jealous!).

The most un-swaggerific part was that there was no shadow of the photographer. There was no pair of handcuffs, no gag or whip, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be a porno. It would seem the photographer simply didn't exist. We were of course still turned off, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a bad joke that Troll Face slipped in.

The screen flipped back to Shrek, still choking his chicken, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be Comic Sans text running down his face from his stonerific eyes. The text was also done in a sloppy style, looking as if a child has designed it. The dubstep sounded as if the drop would hit any second; there were even gifs of Snoop Dogg dancing around the screen. The chocolate pudding was lasting until 4 AM and coming more frequently (lol). After about .00000000000000002 seconds, the screen again exploded and showed a single frame photo.

Gaben was eager to go back, the rest of us weren't, but he didn't care. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be Pepe the Frog. He was laying in a sexy pose. His face was exactly like you'd expect, and he was naked except for his sexy lingerie. Deez nuts were piled on top of him above another crude MS Paint drawing. Again the froge was on the bed and the photographer's shadow didn't exist. I had to choke back a (sexy) moan and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out of fricks to give. The show resumed.

About 585765367554654 milliseconds after this swaggy photo played, Shrek went silent, as did all sound, the complete opposite of when this all started. He put his hentai tentacles down and his eyes were now done in MS-Paint-but-not-quite-MS-Paint like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bamboozled, bumfuzzled, and gobsmacked. He just stared at the screen, as if seducing the viewer (which just looked dumb since he was still high as a kite). After about 1000000000000000 seconds, he started left-sharking, this time not covering his derped eyes. The dance was hypnotic and sharky, and most fishy of all is his dancing was mixed with a bass drop (it's about time man like we waited how long for that drop???).

Stock images and Steam reviews were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The dubstep kept going, and so did Shrek's stoned laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good -1 frames.

Gaben was able to stop it on the 13th and backed up. This time the photo was of...



JOHN--



lennon.



The Game Grumps were just being pulled out from a clown car by a large yaoi hand, their eyes full of memes, sample text trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what but the next one was different but we couldn't tell what but the next one was different but we couldn't brain anymore. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited rainbows on the floor, Uncle Gaben and Snoop Dogg laughing at the screen. The -0.1357545653279 frames were not as if they were 666666666 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video (though technically they were :p). We saw the hand slowly man-handle the...man-handle, we saw the Grump's eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the Grumps beginning to unzip their pants.

Troll Face told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Our Lord and Savior The Almighty Loaf arrived within about 9007 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so Troll Face just continued the episode, anticipating The Almighty Loaf's reaction. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming at cats, all sound again bass dropped. Shrek was just telling ""your mom"" jokes at the viewer, full ugly of the face, for about 333 seconds. The shot quickly escalated out and Shia LaBeouf's voice said ""JUST DO ME--I mean, uh, DO IT"" and we see in Shrek's pants a Minion. He immediately puts the Minion in his mouth and [error: text missing] Completely fake looking [error: MOAR text missing] splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back using the force. The last 5555555555555555555555555566666)))$)))))) seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, in his sexy pose, one rainbow frog dancing above him, staring blankly at him. Then the episode ends.

Our Lord and Savior The Almighty Loaf is obviously confuzzled at this. He demanded to know what the flying feathered fried ham was going on. Most people left the room at this point (for a little ""private time""), so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me eternal horniness. I'm not sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by Troll Face, but he admitted that even he couldn't pull off something THIS huge. The HMO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere .00000000000000000024 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was interrogated for dank memes and weed as well as viruses, as if the time stamp may have trolled us and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don't know what happened and we honestly don't give a crap.

There was an ""investigation"" due to the sexy nature of the photos, but nothing came (*snorts*) of it. Every meme seen was identified but no clues were gathered from the data involved (though I think they just got lazy and went back to bed instead--can't say I blame them). I never believed in unexplainable phenomenomenomenomenomenomenomenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can't prove anything about it beyond my stoned ramblings, I think nothing about things.

3zvbub,3,2016-01-07,Planning for business growth in 2016,KeystoneProc,BusinessInsiders,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusinessInsiders/comments/3zvbub/planning_for_business_growth_in_2016/,"Many businesses are working their way through their plans for 2016 at the moment. From working with businesses and organisations of varying sizes over the past 18 months, we have distilled the main options for most businesses down to seven growth strategies (this is directed at SMEs and micro businesses – aspects apply to larger companies but it is not specifically directed at them).

Below, we outline the main options in brief.

Work harder: The cheapest (financial) option but many businesses are already doing this. People can seek to leverage their time by focusing on higher value activities but will need to be able to fund the execution of lower value tasks passed to third parties, interns or new hires.

Expansion loans: This is the traditional source of funds for business growth in many companies. In fact it accounts for at least 50% of expansion funding across the EU. At the lower end of the scale are countries like Denmark (in terms of dependency on bank debt to fuel business growth) while countries like Ireland are at the higher end of dependency on bank credit (over 90% of businesses in Ireland are dependent on bank debt to fuel business growth). Different countries have different approaches to securitising debt, the use of personal guarantees on loans and the availability of cashflow based lending. For many companies it remains the avenue of choice but it comes with risks and costs (both charges and the contingent costs arising from provisions like personal guarantees).

Government funding: these schemes vary widely but are perhaps at their most useful during the early phase of business development. Government funding schemes can be a viable source of credit that subsequently enable business growth but they are often very bureaucratic and can take a long time to come to fruition. Some government agencies take equity stakes in companies in return for investment which is an additional consideration for business owners to take on board.

Private equity investment &amp; alternative funding sources: whether via a private equity investor, through the injection of one’s own funds, crowdsourcing, employee share schemes or other mechanisms like invoice financing, these alternative sources of funds can provide the capital necessary to grow. The key challenge is to ensure the overall blended cost of using non-bank funds remains competitive and acceptable to the business owners. The non-finance related costs and risks (like managing the expectations of private investors for instance) also need to be acceptable to the owners.

Hire new staff: where companies can afford it, hiring staff is ultimately the only way by which business growth plans can be delivered. This can be achieved through direct hires, contractors or outsourcing but resourcing growth plans is ultimately one of the main reasons businesses seek funds to grow in the first place.

Develop a new line of business: conventionally this may mean something as simple as opening an online channel but it can equally involve developing new product offerings and lines of business to reposition a company for sustained business growth. It is important to remain realistic in relation to what in-house skills can achieve if a new product offering is being developed. A detailed, considered plan that takes account of the rationale for a new line of business, the costs and potential benefits of entering a new market and the resources required to do it is essential.

Join / set-up a consortium: for businesses seeking to maximise large contract opportunities without acquiring debt, a consortium can represent an attractive option*. Through collaboration, opportunities to grow in size and scale as part of a consortium present without members incurring significant investment costs. It allows multiple business partners to build on their existing capabilities. There are challenges and complexities associated with participation in a consortium but it could be argued that there are modest downside risks and significant upside benefits for those that commit to making them work.

The businesses that Keystone has worked with have all examined several of the options outlined above as part of their growth strategy. There are pros and cons for all of them depending on a business’ needs and where they are in their business cycle. The reality is that there is no one size fits all approach to business lines let alone businesses yet we find that is often the way business growth is thought about.

The businesses that grow fastest do not have a monolithic view of growth. They use different tactics for different products or services depending on the market they are in.

Note:
a consortium is subject to competition law and while most companies can benefit from joining a consortium, they are not suitable for all companies or all sectors. Professional advice should be sought by participants to ensure that they operate in a sufficiently competitive sector for a consortium so that  collaboration is not seen as either market distorting or illegal in nature.

3zvscq,123,2016-01-07,"January 7th, 2016 - /r/RandomActsOfCards: Visa, Mastercard, AmEx... I'll take em all.",Lurlur,subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/3zvscq/january_7th_2016_rrandomactsofcards_visa/,"##/r/RandomActsofCards 

**5,104** Card Lovers for **2 years**

Random acts of kindness are totally in vogue right now. Your Amazon wishlist, pizza, oral sex, it's all covered by a random acts subreddit. For those on a tighter budget, not willing to pleasure a stranger or who just enjoy the simple joy of a hand written note in their post, I present today's subreddit of the day!

/r/RandomActsofCards is another of those genuinely nice subreddits. The people seem lovely, the mods are engaged and friendly, even the CSS style has a comforting feel. You can offer cards, request a delivery or arrange an exchange. Using the simple flair system, it's also possible to filter posts to help find the ones of interest to you. 

A lot of people hand make cards, but you could just as easily send local postcards or seasonal greetings cards. 

The subreddit also encourages friendship building and conversation. With a weekly discussion thread and a reasonable amount of comments on posts, you can see how nice these people are. So, if you fancy making a new friend or a whole group of them, maybe consider sending a card.

A word of caution. Due to the nature of the subreddit, you do have to be pretty open with your address. Please keep that confined to PMs and not posted on the sub itself!


The interview portion of this feature was carried out some time ago by an intern lost to the sands of time. I'm a little jealous because they seem so lovely! Enjoy this upbeat interview with the mods /u/Lehmongeloh, /u/Amaurotic, /u/Cheapishowifeel and /u/mellywobbles.

&gt;##Tell us a little about yourself!

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** I'm lehmongeloh. I'm on reddit pretty much every day helping to run the sub and sister subs we have with my wonderful team. Outside of reddit I'm getting my masters in social work and do a lot of nonprofit programming with LGBTQ communities. Some of my favorite hobbies are comic book reading, exploring abandoned places, co-op puzzle platformer gaming, and lifting weights.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** Howdy, I’m Amaurotic. I live on the Canadian West Coast, and I’m currently taking my B.Sc. in Cognitive Systems. I also have a passion for tattoos, and illustrate on the side. I think one of the most magical ways to pass the time is by having a meaningful conversation with someone.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** I'm CheapIsHowIFeel and I live in central Ontario, Canada and work in the Veterinary Administration field. I completely switched careers a couple years back having gone back to school in my 40s, and I haven't looked back! My dream is to be a Veterinary Practice Manager or a Shelter Manager and it's getting closer every day.

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** My name is Melody and I'm a full time student studying electrical engineering. I enjoy baking, taking my dog for walks, kayaking, reading(huge fantasy nerd), playing video games, and sleeping because even though I'm only 24 I'm actually an old person. I love animals- I have 2 cats. Florida has always been my home.

&gt;##How did you get involved in /r/randomactsofcards?

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** I'm the creator of /r/randomactsofcards and initially did a lot of the CSS work. My intent was to create a safe and welcoming place for anyone to come to that can spread a little joy to people who want it. I used to make a lot of custom pop-up cards for people, and it was a pleasure to get to know other redditors about their likes and interests and hear about their surprise when they received it in the mail. Anyone is capable of doing a random act of kindness, and it's so humbling to see the subreddit grow from others who feel the same way.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic**  I joined /r/randomactsofcards early last year both out of curiosity and excitement. I’ve been making hand-drawn cards for family &amp; friends since I was a kid, and I’ve always loved the feeling of personalizing a card for that specific person. Once you’ve found yourself sending and receiving cards from across the world, you’re hooked. I fell in love with /r/randomactsofcards, and I figured since I’m on Reddit so often, I may as well lend a hand behind the scenes.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** I joined /r/RandomActsofCards in the Spring of 2015. I absolutely adored the idea of spreading love through the mail and had just recently started re-connecting with family and friends that way - so this was a natural progression. I only recently became a moderator at the sub to give back to the group that has given me so much.

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** I found this awesome subreddit one night while looking around r/penpals. I joined this community because of a request to send a sick girl in the hospital cards. I spent like an hour on making that card, and knowing that this will make someone happy had me hooked. I have since then enjoyed making friends here and it feels awesome knowing that a simple gesture like sending a card can make someone's day a little better. I have received so much support on here as well, many kind people are in this community and I'm proud to be a part of it.

&gt;##What was the best card you have ever received?

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** The best card I've ever received is from /u/Ashlene88 who gifted me this Batman birthday card. Of course it's sideways. Batman is my favorite comic book character, and I really love homemade cards.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** This is a tough one! Every card is special in their own way. One card that comes to mind is from /u/Drnkslv . I sent him a drawing of his local park in the Czech Republic, and he sent me back a card with a photo of him holding my drawing, at the park (so the obvious thing to do was to take a picture) of his card at my local park!)

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** My very favourite card is a card I received as a child from my grandmother. It was a hand-made flat card. I can still picture it in my head (and I actually had it displayed at her memorial). Unfortunately I couldn't find it in time for this!

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** The best card I ever received was definitely one of the handmade ones from u/Amaurotic and u/cannedpossum . Both have sent me amazingly well drawn/painted cards that took a lot of creativity to make. I cannot choose a favorite card, I love them all so much! :)

&gt;##Tell us about your community!

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** Our community is made up of thousands of people from all over the world. People here love to send cards, expand their collections, or look forward to opening their mailbox for something fun addressed to them. A good portion of our community has a colored envelope next to their username. This means that they have sent at least one card to someone (and usually people start sending more when they discover how much fun it is for them). We have a couple star users that have sent over 250 cards and counting that we track in our sister subreddit /r/raocflair. Every request post has had at least one response from someone willing to send a little happiness. This community works hard to make sure everyone feels welcomed.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** /r/randomactsofcards is a constant reminder for me that such a sincere degree of generosity and compassion exists in the world. We’re a very tight-knit community, yet everyone is exceptionally welcoming and supportive of each other. It’s truly a little oasis of its own.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** Our community is about connection. In a world filled with instant communication, it is oddly difficult to feel truly connected to another human being. A card requires more than just typing a few words and clicking a button. The thought that goes in to choosing the card for the particular person (or making it), the words to convey a specific message, addressing the card, going to the post office to purchase the stamps and send the mail -- and then the wait until it arrives. It's an entire journey towards letting someone know they matter. And, quite strangely, the journey gives as much to the sender as the receiver.

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** As I said above, this subreddit is home to sooo many awesome people. You'll find a warm welcome, kind words, friendly people, and immediate support. Everyone here is kind and I have made several friends through this subreddit. I'm so happy to see that it's growing in size. The act of sending snail mail is a dying practice and I'm happy we can keep the tradition alive. Its very rewarding to see thank you posts done on behalf of those who requested for others or someone who's asked for emotional support; it reminds us that a simply gesture can make a huge difference to someone.

&gt;##Anything else you would like to tell us about /r/randomactsofcards?

&gt;&gt;**Lehmongeloh** 
Anyone is welcome to sign up and subscribe. We run contests and give out prizes, we have various weekly discussion threads, the subreddit changes with themes, and we're always thinking of new ways to improve. The success and atmosphere of this subreddit is due to all our subscribers and community members, and I truly appreciate what a pleasure it is to be a mod of this sub. I never thought it would attract as many people as it had, and I can only hope it'll continue to grow.

&gt;&gt;**Amaurotic** You don’t always need a special occasion to send out a card. From the celebratory to the loss, from the made-up-holiday to the bored, our community is about all about sharing our life experiences with each other.

&gt;&gt;**Cheapishowifeel** We're waiting for you!

&gt;&gt;**mellywobbles** This is the best subreddit... that is all. :D

Just realised my title makes me look like a prostitute.

Soon I will have to come out of sick leave by necessity, and job-hunt. 

It will likely have to be some relatively non-taxing part-time job alike that of high schoolers or freshmen to start with, say for the next 6 months or so. 

But I'm 23. The idea that a 23 year old working part time is basically a loser is quite distressing and demotivating. I am 'supposed' to be building a lucrative career, have gone on internships, applied for multiple job interviews with Fortune 500 companies etc. At least be doing a Masters or PhD by now. It causes me to panic that I have done *nothing* really career wise since I graduated, bar a few hours of voluntary a week for the last *year*. But thinking about the long climb doesn't make me progress, I don't improve, I just freeze and stagnate. Many of you will know how it feels to be unemployed, which is worse than just being part-time. 

I also have to evict myself from the dating pool due to pressure for men to be high status. This is also upsetting but it provides me time to find myself. I hear things get better as men get older and people mature. 

How do I get past this pressure to be a 'high-status man'? I am simply not ready for a career. My SSRIs only really started kicking in over last month.

3zwrbh,30,2016-01-07,TIFU: Got Fired from Busy Season Internship on Second Day,braddlac,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3zwrbh/tifu_got_fired_from_busy_season_internship_on/,"I had accepted a Winter Busy Season internship at a midsize firm in June 2015. The internship was intended to run from January 1 to April 15 and the offer only mentioned an internship. Coming back to school in September I participated in the standard recruiting cycle and was offered a job at a Big 4 firm in October 2015, due to begin in September 2016. 

Now that January arrived, my internship had started a couple days ago. During my first day we went to lunch and during casual conversation was asked if I have any offers for the Fall, a harmless question, so I said yes, they followed up asking where and I told them. 

I arrived at work on my second day and started reviewing some of the documents I was given. Halfway through the day I was called into an office with HR and was promptly fired, although the term offer rescinded was used.

I don't feel as though morally I've done anything wrong. I didn't have any obligation to tell them when I accepted the offer with Big 4 because they had only given me an internship and shouldn't have been required to lie when asked about an offer for the Fall to keep my job. 

What's everyone's thoughts?

3zwt86,20,2016-01-07,Here are some thoughts on MaM by a person with a MS in Forensic Science - TH Garage Scene of Murder - What do you think?,cwheintz,MakingaMurderer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/3zwt86/here_are_some_thoughts_on_mam_by_a_person_with_a/,"For the record I am currently an expert in Toxicology working in the private sector, not a current crime science investigator/trace evidence/DNA/Fingerprint/Firearms or Toolmark expert. I have had internships prior in each of these fields though and have been trained extensively in each of the subjects. Everything written below is my opinion based on my training, experience, and education thus far. 

I feel most sorry for Teresa's family and Brendan Dassey/Avery's parents in this whole situation. I cannot make a judgement on Avery's guilt/innocence without truly being able to see all the facts/crime scene first hand. Please forgive my ignorance if some of these questions have been answered or discussed as well.

I am going to focus my thoughts and questions just on two points of evidence in the garage for this post as this was the Prosecution's supposed scene of the murder for Teresa.

**Gunshots with .22** 

 Was there ever a shooting reconstruction done pre or post conviction? I find it troubling that there were shots fired inside a garage but no blood splatter or shooting-reconstruction performed. 
*The energy behind a .22 caliber rifle is minimal. [ .22 LR vs. .223 Rem. - The Firearm Blog](http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2011/05/03/guest-post-22-lr-vs-223-rem/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=SumoMe&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share)*  
*Opinion* 9/10 a .22 that is fired into a body will remain in the body
*Why wasn't there any bullet fragments/melted brass found in the firepit? - Try it yourself.. Hammer some nails into a log and burn it down. TH PDA/personal belongings and bones survive fire but not bullets?

*Was there a comparison done on the bullet found v. the gun by an expert? Every bullet shot is unique to the specific gun, because of individual wear and specific tool marks of the rifle/pistol, there seemed to be some clear space on the fragment found that could contain some of these indicators 

*The bullet found with DNA was it consistent with impact of a .22LR into human flesh in its current state. 

*Can verify by shooting the same rifle into a dead thawed pig (I know a little sad..but in the name of science!) and analyze the bullets side by side

*How many additional fragments were found/when were they found/where were they found? How many casings where found in total and exactly how did the rifle in question eject rounds on average - *how many feet and in which direction did the gun eject the cartridges* - This could help pinpoint a shooter's positioning and where the body was shot and possible locations for blood/additional evidence 

*Was the gun tested for Teresa's DNA or Oxidizers (cleaning)? When a gun is fired at close range into an object (human) there is significant blow back and atomized blood (fine splatter) that projects in all directions casting a shadow on objects that are blocking its range. It is extremely hard to know where to clean these fine atomized particles of blood some of which are microscopic. 

   *There is always blood in a shooting, if investigators didn't find any than:
   *The investigators were not instructed to look for it
   *The Dept. was not trained to look for it 
   *They did not find any and this would be documented in the investigators personal logs
   *Blood was found but testing confirmed not relevant. Though in a suspected clean-up case it does become relevant.           

**Throat slashed**  

*Look up (At your own risk - gets a little graphic) - Throat Slashing Blood Splatter. I will not include a link here as I am at work and don't want that on my history

*When a throat is slashed blood continues to be pumped by the heart through the carotid arteries in the neck. 
*These blood splatters are cast with the rhythm of the heart beat - so heart pumps/blood squirt, high arch, gravity kicks in blood squirt/arch's down 

*It get's very messy FAST. The avg. person contains 10 pints of blood - *Thought exercise* take about 8 pints of synthetic oil and casually pour them out consecutively that's about the rate of blood loss when both arteries are sliced

*Blood is a little less viscous (thickness) then oil, but also tends to congeal like it meaning it won't travel as far - so it will be condensed to a certain area. 

*If not pre-meditated (set up like a Dexter kill room) the blood would quickly pool and begin to soak into what ever medium it is on or near - such as concrete - which is porous and into every little crack and crevice near or around the body. 

*Anyone who has ever spilled oil in their garage knows that if its not cleaned up immediately it stains quickly. 

*If bleach is suspected on the scene did they find any empty bottles? Did it smell of bleach in the Garage? Was it faint or overpowering? With 8 pints of blood you would need 8+ pints of bleach/ was it 10% bleach/water or pure? 


These are just 2 points of contention in the numerous inconsistencies through out the case that I have problems with understanding. If you are accused of First Degree murder, every single inch of area and every single second of the timeline should be scrutinized and dissected using forensic evidence. 

It feels as if the Prosecution pick and chose their Forensic evidence to support their theory of events. I am a believer of *let the evidence speak for itself.* Like a puzzle, each piece is seemingly insignificant by itself. When you begin putting them together they will form into a clear picture. 

The tests done and evidence found presented questionable timelines when presented with the intelligence level of the individuals and their personality types. 

This is my first post, this case just got me riled up enough to speak on it. Hopefully someone can help answer these questions for me because I am at a loss. "

They have expensive suits, lots of power and more often than not their hair is silvery.

But how does the ruler of the concrete jungle fare against the ruler of the actual jungle, the [silverback gorilla](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/Silverback%20Gorilla%20Wildlife.jpg)



Round 1, the hunt:

An external consultant advised that the IT team of the silver hair CEO's company needs a teambuilding event. So for this the CEO gives them hunting rifles and sends them into the jungle to hunt down the gorillas.

In that jungle dwells the bloodlusted group of the silverback Gorilla. The apes actively go after the IT guys and hunt them down.

Can a team of ten inexperienced nerds with hunting rifles beat a group of ten bloodlusted gorillas in a jungle?

If the gorillas dominate, add HR.



Round 2, the intern:

Who can make a new intern piss his pants quicker?

The CEO is stressed &amp; moneylusted and screams at the intern from close up after the poor little guy fucked up.

The gorilla roars with all his might from ten feet away.



Who has the better team and who is the real boss?"
3zx78o,17,2016-01-07,Career Change Anxieties - 29 yo from dead end jobs to Big4 accounting,bebetna,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/3zx78o/career_change_anxieties_29_yo_from_dead_end_jobs/,"Hi all, I've been lurking for quite a while and this subreddit actually helped with my Big 4 superday (I got the internship!). I guess this post is to both tell my story and express my anxiousness at starting a career so late in life.

8 years ago, I graduated with a BA in Communications which led me to a ton of dead-end jobs (waitressing, office managers, etc). I kept getting declined for jobs in my field, such as marketing, pr, event planning, which made me super discouraged and depressed. I must've applied for more than a thousand jobs during this dark period in my life haha. I then decided to go back to school but kept getting low low scores on the GMAT and GREs which kept me from getting into a decent school until FINALLY (3-4 years later), I got a good enough score to get accepted to an accredited school for an MBA degree, which leads me here!

So I figured I'd like to get my CPA as well as work for a good firm. It didn't have to be a Big 4, just a good decent-sized public accounting firm where I can learn and grow in my new field. I applied for maybe 3 or 4 internships and went on second day interviews for all and was declined for ALL FOUR! I again felt discouraged and thought maybe going back to school was a bad idea. My loans were piling up plus I wasn't getting a chance to put my foot through the door. How embarrassing! 

After the last rejection email, feeling highly dejected, I applied to a general posting to one of the Big 4's website. Surprisingly, I got a call from a recruiter at said Big 4 who invited me to a phone interview, which I thought I bombed but turns out I didn't because I got another phone call a week later inviting me to Superday. I read all the posts here regarding preparation, attitude, etc etc, and although I walked in there knowing my stuff, I still felt nervous, almost as if I knew I wasn't going to get the position because of my past failures and rejections. But even with that looming above my head, I was positive, I spoke clearly, and I asked a lot of questions during Superday. I got an email a day later and I didn't even need to open it because the subject line was ""CONGRATULATIONS from Big4 company!"" I ran to the bathroom and cried my eyes out! After 8 years of rejections, depression, and failure, I finally got the validation I needed in life! 

Which leads me to my anxieties - I'm 29 years old and I will be working with people way younger than me. Most of the time, I know my superiors will be younger than me. I can't help but think that if I started in this field earlier in life, I would already be a manager. But then I wouldn't appreciate it so much I guess. :) It also helps that I don't look my age so I might be able to skate by without disclosing my real age haha!

Anyone else who started a new career later in life felt this way?

Thanks for reading my wall of text. Sorry if it was long but I am really happy and very appreciative! Just a little nervous and anxious!

Some reasoning for my choices:
Datapike was excluded because it interacts poorly with bad publicity. Caduceus also has this problem to some extent, but it competes less with datapike because it represents an early sentry in case they're running a ZU.13 Key Master or a Gordian Blade.

Executive boot camp allows the deck to effectively play more copies of Elizabeth Mills and Adonis Campaign without diluting the deck too much (by playing 3 Liz) or spending too much influence (by playing 2-3 adonis). It also provides protection against Blackmail, since this is a bad pub deck. 

Hostile Takeovers provide fodder for Archer, and allow the deck to climb out of low credit pools (via account siphon, vamp, caduceus or emergency shutdown). This combined with crisium grid are intended to make the deck more resilient than average to econ denial. Having a scored Geothermal Fracking can help to this end. 

Spiderweb and Rototurret should be better than usual, since parasite recursion will be slightly less prevalent after the introduction of the MWL. Blue Sun is naturally more resistant to parasite, so runners are a little less likely to search up/recur them with clone chip over something like D4V1D, which is also a consumable program that has a lot of value against most blue sun builds

SEA/Scorch: Bad publicity encourages the runner to run, and the same time doesn't boost their economy when you're SEA sourcing them. It will provide some economic advantage by saving them credits on breaking ICE/trashing assets, but this deck aims not to float more than 1-2 bad publicity for any extended amount of time. Additionally, most of the cards that give bad pub also give large amounts of credits, allowing you to win the trace.


I've thought about fitting in some number of Interns, or the power shutdown combo, but I'm unsure of what would need to be cut. I don't think the deck can afford to play any fewer ICE, and most of the operations seem necessary, so maybe the assets/upgrades/agenda suite would need to be fiddled with.

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate comments/suggestions! "
3zy0t8,1,2016-01-07,[Help] Blizzard internship cover letter.,Uberman2321,CoverLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoverLetters/comments/3zy0t8/help_blizzard_internship_cover_letter/,"I was wondering if you guys could help me here. I'm a bit lost and I'm not sure what I am supposed to write. My father works at Amazon and he got a connection to help me get a internship at Blizzard. I've sent in my resume, and so far the person at Blizzard is already impressed. Now she wants me to write a cover letter based on these requirements. 

Here is her message she sent by email: I received a copy of your resume and it looks impressive.  Please send me a Fabulous cover letter that includes the following in your own words:
------------------------
Your Passion for Games.
Your Passion for Blizzard.
What it would mean to you to be employed by Blizzard?
How you could make a difference here at Blizzard?
Once you have the crafted and completed, send to me and I will send your resume and cover letter over to the “Right People” to review.
-----------------
So far I have written this: (this is just a draft)

I’ve started playing video games ever since I was a little child. When I first started playing, I never really got into the story part as long as I completed a mission or a match. At first it was just for fun until I gradually read into the stories. Over the years, video games have been more like an interactive timeline where I make my own decisions and decide where do I want to go, not where someone else wants me to be. Having choice and freedom of doing what I want with my characters gives the upmost indulgence. I have always sought most video games to be my ultimate scapegoat of meeting new people and creating friendlier relationships. 

I have sought Blizzard as one of my favorite gaming companies. The reason being is, as stated before, they have always given players the freedom of choice. Many other companies like Bethesda have also given players the ability to look into backstories but to an extent like Blizzard has. Blizzard has created a whole world entirely where it may just take decades to discover all of what they have created. There’s so much more to discover and create and I want to be apart of what can be the best experience any new or old player can have. 

What would it mean to me if I were to be employed here at Blizzard? It’s the opportunity to work in an environment where every employee is determined to make more and better improvements on current or past projects. The improvements wouldn’t just be the projects themselves but the team members who will be subconsciously improving themselves to work harder together and more passionate together resulting in bonding and creating long-term relationships. 

Over the years working in retail, creating customer relationships has always been my forte. Whether a customer and I have just met (for maybe less than 30 seconds), they’ve always returned to the stores that I have worked at or stores that have the same brand name but in other locations. If I were to work at Blizzard, my skills in creating relationships with customers and bringing customers back would be used to its fullest extent. I do have other talents that I can contribute to Blizzard such as voice acting and character design.

So far, I reviewed it with my father and I cannot seem to get any help from him. So far he has asked me such a simple question to which I cannot answer. ""What can you do for this company?"" My mind went blank. I didn't know what to say. So far I'm looking online for as many examples as possible to spark up some ideas. Unfortunately when I come up with an answer my dad shoots it down as if my proposal was meaningless. He proposed the idea that I give up, and I refuted the answer and told him ""never"". 

It looks like this cover letter is too much of a story than a letter. I was wondering if I could get your guys' opinion on this and what I could do to improve (Maybe throw in some ideas). "

    select weeklyBudget from storeBudgets where store = '197'

The weekly budget (which is the dollar amount in sales the store is supposed to reach) will be the same every week for the entire fiscal year for that individual store.

I am wanting to combine these two queries so that each row in my result will have3Columns for each row: EndDate, Total Sales amount, and Weekly Budget.

So this is my first year away from FIRST, due to a sudden internship across the country. Since I remember it being very hard to train my replacements in Java, I figured I should share a project that they could help out on.

I've been working on my college graduation project for the last few months. The short version ([long version here](http://gappleto97.github.io/Senior-Project/)) of it is that I'd like to make a Folding at Home-style network for people to run various calculations on, where people are rewarded for running it.

However, I've got a bit of a chicken and egg problem. The network is designed to work with java, but I've got no intensive code to test it with. So if you'd like to help, here's what I need from y'all.

1. It should run for several minutes. I don't care if you accomplish this with sleeping, or with actually intense calculations. But it needs to run for at least 5 minutes.
2. It should return a final result. This can be retrieved by my network by printing ""End of debug output"", followed by the information you'd need to reconstruct the answer. If you ran ""2+2"", it would look something like `End of debug output\r\n4`
3. It should have at least one instance (wherever you'd like) where it prints a line which says ""Verification flag"" followed by a non-random line. So the first one could be something like ""This is a test #1"".
4. (If you're feeling under-challenged) It should perform extra operations. For instance, there will be a sandbox in place, and you can request the size of that sandbox. For a few of these, it would be nice if they asked for things like network access, or the ability to read or write to the hard drive.

Mods: If this is inappropriate, please let me know. I'm more than happy to take the post down or modify it if you feel this is not right for this sub."

I am new to reddit and someone suggested I come here for some much needed advice. I am currently a senior accounting major at a college and I am currently stuck on where I should look to start my career. I had received 4 second interviews this fall with regional firms all of which I did not receive an offer. I met with my career services office and they ran me through some mock interviews and they said they were impressed with my interview skills and I just have to keep looking for jobs. I want to become a CPA, but at least no CPA firms in my area are hiring (or at least that I can find) and most places are only looking for seasonal help. I do not have any CPA internship experience which I have been asked about on multiple occasions, but I do have non-profit accounting internship as well as bookkeeping internship. I am involved as president of 2 clubs on campus, but I am doing something wrong, or just getting really unlucky with firms having already hiring their summer interns. 

My question is, where should I be looking to find full-time work, and will CPA firms open up hiring to seniors after tax season? My school is in a location where it is an hour from any city and it would be extremely difficult to work during tax season.

Thank you everyone for your help!"

I gave her an ultimatum to leave after her job is completed or I end the engagement.  Did I do the right thing?


I (25M) have been in a relationship (21F) for over 3 years.  About a year and a half ago I proposed to my girlfriend and we have not been happier.  The issue we are having are her parents.  


Her and I are both in college, and this semester she is required to do internships.  So, naturally, she chose to do her internships close to home so she has access to a car and does not have to worry about money issues.  Which is totally fine! 


The issue is that we are set to marry on October 15, 2016.  And her internships will end at the end of May.  So instead of her coming to live with me after her internships her parents have forbid her from leaving the house until she is married.


We have had some brief discussions with her parents and they have always been quick to shut down the topic and say no to the idea of her and I living together.  The main reason, as we can see, is because of their religious beliefs.  


I am very upset about this, mainly because we will be apart for 10 months all the way up to our marriage.  Which I do not feel is right.  


Now, my fiance has always been afraid of her parents.  Notice that I say afraid, because I know the difference between fear and respectful.  She is not the confrontational type, so the thought of her going against her parents scares the shit out of her.  


But, for my own reasons, I needed to know that when we get married, and when we have kids....will she choose me, or will she choose her parents because she is afraid of them.


Because of this fact, I asked her that when she is done with her internships to move up with me.  And I said that it is so important to me that I will end the engagement if she can not do this.  


I know this sounds very selfish of me, but for 3 years we have been at the ruling of what her parents have decided.  I need to know that she will choose me.  


The issue I am having is, am I making the right decision?  I do love her very much and I do want to marry her.  But if she does not choose me and she lives with her parents should I go through with ending the engagement or should I back down and just accept it.  I don't want to lose her, but this seems like my only option.  


Any help will be useful, thank you!"

This was competitive, as there were a limited number of slots, and I know of several students who also applied that weren't offered a slot. With all I hear about how competitive internships in aerospace are, I was not immediately surprised that I got the ""we have continued with other candidates"" a few weeks later. Now that I think about it, though, I'm a little worried. I think that an interview is a sure sign that they're seriously considering you, and that they've already done a lot of filtering of the applicant pool at that point, so I'm beginning to think that I made a negative impression.

3zz714,0,2016-01-07,[Discount ESEX] Calm returns to Valve headquarters after Vegetable Esports Club fails to qualify for The Shanghai Major,Zacoftheaxes,DotA2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3zz714/discount_esex_calm_returns_to_valve_headquarters/,"Today a calm was restored to a recently panicked Valve headquarters after Vegetable Esports Club lost the second North American open qualifier, ending days of uncertainty as to who would cast matches during the regional qualifiers and possibly the main event.


“We almost had zero Merlinis!” one seemingly exhausted Valve employee was heard mumbling from his cubicle. “Thank god, you can't have an event with out at least one Merlini.” 


Valve employees had considered bringing in casters from the Counter Strike community to cover for the event, but still had difficulty finding enough talent to bring in. “Sirscoots and Thorin are pretty acceptable choices. We already have RedEye on board. Who the hell are we going to get past that? Not fucking Richard Lewis.” said another Valve employee.


During an emergency meeting earlier this week, many ideas were tossed around. One intern suggested that Valve should consider looking into casters from the competitive Team Fortress 2 community, after which the entire company pointed and laughed at the intern.


Before news of Vegetable's elimination, Valve began testing of commentators from the Super Smash Bros community, but found little to work with. “D1 did well but everyone else just spent time talking about their waifus and yelling about their dicks. Bobby Scar was better but every five minutes he reminded us that there's a Twitch emote of his face.”


Valve employees say their biggest regret during the panic was wasting thousands of dollars outfitting an expedition of archaeologists to discern the secrets of the long forgotten Starcraft II competitive scene in hopes that the ancient ruins would provide a satisfying answer. 


The calm has been great news for Valve managing director Gabe Newell, who was actively involved in the search. “We got desperate, I'm not going to lie. Apparently there's some game called SMITE and we were seriously looking into its community. We considered every single option. Everything to keep Slacks off the microphone.” said Newell. “We contacted literally everyone in the company to work on resolving the issue when it looked like we weren't going to have any commentary for the event. Everyone responded immediately saying they would help, except for the customer support team who we expect an answer from in the next two weeks.” "

I am terrified of his friends and family not liking me.  I know it doesn't matter that much and I know I am a decent person and likable but I feel really insecure.  His friends are much older and so they are generally out of school or established in a career.  Some are married with children.  I, on the other hand, am still getting my undergraduate degree and I am working internships and a part time job at a restaurant.  I feel like I can never really open up to them because I am generally afraid that they will judge the phase in my life that I am in...

My boyfriend is lovely and it works when it is just us two but I just freeze up when I'm out with him and his friends.  He notices it and has asked what he could do to include me more but I don't know what to say.  I feel weird talking about school or my restaurant job or my goals.  Our age difference has never really been addressed among his friends which may add to my awkwardness but I'm not sure what to say about it or if there is anything to say.

How do I get over this insecurity?

3zzhok,16,2016-01-07,NSV: My spiffy new locker,cenosillicaphobiac,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/3zzhok/nsv_my_spiffy_new_locker/,"**TL;DR.  After 15 years of paying $10 per month for a work gym membership I finally got Member of the Month after 9 straight weeks of working out at the gym every single day that I worked.**  I've lost 25 lbs in those 9 weeks after a sedentary weight loss of 45 lbs for a total of 70 lbs.

I put my TL at the beginning because I don't want people to be intimidated by the wall of text that happens when I've just smoked a j and downed 2 beers, but I still want to brag.  So for those interested, here is my overly detailed story.

Every cloud has a silver lining, right?  I was down about 45 lbs. over 5 months, but was at a pretty serious plateau, and needed a way to break through.  I’d been eyeballing LeanGains, since losing weight rapidly but haphazardly had also left me feeling weak and like I’d probably lost some muscle along with the fat, but needed a push to get it going.  It’s mostly for guys already in shape, but it seemed like a natural since I was already intermittent fasting.

Here comes the cloud, both cars need serious work and my dog fucks up her leg, requiring vet attention, holiday season right around the corner, and broke.  My wife and I needed to tighten the belts (literally and figuratively) and cut costs wherever possible.  Time to start packing a lunch instead of driving for fast food every single day.  I commited to not buying any prepared food for as long as possible, so we stocked up on Costco stuff, and I started taking lunch every single day.  Cycling between two basic meal sets for rest days (which were actually cardio days) and weight training days.  

Gold lining:

Not leaving campus every day, and choosing food I could actually eat while working, opened up my 60 minute lunch break for working out.  Double bonus: we have a mediocre gym right on campus, one that I’ve been paying for every month for 15 years now.  So began the workout routine.  With 7 minutes at each end to get downstairs and change and change back, with 5 minutes for a shower and 5 minutes to heat up food, left me roughly 35 minutes to work out each day.  And mind you, this was free from a free time perspective.  It wasn’t time away from my little family.

I try to maximize those 35 minutes every single day, I do better some days than others, but all in all I’m pretty proud of what I crank out in that 35 minutes.  I put on my headphones, play some music that would probably get me written up for playing at work if my headset ever cut out, and push and pull heavy things or jog on the treadmill.  If somebody is using the things I want to push or pull, I modify my workout on the fly depending on my body part focus for the day, because I can’t stand around waiting for turns.

I’m proud to say, that since starting that, I can’t think of a single day that I’ve worked that I’ve not at least stepped in the gym and done something, no matter how stiff or sore I was from the previous day.  I work 4 days a week, and that was 9 weeks ago.  Yesterday and today it was slow so they were offering early outs, I took them on both days, but not before heading down to the gym to work out (actually it was really refreshing because I wasn’t under my 35 minute time limit, so I relaxed and worked out even harder).  Because of the holidays and a couple of other days off, I’d estimate I’ve worked out 30 days at work in a row, and on my days off I still manage to squeeze in 1-3 workouts at the local community rec center per week.

Monday morning I did what I do on Monday mornings.  Before work, after shitting and pissing but before ingesting any food or water, I got down to my undies and weighed in the scale at the gym at work, and was pleasantly surprised that over the New Year’s week I’d managed to lose another 2 lbs for an even 70.  In my head I was all “I get to change my flair!” and on the way out I mentioned this fact to the intern that works in the gym.  She said “that’s awesome!  And congratulations!”  When I asked her why she was congratulating me, she pointed at the Members of the Month flyer on the wall and there it was…. For the first time in 15 years, with off again on again attendance of the gym, I’d finally been named Member of the Month.  What did I do?  I walked right back into the locker room and stowed my gym bag in my personal ""Member of the Month"" locker.

I think i do a pretty good job and usually it seems like the interviewers like me but I think it may be because I am a sophomore. I had 1 exam in the fall and I just passed FM this december so I was wondering do you think I will get more interviews with 2 exams as a sophomore or should I just wait to have 3 exams and become a junior so I can be a pretty competitive candidate (Taking MFE in July)? I know most companies do hiring in the Fall so just looking for some advice.

Right now I have:

---

So, right now I'm in the middle of working on a program that Amateur Shoutcasters can use to improve their streams. The overlay will soon-enough be able to do it all... Include team monikers, current team scores, apply exciting Objective information, show tournament name &amp; show a tournament icon! Right now, it only works for League of Legends, but I hope later versions will work for various games and genres.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qa4ZfWYr44

---

Unfortunately, due to technological problems with Windows, it will never be as simple as downloading and running through OBS alongside League of Legends... Windows will only pass keyboard/mouse input to one application at a time, so you can't run both on the same computer. The user will absolutely need two computers and a capture card connecting them. Good news is that my application is quite lightweight, so that second computer doesn't need to be very powerful!

---

So, as I was saying, right now I'm in Pre-Alpha. As you noticed with the icons above, the greenscreen effect is none-too-pretty for them. This was something I could not tweak out of OBS (as I was trying to go with a semi-transparent effect), so I'll probably have to leave the icons fully visible at all times. Not what I hoped for, so we'll see.

---

The Icons currently represent the first objective of it's type being capture by a team: First Blood, First Tower, First Dragon, First Inhibitor and First Baron.

So, here's what I'm looking for: any ideas on what other shoutcasters may want to have included with the application! I'm still quite open to ideas, especially since I'm trying to use it - not just for my personal tournament stream, but also as part of my application toward a Game Design/coding internship.

Thanks all, I'm looking forward to your thoughts!"

I really don't know what to do right now. Hopefully you guys can help me out.

I think that I should begin by saying that I am by far not a smooth person and I consider myself only an average level of attractiveness (which is way below average in the gay world as I have found); Grindr claims about 99% of my sexual encounters and to this date I have not had an actual date with someone and have that turn into something romantic or a second date, etc. I've never really clicked with anyone that I've messed around with until this guy, whom for the purpose of this post I will call Jake.

Jake is a fraternity brother of mine that is pretty successful in his future endeavors already - working as an intern for his dream company more than he is in school, full time offer for it after he graduates, super attractive, etc. I never knew that he was anything but straight until I made a joke one time and that lead to him confiding in me that he had tried stuff with guys before. He is completely in the closet, believes that he is bi but thinks that society doesn't accept bi people, that they believe a person is either gay or straight (I have failed at convincing him otherwise), and that he would be ostracized if he came out. (I, on the other hand, have been out since I came to college)

In his youth, he was a victim of sexual abuse by an adult of the same sex and he thinks that his thoughts for men may have come from this traumatic episode. Needless to say, he is very confused about his life and what he wants.

I developed a defense mechanism after coming to terms with my sexuality (albeit not before some heartbreaks) that pretty much keeps me from falling in love with anyone that isn't attracted to men, however attractive they themselves are. After finding out that he not only is questioning his sexuality but has had experience with men before melted those barriers down and suddenly gave me hope for something that I had not imagined to be possible before.

I had a type. Not just for looks but also for personality. He was everything that I have ever dreamed of and more. I had always dismissed him as a possibility because I thought he was as straight as they go, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that the reason that I was so attached to him as a friend was because he was the perfect one for me.

The night he told me all this happened to be on a vacation trip that we took in the spring with some other members of the fraternity. We took a long walk on the beach and talked about his youth and what had happened to him, his previous experiences, his struggle to come to terms with his feelings for other men, and I feel like we connected. We were both drinking at this point, and talking gave way to some flirting and some touching and we eventually came to the point where the people we were on the beach with wanted to go back to the house. (It was pitch black almost, so we had a lot of privacy the whole time) We went back to the house with the rest of the group and drank some more, then eventually found places to crash for the night. 

I had found a place that was right next to Jake, and because of the close quarters, I was pretty much right next to him. My heart must have been pounding at this point I was so nervous, but for some reason I knew that Jake was still awake next to me after everyone had fallen asleep and I snuggled a little closer and to my joy he did the same. Somehow my hand found one of his and we kinda held hands for a little bit. He turned over to me and after we snuggled a little bit more I had felt that he was aroused (so was I at this point, who am I kidding) and we began to make out and mess around. We were pretty close to other people in the room who were sleeping so we had to be pretty quiet. It progressed to me giving him a handy and he even made a joke about him being a ""tough nut to crack"". Eventually we figured out we couldn't really finish without making more noise and possibly risk waking someone else up so we gave up on it after making out some more. I was over the world that it happened in the first place. We fall asleep.

Next morning, we had gotten up and he had acted like nothing had happened. I figure we should talk about it and since there were people all around us, I kinda just texted him and asked about last night (my mistake, shouldn't have texted him probably, but I don't know, I was so overwhelmed) and he had replied saying that he didn't really remember much of last night and that whatever happened it was no big deal. I told him what happened and he said something along the lines of him not knowing what to say really, and that he would rather have not done that, nothing against me.

I was pretty heartbroken, because I had thought I had found someone that I was both bonded with romantically and platonically. I spoke with a mutual friend of ours that both of us entrusted (I knew if he talked to anyone about it it would be her) and she basically advised me not to expect anything, that it was most likely going to be a one time thing, and that I shouldn't torture myself.

So there it was. It was hard, but I kinda got over it. It kinda hurt our friendship a little bit, but he went back to his internship for a semester and I stayed in school so it kinda cooled down on that front. End of story right?

Wrong.

As the end of the semester neared, he came by and visited the fraternity during one of our parties, and at the conclusion of the night, we started talking, flirting, and one thing led to another and we ended up on my couch, and this time, since we were alone, we ended up giving each other blow jobs. After all that was done, I could tell he was in a pretty good mood, and we decided to rejoin the people still awake for the aftermath of the party and went our separate ways.

Now that semester ended and a new one is beginning. He is moving back into the house and we are once again having cheerful back and forth banter as if nothing had happened. We haven't talked about what happened at the end of the last semester yet, but if he was in it for the no strings again, I don't know if I should bring it up at this risk of sounding like I want to make something out of this when he so clearly did not want me to previously.

What should I do? If there is a possibility he has accepted his sexuality more and feels more comfortable with having a gay relationship, I'm so down for that.
If there is a possibility that he is ok with just a FWB thing I am ok with that too; even if he feels like the second time was also a mistake, I want to know at least, so I can stop my emotional roller coaster. I think I am in love with him, but I don't know what he feels about me. What did the second time mean? Should I talk to him? Should I leave it be?"
400z8j,4,2016-01-08,Screenwriting Your Way To Hollywood,DexFA,Screenwriting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/400z8j/screenwriting_your_way_to_hollywood/,"Throughout filmmaking history screenwriters have used many methods to achieve success in Hollywood. Nora Ephron (When Harry Met Sally, 1989) easily gained access to Hollywood as the daughter of stage and screenwriting team Henry and Phoebe Ephron. Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, 1999) juggled many jobs and wrote for the T.V. series, “Get a Life,” before catching the attention of producer Steve Golin. Alan Ball (American Beauty 1999) chose a different path; he first worked as a theater producer and writer. Producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner invited him to Hollywood because they both saw the debut of Ball’s hit play, “Five Women Wearing the Same Dress” at the Manhattan Class Company Theater.

While Hollywood screenwriters have their own success stories, they also share strong work ethics and know how to foster vital business connections. This article examines how current Hollywood screenwriters Dan Bucatinsky and Tim McCanlies learned from their predecessors’ habits and how they jumpstarted their writing careers.

Dan Bucatinsky is a talented and disciplined writer who broke into the Hollywood scene in 2001 with his romantic comedy, “All Over the Guy.” A 1987 graduate of Vassar College, Dan took advantage of his education and worked diligently to learn his craft and develop a unique style. His time spent writing countless papers, stories, and scripts in college attributed to his screenwriting excellence. When he returned to Vassar in 2004 to advise aspiring screenwriters Dan emphasized the importance of writing every day.

“Even when I draw a blank, even when I don’t feel like working, even when nothing I put down on paper is any good…I force myself to write for at least a couple of hours every day,” Dan revealed.

This discipline is a trademark of successful Hollywood screenwriters. According to Dan, a writer’s willingness to push himself can prove more significant than raw talent. There are many naturally gifted writers; what distinguishes a great writer from a good one is the technique they have gained through careful study and years of dedication.

Several helpful books exist for writers seeking guidance as they try to develop their skills, including, “Crafty Screenwriting” by Alex Epstein, “Adventures in the Screen Trade” by William Goldman, and “Secrets of Film Writing” by Tom Lazarus. Dan Bucatinsky and countless other screenwriters rely on these resources to craft innovative, creative screenplays. 

Like Dan Bucatinsky, Tim McCanlies (Iron Giant, Secondhand Lions, Dancer, Texas Pop. 81) gained attention for his artful writing. He nurtured his natural writing talent by practicing and revising scripts when he wasn’t working at odd jobs to support himself.

In 1979 he published his first novel, “Harlem,” and enrolled in the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College to further study writing techniques. While in school Tim simultaneously excelled in his classes and completed a screenplay based on his novel. His hard work paid off: college founder Gary Shusett noted Tim’s diligence, read the screenplay for Harlem, and helped to get the script optioned by Interscope.

In a recent interview Tim revealed that he still writes every day and added that “the key to good writing is to focus on developing strong, interesting characters.” He stressed the importance of building up a writing resume, encouraging aspiring writers to embrace all learning opportunities including internships and jobs as assistant writers.

One of Tim’s early jobs was as an assistant writer for the 1987 film North Shore. An array of writing jobs and internships can be found online through websites like www.mandy.com, www.backstage.com, www.hollywoodlitsales.com, www.FreelanceWriting.com, and www.CyberScreenwriter.com. 

Tim urges beginning writers not to lose hope, saying that it took him more than six months to write and revise the screenplay for “Iron Giant” even with his strong educational background and years of professional writing experience.

As gifted, hardworking writers, both Dan Bucatinsky and Tim McCanlies recognize the significance of contacts in Hollywood. Hollywood studios receive thousands of scripts each month. Of these thousands only a few hundred may make it from the mail room, past the intern’s desk, and into the executive’s office. In the rush to read and pass scripts through the hierarchy, Hollywood studios push many screenplays to the back burner or, worse yet, immediately discard screenplays without review. Some amazing screenplays end in the trashcan while many mediocre scripts are approved for production.

Why does this happen?

Because when a script arrives with a cover letter of recommendation from an executive’s old professor, friend, co-worker, etc… it goes straight to the top of the studio’s “Read Me Now” list regardless of quality. This is the reality of the Hollywood system, however unfair it may seem to newcomers.

The smart screenwriter will accept this reality and make the most of his/her connections to ensure that their script lands in the “Read Me Now” list. Although mixers through organizations like the American Screenwriters Association and the Writers Guild of America are good places to make contacts, the schmoozing element of the business often requires some luck as well as hard work.

For example, Dan Bucatinsky was close friends with a woman named Lisa Kudrow when he was studying to become a writer at Vassar College. When Lisa became famous for her role in the popular television sitcom, “Friends,” she helped Dan achieve his Hollywood dream. She ensured the production of “All Over the Guy” by signing onto the film as an actress and recommended Dan as a writer to many Hollywood producers and directors. Dan and Lisa continue to collaborate on film projects, and he writes parts for her into his screenplays. When Dan speaks to students, he stresses making valuable friendships in college and urges students to view writing as a business as well as an art.

Tim McCanlies also credits much of his success to luck and connections. Without the support of Gary Shusett, an associate producer on the 1988 film “Moon Over Parador,” it is unlikely that Interscope would have read Tim’s unsolicited screenplay “Harlem,” let alone optioned it. Once Gary Shusett helped him get his foot in the door, Tim had the opportunity to make films with rising Hollywood stars like Brad Bird (Iron Giant 1999, The Incredibles 2004) who appreciated his work ethic and creativity. Tim’s career as a Hollywood screenwriter thrives today because of the connections he made and fostered as a young writer.

The key to breaking into Hollywood as a screenwriter is twofold: a willingness to write, study, and practice with consistency; and a talent to develop relationships with people in positions of power. There is not one right way to be a screenwriter, but these elements are significant to achieve success in Hollywood.

I have an industry internship with a large firm this summer, but I'm also looking to make it to at least one Big 4 SLP (if I get the offer).

So the question is: when I'm interviewing for the SLPs, should I mention the fact that I have an internship? Or just keep it on the down low? "
402aae,4,2016-01-08,My(30/m) friend(28/m) made up a lie about my ex(25/f) to save his relationship,throwaway41201,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/402aae/my30m_friend28m_made_up_a_lie_about_my_ex25f_to/,"WARNING WALL OF TEXT.

About 5 months after we broke up, a female friend told me she heard from my friend's girlfriend (try to follow!) that my ex was using hard drugs every day for the last few months of our relationship. She went to his house the day before we broke up and confessed this to him. I was totally destroyed by this news. I believed him until I met up with my ex for a beer to catch up and because she heard I was worried. 

She had a total different account of the events. First of all, she is doing *great* at life, is happy, looks healthy, claims to have given up her party lifestyle, and has landed a few internships in her line of work. This girl is not on hard drugs. We dated 4 and a half years. I know this girl. She tells me that the day she went over to my friends (I should mention, we were all very close with one another), she went to tell him she was going to dump me. SOO, he tries to **kiss her** while his girlfriend is at work. My ex didn't accept the advance. Then a few months later, he texted her asking if she wanted to see a dick pic (his girlfriend was out of the country). I have another very close female friend who told me that he was asking her to come over during this same time period *while she was dating our mutual friend*, and has tried to cheat with her, so I know what my ex was telling me is true. My ex also mentioned that he would make advances at her throughout our entire relationship, but never told me because she knew how close we were. I also spoke to her best friend about the drugs and she responded like I was out of m mind for even thinking that was the case.

I have no idea why my friend told his girlfriend that my ex was using hard drugs, but I have a feeling he was caught in a lie in his relationship, and now this has totally spiralled out of control for him. Remember, the ONLY person he actually told this to was his girlfriend, and *she* told our mutual friend who told me. He hasn't spoken to me since this all came to light, so I believe he thinks I know he was lying.

I can't deal with knowing this information! I don't want to destroy his relationship by exposing him because I was also very close with his girlfriend, and really don't want any more drama. We run in the same friend group, so I will have to explain to mutual friends at some point why I can't hang out with him anymore. I don't want to give up our mutual friends because I did NOTHING wrong here.

Help. Super confused.

TL;DR Friend made up a lie about my ex to cover up bad boyfriend behaviour and I'm the only one who knows. Don't want to lose mutual friends over it."

402vb3,229,2016-01-08,"Modpost: Introducing ‘Sources Required’ Discussions, a reminder about the expectations of quality in this subreddit, AMA with Jeff Bezos, and general updates",EchoLogic,spacex,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/402vb3/modpost_introducing_sources_required_discussions/,"Hey team. Just kidding about the whole Jeff Bezos AMA thing - but we do talk about similar topics below, so keep reading! ;) 

We’re just doing another modpost so we can all catch up and discuss how the subreddit is going. Long walls of text ahead, so I’m breaking up this post up into a few sections. Feel free to read the sections that interest you and can be bothered sitting through!

1. Introducing Sources Required Discussions
2. Expectations of Quality
3. Subreddit Survey Update
4. Wiki Contributors needed!
5. Ban List Update
6. Wrapping up.

### Introducing Sources Required Discussions

This has been vaguely in the back of our minds for a long time, but we never really felt a need to implement it until now. Recently, the speculation and general uninformed submission of ideas has started to reach a more critical mass, and we want to address this, without being overly onerous, if possible.

Long story short: we’re introducing a new aspect to the subreddit called “Sources Required Discussions”. [Here’s an example of what you might expect to see in such threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/402s48/sources_required_how_does_the_required_%CE%B4v_for_a/).

This is a **totally optional** additional quality control check that any post author can implement, by simply including the text “Sources Required” in the title of their post, with some type of bracket surrounding it. Once submitted, your submission will be automatically flaired with “Sources Required”, and our lovely automod bot will make a short comment in your thread informing other users of the additional requirements this thread contains.

User-submitted comments in such threads will be subject to additional quality checks. First off: Top level comments must contain references to primary sources (this includes news articles, scientific papers, PDF’s, tweets, and more) - Wikipedia is not a primary source! We can do better. Automod is now smart enough to tell when you haven’t included a source in your comment, and will remove your comment and let you know what you did wrong.

Comments that are not top level, but do claim to be objective information, must also provide sources. We’ll catch these manually. 

Obviously it’s not our goal to limit discussion here; so questions, corrections, and other statements are exempt from the above rules. We like to be lenient where we can, so if you ever feel your comment was removed inappropriately (you will always get a message about this), let us know and we’ll reconsider.

### Expectations of Quality

It’s great that we’ve got so much enthusiasm post Orbcomm! However, we’ve noticed a rise in the number of just generally bad posts and bad comments - overall we seem to be just a bit too peppy right now. You know when a comment that simply says “Jeff Bezos” is posted… more than treefiddy times… in a single thread… there might be a wider issue present.

This is an interesting trend, because the vast, vast, majority of comments in the subreddit survey wanted *stricter moderation*, which was both surprising, and something we’ll have to think about over the next few months. We’re not sure tightening the rules would be worthwhile right now.

**So, here are a few things we’d like to ask of you:**

1. Drop the Jeff Bezos insults and comments, unless you have an actual informative, indepth comment to make. Likewise, this is a no-fly zone for the terms “Bozo” and “Bezo”. This is a SpaceX subreddit anyway - most of us come here for SpaceX news and info, not competitors.
2. The number of simple questions that we’re having to remove is astounding (“Why is the rocket covered in soot the way it is?” x 100). There is an ‘Ask Anything’ thread stickied at the top of the subreddit for this sort of stuff - furthermore many of these questions are present in the FAQ, even furthermore, it’s likely it’s been asked before. Search first!

    It’s great everyone’s asking questions, but it’s detrimental to clog up the front page with them. To prevent this, we’ve raised the character count on what we consider an “acceptable” self post significantly. If you’ve always written high-quality posts and discussions, you won’t notice a difference.
3. Unless you have a really compelling question about touring SpaceX or getting an internship, sorry, but we’re going to redirect you to the Ask Anything thread or the FAQ. It’s been nearly one per day recently.

However, nearly all of you have been participating in this subreddit for many months/years with high quality submissions and comments. If you continue to participate like this, you won’t notice any difference in how our actions affect you. 

### Subreddit Survey Update

The subreddit survey closed a while back, and we’re in the process of graphing the data at the moment. There’s still a few people who I need to chat to who wanted to submit answers without using Google Forms, so that’s on my todo list before prettifying the charts.

Long story short, we got over 2000 responses, which is insane.

### Wiki contributors needed!

If you’ve been participating in this subreddit for more than 6 months or so and have a history of informative comments; and you’d like to help out with improving the state of the Wiki and FAQ. Let us know! Note that if you want to make structural changes (such as adding pages or moving content), please let myself, or /u/retiringonmars, or /u/ravedave know first. 

### Ban List update

We like to be transparent where possible, [so here’s the subreddit ban list as it stands](http://i.imgur.com/BxP6Wrz.jpg) (there was Star Wars spoilers on here, but they’ve been removed). Furthermore, we are currently using subreddit shadowbans for 12 accounts, most of which are 1-2 persistent trolls.

### Wrapping Up

So, that’s pretty much it. As always, we like to make modposts just as much about us announcing new things as much as we want feedback from you! Want to change or modify a subreddit rule/guideline? Tell us something we’re doing wrong, or could be doing better? Go for it! All proposals go up for popular vote, and if the subreddit agrees with you in majority, we’ll make your requested modifications.

Let us know your thoughts!"
402z8b,3,2016-01-08,Etiquette for notifying potential employers about already accepting a position,SylveoPlath,paralegal,https://www.reddit.com/r/paralegal/comments/402z8b/etiquette_for_notifying_potential_employers_about/,"Thanks for all the tips on my last thread, y'all -- I got the position! I am officially going to be an immigration paralegal intern.

That said, I have one law firm who contacted me back and asked me to email them in mid-January to discuss the internship further. In the meantime, I've already interviewed and accepted a position with another law firm.

What's the etiquette here? They will not be contacting me first, I'm sure, so I would have to reach out to them. They're expecting an email mid-January to discuss the possibility of me interning with them, but I don't know whether I should still email them.

My professional gut says to contact them, let them know I've accepted a position elsewhere, and thank them for their time so I don't burn any bridges. But I've never been in the position where we haven't even scheduled an interview when I've accepted another position. (In the past I've accepted before another interview and just let them know I wouldn't be interviewing with them because I'd already accepted a position.)

What's the etiquette here?"

Backstory: Graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering after 8 years of trying to get through. I went to a large highly ranked College initially that was out of state and expensive. after 4.5 years and constantly being on the border of passing and failing out I got dropped 17 credits from graduating. I went to a community college and fixed my grades and transferred to a smaller college and got my degree and paid for that college through selling a vehicle and other means. But from that first college I have $197k in debt.

I graduated in May 2015, finally, and got my Engineer in training license, I had an internship with the Army Corps of engineers my last year in school which transitioned into a full time job which I really enjoy and enjoy the people I work with. I am in a program that steps up salary, right now it is about $38k before taxes and other deductions and I usually end up taking home $806 biweekly (health insurance is stupid expensive and it is for my wife and I so it is almost $200 biweekly that's just gone) but for the next few years I will get step increases for the next few years topping off at a GS-11 which is $55k or so. positives are that in the summer opportunities for overtime can arise with need and I have to travel a lot which gets me a per diem of about $51 a day which I don't use all of and is paid tax free. My wife is an advisor for the local state university but only making about $36,700 and takes home about $2300 a month. My state is having issues to instead of laying people off, her department just froze wages for the unforseeable future. But She is working on getting certified to be a real estate agent, but we aren't counting on that till it starts bringing in money, but has options. Also, we have about $7k in savings for emergency funds if anything happens, both have crappy paid off cars, hers might die soon though, mine is in better working condition but high miles.

Ok, here is the important part.

I have 65,596.22 in federal consolidated loans. We have them on an Income based repayment and got them to $86.53 a month but the good thing is with the corps I get loan forgiveness after 120 payments. Decently set there.

[here is the list for all my loans](http://i.imgur.com/vDegVVX.jpg)

Also, want to note that the Navient Parent loans are taken out in my parents name and they don't have much so they expect me to pay for them, which, they have sacrificed a lot to help me get through college. My dad is a truck driver and makes about what I do now, and my mom has always been a stay at home mom and is in poor health, which most of their money goes to keeping them healthy.

So advice I need from you guys is pretty much should I consolidate the discover, wells fargo, sallie mae, and citibank loans? I am not sure how to with that amount as a few local banks I have looked into will only consolidate up to $80k. I can currently make minimum payments on all loans but doesn't leave me with much and I need to get ahead of these loans.

I need some solid advice on where and how to consolidate if that is a good course of action. I don't need judgement, I realized I have a lot do dig my self out of, not much to work with, and I made some mistakes in choosing colleges. I plan to pay all my salary to get out from this burden as my wife's salary generally goes towards living expenses maybe a few hundred able to help on payments. Either way, if you need more information or I forgot something just let me know."

I've been lurking for awhile, btu have been into cigars for some years now. Now that I have a nice paying internship, I felt it time to finally step up and get my own humidor.

It's the Whitetail Glasstop humidor from CI. I bought with the extra starter kit. So far, it's keeping around ~~70-75% humidity, so I'm happy!~~ I realize now that that is too high. I'm bringing it down to 65%

As for the sampler, I got the White Christmas Sampler II. I'm not too big on full flavored cigars, and prefer more medium to mild. This pack seemed right up my alley, and was a cheap way to quickly fill my humidor with 18 cigars.

**Bad news** is that I will no longer be offering full face for videos or pictures. I have gotten some pm's about people knowing who I am irl. With the vast internet I cannot risk the chance of a future employer seeing me naked with a tail (even if he does like it). All of my premades with face will be edited or taken off the list as off Sunday.

**Best news** is I'll never stop posting naked pictures of my self because I enjoy it too much! If I had the chance I would be a pornstar of course, but a steady job in technology is more practical.

404i4l,552,2016-01-08,Life Sucks - A Defense of Philosophical Pessimism,darthbarracuda,philosophy,https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/404i4l/life_sucks_a_defense_of_philosophical_pessimism/,"#Life Sucks – A defense of philosophical pessimism#

##Introduction##

Leibniz famously proclaimed that this was the best of all possible worlds in order to solve the problem of evil.

A century later, Schopenhauer would argue the opposite: this is one of the worst of all possible worlds, permeated with suffering, decay, and death, in which everything is an incarnation of the insidious Will.

For the average reader, the adjectives used may seem accurate, but the proclamation that the world is so poor would be taken as an exaggeration. It is in this post that I try to argue in favor of Schopenhauer’s, and his fellow pessimists’, lament of the world.

##Suffering##

First, I would like to define what suffering is. Suffering is any irredeemable discomfort across a spectrum of feeling. By “irredeemable”, I mean “unable to bring meaning out of”, as in pointless, defeating, and burdensome. Physical pain often accompanies suffering, but it not necessary (i.e. psychological suffering).

Now, it is plainly obvious that there is suffering in the world. There is discomfort, oftentimes quite severe. It is my belief that what makes something of ethical value is its ability to feel suffering, and that our ethical impetus should be to address the existence of suffering.

There is no doubt that quite a lot of discomfort can be redeemed in a meaningful way. Climbing a mountain may be extremely strenuous, but worth it in the end.

However, there is a problem here. The meaningfulness of this discomfort is *post hoc*. If anyone would willingly take discomfort over neutral or pleasant feelings, they would be a masochist.

Therefore, the world is filled with unnecessary discomfort.

##Boredom##

But what if we lived in a world without discomfort? This is where the second part of Schopenhauer’s assessment of the world comes into play: boredom.

My argument is that existence as we know it is a pendulum that swings back and forth between suffering and boredom. If we are not suffering, we are either in a brief intern (a relief which I take to be happiness), or bored out of our minds.

Experience makes certain slices of reality more vibrant, whether that is pleasurable sex or a miserable root canal. Our attention is focused on what is happening, beneficial or detrimental.

But when you are bored, reality begins to become a heavy, stagnant burden. There is no stimulus. Your consciousness is desperately reaching out, trying to find something to keep you occupied. My claim is that life is a literal waste of time; every single thing we do is a distraction to keep us from confronting the void of boredom. Weltschmerz becomes very evident if you are ever bored for a significant amount of time.

##Pleasure##

But what about pleasure? Isn’t it rather odd to focus only on the negative?

I am not denying that pleasure is “psychological beneficial”. Rather, I am claiming that pleasure is intermediate, temporary, and ultimately unsatisfying. The Buddhist concept of *tanha* explains this: certain kinds of pleasure are like addictions; after using up your supply of pleasure, you are back on to the hedonic treadmill. Evolution did not program us to be happy, it programmed us to be motivated. Furthermore, a simple introspective activity will lead to the conclusion that pleasure is far less “real” than pain. A simply pinprick can hurt like hell, while all the chocolate in the world is not orgasmic (in fact, too much pleasure can lead to discomfort).

##Consciousness##

My conception of happiness is one that makes it equivalent to contentedness. If you do not desire anything, you are content. You do not feel any anxiety, any pang, for stimulus. You are at peace. Like Schopenhauer, I argue that to be content not only requires you to limit your desires but also to be free of suffering. Again, not all pain is equivalent to suffering; for example, I could have a headache and still feel generally happy. This does, however, show how easy it is for happiness to break. Happiness is a very fragile thing, held together by threads of pleasure, contentedness, attention, and ignorance. The default position of human consciousness is that of striving, discomfort, and dissatisfaction.

As Zapffe argued, I hold that consciousness is ultimately a burden, a curse that evolution bestowed upon us. We have become too smart, too observant. The human mind has aspirations that the universe cannot fulfill. Unlike many ancient Greeks who thought that rationality would lead to happiness and flourishing, the pessimist affirms the opposite. Rationality has exposed the nature of reality, and it is not pretty. It could be argued that pessimism is a philosophy of disillusionment.
 
Zapffe also argued that humans “artificially limit” their consciousness. To be conscious, at least in the human sense, is to have to ability to suffer, feel boredom, and come to the meta-conclusion that this is what the consequences of consciousness are. Humans will often escape the panic of this realization by sublimating their thought process, thus the creation of culture, political ideology, religion, aesthetics, etc. In this way, we avoid the panic of realizing how empty our lives really are and become addicted to a fantasy.

##Solutions##

What I have written is not a comforting picture of the world. But there is no limit to what philosophy can explore, even if it makes us uncomfortable. 

There are some paths we can take to deal with all of this. I deny that these are mutually exclusive.

The first path is to rebel. Nietzsche and Camus come to mind. I have sympathies to both of them, but I think Nietzsche went too far. His *amor fati* is not only impossible, but masochistic. Camus was far more tempered and realistic; his Sisyphean philosophy is one that can be applied to an unstable, nihilistic world without radically changing the structure of it.

On the topic of Nietzsche: his Ubermensch appeals to our desire for victory, dominance, and flourishing. But I deny that one cannot become an Ubermensch if one lives a “nihilistic life” as Nietzsche would say. I deny that such paths as the Middle Path of Buddhism are “incompatible” with Nietzsche’s overman concept. In fact, if we were to take to the path of the overman without conceding the wisdom of the classic pessimists such as the Buddha and Schopenhauer, we will only be setting ourselves up for inevitable defeat and non-stop suffering. Nietzsche claims that the overman would be able to embrace this; I claim this is psychologically impossible and masochistic.

The second path is to pursue asceticism. Asceticism is a difficult word to pin down, but basically what I claim asceticism is, in this context, is the path that rejects the world as it is. The ascetic realizes that meaningless pleasure is only fuel for an addiction; although it feels good, it is ultimately a very bad thing. The ascetic realizes that the ego is the microcosm of the world and the structure of suffering; thereby denying the ego, they attempt to deny themselves suffering.
 
Interestingly, if we are to take the Buddha’s philosophy seriously, then much of the suffering imposed upon us is self-caused (by ignorance, aversion, and attachment).

Notice how the first two paths deal with the more “existential” burdens of life. But there are still very real, very harsh physical pains, that cannot be tempered by mere psychological perspectives. Tomorrow I might get a raise, but then again, I might get into a car accident and be impaled and die a horribly painful death (which is obviously irredeemable). Depending on your ability to deal with your current existential condition, alongside the perceived probability of something of the aforementioned magnitude of happening, the rational path may be suicide. Perhaps suicide is indeed the rational choice for everyone, since the future cannot be predicted, and you won’t know of any pleasures you have missed if you are dead.

I doubt the ability of technology to solve these problems. It is far more reasonable to assume that these technologies will be perverted and cause even more suffering, as is the case in a significant amount of technological advances in the past.

My personal philosophy on this is that regardless of whether or not we like this perspective, we are programmed to continue to live. Unless we are in such significant, traumatic suffering, we cannot kill ourselves. It is biologically impossible. So the solution is to minimize what suffering we do experience, maximize our pleasure and happiness, and ultimately live a life that, when it comes to die, leaves us with the knowledge that it was worth it. It would be quite sad to look back at your life and wish you had killed yourself earlier, whereas, if you look back at your life and come away knowing that, against all the odds, you managed to make your life meaningful and worth it, that would constitute a ""good life"" in my book (even if it's not worth it to start a life).

It goes without saying, however, that regardless of which path you take (or lack thereof) there is no excuse to inflict harm upon another sentient being (unless by self-defense). This includes procreation, or as I tend to view it, destructive breeding. When one realizes that each and every sentient being is a fellow sufferer, then it is quite easy to see how compassion should be used to assess our relationships between other people. 

##TL;DR: As Thomas Ligotti said, “LIFE IS MALIGNANTLY USELESS.”##

Cheers.

404ki8,3,2016-01-08,To the one I hope to love some day:,ayjak,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/404ki8/to_the_one_i_hope_to_love_some_day/,"Most of my friends are getting into relationships or continuing long-term ones. Several years ago, I'd be jealous as all hell. I remember crying to myself, unable to believe that I made it through high school without even having my first kiss. I felt ashamed, sitting in my college dorm room, feeling like I was the only one in the world who wasn't a virgin.


Well, I've already reached those milestones. I'm no longer sitting here, pressured to leap into a relationship to do something before a certain age. Not that I was before - I enjoy looking back on those experiences; I have no regrets. With that being said, I do believe I would have had a significantly clearer head if I wasn't feeling as pressured by society to do things.


All I've got right now is me, and I'm pretty excited about that. I want to work on myself for a little while. I've recently switched majors, and I'm hoping to make that my home. The faculty seems awesome, I love my adviser, and I cannot wait to start becoming a real part of everything. I do not know my new classmates in my major yet, but I'm looking forward to hopefully making some good friends, preferably over sobbing over an biochem exam, or an inorganic lab not working. 


I'm going to become an EMT. This is something I've wanted to do for years. I've talked about it, but unfortunately, the course never worked with my schedule. This time, I made it a priority. 


I'm going to become that weird, yoga-obsessed, kale-eating girl you'd find in an aisle in Whole Foods. I love what yoga has done to me so far; I'm addicted to the added energy I've been able to feel running through my veins. I've been cooking more adventurously, albeit typically setting off smoke alarms, but I've been having fun. Some of my adventures have been absolute disasters, but I never would have known unless I tried them.


I'm going to drop the activities that drain the life out of me. I'm sorry, to the sport I'm leaving after so many years. It's no longer worth the tears and frustration over petty drama and power struggles. I have no room for negativity in this new me. 


I'm going to go to med school. Again, that's something I've always wanted to do, but it's somehow always gotten buried by everything else. I felt like I had to prove something to myself - to everybody else, by instead becoming an engineer. Well you know what? Let me wipe your tears with my future title of Dr. ... also with my massive student debt, granted, but also with my happiness. 


I'm going to do things that are exciting. This summer as an intern was a lesson if there ever was one. I'm going to talk to people in fields I'm interested in, making connections and seeing if what I want to do will have me wanting to go into work every day. I have no idea where I'm going to end up, but I'm open to anything.


I want to get an odd fun job before I'm ""too old"". Perhaps I'll bartend at a downtown bar, laughing at my classmates as they make fools of themselves in front of that girl they're trying to impress. Maybe I'll work at a small coffee shop, being able to keep up with a ""triple whip extra soy half-caf regular"" or whatever it is. I want to have fun and have a few extra dollars here and there. 


I hope to meet you someday. I know I'm not supposed to go looking for you, so I'm going to stick to what I'm doing. Maybe I'll find you at my job 10 years from now. Maybe I'll meet you in medical school. Maybe I'll run into you tomorrow at Staples when I go to buy new earbuds ... probably not because I always think that, and I don't think I'm going to meet you if I'm looking. 


I want to be able to talk with you forever about topics nobody else cares about - a friend's sister and her boyfriend analyzed Shrek for over an hour, and nobody understood what was happening. I want to debate over whether octopus are actually capable of taking over the world... stupid stuff like that. 


I want to lie in bed with you all morning one day, listening to my Arctic Monkeys record, preferably having hot sex. I want to have GOOD sex - more importantly, I want to communicate. I want to feel like I am the most beautiful thing in the world to you - not through your words, but through your actions. I want to be your world. I want you to be mine. 


I kind of hope you'll be the guy my mom doesn't love at first. She doesn't tend to love the wild guys I bring home, but those are the most fun. It's almost like I'm not supposed to fall for you ... but that makes me fall that much harder. 


I hope I'll be head over heels in love. I hope you'll change my life in some way. I hope you'll be the one. I hope you're out there somewhere, doing your own thing. But don't come looking for me - it'll be that much more special when we bump smack right into each other one day. 


I hope you're following your dreams, doing what you love, because that's what I'm trying to do right now. If you exist, I hope we meet in the silliest of ways, telling all of our friends the story for years to come. And if you don't exist? Well, it looks like I'll just have to keep following my dreams. Bummer. "

I'm 24 and have been kicked out twice by my NMom. She constantly threatens it, but it's only actually happened twice. I lived with a friend for a while, then with my grandma (nmom's mom) who is 90 but also is partially the reason my mom is the way she is so I ran into similar problems. I was unable to support myself due to my own faults with not budgeting properly, but also because I had to pay for a few semesters of school out of pocket, a new car, constant repairs on old car, and a laptop for my classes. (i'm a graphics art student)
At this current moment, I'm saving a lot of my money for a safety net and a deposit on an apartment. I have over half of my goal money, but plan on moving out after this next semester, which is around the spring/summer.
It's becoming harder and harder because I'm constantly worried that I can't support myself and I'll end up here, again. Granted, I'm grateful that my nmom lets me live in her house rent free, but it's at a great cost for me emotionally. I had a breakdown when I had to leave my grandma's a year ago, friend's tell me I act drastically different when I wasn't living with her, etc.
One that is holding me back is access to apartments in my price range because of a lab I have. I have considered rehoming him, but it's not something I entirely want to consider because I almost view him as emotional support. My dad died a few years ago, we got the dog as a last wish for him when he was in hospice, and when he passed I took care of him. My dog was the only reason I didnt slip into a fatale depression cycle as my family spiraled even more out of control. I have considered trying to claim him as an ""emotional support"" animal, but I'm not quite sure if I'll meet the qualifications. I've been in and out of therapy since I was a teen, but we lost insurance and since I've gotten medicaid it's been significantly difficult to keep a therapist or find one that isn't an intern. If anyone has advice on accessing these services, let me know.
I'd love to rent a house instead of an apartment, because my dog would have access to a yard, but it's extremely hard to find people my age that are ready to move out? A lot of my friends are either in debt, just graduated and haven't build up a budget, or are still in school. 
My sister and I have talked about moving in with each other. Our relationship has been rocky, because my NMom constantly pitted us against each other. I was the Golden Child she was the Scapegoat when we were growing up. Now, my NMom likes to switch the rolls on us. Among some other reasons, I think this is one reason we aren't really jumping at the opportunity to live together.
It's just really hard because while I almost have the money I need, I still need to find living arrangements and I'm getting really discouraged.  "
405saa,9,2016-01-09,How do I get my life back? Advice needed.,Olffrick,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/405saa/how_do_i_get_my_life_back_advice_needed/,"Some background: I've been going through sheer hell lately. Over the last year and a half I stopped working, and dropped 180 pounds. I took the time off because my family needed help and I was literally eating myself to death.


Growing up I was part-time SG, part-time GC, full time middle child depending on the parent, the mood, or even the arbitrary day of the week.


N/Emom (because honestly she's always been both) is a contrarian, an addict, and an all around emotional vampire. She can drain the energy out of any room, make everything about her and how she feels, and more or less does not care unless something negatively affects her. Growing up I always saw her as a victim and never a bad guy until I became an adult and started to see that her behavior was quite abnormal.


NDad is an alcoholic, former cocaine addict, and has always had the emotional maturity of a teenager. He cheated on my mom, squanders his $100,000+ a year job on alcohol and what I believe are prostitutes but I can't confirm that.


As for me, my role in the family always seemed to center around playing peacekeeper and caregiver to the wayward and incapable. From the time I was about 8 or 9 I learned how to cook to feed the family, I played housekeeper, maternal grandmother lived with us, so I also played nurse/caregiver. I did my own laundry. I made sure I was up and ready to go to school. I also made sure to keep my grades up and excel. I couldn't ask my parents for help because I was the exact opposite of them. For everything I did right in my younger years they did wrong. Both barely passed high school. My mom boasted about how she ditched half of sixth grade and all the cool and awesome drugs she did in high school. My dad's stellar advice to me was such time honored classics like, 'I'm a prime example of what not to do.' and 'I already did school.'


For all of my parent's shortcomings they would always tell me how intelligent I was, and how I could do anything I wanted with my life, and that I would go far. I would get convoluted praise, but no real direction or anything substantial.


When I was a teenager things all went to shit. Our house burned down. My pets died. I couldn't get them out of the house because I had to get my Grandmother out, and it was too late to go back in. By this time both of my parents had been sober for five or six years. They got an insurance payout, rebuilt, and took out a mortgage just in time for my dad to relapse and have his midlife crisis. He coked, boozed, and cheated. My mom fought for him which made our lives worse for the wear. After 4 long years she divorced him for good.


During this time, Nsis, moved out for college. She had never been much help. That always fell on me. She cut communications with my dad because their relationship was incredibly volatile. My younger brother did the same thing because he was too young to remember how they were when I was very young and lost all respect for him. I kept in touch because I always believed there was hope for him.


I was still basically running a household at this time. I had a younger brother, a Grandmother, and a 'PTSD' mom to take care of. Mom made me her therapist, her best friend, on top of already being everyone's caregiver. She put my Grandmother in a nursing home, and shortly after had a career ending accident at work. Worker's Comp made her go to work with a broken back that never healed correctly, and not long after she received SSD.


I graduated, and got accepted to a very good school 25 minutes away because God forbid I try to move away after my 'failure of a sister dropped out'. In retrospect I could have left, but was browbeaten into staying nearby.


My alcoholic NUncle moved in at a time that I was working full time, going to school full time, and had an internship. I was stressed beyond all recognition. He was incredibly emotionally abusive towards me. He got his bachelors degree and was threatened by someone in the family being as smart as he is. At the time I was sexually assaulted on the job, and my Grandmother died on my 21st birthday. I downward spiraled into cutting. My family's history with drinking terrified me, but I needed to numb some way. I came out around this time too because I couldn't deal with the stress of hiding that I was gay anymore.


This was when the spiral went out of control. I lost the job. I lost the internship. I lost all drive and will to live. I got heavy into pot and synthetic pot. My gay and lesbian friends introduced me to MDMA. I loved every minute of it.


I maintained my grades and got accepted into a prestigious study abroad program that reinvigorated me. In 4 months I lost 50 lbs and found a new sense of freedom and lack of obligations that I had never experience before and I thrived.


Then, I came back to NUncle. The abuse got worse because he had been accepted into a program to go to Israel, but his now ex-wife had forbade it. My mom only intervened when it was finally negatively affecting her. I lashed out. I loaded his coffee with laxatives. I went back to my partying lifestyle. It came to a head when we had a blow up, I left the house and threatened to come back with my NDad to kick his ass. NMom called me, told me not to bother, that she had gave him $100 dollars, put him up in a hotel, and told him not to come back. It literally took all of that to get her to finally say enough was enough.


I hated her for it. To this day I haven't forgiven her. Of course she doesn't know or realize any of this because everything is copacetic as long as nobody seems 'mad at her'. 


I call her an E and an N because she's always chose the other person or her own comfort over mine. Whether it was caring for her mom, living with NAunt, NUncle, or not telling anyone about what was going on because social services would take me and my brother way, it was always about her.


Anytime something was amiss or wrong it was because there was something wrong with me. I was given ritalin as a child because I was 'unruly'. I was always the problem. Not a damn ounce of responsibility was ever taken by any adult and to this day still isn't.


Thanks to my good friends, the partying subsided, the drugs eventually stopped, and I was in an alright place for awhile. I graduated, went on to grad school, got accepted into another prestigious study abroad program, and graduated with very good grades. 


I got a decent job, but not long afterwards my health took a turn for the worse, and family life collapsed yet again. My Nsister and BIL were financially supporting the house. The minute I got a job they bailed and left me with a mother and brother that couldn't support themselves. I worked there until I couldn't breathe going up and down stairs. Then, I said enough is enough. I quit and committed to taking care of myself. I figured at this point my parents owed me.


It didn't last. I was relegated to the task of taking care of my other Grandmother so that my dad could work out of state. This was supposed to be a shared responsibility of mine and my cousins. Meanwhile, my dad in exchange would make sure my bills were paid.


It hasn't been a good situation. NSis went NC with NMom. NMom tried dragging me in the middle and still does. Grandma turns out to be quite the N herself. She gives me a really good hard look into the life of NDad and why he is the way he is.


My 180 pound weight loss has stalled over the last 4 months. My doctor and nutritionist had told me how wonderful and confident I'd feel once I lost weight. All lies. I have body dysmorphia. I easily have another 140 pounds to lose, but everything I have lost seems meaningless. I just feel disgusting. The worst part of it all is that over the years everyone made excuses for me. I was literally 460 pounds and my family was telling me that it wasn't that bad, that it was all in my head. I can't trust anyone now. You can't weigh that much and have people telling you that it's your thyroid, or conditions, or that you're really not all that overweight. My trust was betrayed by people that were more concerned over me being angry with them, than actually caring about my health and well being. I could have died. I'm still large enough that I could die. So I did a 180. I covertly joined a certain hate subreddit because in my fucked up head I wanted a taste of what real people thought of me. It wasn't until I found y'all that I got a shred of self-worth back.


So here I am at a loss. I feel trapped in this life of serving my family. I feel trapped in my body where nothing is ever good enough because I can't trust anyone including myself. I don't have a job because I quit it to take care of myself and become a caregiver once again. But what's worse is that I'm cutting again. I dropped acid on New Years Eve. I'm creeping back into a person that I don't want to become.


It's a horrible dichotomy too. On one hand, I want out of this spiral and don't know where to begin. I don't feel like I have the tools to pick up the pieces. On the other hand, I feel like I've been presented with what seems like a Peter Pan Syndrome. I adulted, and I adulted hard all though my teens and my 20s. I'm almost 30. I feel like I've been robbed of my best years. Meanwhile my friends are getting married, buying houses, and having kids.


I keep a lot of this stuff from my friends, lest they find out the dysfunctional freak I really am, and hence don't feel like I have anywhere to turn.


And then, I really fucked up. I turned to my Dad for some sort of fatherly advice. I figured I spent my whole life being my family's support system that for once I could burden them with my problems.


I came clean about the weight issues, about the job struggles, the difficulties of taking care of his mom. Just my general unhappiness and depression. Spending 20 years in the closet taught my one thing. It taught me how to be someone I'm not. Most people don't know how miserable I am because like most prey I do a good job of hiding anything that is wrong with me.


Now my father has never been a religious person. In fact he so much as mocked anyone for being that way. He knows that I am an avowed atheist. I keep my opinions to myself for the most part, but it's no secret to anyone who knows me.


This is what he came back at me with.


&gt; You will be rewarded in God's time not mine, but I'll do what I can to help. Think about it how many of your friends would do what you are? You're helping me and your grandma.


God's time. God's time for good old atheist Olffrick.


How do I break it? How do I get away? How do I simultaneously fight the desire to be a manchild to compensate for a wrecked childhood versus breaking free from a toxic environment? I feel like someone in a ten foot hole, the only way to get out is a teaspoon, and someone at the top is throwing the dirt I dig right back on top of me."

(Or, a rant about a job.)",batgirl2,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/406ieo/i_dont_want_to_fuck_this_up_or_a_rant_about_a_job/,"I will not drink today, and tomorrow husband and I will have 30 days sober. Never thought it was possible, and it fills me with joy and pride and resolve. As proud as I am, though, of getting through the last 29 days alcohol-free, I have to admit that ALL I have done for the last 29 days is get through them. Alcohol free. I keep telling myself that's enough (it certainly is hard enough) because baby steps, but the rest of the world is obstinately refusing to pause for me while I get sober.

I'm a graduate student with one semester left before my MFA. I've been on winter break, so I've had time to do 2 hours of yoga every morning, sleep for 40 hours in a row (did that last week), stare at my thesis and poke it every once in a while to see if it will write itself, and obsessively NOT drink alcohol. My semester starts up on Monday, with the insane schedule and the deadlines and the stress and the socializing and ACADEMIA and OTHER PEOPLE and I am terrified about taking my fragile sobriety out into the real world.

More than that, though, I have my first big ""thing"" coming up - you know, a big, emotional life event that in the past would be accompanied by copious amounts of alcohol. It's not a party or a dinner (I'm getting better at those) but a job interview. THE job interview.

I work part time at my dream job (and full time at a restaurant to pay the bills). A full time position has opened up in my department and they are hiring immediately. I've made it to the last round of interviews (top three candidates) and my final interview is Tuesday. Excuse the essay that follows, I just need to rant.

I need this job, financially (it has BENEFITS) and I need it professionally. I've been groomed for this position since I came to this company as an intern 4 years ago. I love the company; I fervently believe in our mission and I want to dedicate my career to spreading it. I've applied for other positions in the company before, and made it this far in the interview process - but they were always in different departments and never exactly right for me. But THIS is THE job - though ideally I wish I had graduated before it became available, but that's not up to me. I can do this job, I would be GREAT at this job.

I know the other top candidate. She is a classmate and dear friend of mine. This is not her dream job, but she would be great at it. We have exchanged the ""I would love to have this job but would be equally thrilled if you got it"" sentiments, which on my side is a LIE. I would be devastated. My friend/competition is organized, qualified, and dedicated - but she doesn't LOVE this like I love it. The job is an administrative education position (kind of) and she'd probably whip my ass at the administrative stuff, but she hates to teach. I breathe to teach. The things she does better are things I can learn. The things I do better are part of my essence; they are personalty traits, not skills.

The search committee is two people - figurehead/founder of the company and the department head. I love them both dearly; I have their respect and admiration. So does my friend/competition. Department head is more in my corner, figurehead/founder more in hers. F/F is a father figure to me, and the department head has told me his biggest reservation about me in the position is that I am not ""grown up enough"" yet - he doesn't see me as an adult. I don't blame him. But after 4 years, two Master's degrees, and a whole lot of debt, I can't afford to be a glorified intern forever, no matter how much I love this company. I have to accept that if I don't get THIS job, I need to move on from the company. I don't want to do that, but I will if I have to.

30 days sober does not mean I'll get the job. I can't put it on my resume.

I will be DEVASTATED if I don't get it. I know that already. I just need to NOT DRINK, no matter what. If I don't get the job, I'll need my sobriety all the more. I hear the hunt is tough out there in the real world.

407ejk,6,2016-01-09,When I Was The Catfish,catfisherhrowaway,catfish,https://www.reddit.com/r/catfish/comments/407ejk/when_i_was_the_catfish/,"This is a throwaway account I made to tell this story. I'm actually a girl, and I was a catfish. I pretended to be a guy named Cody. This has happened for 2 years, and recently ended in September 2015. I'll start from the beginning. This is probably going to be a long story, but it's haunted me for a long time. I want the guilt and burden to be lifted off. I apologise if it's confusing. Feel free to ask for any clarifications.



It all started on the last day of my sophomore year of high school. I was glad that it was over because I'd been diagnosed with depression that year, and I could relax for the summer. Before heading off to school, I made a Tumblr page under the username, preppyguycentral. It was really popular, but it got deactivated and the username was up for grabs. I decided that it'd be a great opportunity to rise to Tumblr fame. Stupid, I know, but I was only 16. When I got home from school, summer vacation began. Of course during that summer, I spent most of my days inside. However, I wasn't the stereotypical fat catfish: I did cross country and track, and I run almost everyday. I was skinny, but I wasn't good looking by any means.



The Tumblr blog, preppyguycentral, was just reblogs of male models. I never posted anything personal. It contained a shitload of self promotion for everything it reposted, and I racked up to 2,000 followers by the end of 2013. When the blog was getting a lot of attention, I started getting a lot of asks from people. If you don't know what ""asks"" are, it's just a word tumblr uses for ""messages."" These people asked me if I was a gay guy and asked me to post pictures of myself. I used pictures of a guy from another cross country team. He was really handsome, and I've had interactions with him. Let's call him Cody. Cody was a year older than I was. I wasn't friends with Cody on Facebook or anything, so I was limited to what he posted on Twitter and Instagram, as well as public photos on Facebook. I also found pictures of him on his teammates' social medias. 



The story so far is: I made a Tumblr account that only posts male models, and I pretended to be a really handsome high school runner. One day, a guy named Carl messaged me. If you want to know his Tumblr, feel free to ask. His blog is really popular amongst the gay community on Tumblr. Carl and I messaged via Tumblr's fanmail system almost everyday, then we talked on Kik. He hated Kik, so we exchanged numbers. We both had iPhones, so the duration of our relationship were iMessage texts. I remember the night when he asked me for nudes. I told him that I was at work, and when I came home, I'll send him nudes. Keep in mind I was pretending to be Cody the whole time. I wasn't actually at work - I was a piece of shit, staying inside my room. It allowed me time to look through some Tumblrs for nudes. I saved a couple of photos, to keep in the future when he'd ask. He sent him some nudes, then he sent me his. I complimented his nudes, then we started to talk about marriage and children. That was the night our relationship strengthened.



He knew I was in high school, and I knew he was in college. He'd text me about the bullshit that happened during his lectures, and I'd text him about how much I hated my forensics class. The forensics class was hell - it had kids who only took it because it was an easy A. Most of the kids have tormented me back in middle school, and yeah, I hated them. Talking to him during the class made it more bearable. I also had a lot of mental health problems around the time I talked to him. I'd get sent to the hospital a lot by the school psychologist because she thought I was in danger of suicide when all I really needed was someone to talk to. So, I occasionally talk to Carl about my problems. There was a point in our relationship when we stopped talking for months. It was I who didn't respond to the texts and disappeared for a while. When I get lonely, I talked to him again. I was never popular, so I spent most of my time alone. Sometimes, it's too much and I needed someone to talk to. I hated how I used Carl. Whenever we got back from not talking for a while, we'd send a million photos to help each other catch up. He'd send me pictures of his White House Internship, and I'd send him stuff I gathered from what I can of Cody. 



During the summer of 2014, Carl started asking me if he could post my nudes to his Tumblr. For clarification, it's  the fake nudes I got off Tumblr. I told him he could, then sent him more nudes to post. One photo was a tall, toned man with his back faced to the camera, holding a spear. The background was a bookshelf filled with millions of books. This photo is going to be important for later. Eventually, he asked me if we could Facetime. I made up some bullshit about how my hearing sucks and it's passed on from my grandfather to my dad to me. He asked me if we could just wave at each other instead. I don't know how the conversation ended, but he agreed that we wouldn't Facetime. For some reason, Carl found it perfectly acceptable that I didn't use Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. Of course, the real reason for all this is that I'm a catfish. I'm a girl, and not a guy, and this would never work. I'm surprised he never called me, despite having my number and texting me through it all the time. However, something I did agree to was when he asked me to email him some of my orgasm sounds. I basically search ""male moaning"" on Youtube. I downloaded the videos, converted them into mp3 files, then emailed them to him. Each time Carl asked for a moan audio, I sent him one. These were really easy and consistent because these audio files were 20 minutes or longer, and I'd only cut them short of 5-6 minutes, then send him more. That saved my ass from being exposed for a while. I did, however, stumble upon real Cody's Vine, and sent him the URL. He loved it, complimented on Cody's hot voice, etc. He also asked to meet up several times. He asked me to come to his university and he promised to show me around. He even sent me a story of how a guy met his boyfriend over Tumblr then lied to his mom about going on a school trip, but he actually went to meet his Tumblr boyfriend.



Between summer 2014 and summer 2015, Carl and I talked on and off for the duration of my senior year of high school. I graduated high school and got accepted into college. Summer 2015, when I graduated, I was lonely once again. I didn't go to prom or even graduation. I got my diploma in the mail. I didn't associate with anyone from high school. So, I started texting Carl again. I apologised for leaving him, that I was a bad boyfriend, etc. He told me that he will always be there for me. I really hated how I always took advantage of him. We start talking like old friends again. We did the usual post pictures and update each other. It was quite easy to do it this time because real Cody's been using his Instagram more and posted pictures of him and his friends at the beach. I told Carl I went to Cape Cod with friends, then he asked me where were those friends. I told him about how I seldom text people and liked talking in person more. We didn't exchange nudes this time around, and he already has a handful anyways. 



Fast forward to move in day for college. It's September now. I'm talking to Carl and how it's boring on the campus because I have no friends. I tell him I got mistaken as an RA and that I was just wearing a running t-shirt and shorts, and he said it's cute and consider it a compliment. He told me about another guy he used to talk to named Grant. He talked to Grant when I was away and didn't want to talk. Well, Grant turned out to be a transgender man. When the transgender man used to be a woman, he dated Grant, and that's how he has so many photos and Grant and made it very convincing. Grant used to send the transgender man nudes and stuff, then when the transgender man played the catfish game, he would pretend to be Grant and send Carl Grant's nudes. 



Well, it wasn't long before Carl found out I was a catfish after he told me the story about Grant. For 2-3 days, Carl and I didn't talk. I sent him a photo I found of Cody and his cross country team back in high school. Ten minutes later, Carl replied with a Tumblr link. I clicked on it, and it was the photo of a tall, toned man with his back faced to the camera, holding a spear. The background was a bookshelf filled with millions of books. That was the photo I mentioned earlier in the story. I pretended that man was me, but Carl found the real guy on Tumblr. That's how I got caught. I never talked to him afterwards. That was the end of the relationship.



I really regret this. Carl has been catfished twice now, maybe more. I hated how I exploited him and his kindness. While he didn't send anything to me, he was there when I felt like shit and what not. I remember when he told me his grandfather died and I helped him fight the sadness. I hated myself for not being honest with him. It's like he found the perfect person, but it turns out he was lied to. What this shows is how much of a shitty person I am. I also felt like the real Cody knew someone was using his photos. Recently, he deleted a lot of his photos on Instagram and changed his username on Twitter. I think one of Cody's friends found the preppyguycentral Tumblr and informed him. His Facebook is very private. I really apologise to both Cody and Carl. I've hurt them both. No amount of kind words will heal the wounds I've created. By this point, the preppyguycentral tumblr has been deactivated. Also, thank you Redditors if you have made it this far. I'm glad to get this off my mind. It's haunted me, but I can finally put it to rest."

Most of the research has turned up devices and programs that aren't very functional for facility use; only way to check is with a smart phone app, no location when inside building, shoe insoles into shoes they might not be wearing, etc. 
I was wondering if anyone had any experience with anything other than project lifesaver that does roughly the same thing but maybe cheaper. I'm leaning towards it anyways, but my job and the california association of area agencies on aging wants all the options listed out. So far I've found 

* Mindme (only in uk?)
* Gps shoe
* Gps smart sole
* Safelink
* Pocket finder
* Revolutionary Tracker
* Comfort Zone Check-in
* Blue Water Security
* MiniMerlin

anything that you know of that is not on that list would be appreciated.
if you know firsthand the effectiveness of any of these programs in a facility setting, that would also be great, THANKS!"
408l66,4,2016-01-09,"What has happened to me? Liar, thief, prostitute. Completely dependent on alcohol. 22 years old.",confrontingdemons,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/408l66/what_has_happened_to_me_liar_thief_prostitute/,"For the last year or two, I have forced myself to not think about my past and my life, but it's now getting to a point where it is completely socially dehabilitating and I just don't know how I can get out of this hole. I don't know if this is the right place to post and I don't mind if no-one responds or cares, but I feel like I need to write this as a way of forcing myself to think about both my past and my present. 

I've always been socially awkward. I've had speech problems and a stutter since I was maybe five or six, for which I have had years of speech therapy. I tell myself that the social awkwardness stems from this and that this is the reason that I find it hard to make connections with people, but I think maybe I'm just using this as an excuse.

Up until I started college, I excelled in school and I was confident in my abilities. I was intellectually curious, I wanted to learn and I genuinely believed that I could do good things with my life. Without a huge amount of work, I got the maximum possible marks in this country's end of school examinations (i.e. was in top 20 students out of 20,000 who sat the exams), so I know that I had good potential at some point. I remember being one of the people that people just expected to go on to have an impressive career, etc, and I was 100% positive that this would be the case.  

I'm now 22 and don't know how I was ever considered an intelligent person or how anyone will ever find me interesting. My brain constantly feels foggy and I've lost interest in anything intellectual. 

I had one best friend in high school, however I never had a close circle of friends. I assumed that I would find this circle when I went to college, but this wasn't the case. I lived at home with my parents for the first two years of college and I felt that I was missing out on the social opportunities that my classmates had. I'm studying maths and in a small class of around 20. I made some good friends with the other girls in my class however and I was very happy in my second year of college. For my first two years of college, I was in the top 2/3 people in my class and was confident and even though my stutter was still present, my avoidance techniques were well developed enough that it wasn't stopping me from interacting socially.

At this point I thought that the only reason I didn't have a very close circle of friends was because I was still living at home and didn't have the same opportunities. I talked to my parents about the idea of studying abroad in the US, which they supported me with financially.

This is where my life began to fall apart. I assumed that when I went to the US for my third year of college, I would make plenty of friends and I would settle into life there. I moved into a house of girls with whom I didn't click or make good connections with. I was in the US for a week and beginning to feel more awkward and socially inept then ever before. My housemates invited me to go out with them. I wasn't used to the essentially unlimited amount of alcohol and the freedom of not needing to go back to my parents' house. I blacked out and to make a long story short, tripped and broke my nose. I woke up in a hospital bed, with one of my housemates who was very pissed off.  My first two weeks of my year abroad were spent with a cast on my nose and a swollen face, which made me feel like a freak and completely ashamed. I told my sisters at home, but not my parents. From here was when I began lying to them, telling them that I was incredibly happy and loved it in the US etc, basically telling them everything that I assumed would be true of my year abroad, although I was lonely and homesick at this point.

My 'friends' were the other Irish/UK students who were studying abroad, but I never developed a friendship with them to the point where we would hang out together during the day. I would only see them on nights out. I began drinking to an excess. I would wake up in different guys' beds, having no memory of what had happened. Up until going abroad, I had had sex with only one guy, who I was in a semi-relationship with for a few months. 

I had signed up to postgraduate maths classes as advised by my home university, but found them completely overwhelming and did not succeed in making friends with anyone in them. I stopped going to classes and doing homework. I was drinking to the point of blackout every weekend. 

Things hit a low one weekend where I drunkenly went back to a guy's house. This is where things get confusing and traumatic for me and I just don't know how to process it. Although I remember everything up to and after this point, I can't say with 100% certainty what happened in the bedroom. I remember being pressurised and trying to resist and possibly being held down. I was able to get him to stop by asking to go to the bathroom, my plan was to run away from there, however he was waiting outside the bathroom when I came out. Some amount of time passed then, but I don't know how much or what happened or if I resisted or maybe even encouraged, I don't know and I wish I did. I know that I again grabbed a blanket and asked to go to the bathroom. He again followed me out, but I ran out the front door. He ran after me but I turned a corner. I remember hiding behind a pillar while seeing him going down the other street on a skateboard. I ran back to the house I was staying in with the blanket wrapped around me. 

My housemate was there when I came in and she saw that I was in hysterics. I told her that I had been raped. This is where things are more complicated because I don't actually know that I was, I don't really remember what happened in that room and I hate myself for possibly making a false accusation. She wanted me to go to the police, but I didn't. However I feel like by telling her that I had been raped, in my head I had decided that I was a 'rape victim' and I don't actually know that this is true, just that I had an unpleasant experience that I had to run away from. 

At this point, I am getting hospital bills from the broken nose for around 13,000 USD. My international health insurance will not cover it. I am petrified about what is going to happen, but I am just ignoring all of the letters I'm getting about here.

At this point, I am in bed all day, every day and not going to classes at all. My family at home have no idea - I get dressed and put on makeup for weekly Skype and pretend that I'm living the idyllic life. I've gained around 35 pounds.

I go to college counseling for one or two sessions, but I feel like an imposter. I've told them I was raped, but don't really believe this, or at least don't know what has happened to me. 

They put me on anti-depressants, which I take for a few weeks. At this point I find out that I've gotten a paid tech internship in San Francisco which I had applied for a few months previously - finding this out gives me a bit of sense of worth again and I start getting out of bed and trying to go to classes. I now know that I am going to fail all of my classes, I don't talk to any of the professors about it, basically completely burying my head in the sand. 

I'm drinking excessively again and this is the only time that I feel like I can have normal social interactions. I don't have any close friends, just drinking buddies, in day-to-day life I feel completely alone and socially inept. 

The summer comes and I move to San Francisco. Living in an apartment with one friend from my home and some other people - happiest period of the year. Feel like I have friends and a somewhat normal social life. Working 12 hour days and then going out, exhausted, but generally happy. I'm starting to freak about about the fact I've failed all of my classes however, don't know how to tell my parents that I've wasted so much of their money (they were so generous in helping me go abroad and it was a huge amount of their savings. They have no idea that I been such an epic failure.)

Financially, getting very stressed out about the hospital bills and also the fact that I will need to pay for an additional year of college at home because I've failed the year abroad. I join a sugar daddy website and meet up with an wealthy 65 year old who pays me $850 dollars to have sex with him. I feel absolutely disgusting after this, but do it twice more, despite the fact that I'm basically prostituting myself. 

The end of summer comes and I need to tell my parents about what has happened. I make up a story about classes not meeting requirements, basically lie and tell them that reason I will have to repeat the year is due to technicalities and not because of me fucking up. 

I'm now in a new class with different people. Last year wasn't so bad because I still got to see my old friends from the other year, but I hate being in a new class. They're so lovely and I feel like maybe before I would have made friends, but my social skills have pretty much disappeared. My old class has graduated and I'm now pretty much alone. 

I really just hate myself and I can't believe the person I have become, I don't know why I do what I do. I can't believe I had an old man pay me for sex. I hate that I use alcohol as such a social crutch and that I drink to such excesses. I can only comfortably interact socially with people when I am drunk and as a result while I think people like drunk me, sober me is awkward and aloof. I feel so anxious in social situations and it's getting to the point where I will make up any excuse to avoid having to talk to people. The idea of having to interact with anyone stresses me out so much. I'm completely consumed by guilt about the fact that I wasted so much of my parents' hard earned money on studying abroad and I was so lonely for most of it. 

I desperately need to confront my social problems, but I feel like with every year that passes, I get more and more socially inept. 
I just can't make connections with people and I lie so that the few friends I have left don't realize how lonely I am. I do have one or two friends that I could have travelled to and spent New Year's with, but I didn't want to admit that I have no friends in my home-town so I booked a hotel room and stayed in it alone so that my family wouldn't realize how few friends I have.

I'm so lonely, but I can't see myself making any more friends because I am now so unused to social interaction that I can barely put sentences together when talking to acquaintances or strangers. Academically, I've gotten my life on track and I have gotten some job offers for next year, but I'm petrified of going into an office environment because I know I'll fuck it up with my inability to socially relate to people. 

Sorry, this is such a long ramble and so incoherent. I can't force myself to read through it and edit it. I'm not looking for pity, I just needed to put this out there as a way of trying to think about who I am as a person.

For a long time, I've wanted to find someone who loves pizza and books as much as I do, and I felt that moving to a new city means a good opportunity to find them.

A bit more about me:
I have an incredibly eclectic taste in all kinds of art.  I can appreciate stupid, profound, heavy, and cheery paintings, books, movies, music, and video games.  When it comes to music, I love indie rock most of all, but I have a little of everything.  I'm one of those people who can talk all day about the meanings and messages behind something.

I'm a PC gamer with a massive Steam library who's still recovering from the ending of Undertale.  To be honest, Steam dates are my favorite, because there's a lot less pressure and a lot more fun than a regular coffee meetup.

My dream is to be a novelist, but I have self-doubt issues.  I really need someone to kick me into gear when I feel like giving up.

If you live near Ithaca or just in upstate in general, I'd love to hear from you!  Even if it doesn't click, it'd be nice to have friends  in my new home!"

I know that I want to finish up a month here, which will be three more weeks. I have a few options for what to do next but I have no idea what I want to do the most. What do you do in these situations to be most comfortable with the one that you choose? 

(After typing everything below, I want to emphasize that I'm looking for a helpful method, not an answer. Stick generally to the title of the post in comments. But helping me find the pros and cons is appreciated!)

Maybe /r/travel can help me decide. The biggest factor is budget, mind you, which is why I include the probable timeframe for each option. I need to return home in spring for personal commitments, so the option of teaching English or bartending to replenish funds and do all the options is out. I'm five months deep in SEA, been to the island nations, Thailand, and now Myanmar. So, starting the first of February, should I:

Go to Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia for one month each to take my time and enjoy the culture like in Indonesia (where I spent two months and stayed in the homes of local people), and head home April-ish. Safest option for budget, but I might be getting a little tired of very similar southeast Asian villages, jungle, and ""hello friend/mister/boss, where you going? Taxi?""

L, V, C all kind of quickly (I took off with a goal of all ASEAN nations so I want to do these even if briefly), then Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, home late-april, early may. This one tests my shoestring limits, but is extremely attractive to me. Biggest downside is that i would want a couple months for India at least, not to mention time for trekking in Nepal, a week or two in Bangladesh, and a month in Sri Lanka. So the timeframe isn't ideal.

Go live in Indonesia while I work on my blog before juggling it with daily work in the States, because a girl just asked if I want to split rent with her while she does an internship in Bali, get home in april. The girl is a small factor, but mainly I just really loved Indonesian culture and people (yes even Bali, get the pitchforks). I'm trying to do a blog but I'm just so far behind and need to sit down and type for a while to catch up. It would be excellent to do this before getting back to the nine-to-five. Also, I feel myself getting a little road-weary after five months. I take far more naps now than I did a few months ago. It would be nice to settle down for a bit. Before I go back to home life. But I will maybe feel like I'm wasting my time abroad by not going anywhere new every few weeks. 

Go to Europe because my best friend is lonely while solo traveling but that means I'll come home much sooner than planned due to budget, home early March, but will share wonderful experiences with my best friend.

How on earth do I decide?!"

A little backstory: I work beauty retail for a pretty large grocery retail company in Texas and have been with them for the past 8 years. I graduated in 2014 with my degree in Communication and have been pursuing a corporate job within the same company since I graduated with no luck so far. I took a step back for a few months and re evaluated what I wanted to be ""when I grew up"" and realized I wanted to work in Beauty Procurement, which I also happen to have 4 years of beauty sales experience with the same company. So in July, I emailed one of the beauty buyers and asked if I could go see what they do and talk for a few hours and they were totally cool with it.  I met all of the buyers and their boss and all-in-all had a really cool experience meeting them and talking to them about what they do.


So in September I noticed that they posted an internship for Beauty Procurement and I applied. They called me shortly before Christmas for a phone interview and all of the questions were ""tell me about your role and what you do now"", ""what was your GPA when you graduated"", etc, etc. to which I answered and I got this sense of appeasement from the guy on the phone that he was just there to ""check the boxes"" so to speak. I finally mentioned my desires to go back to school and get my MBA which he perked up and said ""well normally we don't hire post grads for internships (which on the job posting it says they do and I also emailed the recruiters to make sure) but since you said that I'm going to send off your info and set you up for a second in-person interview."" 

So this past Tuesday I had my in-person interview with the buyers' boss for an hour. He sat me down and immediately recognized me and asked me how my store was then proceeded to ask me how I heard about the internship and what I knew about it....and those were like the only questions he asked me besides if I had any questions about it to which I asked what the challenges were. Other than that, we basically had a conversation about things he knew I would understand about relating to the business because of my experience and what was expected of the intern and future goals and projects he wanted to conquer this year and next year. Then towards the end of the interview, he asked me about whether or not I was able to travel, which yes I am, and with my resume in his hand, he said ""I don't have any questions for you, because I already know you. You'll have an answer on friday."" And in my brain I was like, ""uhhh...what? Is this a good thing?"" He escorted me out and I told him it was nice to see him again and thanked him in an email.

On my way out, I asked my recruiter how many other candidates there were and she said it was just me and one other person...so I just don't know how to feel about it. Yesterday was Friday, no call, and my job status still says ""under review."" I want to feel good, but at the same time, I've gotten a lot of no's so I don't want to get my hopes up. 

TL;DR Interviewer said he ""already knew me"" and didn't ask me any personal or behavioral questions and I'm hella confused. What do you think?"
40a1nq,40,2016-01-10,One of the best night in Destiny I've had in a long time,bobcat1059,DestinyTheGame,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/40a1nq/one_of_the_best_night_in_destiny_ive_had_in_a/,"I wasn't planning on posting anything, but I've been thinking about this over the past couple days and wanted to share. Sorry if this ends up long.

I'm a Year 1 Guardian, picked up the game almost exactly a year ago. I had a friend I played pretty regularly with, and enough online friends that I didn't really have trouble filling a fireteam. But in September, I moved out of state for a doctoral internship, and long days meant short, late-night sessions, if I had the chance. No big deal, since then I've kept up with TTK pretty well, other than the raid. I've even improved a lot in the Crucible and been enjoying it, after avoiding it for much of year 1. 

The other day, Lost to Light came up as the daily. I had been trying to solo it, since it's hard to find a fireteam on short notice at close to midnight. But for the sake of my controller, I decided to try LFG this time. Within a few minutes, a Warlock and Titan responded, joined up, and we're on our way. We kill the ogre, and start the run to the ketch. None of us had earned our Spindles, and these two didn't even have exotic swords, and I ended up as the pseudo-shot-caller. But immediately, I noticed we were killing it. First room in under a minute, down to the boss with just under 7 minutes to go. Blights and adds simply died. And last, finally, Driksis went down. Cheers were had as we went back to the tower. 

I asked them how long they had been playing; both were Year 2 Guardians. So I told them how Black Spindle was based on Black Hammer, and how ridiculous it was (or so I heard; I never had it drop). As I talked about Crota's End, they told me they hadn't completed any raids, and both were stuck on the Atheon step for NTTE. I was too, so I offered to lead them into the Vault of Glass. Although it was late, and I wasn't sure how far a veteran and two rookies would get despite being overleveled, we decided to give it a shot. 

Knowing these two were experience a pivotal Destiny experience for the first time brought me back to my first time in the VoG. Loading into the Waking Ruins on Venus gave me chills, and I ran through the mechanics to open the Vault. Shortly after, we were in, and on our way to the Templar's Well. 

Explaining the mechanics of the confluxes, oracles, and Templar reminded me how well this raid was designed. Despite being severely overleveled, the Vault is still not a cakewalk; everyone needs to know what they're doing, or things can go downhill quickly. But these guys, well, they were flat out GOOD. One run-through of the mechanics and they knew the drill. One wipe on the confluxes, zero on the oracles, one on the Templar. I've been in 6-man, experienced fireteams who have done worse. It was such a great feeling to see these guys get it so quickly. As I picked up the relic, my fellow Guardians understood their role right away. As he fell, I got to explain Ascendant Shards to them, and how back in the day, the VoG armor and weapons were the absolute shit (RIP Vision of Confluence). I even got my first Found Verdict...watch out, I'll be test-driving it in Crucible soon, just because! 

My mic died as we entered the Gorgon's Maze, but I was able to explain the maze and tell my fellow Guardians to stick close just before I plugged it in to charge. One wipe, then we cleared it. My mic charged enough for us to finish, and I was blown away by how quickly they understood their jobs with the Gatekeeper. One stayed back to hold down the sync plate, and the other, despite never having used it before, got the hang of the relic immediately and held down the conflux while I grabbed the other. We had two wipes, one of which was my fault...the Venus Gatekeeper exploded on me as I was passing to pick up the relic. My shame is true.

Then on to Atheon. We were able to grab one more, just to have enough to finish. I think we wiped twice. We've all had the experience of fireteam members who, no matter how many times they're told to FOCUS ON THE ORACLES do anything but. These guys got it right away. Man, it brought back the feels as I popped the relic shield on the center platform, standing together as my fellow Guardians gave Atheon eveything they had. A few repetitions, and he fell. No one got anything super-interesting, other than furthering the NTTE quest, but it reminded me of my first time, motivated by wanting, and receiving, the Vision of Confluence. 

As we returned to the Tower, I picked up the next step in the quest, and signed off, bidding farewell to my fireteam. After months of running solo, I had an amazing time, working with two Year 2 Guardians to earn our Spindles, then leading them through my favorite activity in the game so far. I love the Vault of Glass, and I was blown away by these two Guardian's ability to listen and pick up the mechanics quickly. 

Sorry this was so long, but I know they visit the sub, so , if you see this, Captain96KS and JoVian420, thank you. I'd fight side by side with you any day.

NTTE: Met two Y2 Guardians, earned our Spindles, helped them beat the VoG for the first time, made two friends.

I am partially worried about job prospects but I know that there are lots of different types of jobs in the wine industry from wine production to hospitality.

I am at a loss for how to go about handling this situation in an appropriate manner. Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated at this point. To make this easier, lets call my friend Kate and her fiance John. 


I met Kate during my sophomore year of high school through mutual acquaintances. We became very close so naturally I was devastated when she moved several states away after graduating. Despite the distance, we kept contact and remained as good of friends as ever. 


About two years ago, my family happened to take a vacation in very close proximity to her new home. So, we excitedly planned to meet. It felt amazing to see her again- we both dashed out of our cars and hugged and squealed like stereotypical best friends. We hung out all evening and caught up with one another in person. Also, I had the chance to finally meet her fiance of one year. I had heard only great things about this guy and he seemed very pleasant. 


Shortly after returning home, I received a text message from an unknown number- John. He thanked me for stopping by to see Kate, saying that it really lifted her spirits and he hadn't seen her so happy in a long time. Understanding the personal issues Kate had been struggling with lately, I told him I was glad to have helped. I assumed Kate had given him my number and didn't think much else about it. 


John would text me here and there about little insignificant things. He'd mention a movie him and Kate were about to see and ask my opinion, or suggest to me a fun new video game they'd bought. I would answer is questions or respond to suggestions, but never carry on a conversation beyond the original topic. John would attempt to keep me talking, but I always dropped off due in part to me not being very big on texting.


More than a year after seeing Kate, I received a very late night text from John saying ""I miss you"". Assuming he had sent this to me by mistake, I ignored it. 


Fast forward to a month or so ago- I took a weekend trip to visit Kate. We had been planning this get together for a while and I was super excited to spend some much needed girl time with her. I had been anticipating a chill weekend with my best friend, but nothing could have prepared me for the Twilight Zone shit I was about to walk into. 


Kate and John picked me up from the airport and I was made to feel uncomfortable almost immediately. John had extended his arms for a hug upon my arrival, which I thought nothing of and accepted. He held me a bit too tightly and a bit too long and then commented on how hot I looked. Not nice or even pretty- ""hot"". I sort of just laughed awkwardly and looked towards Kate, who seemed to not be paying attention at the moment. 


I pushed this aside, chalking it up to a social fluke on his part and enjoyed the rest of my day with them. The daylight hours went smoothly, save for John suggesting several times that we all get drunk that evening. Not being a drinker, I declined only to have him get a little pushy with it. I politely reaffirmed my opinion and he eventually dropped it. 


After returning to their home, the three of us hung out in the family room and watched a bit of television. We all began talking and somehow came to the topic of a pregnancy scare Kate had told me about a few months prior. John proceeded to tell me how stupid Kate was for way in which she worried over a possible pregnancy. He said that he had told her several times that it was hardly possible and to ""stop being such a stupid fucking spazz over it"". He went on to tell me that it was her own fault for forgetting her birth control and that it was bullshit for her to then expect him to use a condom. 


I was entirely thrown off at the way he had raised his voice and talked so rudely about my friend. I defended her, saying that it was an entirely legitimate thing to worry over and that if she prefers that he wear a condom in order to be safe that he should respect her wishes. He only laughed at me and Kate stayed totally silent during the entire interaction. 


John then asked if I wanted to sleep in bed with him and Kate rather than in the guest room, which I found totally strange. I declined the offer and went to bed. 


The following morning, Kate and I had made plans to go shopping. She mentioned John wouldn't be with us because he had to work, which I was very grateful for. Before leaving the house, however, John stopped me and said ""You're a heavy sleeper"" 


Confused, I gave gave a weird look and asked what he meant. He went on to say ""You're a heavy sleeper- you don't even wake up when people *touch* you"" now normally, I would have interpreted this as someone possibly trying to rouse me earlier by tapping my shoulder or something along those lines. But the way in which John was smirking at me and the inflection and emphasis he had put on the word 'touch' caused me to think otherwise. I asked John what the fuck he was talking about and he only laughed, saying it was nothing. 


Now, I happen to take some relatively strong sleeping pills- which Kate is aware of. These knock me out pretty hard, but I believe I would have woken up given the chance that someone entered the room or touched me inappropriately. So I highly doubt anything actually happened, but the possibility of him groping me in my sleep makes me sick. Actually, the fact that he would say that to me just to cause anxiety makes me sick. 


I went on to try and enjoy my outing with Kate- which unfortunately didn't offer much solace. While stopped at a red light, Kate and I sat quietly as a group of pedestrians crossed the street. Kate made a comment on how beautiful one particular girl in the crowd happened to be. I agreed that she was a very pretty woman, only for Kate to suddenly spout out- ""I'm not attracted to men"" 


She had said this as if the words had been dying to leave her lips for years. I was pretty dumbfounded and caught off guard by the sudden confession, as I had never entertained the idea of Kate being a lesbian. She had mentioned once a short fling she shared with a girl in middle school, but claimed it to have been nothing more than a cry for attention. We joked about this here and there but I never thought she could have been lying. 


I didn't answer due to lacking a decent response, so she followed up by blatantly telling me that she is a lesbian and that she doesn't love John. I asked Kate why on Earth she would marry him then and she only said ""because I think it's what I should do"". I tried to talk to her more about this but she then told me she would prefer the subject be dropped. 


At this point, I was counting down the hours to my flight home the next morning and after hearing John would be joining us for dinner I was even more eager to get away. After meeting up with him, the three of us began walking into the restaurant only for me to catch John's hand veering dangerously close to my butt. I shifted away and he moved very quickly in an attempted to grab it. Luckily I managed to jump to the side, leaving him with only his fingertips brushing my skirt. I told him to watch his fucking hands and he just laughed again and made some kind of comment on my appearance and the fact that he couldn't help it. 


Dinner couldn't have gone by slower. I sat there hardly saying a word and wondering if I should just try and get a hotel room for the evening. However, my stupid self decided that I could make it one more night and save the cash. 


I told Kate that I was very tired the moment we got back to her place, but she insisted that I watch our favorite movie together before I have to go home. Unable to say no, the two of us head up to her room (her roommate's bedroom is on the bottom floor next to the family room so the television would have woken them up). 


About an hour into the movie, John comes in and asks to watch with us. Kate tells him of course and hardly ten minutes passes before he's attempting to convince Kate and I to kiss. I say no repeatedly and just keep looking at the screen. Kate isn't saying a damn word about it and John actually starts pleading with us to just kiss really quick so I tell him to shut up and that he's ruining the movie. 


A couple more minutes of silence pass by until John outright asks if I'd like to sleep with him.

I looked at her, expecting some kind of response but it was obvious that she'd totally spaced out at this point. John informed me that Kate was fine with ""sharing him"".


He continued to badger me and insisted that I show him some appreciation for allowing me to stay in his home. I looked at Kate and asked her ""how the fuck are you okay with this?"" she looked as if she was unable to hear me- staring straight ahead with dull eyes.

I gathered my things quickly and got the hotel room. 


Kate never even acknowledged what happened. I think she may be suffering from either John's abuse or some kind of mental disorder- which makes me feel bad for being angry with her. But I am, I'm very angry that she sat by and did nothing while her fiance was so aggressive with me. Kate is aware that I was sexually assaulted in the recent past and therefore am sensitive to such pushy advances. 


I talk to Kate very sparsely and she doesn't seem to understand why. By coincidence, I happen to have accepted a role in an internship program close to the city she lives in. Within a month, I will be living in very close proximity to both her and John and I need to figure out what to do. 


I want to help my friend- I'm afraid that she is experiencing abuse, living a lie by pretending to be heterosexual, and may possibly be suffering from some kind of mental illness. 


I have never been in a situation like this and I'm at a complete loss. I don't want to see Kate after I move because that in turn means I'll see John. Any advice as to how I can help her and try to diffuse this situation would be massively helpful. 


**TL;DR: Best friend's fiance is inappropriate and aggressive towards me during weekend trip. Friend also claims to be a lesbian and is only marrying fiance out of obligation. I'll be living close to them soon**

Edit: wooaah my gosh I just woke up and I had no expectations of this post blowing up so much. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of the advice and support. Seriously, you guys have no idea how much it means to me. 

I've decided to talk to Kate. I'm nervous as Hell because I have no clue how she'll react, but I need to reach out to her. She has been there for me during trying times in my life, I want to be there for her. 


I know for a fact that John works tonight and Kate will accompany him sometimes and just sort of sit there and be idle all evening (I should have recognized this as weird earlier) but I don't know if she's going tonight. I asked if she'd like to skype this evening and she responded with ""why do you want to talk to me all of a sudden?"".  I told her I'd just like to catch up and apologized for being so busy as of late. Haven't received an answer just yet, but I'll try my best to update tonight if we get the chance to talk. 

Once again- thank you everyone. I'll try to respond to as many comments as possible. I'm not receiving any good advice from those close to me so this is insanely beneficial. 

Edit 2: Skyping with Kate tonight. She agreed a lot more excitedly than I had anticipated judging by her preceding texts. We chatted for just a little bit afterward and oddly- she brought up the fact that she had recently watched Rush and commented on how hot Chris Hemsworth is. I was a bit thrown off for obvious reasons, given that she had not only confessed to being lesbian but verbatim told me she's not attracted to men. Maybe I'm reading too far into it so I just agreed that yes, Chris Hemsworth is indeed gifted and told her I couldn't wait to talk tonight. I'm still very nervous. "
40a9i4,3,2016-01-10,My [21F] best friend's [23F] fiance [29M] was extremely inappropriate towards me during a visit,whatdo232,rape,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/40a9i4/my_21f_best_friends_23f_fiance_29m_was_extremely/,"Throwaway because one of the people involved knows my personal account.

I am at a loss for how to go about handling this situation in an appropriate manner. Any kind of advice would be greatly appreciated at this point. To make this easier, lets call my friend Kate and her fiance John.

I met Kate during my sophomore year of high school through mutual acquaintances. We became very close so naturally I was devastated when she moved several states away after graduating. Despite the distance, we kept contact and remained as good of friends as ever.

About two years ago, my family happened to take a vacation in very close proximity to her new home. So, we excitedly planned to meet. It felt amazing to see her again- we both dashed out of our cars and hugged and squealed like stereotypical best friends. We hung out all evening and caught up with one another in person. Also, I had the chance to finally meet her fiance of one year. I had heard only great things about this guy and he seemed very pleasant.

Shortly after returning home, I received a text message from an unknown number- John. He thanked me for stopping by to see Kate, saying that it really lifted her spirits and he hadn't seen her so happy in a long time. Understanding the personal issues Kate had been struggling with lately, I told him I was glad to have helped. I assumed Kate had given him my number and didn't think much else about it.

John would text me here and there about little insignificant things. He'd mention a movie him and Kate were about to see and ask my opinion, or suggest to me a fun new video game they'd bought. I would answer is questions or respond to suggestions, but never carry on a conversation beyond the original topic. John would attempt to keep me talking, but I always dropped off due in part to me not being very big on texting.

More than a year after seeing Kate, I received a very late night text from John saying ""I miss you"". Assuming he had sent this to me by mistake, I ignored it.

Fast forward to a month or so ago- I took a weekend trip to visit Kate. We had been planning this get together for a while and I was super excited to spend some much needed girl time with her. I had been anticipating a chill weekend with my best friend, but nothing could have prepared me for the Twilight Zone shit I was about to walk into.

Kate and John picked me up from the airport and I was made to feel uncomfortable almost immediately. John had extended his arms for a hug upon my arrival, which I thought nothing of and accepted. He held me a bit too tightly and a bit too long and then commented on how hot I looked. Not nice or even pretty- ""hot"". I sort of just laughed awkwardly and looked towards Kate, who seemed to not be paying attention at the moment.

I pushed this aside, chalking it up to a social fluke on his part and enjoyed the rest of my day with them. The daylight hours went smoothly, save for John suggesting several times that we all get drunk that evening. Not being a drinker, I declined only to have him get a little pushy with it. I politely reaffirmed my opinion and he eventually dropped it.

After returning to their home, the three of us hung out in the family room and watched a bit of television. We all began talking and somehow came to the topic of a pregnancy scare Kate had told me about a few months prior. John proceeded to tell me how stupid Kate was for way in which she worried over a possible pregnancy. He said that he had told her several times that it was hardly possible and to ""stop being such a stupid fucking spazz over it"". He went on to tell me that it was her own fault for forgetting her birth control and that it was bullshit for her to then expect him to use a condom.

I was entirely thrown off at the way he had raised his voice and talked so rudely about my friend. I defended her, saying that it was an entirely legitimate thing to worry over and that if she prefers that he wear a condom in order to be safe that he should respect her wishes. He only laughed at me and Kate stayed totally silent during the entire interaction.

John then asked if I wanted to sleep in bed with him and Kate rather than in the guest room, which I found totally strange. I declined the offer and went to bed.

The following morning, Kate and I had made plans to go shopping. She mentioned John wouldn't be with us because he had to work, which I was very grateful for. Before leaving the house, however, John stopped me and said ""You're a heavy sleeper""

Confused, I gave gave a weird look and asked what he meant. He went on to say ""You're a heavy sleeper- you don't even wake up when people touch you"" now normally, I would have interpreted this as someone possibly to rouse me earlier by tapping my shoulder or something along those lines. But the way in which John was smirking at me and the inflection and emphasis he had put on the word 'touch' caused me to think otherwise. I asked John what the fuck he was talking about and he only laughed, saying it was nothing.

Now, I happen to take some relatively strong sleeping pills- which Kate is aware of. These knock me out pretty hard, but I believe I would have woken up given the chance that someone entered the room or touched me inappropriately. So I highly doubt anything actually happened, but the possibility of him groping me in my sleep makes me sick. Actually, the fact that he would say that to me just to cause anxiety makes me sick.

I went on to try and enjoy my outing with Kate- which unfortunately didn't offer much solace. While stopped at a red light, Kate and I sat quietly as a group of pedestrians crossed the street. Kate made a comment on how beautiful one particular girl in the crowd happened to be. I agreed that she was a very pretty woman, only for Kate to suddenly spout out- ""I'm not attracted to men""

She had said this as if the words had been dying to leave her lips for years. I was pretty dumbfounded and caught off guard by the sudden confession, as I had never entertained the idea of Kate being a lesbian. She had mentioned once a short fling she shared with a girl in middle school, but claimed it to have been nothing more than a cry for attention. We joked about this here and there but I never thought she could have been lying.

I didn't answer due to lacking a decent response, so she followed up by blatantly telling me that she is a lesbian and that she doesn't love John. I asked Kate why on Earth she would marry him then and she only said ""because I think it's what I should do"". I tried to talk to her more about this but she then told me she would prefer the subject be dropped.

At this point, I was counting down the hours to my flight home the next morning and after hearing John would be joining us for dinner I was even more eager to get away. After meeting up with him, the three of us began walking into the restaurant only for me to catch John's hand veering dangerously close to my butt. I shifted away and he moved very quickly in an attempted to grab it. Luckily I managed to jump to the side, leaving him with only his fingertips brushing my skirt. I told him to watch his fucking hands and he just laughed again and made some kind of comment on my appearance and the fact that he couldn't help it.

Dinner couldn't have gone by slower. I sat there hardly saying a word and wondering if I should just try and get a hotel room for the evening. However, my stupid self decided that I could make it one more night and save the cash.

I told Kate that I was very tired the moment we got back to her place, but she insisted that I watch our favorite movie together before I have to go home. Unable to say no, the two of us head up to her room (her roommate's bedroom is on the bottom floor next to the family room so the television would have woken them up).

About an hour into the movie, John comes in and asks to watch with us. Kate tells him of course and hardly ten minutes passes before he's attempting to convince Kate and I to kiss. I say no repeatedly and just keep looking at the screen. Kate isn't saying a damn word about it and John actually starts pleading with us to just kiss really quick so I tell him to shut up and that he's ruining the movie.

A couple more minutes of silence pass by until John outright asks if I'd like to sleep with him. The way that he went about asking was as if he had deluded himself into thinking he was fucking irresistible to me. I told him NO and pointed out the fact that Kate was sitting right next to me. I looked at her, expecting some kind of response but it was obvious that she'd totally spaced out at this point. John informed me that Kate was fine with ""sharing him"".

He continued to badger me and insisted that I show him some appreciation for allowing me to stay in his home. I looked at Kate and asked her ""how the fuck are you okay with this?"" she looked as if she was unable to hear me- staring straight ahead with dull eyes.

I got up to leave, only for John to attempt to block the door. Mind you, I'm a 5 foot tall 100 pound girl being physically blocked by a very large man. I tell John firmly to move only for him to once again say that I owe him. I took my chances and shouldered my way past him. Luckily, he didn't do much but attempt to grab me as I exited the room. I gathered my things quickly and got the hotel room.

Kate never even acknowledged what happened. I think she may be suffering from either John's abuse or some kind of mental disorder- which makes me feel bad for being angry with her. But I am, I'm very angry that she sat by and did nothing while her fiance was so aggressive with me.

40apw2,6,2016-01-10,Tomorrow I'm leaving and so is he,atlor,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/40apw2/tomorrow_im_leaving_and_so_is_he/,"It's been a long, sleepless night. The guy I fell for is moving to DC for a six month internship, and I'm back off to London tomorrow.

We just woke up after his goodbye party. He invited me to stay the night.

When I moved to London, we had a chat. ""I don't know what I'm doing,"" he said to explain his behaviour towards me. ""Ok, but this is how everyone sees it,"" I explained. I said things would have to change, he agreed.

But everyone agrees he likes me. It's so obvious. Things were fine when I moved. Then he messaged me saying he missed me. And now he wants me to rotate to Boston, even meet his family. ""Even though I'll be in DC,"" he quickly added.

This, and we haven't even kissed. I respect his boundaries and the fact that he's insecure and trying to deal with liking me.

But now I'm leaving and he's leaving. He's obviously afraid of losing me, despite never actually having had me. And I'm sad as fuck because it seems we're making progress - begrudgingly slowly, but still, and yet now I won't see him for six months at the very least - if I even do go to Boston.

There's a heavy silence between us, laden with all the things we've left unsaid. I guess I just don't want to get burned... But I've lost enough people in my life. I don't want to lose him. To lose this. To lose whatever we have that most certainly isn't just a friendship.

Life sucks sometimes. Right person, wrong time."

I interned with a firm in 2015 and ended up accepting an offer with them. I also extended my internship and worked part time while finishing my masters degree. I am currently taking a break from work and have the option to return next month to continue to work part time until my full time start date in the summer. They have already paid for Becker as well. 

During my time off I've had a lot of time to think about my time there and how much it changed from the time I accepted the full time offer. More than half of the my team quit including managers and senior directors. The coworkers I was close with always complained about the raises and bonuses they got and how things will not get better anytime soon. The firm merged in 2014 and they still haven't fully transitioned. I do not feel like it is a good fit anymore and cannot see myself being happy working there.

I am in talks with other firms and will be going to one of them next week for an office visit and interview. At this point I would like to accept an offer from another firm and plan on doing so if it seems like a good fit. 

My problem is, how do I quit? My only way of communicating with the firm I'm at now is through phone or email because I'm taking a break. Should I just call HR and tell them what's up? Or schedule a meeting with HR? I would prefer not to speak to my manager. 

EDIT: Obviously not quitting until another offer is accepted."
40cdk8,1,2016-01-10,[22/m] just got broken up with by [21/f] girlfriend of 3 years. Need advice to get her back or move on.,california2015,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/40cdk8/22m_just_got_broken_up_with_by_21f_girlfriend_of/,"I'm a 22/m and started dating my 21/f ex girlfriend during my first year at UC Davis. We have had a pretty good relationship with no huge issues like cheating, or abuse or anything of that nature. 

Throughout the relationship she would be the one who often texted me first during the day and definitely posted more pictures and etc to social media. The only thing I can remember us ever really arguing about is communication. She often felt we could improve it, but this was also often due to drunk texts etc by me. Nothing too serious, or mean in nature. 

Recently for winter break she went on a trip with her family and I went on a trip with mine, and I didn't make as much of an effort to text as I usually do and contact between us thinned out. I wasn't ignoring her but I got really busy during the break. She spent a lot of the break thinking about what to do with her life and seems to have gotten really stressed and pressured. 

We hadn't seen each other for two weeks and a week ago I texted her saying we should talk (and it wasn't just me being drunk. Sent the text out at like 2 am so I had to confirm). I just wanted to tell her to be more positive, something I felt like was taking a slight toll on our relationship.

She however blindsided me by saying that she needs space. She needs to figure out some things about herself, and where she is going. Internships,grad school, and basically her career. She told me that she still loved me and this wasn't about her trying to figure out if there are other people out there for her (I believe her I think). She isn't the type of girl who I can imagine moving on right away and I truly want to believe that this is all about her finding herself. 

We both have a year left at UC Davis after this one, but I have accepted an offer to do a CO-OP in Washington DC this spring, and won't be in California from march to June. After that we will both probably work internships again this summer and likely not see each other much. In the fall we start applying to grad schools, enter recruiting and etc. She says she's afraid, that it would hurt more if we stopped suddenly senior year rather than now. This is where we disagreed, but I didn't really argue much when we were talking about it since I was so blindsided.

It's only been a couple of days since we haven't talked or seen each other but it's driving me crazy. I can't stop looking at my phone and hoping to see a text or wondering what she's up to, or missing her in general. It has disrupted my sleep and focus and sucks overall. The worst part is she told me she still loves me the last time we met and said she always would. (Both in person and on text)

Now we are both going to be in Davis from now till march, and I feel like it wouldn't be hard to do long distance for the 3 months of my Co-Op. Lastly we don't even know our internship situations, so we might have a ton more time to see each other this summer than we think. Next year we will figure out about grad school and etc. I think that it would be easier to have to end things at that point because we wouldn't have to not text or be friends and could just respect each other's space because we would have to. (Being in different grad schools, cities, etc.)

I've been going crazy and thus reading tons of articles on how to get her back. I've been hearing that there is a No Contact Period and other techniques, but I don't have that much time. I go on the co-op in two months and I feel like the fact that we didn't have a nasty breakup or compatibility/relationship issues that I should try to get her back. If it's bothering me this much on a daily basis I think I should ask her to try to make things work?

Basically my question is what do you think reddit? And how should I get her back?

Thanks for reading and sorry it's so long"
40cjyb,14,2016-01-10,PhDs are a dime a dozen. [Advice Needed],allisonrs,labrats,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/40cjyb/phds_are_a_dime_a_dozen_advice_needed/,"I graduated with a BS in biochemistry last year and managed to land myself a pretty sweet RA position in the field I want to continue in. I told my company straight up in the interview I plan on going back for a PhD in a few years and that I really just wanted to work for a bit before doing so, and they're completely fine with that. It's definitely the best position and the best pay I could get in my area, and I love the science we do here. But six months in and I'm already feeling the need to go back. I've wanted to do research and get a PhD since I was 15. It's not about the paycheck. 12 hour days in the lab are worth it when you get to see *your* ideas play out and present *your* results (eventually). And I'm just not going to get that as an RA. 

My initial (and current, I suppose) hesitation for going back is that PhDs are pretty much a dime a dozen. It doesn't really guarantee anything anymore. In order to ""make it"", you've got to have a skill set or do something that sets you apart from the dozens of grad students who are all chugging along on their projects, learning the same general things, and putting their papers out. All of us are competing for the same positions; when you've got so many qualified applicants for so few positions, how do you pick? 

I currently work on anti-virals, and I know I want to stay in virology. I did an internship on HCV and completely fell in love with the field. I like that there are so many aspects to it, from molecular to epidemiological to pharmacological and everything in between. I love the slightly morbid fact that viruses can screw over anyone, and not just those who are pre-disposed to diseases based on genetics or environmental factors. I like the fact that we can use the same mechanisms that cause people to get sick, and instead manipulate them to cure cancer and other diseases. 

That said, I was thinking about going back to get an MPH and focus on infectious disease prior to starting a doctoral program, combining specialized scientific training with a practical component that would set me up for any number of positions. I'm also fluent in French so it would allow me to do field work in many areas and with international organizations. I know I don't want to do academia. I've seen too many people I know personally work themselves to the bone only to come up empty-handed because of the lack of positions or lack of grant money. Reading everyone's stories on here and other science subs doesn't exactly help either. If (when) I go back, I want to have a clear reason of why other than just ""I want to"". 

But. 

I also don't want to go into debt to do this. The **MPH** program I am interested in is about $50,000 over two years. I thought about doing a different one-year masters program at the same school if I didn't get the job I have now, but should I go back when the salary difference between a BS and MS is likely not enough to justify the loan payment? I know I said earlier that I'm not in research for the paycheck, but I still want to make a fiscally responsible decision. I had nearly a full ride in undergrad to where I was only paying about $500 a semester, so I didn't have to take out loans. I could potentially start the program part-time now and work simultaneously to save money, and only go full-time the last year so I take out less, if I'm not offered an assistantship. **I know that the PhD program will be paid and have a stipend.**

I guess what I'm asking is that is my line of thinking reasonable? What have your experiences been? Do you think this is a sound plan?

Thank you!

Edit: Thank you all for the wonderful advice. I have a lot of thinking to do over the next couple of months, but I know it'll be worth it :D I should also clarify that I meant to say that I am/was thinking about going for an MPH prior to starting a PhD (and thus deciding if the MPH was worth it financially), but the general consensus says not to. One less thing to worry about.  "

40d5fu,12,2016-01-10,My yearly review | 2016 commitment and goals,Path_of_change,KaizenBrotherhood,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaizenBrotherhood/comments/40d5fu/my_yearly_review_2016_commitment_and_goals/,"##Yearly Review

**2013** was mediocre, I was going through life with no direction, unhealthy and full of bad habits and limiting beliefs.

**2014** was quite good and full of life changing events, I started exercising, discovered Elliott Hulse, discovered noFap and started journaling.

What made **2015** special and great? Let's see...

- Completed my bachelor thesis and got my diploma
- Started /r/kaizenbrotherhood as a small accountability group, and grew it out into a community
- Started a master program in Software Engineering in a big European city
- Moved to a foreign country
- Attended my sister's wedding and had a blast
- Read around 100 books
- Taught myself Python, Java and Javascript
- Started writing regularly
- Learned a lot about myself and what I want out of life

It was a year full of big changes and because of that very stressful. Here are some of the things I didn't really enjoy:

- Lost 15 kg in 6 months and then regained them over just 4 months (I tend to eat a lot when stressed and facing big changes)
- Went through a really depressing period that lasted 3-4 weeks where I didn't do almost anything
- Didn't look actively for a job
- Didn't work much on my social skills and didn't meet as many new people

##What I learned

The biggest lessons of 2015 were:

1) **Make your decision and stick to it** - A big part of why I regained a lot of weight was that I kept switching from one diet or workout regime to another. In order to reap the benefits of a diet you have to give your body time to adapt and improve. I need to [work on my discipline](https://redd.it/3ggcjb) and stick to my commitments!

2) **Create more, consume less** - Ex-pression instead of De-pressions! During 2015 I made an effort to reduce the amount of information I consume and instead create something new every day. [I stopped using social media, youtube](https://redd.it/3rvtwi) and drastically [reduced the time spent on random websites](https://redd.it/3vc4q2) and blogs. Right now, I only follow a handful of carefully selected blogs and youtube channels. Instead of watching movies and TV, I spend my free time writing, and coming up with ideas. 

3) **It's in our nature to grow and improve** - Just like a tree, human's nature is to continuously change. The only thing that is holding us back are the self imposed limits by our mind and the physical limitation of our body. The key to manifest your fullest potential is to maintain a healthy a body and cultivate a clear mind free of ego and judgment. Follow your inner voice and you will grow into the best version of yourself! Awaken the [burning fire inside you](https://redd.it/3fv98r) that wants you to grow! [Become LIMITLESS](https://redd.it/3qwhit)!

4) [**Switch from a fixed mindset to the growth mindset**](https://redd.it/3xbygp) - People with a fixed mindset don't think that people can change. They strongly believe that your character and identity is set in stone. They allow their fears and anxieties to hold them back. On the other side, people with the growth mindset are aware of the potential to change completely. And they know that the only way to change is through failure. If you want to adapt the growth mindset, then you have to learn how to embrace failure and see it as part of the journey. People with the growth mindset are true warriors. They seek the challenge and [go towards their fear](https://redd.it/2zeeh8)s instead of running away. They grow every day and every moment.

##My goals for 2016

Last year I spent a lot time learning about myself (through journaling and meditation), researching and experimenting a lot (trying out different diets, workouts, productivity apps, methods, etc.). This helped me a lot to get some perspective on my life and deciding how to go about my future. If I had to label it under a motto, it would be ​*""Know thyself""*​, because over the year I moved from being completely lost and confused to a state where I know my values, aspirations and goals. I know where I want to be 3, 5 and even 10 years from today.

40e5j2,6,2016-01-10,*Extremely* demoralized and about to totally give up,z8289mx,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/40e5j2/extremely_demoralized_and_about_to_totally_give_up/,"I am a 24 year old guy who has been trying to find someone to be in a relationship with for at least the past 7 years. Punchline: I haven't been in even one. 7 years and not even one! 

Being upfront it feels like I am trapped or just doomed to failure. I have tried Scruff, POF, Growlr (oh yes), OKCupid and so many other websites and it's hitting the point where I am about to say I am done. Literally the only people that show interest (with all due respect) are men old enough to be my father (and no that is not okay to me), in fact the majority ARE OLDER THAN MY FATHER. I have been to gay events at my university (UofA) and I ended up seriously just sitting there alone at a table, and was basically shunned, which was heartbreaking because for a group expressing ""acceptance"" and whatever else it sure seemed like it was more of a ""When they are hot enough"" sort of conditional.

Then I went to a local gay bear event FabALBEARTA or something similar and I was basically shoved into a corner and prettymuch ignored. An inconvenience to be discarded. Later on I was sent an extremely heartbreaking message that I wasn't welcome there from one of the ""hot guys"" at the event. Despite me having literally just (overpriced) paid for and bought entrance and membership. I spent 3 days over their summer events trying to get involved and yet thrown into the dumpster and rejected. An ENTIRE PROVINCE'S worth of the subsection of the gay community flat out rejected me in person. 

I don't boil myself to be 100% about relationships or make being gay be my primary defining trait, like I am an extremely successful student who has a rapidly escalating engineering career right around the corner. Regardless though I brought in the new year 100% alone, Christmas 100% alone and when my university's gym was closed spent a solid week laying in bed crying, I barely even ate. I still cry a lot, but I literally bury myself into my engineering books and the gym and lectures-- those are the only things that stop me from crying. (Incase anyone needs to know I've gone to the gym 6 days a week for the past 3 years, almost 3.5 years?). In fact New Years Eve brought in a ""new year new me"" sort of thing, the me that isn't buying the lies and false hope I was fed 3 years ago, and I am lonely.

Like people say things get better, but do they really? All I have had over the past few years is nonstop failure, rejection, etc. My absolute crowning achievement of a relationship was my rapist who took me to his place, raped me, drugged me to keep me there to do it a second time. THAT IS MY DEFINING GAY RELATIONSHIP. And want to know the kicker? He is attractive, tall, etc, and so he managed to a month or so go be recognized by the gay community where I live as a hero and that he is picking up broken pieces of people that were hurt. He also spread the rumour that I am the ""whore who left medicine"" (An ENTIERLY DIFFERENT TOPIC. Tl;dr: I was accepted into medicine, left medicine because of deaths. Went into compsci.) I couldn't even report it because the police station, after I worked for weeks to get the strength to report it, laughed it off and congratulated me on having sex and told me it wasn't worth reporting. No, I am not even joking. 

I even went to a few plastic surgeons and one told me of a singer, Kendji Girac, and they said with (quite a bit of money mindyou) they can successfully make me look damn similar to him. And I can actually see it as my face, eyes, etc are extremely similar. But do I really need to do this to myself? Do I really need to pour an entire engineering internship's salary into plastic surgery just so I can get a boyfriend?
Closest picture, most others the singer seems painted in eyeliner: http://img.cache.vevo.com/Content/VevoImages/video/D2F4C4A360AA485B6919E73A7A911D0B2014186115557741.jpg

Of course people will say ""no, someone who loves you will love you for what is inside"", but that seems like a knee-jerk response after I have proven over 7 years that no one my age seems to want me even as a friend. So I honestly think when I land an internship that I will eat ramen and noodles and dump very damn dollar into a plastic surgeon just so I have the chance at having a guy that loves me. 

Like, I am not even sure what to say anymore. I never hated being gay, I never looked down on gay people nor did I ever feel the need to closet myself nor pretend I am some flamboyant characture from Glee to fit into what other people want to see as gay. But I don't feel welcome, I don't feel any sense of community. I feel that there are people standing in a group waiting for the next ""hot guy"" to come out and then everyone is so happy to throw out acceptance. And honestly? It's made me bitter. I see so many happy couples getting married and despite me fighting it relentlessly, I am seeing a bitter side of me coming out. 

But for me... I'm not sure what to say, this post may be my last attempt at communicating on the topic or even trying to get love. I am on the verge of just simply giving up. Actually after writing this and before hitting submit I'm pretty sure I'll be trolled and told to fuck myself, so I guess I did give up on love. "
40e7pv,36,2016-01-10,I am a chronic pain patient and my life has turned to shit since the car wreck that caused it. Is it possible for me to turn my life around with this severe of a condition?,bsthrowawaybs,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/40e7pv/i_am_a_chronic_pain_patient_and_my_life_has/,"Before my wreck I was doing great and improved my life dramatically with a lot of rp type principles. 

5 years ago I got in a terrible wreck that left me with chronic pain in my back and neck. I've had multiple surgeries to try and relieve the pain, but I am still left with agonizing pain that can leave me bed ridden when it gets too bad. I'm desperately trying to turn my life around despite my pain. Last year I started the year at 290 (gained 90 lbs from all my surgeries and being in bed constantly. Some surgeries needed me to be on a 6000-10,000 Cal a day diet.) By the fall I weighed around 210, but in that time I started to lose function in my right leg a little and spiraled back to 240.

I had to move back home due to having constant surgeries and procedures and took last semester off. I also just started a basic medical internship but didn't apply due to not being able to be on my feet that much. I feel like I've lost everything. However, I am finally starting my 4 year college this year after getting by basics at a Cc. I hope this will get me more active and will maybe improve my mood. I want to try and work in the lab but right now I'm not sure if my back can take it. 

I also used to be great at talking to girls and people in general, but now that I've spent so much time virtually alone on my bed/hospital that I feel like I've forgotten how to talk and connect with people. My meds and mmj (I fucking hate smoking but it helps with pain but causes me to be in my head too much) have fucked with my head, causing lots of anxiety and over thinking. The pills have also fucked with my Testosterone. My levels are around 180 when it should be around 700-900. 

I usually do great in summer and get a lot of progress in my life, but once it becomes winter my back goes to shit. It's just impossible to see me getting better. I've just lost all confidence. 

Now the worst thing I can do now a days is lay on my back all day. Moving and stretching a lot is key  to getting things feeling better. So I'm trying to get back in a workout routine which usually helps once it gets going for long periods of time, but sometimes it is literally impossible to move and get to the gym. There are those days (especially if I over do) that I just have to ice my back all day and lay in bed. There is no way around it. So it's one of those things where it's impossible to gain ground. It's always a 5 steps forward 4 steps back. So I just have no idea how to get out of this rut. 

I'm not sure if there's anyone who has any advice or words of wisdom but I could really use something. I just turned 24 and I have nothing to show for my life except a little bit of money from the settlement."

Although, a girl I dated for a year in high school did this with me via Facebook.  
There was a girl who came in to interview for an internship position at my workplace. She is about my age, and we were briefly introduced as my coworker was showing her around the office. I thought she was very cute, and seemed nice when speaking briefly with her. Plus, she ""got"" the internship, but unfortunately never accepted it (I was hoping I could get to know her organically at the office). I had actually seen her before at a bar, thinking she was cute, and realized that it was the same girl after she left our office. I didn't approach her due to something else happening that night where I was playing boyfriend with another girl because some dudes were being weird.  The bar is far from my house and close to her school so I doubt I'd run into her anywhere else.  
Anyhow, I was introduced and then my coworker sent me the link to her LinkedIn to review her experience. I find her attractive and we share at least a few similar interests due to her interviewing there. 
If someone in this circumstance were to ask you via social media to hang out sometime because they thought you seemed interesting would you consider it or just be creeped out?  
  
Tl;dr: Cute girl interviewed, didn't accept position for whatever reason, have a chance to add her on Facebook or LinkedIn to reach out to her about hanging out. Is it creepy or acceptable."

&gt;&gt;Wow. She goes as far as saying that her husband abused her. She put him in a really shitty light for no reason. Even if he is a shitty person, it doesn't justify your selfish behavior. Did she really think the court would agree to return the money if she told them he was an asshole?

&gt;&gt;I read way too many stories of women refusing to take responsibility and blame everyone but themselves. She's an idiot who tried to play the pussy pass and was stunned when it didn't work.

&gt;&gt;Fuck selfish, narcissistic people. [top reply]

So much.

Here's a thought: maybe he did abuse her. Maybe that's why she didn't want to share a fortune with him. Equal evidence on both sides? ""Did she really think the court would agree to return the money if she told them he was an asshole?"" - Wife beater === asshole. Lying woman === cunt. Priorities, guys. Priorities.

""I read way too many stories of women refusing to take responsibility and blame everyone but themselves."" - Truth by anecdote. No sources. /r/pussypass. ""Fuck selfish, narcissistic people."" She's also a narcissist now. Try to keep up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Story time! For a very short while, I worked at a free legal aid office for a school internship for a paralegal degree. I've seen some really shitty things at that place, but the worst of it all was the family law cases... Our lawyers would ""off-handedly"" mention to all our clients that the courts often look favorably on women's cases if it was mentioned that they suspected the father was sexually abusing the children. They were specifically told that it had to be ""suspected"" simply because they only had a ""feeling"" and therefore had no proof because the children would never ""fess up"" to the abuse (likely because it never happened)--and that it was partially why the woman decided to get the divorce... Of course, the execution of this was far more nuanced, but you can probably picture how that office had a statistically revolting number of women who ""suspected"" their husband was abusing the children. [top non-deleted reply]

Female divorceés are now false child rape accusers now. What next, terrorists? Cuckolders?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[in reply to the comment about women making false marital abuse claims] Although I agree with you for the most part, do note that men do this too. A friends' client did a similar thing to his now ex-wife and a quick Google search will yield more results.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it doesn't work with men though, based on our society. women's allegations hold more merit. [a score four times higher than the 'men do it too' comment]

He just said it worked for his male friend. ""It doesn't work for men"" - score four times higher. Feels &gt; reals with these guys. Divorce is their trigger word.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's exactly why I didnt mention men. If a man tries to accuse his wife of battery he would be laughed at. Women, on the other hand, can use this excuse as much as they want. [even higher score still]

Except - except that - this court case is where it *didn't* work. ""Pussy pass denied"", remember? You can't have it both ways. Either women get a 'pussy pass', or they don't. The judge said her abuse claims were not relevant. Feels &gt;&gt;&gt; reals. Triggered.

Let's look at the one from 8 months ago. I have low hopes.

&gt;I won $60 on a scratch off ticket (a lot for a college kid), went to the bar with my buddies, ended up meeting a girl there who was the waitress.  8 years later, we're married.

&gt;Believe me, in the end, that $60 ticket cost me a lot of money. [top comment; +5,000; gilded]

We all know which way this is headed. 

I will save the 2nd top comment for later.

&gt;That's hilarious. I can't believe her divorce lawyer didn't mention or didn't know such a statute existed. [3rd top]

""A woman did it"" - Reddit hates her. ""I would do the same"" - thousands of upvotes. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He found out about it a year and a half later when a letter was sent in her name to his address, asking if she was interested in a lump-sum buy-out of her lottery winnings. [+1,000]

Oh but there's an Edit:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EDIT: It's not illegal to open your spouse's mail, if you are still married to them. It would appear that they were still legally married since the guy got all of her money.

*Technically*... *actually*... Sounds like he broke the law by opening her mail. She breaks the law so he gets nothing - cunt. He breaks the law so she gets nothing - hero. 

Another edit:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EDIT 2: [From this article](http://www.sjfamilylaw.com/the-duty-of-disclosure-and-in-re-marriage-of-rossi-a-cautionary.html), it says that he filed a motion to **set aside the divorce judgment** and sought an award of 100% of Ms. Rossi's winnings. 

Wow, they're really trying to defend this guy. That's their emphasis in bold, not mine. They even linked to an article and everything. 

Wait there's more?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;~~So they were still married when he received the letter~~, and the information could have been on the outside of the envelope, like a lot of junk mail. Probably something like ""Denise, get a lump sum for your lottery winnings...""

LOL OMFG! ""Could have been on the outside of the envelope""? Were you there? He even gives an example ffs: ""like a lot of junk mail. Probably something like ""Denise, get a lump sum for your lottery winnings..."""" - just entirely made up horse shit. He broke the law guys, get over it. Oh, that puts a dampener on the hate boner. We were allowed to hate her because she broke the law. Him breaking the law too creates cognitive dissonance. Can't my porn just be simple and straightforward: anti-women?

I'm not joking; another edit:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;EDIT 3: [Found an other article that says it was more than 2 years after the divorce was finalized that he received the letter](http://articles.latimes.com/1999/nov/17/news/mn-34537)

&gt;If I were him, just to rub it in some more, I would have a t-shirt made for her that read ""I Just Won the Lottery and All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt"". Also included in the package would be a picture of me Scrooge McDuckin' into my insane pile of cash. [4th top]

On Reddit, you can't steal money, but you sure can steal comments for that sweet sweet internet points.

Remember that 2nd top comment I skipped over?

&gt;Reminds me of the joke:

""Awesome! What type of clothes should I pack?""
""I don't care! Just get out!"" [5th top]

Reddit is so anti-stealing.

Let's look at the newest re-post.

&gt;[the entire article] [top]

&gt;&gt;&amp;gt;That plan backfired slightly. In 1999, a judge ruled that Rossi had violated state disclosure laws and ordered her to give a portion of her winnings to her husband. How much? Albert Einstein. 

&gt;&gt;Why is this writing style getting more popular? It's like a paragraph written in clickbait form, and it's annoying to read. [20% higher score than the top comment]

Hate female divorceés? You should hate online journalists too. What is it with Reddit and hatred? They're just hatemongers. Oh really, you're complaining about journalism... on *Reddit*??? Yeah, because gifs of explosions in Just Cause 3, adorable cat photos, and advice memes are the last bastion of journalism. Come on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because we don't require people attend a school of journalism to be a journalist these days. You'll find a ton of new, actual, journalists somewhere else. Where? Starbucks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They can't expect to gain or maintain a job in today's fast-paced journalism when they insist on insane extravagances like fact-checking, half-decent grammar and journalistic integrity.

Fact-checking? But the story is true. Only the grammar thing was in question. And the grammar was correct, it was just the 'clickbait-y' style of writing. Irony: complaining about writing style by using the word 'clickbaity'.

&gt;The rest of the article about the other lottery winners is incredibly sad and depressing. [2nd top]

&gt;&gt;I think the problem is not winning the lottery but the type of people who win it. winners seem to have gambling or drinking backgrounds...which could only get worse with unlimited funds. if they had a better background and grounded family (they all have domestic issues), I doubt winning the lottery could be that bad. [+1,000]

Seem innocent enough? It isn't. You know how Reddit drags down little kids who win science fairs? ""I could have won that if my teacher's taught me strong study skills and discipline."" Well now they're dragging down lottery winners, calling them gambling addicts and alcoholics.

The third top comment was the Scrooge McDuck re-post. Yeah. Big ~~money~~ internet points.

&gt;All it takes to turn a lottery win into lifelong financial security is self control. Unfortunately, habitually buying lottery tickets may be a sign of low self control... [4th top; +900]

Lottery winners have low self control. They're superior to lottery winners now. Lottery winners are inferior to them. It really is the prime jerk on Reddit: ""I am superior"". 

Now let's skip down to the 6th top, the only voice of reason I can kind in all of these posts, the only one:

&gt;ok, what she did was more than shady. pretty damn awful if you ask me, and ya, he should have gotten some of those winnings, no argument there. but does everyone here honestly think she should have had to forfeit ALL of it? I know what she did was morally wrong, but it was her ticket.. [+300]

And there it is. Someone finally said it. Yes, what she did was wrong. Yes, she shouldn't have lied. But did he really deserve *all* of it? *ALL* of it? Reddit goes on and on in thread after thread saying bitch this and cunt that and non-contributor the other. But as soon as a man gets 100% in a divorce, she's still a bitch, she's still a cunt. John Cleese lost more than half - unfair. The other guy lost 70% - unfair. This woman lost 100% - cunt. She lied, she deserves nothing. He broke the law opening her envelope, he deserves everything.

And what is the top reply to the voice of reason in all this?

&gt;&gt;Covering up crimes is seen as worse than the crime [+400]

A higher score than the voice of reason. Covering up a crime is *worse* than the actual *crime itself*? More like being a woman is worse than being a man."

40f7om,1,2016-01-11,Unpaid internship with creative benefits?,Meowfist,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/40f7om/unpaid_internship_with_creative_benefits/,"I know that unpaid internships are extremely frowned upon, I'm really not a fan either. I'm extremely nervous asking this question but I feel like I'm on the precipice of a cliff tossing this question around.

But I recently have been offered a 3 month unpaid internship with a new creative work firm. They have clients working with them already and do everything from app production to photo shoots. 

The duties would include helping with the books and general accounting work, in addition to contributing to projects and the magazine they publish, which would include creating articles and putting taped interviews to word.


The thing is depending on how the firm does the unpaid internship becomes a paid position. The people I have spoken with I get along with excellently and I feel if I need to leave they would be okay with that. I was extremely frank in my interview.   

I'm a senior student right now, I have about 24 credit hours to go for my BA, and I'm working on getting a summer internship. Recruiting at my school starts late January.

Would this be a horrible opportunity to accept?"

I am quiet an anxious person and this anxiety has been increasing due to my changing image due to weight gain. I really want to start losing weight so that my anxiety can ease up. I have never been to gym before cos I had been eating well before college. To start losing weight, I have been looking at fitness trackers on internet.

40flba,1,2016-01-11,"My [19 F] old friend [19 F] is possibly engaging in prostitution, not sure how to help her",Arctic-Elx,secondary_survivors,https://www.reddit.com/r/secondary_survivors/comments/40flba/my_19_f_old_friend_19_f_is_possibly_engaging_in/,"So, I know some people believe prostitution can be a super positive, owning-your-sexuality type of deal, and not necessarily something to discourage. My concern is that my friend is doing this self-destructively and that she is unsafe.

I've been in contact with Friend on-and-off since high school (we go to uni now in different states), but I'm one of the closest and most consistent female friendships she's had, and whenever a major life development happens or she needs to vent, she checks in.

A bit over a year ago, she called me and told me that she'd recently recalled previously withheld memories of a period where her sibling sexually assaulted her regularly. I talked through things with her and was glad to hear she'd already sought out someone professional to work through this information with.

Next phonecall we had, she mentioned that although she couldn't pay for a therapist (and didn't want fees showing up on her parents' insurance, or something) her therapist was really nice and charging her a discounted price out of concern. Also she and her therapist had begun a sexual relationship.
I told her this guy was taking advantage of her and that no professional would ever behave that way, but she brushed it off and said she enjoyed it so it was okay.

Flash forward about a semester, she's working in a 'massage parlour.' She says she'd never sleep with someone for money, but this is okay because sometimes they're attractive and they're mostly nice but delusional. But then she mentions the number of guys who squeeze her so hard it hurts, and a few other sadistic clients, and that parlour security is only to be called in extreme cases because otherwise they'll lose business or be flagged for being a sex operation. She tries to highlight how much money she's making, and her plans for it, and that she's also keeping up with school.

Next call, I find out she has an internship. She says her boss expects her to dress and behave provocatively, and that it's ok because he's hot and the internship looks great on paper.
Most recently, she's brought up that she'd be willing to sleep with someone in exchange for money, as long as they weren't hideous and it was a lot of money. Then she mentioned she had done so, and plans to do so in the future.

My concern isn't really whether prostitution is a viable venture, but that she's acting out on some really poorly informed constructions of self-worth, and that she's doing so in a way where she wouldn't feel comfortable involving law enforcement if something went wrong. She's also mentioned around being around people doing hard drugs, and her experimenting with drugs also seems to be escalating, so I'm worried she'll end up with a very expensive hobby with only one lucrative option to pay for it.

I want to reach out to her and try to help her move away from what seems to be a kind of self-destructive path, but I'm not sure how. So far I've just made it clear to her that she can tell me anything and she can come to me or my family any time, no questions asked. I'm just hoping that if she needs me, she'll come, but I can't help but feel like she needs me now but there's nothing I can do.

**tl;dr:** Friend from HS has been sexually abused, began selling handjobs, now seems to be selling her body. Not sure how to talk her out of it, if possible. No one close with her to contact"
40fr8u,1,2016-01-11,My boyfriend is avoiding me.,sadtinydr,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/40fr8u/my_boyfriend_is_avoiding_me/,"Hi, I need your advice please.
So, 5 years ago while on summer classes on medschool I had a boyfriend and I met this guy(let’s call him Tim for the benefit of the story) who has a gf and we get along amazing, but the gf ends the relationship because of me (stupid because I don't care about this guy at all) anyway. We became really good friends and I could tell he likes me a lot, but still, I don't see him as my love you know? I finished my bf because tons of things (that’s another super long story) and date some other random guy who breaks my heart in tiny little pieces. so my friend Tim see me at school looking crappy and prepares me a surprise, he made a little game in which I won some great stikers of star wars, and tmnt and stuff like that he did himself. I’m impressed I want to feel something back to him but I can’t!! Long story short, he was in friendzone for 3 years. The las year of medschool I started missing him more than usual, I was confused but finally the last semester I asked him to be my boyfriend, and he said yes.
Sadly the next step of medschool is an internship. I went to another country (which is more relaxed) and he to another city in our country(wich they are like slaves). We decided to keep the relationship, after all, we strongly believe we love each other and we want to marry and have kids and a big house etc. etc... 
We had some fights but, everything was ok until December. He started not talking to me not on work hours which I would understand, but in out hours. He was different, and on my birthday he just sent me a voice note of less than 30 seconds saying happy birthday. It was especially bad day for me because it was the graduation of one of my bFFs and I was there instead of with my family and friends and on top of it, I was invisible for my Tim.
The same happened on Christmas, he was in the hospital but had several parties. I sent a picture of me looking good and he didn’t noticed until he saw it on instragram days later. Funny how one year before we were texting a lot as friends saying we cared about each other and now... invisible for my Tim. 
Same on New Year. 
After I came back from vacations I didn't want to fight anymore so I just talked like before, you know, the I love you and I miss you, all that sweet sweet crap. It was ok til this Friday, he suddenly dropped a bomb.
I am thinking in a pause in the relationship.
he knows I don't believe in pauses, to me is, I want to mess around. So this weekend was awful. 
Saturday morning he left his apartment because he was hungry.. came back until night and wouldn’t tell me and I was freaking out until I called him (wich we don't because of long distance bill) and he told me like , you are not like this why are you  freaking out? 
REALLY? WHY? You just drop the bomb and disappear and ask WHY? . He was avoiding all and went to sleep because he was tired. Today he did the same. But today I recorded myself asking him to be honest with me, I don't feel ok with him avoiding me, I want to go back to love each other. 
So I finally have a longer conversation, just on txt because ""his roomies didn't pay the internet so we can't skype"" and he tells me he is feeling something for this resident he has been going out with (like with the group of friends, I Know this is true because they post on facebook) I'm dying inside. 
We agreed to keep trying, but, I don't feel comfortable with this.
I know maybe he is like excited because it the first time he lives out of his town to a much bigger city, and she is not prettier than me, and this could be nothing, but still it hurts so much that because of her he ignored me on my birthday and Christmas and this weekend. I have only told two friends. One is telling me to hold on and the other to let him go. I'm lost, and sad and embarrassed that everyone told me LDRs don't work. Please help.
Im afraid to repeat the history of his previous girlfriend.

tl;dr : Boyfriend who was set free from friendzone now is kind of cheating on me

thanks a lot for reading. "
40fstr,3,2016-01-11,"I [18m] have been dating an anorexic, anxiety driven [19f] for [6 months] and need help.",rangerrump,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40fstr/i_18m_have_been_dating_an_anorexic_anxiety_driven/,"It's a long story and a little complicated. If there is a sub-reddit  better for this please let me know so I can address it there, I couldn't find any others.

Ok, so I'm a college student, no big deal. But here's a little bio to get who I am. My father was arrested 2-3 years ago while I was in highschool and I grew up quickly, I left highschool as an academic scholar and plan on being a nurse. My goals in life are to help those in need and be that guy you can rely on, someone to look up to. I became a leader of a group that took care of middle schoolers who have had hard times home and in school that need role models and continue to do that for others.

I've known my girlfriend for years, she's a very tiny, shy, sweet girl. We both actually liked each other without the other knowing. She has depression, is anorexic, used to do pills (solved that problem with her) and gets extremely anxious quick. It's all because of her past, how she was treated as a child, her environment, lack of attention and abuse. I knew about her problems before she told me. 

I've always been a little different, able to read people, what they're like, how they feel according to body language, stance, stare, gestures etc. It's been useful for most of my life talking to people, approaching them accordingly, being kind, talking kindly to them, asking what they need, want. 

 I let her tell me what she would feel comfortable with one night we were alone soul searching, after our long, deep and sad confession session I let her know that I knew about everything the entire time. She was afraid at first I would stop talking to her because of all she does and has been though, but was shocked to find out I knew about it all. And so I could finally tell her that none of it changed how I felt about her because I know who she is, and who she could be if her suffering and sadness could go away, I wanted to be someone to get her through the hardships.

So our long, hard relationship began.  There are no problems between us, we both like each other a lot. The problems come from her thoughts, the way she thinks and treats herself. She thinks she's a burden to society, and that having outer beauty is her only solution to finding happiness for herself, which in-tern makes others like her. She thinks everyone has these permanent inner thoughts of prejudice against her, she wants to be liked but thinks no one likes her because she's fat, ugly and annoying. 

Just today she was complimented twice in public about how pretty she is, but dosnt take it seriously. She really is georgous, everyone I know is jealous of how pretty she is. 

I convinced her to get a therapist, a very big step in helping her. They get along quite well and connect in a positive way. A lot of advice I give her is actually the same advice the therapist gives her, its funny, but nice to see that shes getting the same advice from two people that care for her. 

The thing is, she hasn't really had support from anyone. There are so many people oblivious to the fact that she is hurting that she thinks no one should care about her. I'm trying to do my part day by day, not pushing, or shoving change to her but letting her know it really is different than what she believes. Its just the environment she's in.

Ever since she was little she didn't have much attention given to her, she had to take care of her younger brother at a very, very young age. One day that control and responsibility was taken from her, and she had to replace it somehow. The only way to was controlling what she ate, and its been like that ever since. Now she's 19, stuck taking care of her mother's daycare and with her (sorry if it sounds offensive but its a technical term) crack baby brother who is out of control.

I'm happy to do what I do for her and there has been significant change the past few months from getting her off pills and helping her get confident enough for a therapist. It's just hard, I feel like I'm on the sidelines yelling out from the crowd that she can do it! I just want to know what else I can do, what I should be doing and if I'm going the right path on this.

To end this I want to say I plan on staying with her, I'm not suffering, I'm just sad to see someone I love so much going through this illusion and pain. Thanks for reading this through, any advice is appreciated.

TL:DR, my girlfriend is going through a lot and I'm doing my best to support her through her anorexia, depression and anxiety. I'm reaching out to find out what else I can do for her situation since I plan on staying by her side through it all. My goal is to get her out of these illusions of being useless and to help her start feeling better about herself."

Current personal situation: I am an int. student starting my second semester of junior year. Due to a whole variety of reasons none of which excuse me from blame (poor study habits, family passing, lack of motivation) my GPA in the first couple of years was awful. It even got to the point where I was put in academic probation. Last semester I was able to recover/get my shit together and take my cumulative GPA back to a ~2.25. I am positive I can keep up this trend, but I am worried that I will not be able to find an internship or entry level position due to my past mistakes. I plan to still apply to as many internships I can find available either way, but I was wondering if anyone in this sub had any experience with such cases either as a recruiter or personal experience.

1) Any websites that you would recommend in particular for internships in the field.

2) Will my application be tossed out as soon as the recruiter sees the GPA or will it be considered. (I get that higher GPA will get priority, but will it even be considered?)

Thanks in advance for any advice.

40g61w,1,2016-01-11,Alt Weekly - Boston Phoenix - One Year Gone,ShaunaDorothy,Journalism,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/40g61w/alt_weekly_boston_phoenix_one_year_gone/,"by Christopher M

Full disclosure: I worked for the PMCG (but not the Phoenix itself, it was a company called TPI) back in 99-01 taking personal ads, running refunds, supervising the call center, and doing various bits of backend programming for a salary that amounted to being kicked in the balls and flipped a shiny coin as my assailant sauntered on. Still, I had many great memories. But this is not the time.

One of the first things I did upon moving to Boston in January of 98 was to grab a copy of the Phoenix in the lobby of my college. It was free for us (even though you used to have to pay for it). I was amazed by what they were printing. This was nothing like journalism back in Amish country: Music reviews, social events, scathing articles. . SWEAR WORDS! ZOMG! I got hooked. I made sure to grab a copy every week when they showed up. In fact, this lead to the one act of petty larceny in my life. I didn't know that the phoenix wasn't just a free paper so I grabbed one on the way out the door of Tower Records. When I got back I saw the price at the top, felt so bad I went back and tried to pay. The cashier just looked at me like I was nuts and turned her back.

Ah, the memories.

It's odd to write this, since there was a rift after I ""left"". I never held a grudge, but picking you up seemed odd somehow, like seeing an old girlfriend who never gave you back all your stuff and still owed you $200 for that month you covered the rest of her rent, but now that you've passed I can say that I honestly have nothing but good memories.

Boston Phoenix, you kept me in the know about what was up for years. You gave me reasons to laugh at things that weren't funny, not laugh at things that should have been, and a list of shows I needed to sneak into or weasel my way onto a list for as long as I can remember. I hope that in the years to come people remember you as fondly as I.

The Boston Phoenix Set Me Free

""Consider yourself off the leash,"" he said. I was moaning about editors to my new editor, Lance Gould, in his office at the Boston Phoenix. Editors had been messing me around my whole life, I told him—neutering my style, rejecting my ideas, making me explain myself, fucking up my thing. Bloody editors... Gripe, grumble... I fumed and fidgeted in the crappy chair. And yet here he was, this kind man, this editor, regarding me with eyes of understanding and telling me that I was FREE. Was it a dream?

It feels rather dream-like today, now that the Phoenix is kaput. I received the news of the paper's closing, last week, the way I receive most bad news—which is to say, I barely received it at all. It bounced numbly off my heart. Doink! But now I'm thinking about it, and beginning to feel it.

I was a staff writer at the Phoenix for 18 months, 2007-2008. Free? I was practically feral. I wrote much too fast and much too frequently about whatever took my interest. Poems, weekly. A column about reality tv, also weekly. (My secret plan was to turn it into a column about bullriding. This never happened. But it could have.) In the name of the Phoenix I interviewed—how about this for a journalistic coup—a man who hadn't written a biography of GG Allin, the most horrible punk rock frontman ever; in the name of the Phoenix I accompanied a Wildlife Removal Specialist as he tore embedded raccoons from one suburban loft-space after another; in the name of Phoenix I went into a men's prison and watched a priest lead a group of convicts through the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola.

And I loved my colleagues. The muse of the Phoenix, as I came to know her, hovered in the space between the groovy young buggers who were coming up and the old-school eminences who wouldn't quit. At this higher level, scholarship abounded. Jeffrey Gantz, Penguin Classics translator of The Mabinogion and ardent—in fact incandescent—Chelsea fan, rushed between cubicles like the White Rabbit, a hand to his forehead. He knew everything. Jon Garelick would lend his exquisite jazzman's ear to your prose, tell you where you'd gone out of tune. The great Clif Garboden sat hunched in his special managing-editor's alcove at the back of the third floor, with torrents of copy churning beneath his ironic eye: from time to time he would bark an oath at his computer, or exhale in a shuddering, Job-like manner. (I'm quoting here from something I wrote for the paper after his death. Hope you don't mind, Clif.) It was a uniquely supportive environment, an accidental ecology in which—if you were the least bit accidental yourself—you could thrive.

These days, whenever an assignment begins to cramp me up, I pretend I'm doing it for the Phoenix: instant relief.

My fellow staff writers were delightful. I marveled at the gumshoe tenacity of political reporter David Bernstein, and the fact that—on a diet of pizza, cigarettes, and noisy phonecalls—he somehow preserved the complexion of an athletic schoolgirl. I annoyed Sharon Steel by throwing bits of paper at her. I slipped out for surreptitious pints with Adam Reilly. Mike Miliard helped me, endlessly.

So I was free, and the paper was free. It was flung out onto the street for whoever wanted it, whoever happened to be passing—not for some technocrat in Peets, pecking out a URL. It was a loose transaction, and it kept you loose. Even the leaking sordor from the ""Adult Services"" section, I confess, I found helpful. Trash and fecundity are neighbors, after all. These days, whenever an assignment begins to cramp me up, I pretend I'm doing it for the Phoenix: instant relief.

All a dream, all a dream... I can see Pat D pushing around his enormous dustbin as if, rather than putting things into it, he might produce things from out of it—ingots or rayguns or shrunken heads. I can hear the hacking and rumbling of Killing Joke's Jaz Coleman, on the line from Prague, fantastically intoxicated: ""I don't like human beings, I think they're parasites, they're fucking parasites."" Eheu fugaces labuntur anni. About the industry, journalism, the Internet, the row of grinning skulls where all the good writers used to be, I have nothing useful to say: I share in what I assume to be the general state of dazed apprehension. Not so long ago, many things were possible for a lucky writer. As of last week—this is how it feels—they are a little less possible.

A look back at some of its greatest stories.

Home for the Holidays
Chris Radant • November 1990

On heading home for Thanksgiving.
“Grazing began extra early on Thanksgiving morning. My brothers arrived with assorted girlfriends, wives and children. And there were fried eggs, pancakes, ‘crew-sonts,’ fudge cookies, and sticks of butter disguised as every manner of food. Mom made us go look at the long icicles coming off the corners of the shed. The kids bounced up and down. Dad recited in-flight emergency procedures. And on TV, the Johnny Mann Singers sang, ‘Y’gotta have heart,’ as only they can. Dad repeated his complaint about uncle Freddy repeating his stories. Mom told everyone about the oozing lesion of somebody we didn’t know. The question, ‘Is Disneyland more fun than Busch Gardens?’ was tossed out for debate. Dad went outside to look at the sky and missed Mom’s brief history of nasty gashes suffered in our family.”

The Strange Case of Audrey Santo
Ellen Barry • December 1997

A comatose from Worcester, Mass., is the catalyst for a string of miracles and becomes a tourist attraction.
""Her name is increasingly well known in the circle of people who follow miracles. ‘She's new. I think she just became popular in the last year or so,’ says Jim Drzymala, administrator of the ‘Apparitions of Jesus and Mary’ Web page. Those who can't jump the line by virtue of chronic disease take what ancillary contact they can get; once a year, on the anniversary of her near-drowning, Audrey is wheeled into a local church to receive the faithful. Last year, as Audrey lay in her tiara on a stretcher, this Mass attracted upward of 5000 people—a crowd so large, and so unexpected, that ‘the police could not respond appropriately,’ according to city councilor Wayne Griffin.
“Every time the story appears, it ratchets up the level of public enthusiasm. Audrey's Life and The Story of Little Audrey Santo have become so popular that one fan recently asked Audrey's dermatologist, who appears in the video, for an autograph. Channel 7, which has run several spots on the phenomenon, has reported as many as 250 phone calls after a broadcast. And when the Boston Herald ran a story about Audrey last month, the accompanying photograph showed a plaque with a contact number for the Santo family friend and representative Mary Cormier. The story ran on a Monday. Over the next two days, according to Cormier, 700 people called that number.”

Seattle Was a Riot
Jason Gay • December 1999
What really happened at the World Trade Organization protests.
“Meanwhile, the police are watching. There are more than 500 police officers on the scene, most them arranged around the outskirts of the Washington Trade and Convention Center, where the majority of WTO events are scheduled to take place. Almost all of these officers are decked head to toe in black riot gear—helmets and gas masks and baseball-catcher-style knee pads and arm pads and chest protectors—and carry crowd-dispersal weapons such as pepper spray, tear gas, and rubber-pellet guns. At one intersection, a group mans a small armored vehicle nicknamed the ‘Peacemaker.’

“It's easy to see that a situation's developing. The protesters are everywhere; the delegates are shut out of their meetings; many of them, including the US representative to the WTO, Charlene Barshefsky, can't even get out of their hotels. What's more, the big protest—the labor march, with more than 30,000 people—hasn't even started yet. It's not even nine o'clock in the morning, and authorities are losing control of the city.

“Soon after, the tear gas comes. It's a surreal moment. When gassing first occurs, I'm standing about 100 yards from the intersection, and people near me pause and stare momentarily, as if they're not sure whether it's gas or a stray, low-flying cloud. It's almost as if the crowd is saying to itself: That didn't just happen in America in 1999, did it?”

Cardinal Sin
Kristin Lombardi • March 2001

Cardinal Bernard Law knew as early as 1984 John Geoghan was molesting children. The priest would not be defrocked for 14 years.
“Law, a high-ranking official within the Catholic Church, is one of just eight cardinals in the United States. His boss is Pope John Paul II. As head of the fourth-largest diocese in the country, Law wields substantial power. He is a senior member of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB), a canonical body that makes high-level recommendations for the American Catholic hierarchy on pastoral practices, interreligious affairs, and government policy. One Boston attorney who handles clergy sexual-abuse cases says that ‘suing Law is almost like suing the pope.’
“Still, those familiar with the scope of Geoghan’s behavior are surprised it’s taken so long for Law to face legal action. ‘This has been a dirty little secret the Church has desperately tried to keep quiet,’ charges Stephen Lyons, a Boston attorney. Lyons is best known for defending David and Ginger Twitchell, the Christian Science couple whose child died after receiving inadequate medical care. But he has earned national recognition for his legal work involving clergy sexual abuse. He has successfully litigated more than six lawsuits against the Boston archdiocese and other dioceses nationwide, and says he’s ‘well aware’ of evidence implicating the cardinal—evidence that he cannot reveal because of confidentiality orders. (Lyons has never handled a Geoghan case, nor has he handled a lawsuit against the cardinal.) ‘As far as I’m concerned,’ Lyons says, ‘it’s extraordinary Law hasn’t been named a defendant [in the Geoghan cases] before.’ ”

Did He Murder His Mother?
David S. Bernstein • April 2005

The jury made a mistake when it convicted Abdul Raheem.
“The state medical examiner was never allowed to enter the crime scene—another peculiar aspect of the investigation. That examiner, Alexander Chirkov, testified that he came to the crime scene the first evening and stood waiting outside the house for half an hour, but was sent away. Chirkov performed the autopsy at 10 a.m. the next morning in his lab, a delay, he testified, that denied him access to information that could have allowed him to pinpoint the time of death, and perhaps to discover other important information.
“Then, too, there was the loss of the rape kit. A rape kit, a standard part of an investigation of a female victim—especially a naked one—includes swabs from the body, material from beneath the fingernails, and other potential physical evidence. This was, in fact, the only potential source of DNA evidence taken from on or around the body. Yet detectives did not ask to have the kit processed for months, and when they finally did they found that it had been ‘accidentally destroyed’ at the office of the chief medical examiner (CME), according to a report submitted by Coleman. (Chirkov, who no longer works for the CME’s office, did not return calls from the Phoenix seeking comment.)”

A Weed Grows In Boston
Valerie Vande Panne • December 2009

What's a suburban soccer mom who was once fervently anti-drug doing running a business growing and selling pot?
“From the outside, we could have been on Wisteria Lane. But none of their neighbor's houses are visible through the trees that surround Mary and Joey's abode.
“We walk into a neat, clean, sparse home. There are no pit bulls, no guns, no security cameras. No henchmen, no gangsta rap blaring. No heavily tattooed and pierced punks or hippies. It is, in fact, the exact opposite: a quaint residence, quintessentially suburban, with a bowl of plastic fruit on the dining-room table, pictures of their happy family on the walls, house plants in the windows, and a bird feeder in the backyard. Smokey, the house cat, lolls in the living room.
“That living room has a few EZ chairs and a long, wrap-around couch — replete with built-in cup holders — where a ‘trimmer’ is stationed with a marijuana-filled TV tray. He's using a little pair of scissors to cut the leaves (the ""trim"") off the buds (the desirable part of the plant for sale to consumers). MTV's For the Love of Ray J plays quietly on the television. (‘In order to keep the trimmers trimming,’ she advises, noting how they can get easily distracted, ‘it has to be reality television. It can't be sports.’)
"" ‘We pay our trimmers $20 an hour, plus food,’ explains Mary, gesturing to the composed laborer. ‘We can't offer them health insurance, though. Most of our trimmers are unemployed otherwise.’ One of them, it turns out, is a former chef who's had a hard time finding work in the global depression.”
The Trials of Nadia Naffe
Chris Faraone • February 2013

Naffe, a young Republican, entered the belly of the political beast—and was nearly eaten.
“After a long cruise through wooded Westwood, O’Keefe pulled up to Naffe’s accommodations for the night: a two-story barn on the property of an upscale suburban home. Naffe says details of their destination were not made clear on the ride, but it didn’t take long once they arrived for her to realize that she was inside Project Veritas headquarters. There were awards on the wall with O’Keefe’s engraved name on them; equipment from the RV in Los Angeles was set up on a desk. With contributions pouring in, O’Keefe had invested thousands on computers and surveillance equipment. His renovated barn was a full-service bunker for waging war against liberals.
“O’Keefe sat in his editing cockpit and began to play the NYU recordings. Strangely, Naffe says, there were also candles lit around the room. She sipped a beer, and asked again about O’Keefe’s grudge against Seife. She also asked when he planned to leave so she could have privacy. After the long train ride, she was eager to shower and get to bed early. But Naffe says O’Keefe made several excuses for why he needed to stay—to watch a football game, to use his ‘stuff.’ Then she turned her attention to a phone call with another guy, and the conversation flipped completely. O’Keefe stormed out, and peeled off. That’s when Naffe says that she began feeling woozy, as if she’d been drugged.”

How the Village Voice and other alt-weeklies lost their voice in 2013 http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/28/how-the-village-voicean

The papers — which documented parts of cities that other media missed — suffered major blows this year

LOS ANGELES — There was something else there, but you couldn't see it. There were notes coming from somewhere — maybe adding up to a melody — but you couldn't quite hear them. Growing up in and around this sprawling, elusive city in the 1970s and '80s, Lynell George would see things, hear things, that never showed up in the daily press.

""I didn't always find my city in the newspapers,"" says George, who grew up black in racially mixed neighborhoods and was so inspired by the city and its contradictions that she decided to become a writer who'd decode L.A.'s sense of place. She was tired of reading about the wealthy Westside, Hollywood deal-making and society ladies in Beverly Hills. ""Sometimes there were just little glimpses,"" she says, of something else.

Documenting the city — its racial and ethnic fault lines, the brilliant corners of its music scene, its overlooked literary life — was something, George realized, she could tackle more effectively as a journalist for alternative newsweeklies rather than a novelist. She'd spent years driving to Book Soup, a store on Sunset Boulevard, to pick up the Village Voice and read Greg Tate on black culture or Guy Trebay on the Bronx's crack epidemic or to Venice's Rose Cafe or Tower Records to pick up LA Weekly. ""I wanted it on Thursday; I couldn't wait,"" she says. ""If you didn't get it, it was gone. I wanted to be part of that conversation.""

Talk to readers and writers about the heyday of the alternative press and you hear stories like this. For all the good memories, though, 2013 has been a rough year for alt-weeklies. The Boston Phoenix, among the oldest and most storied, collapsed in March, putting about 50 employees out of work, just six months after an optimistic move to glossy stock; the paper was losing roughly $1 million a year. Susan Orlean, a New Yorker writer who, like Joe Klein, Janet Maslin and David Denby, worked for the Phoenix early on, compares it to the disappearance of her alma mater. ""I am a child of the alt-weekly world,"" she says, ""and I feel like it has played such an important role in journalism as we know it today."" The New Haven Advocate was folded, along with two other weeklies, into The Hartford Courant this month after a year that saw heavy layoffs. In May, the two top editors of The Village Voice resigned rather than cut a quarter of the staff.

The troubles are not confined to the northeast: The LA Weekly, whose issues typically offer less than half the pages they did a decade ago, recently announced substantial cuts in its theater coverage, to which the paper had a three-decade commitment. Most places, page counts and staff sizes are way down.

Some of the causes of the alt-press meltdown are more complex than those of daily newspapers, which have been felled primarily by the Internet and corporate overreach. But the results are at least as tumultuous.

None of this sad trajectory was clear to Lynell George back when she became — in a chaotic office in Silverlake, a gritty gay neighborhood not yet declared cool — an LA Weekly intern in the late '80s and a staff writer in the early '90s. A tattooed performance artist manned the front desk, and pompadoured staffers in pegged jeans would arrive with guitars in preparation for after-work gigs. ""You didn't know what you'd come into in the morning — I loved that. It reflected the music scene, the art scene."" And ""alternative,"" she realized, meant asking, ""'What's really going on?' And to come at it in a different way.""



Despite its association with the counterculture, the alternative press had its origins in the Eisenhower era — in the Red Scare, in fact. Though mainstream culture circa 1955 was sleepy and reactionary, Norman Mailer, who helped found The Village Voice that year out of a Greenwich Avenue apartment, wrote that the paper would ""give a little speed to that moral and sexual revolution which is yet to come upon us."" Dan Wolf, another founder, described the era as one in which ""the vulgarities of McCarthyism had withered the possibilities of a true dialogue between people.""

Mailer's column for the Voice, the novelist wrote a few years later, gave him the kind of opportunity that would have made Jack Kerouac swoon: ""Drawing upon hash, lush, Harlem, Spanish wife, Marxist culture, three novels, victory, disaster, and draw, the General looked over his terrain and found it a fair one, the Village a seed-ground for the opinions of America, a crossroads between the small town and the mass media."" Avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas became the paper's film critic, urbanist Jane Jacobs wrote important pieces on the destruction of lower Manhattan neighborhoods, Nat Hentoff chronicled jazz and politics, Robert Christgau helped invent rock criticism.

The Voice surged from its initial print run of 2,500 copies (sold, originally, at 5 cents apiece) to 150,000 readers by 1970. By that point, the paper had company: What began as a music-heavy publication in 1966, Boston After Dark would become the more comprehensive Boston Phoenix, and in 1970, anti-war students at Arizona State founded the first New Times paper to protest the Kent State killings. The year after, the Chicago Reader was inaugurated by a group of college friends, and the following year, the first of the Creative Loafing papers, which would spread across the South, began in Atlanta.

These papers inherited varying degrees of the Voice's political edge, emphasis on hipness and personal style, and pugnacity toward the mainstream. When LA Weekly rolled out its first issue in 1978, Jay Levin, one of its founders, wrote, ""the smog in L.A. was so bad that much of the year you could barely see the hookers on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Western Avenue.""

Before long, the Weekly had dug into the cozy relationship between government regulators and polluters and turned out 40 stories on smog and the people responsible for it. This was the paper’s mission: ""We would challenge all the official stories."" (Today, now that L.A.'s smog problem has improved, you can see the hookers clearly.)

Alt-weeklies thrived in conservative and conventional times. ""The Reagan years were in some ways the alternative press's glory years,"" says Tom Carson, who wrote for the Voice and LA Weekly from 1977 to 1999. ""We knew we were a playing an adversary role. Peggy Noonan was right: It was a revolution, destroying what was left of the New Deal, making this into a very different country. And we were the only ones calling (Reagan) on it, besides a few scattered op-ed columnists.""

At a time when corporate rock thrived and the blockbuster culture was gearing up — Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were no longer mavericks, Phil Collins and hair metal raced up the charts — and the president refused to utter the name of a plague killing thousands of gay men, the lines were clearly drawn. The alternative press knew which side it was on.

Though sometimes dismissed as hippie rags, alt-weeklies exerted an influence on mainstream, straight dailies. ""The alternative press should get credit for pushing the daily press to cover culture and the arts,"" says Doug McLennan, a former Seattle Weekly staffer who now runs ArtsJournal.com.

But the influence went the other way, too: By the '90s, with the first popular Democratic president in three decades, corporate studios starting indie-film wings and ""alternative rock"" albums shooting up the charts, the lines became more blurred: Alternative weeklies and mainstream papers were harder to tell apart.

Manohla Dargis was writing for The Village Voice when she saw a New York Times story on the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and realized that things had changed. Cultural shifts, and an interest in youth and fringe culture by the mainstream press, meant that alt papers were losing their distinctiveness. And without a Republican White House, alt-weeklies were losing their political edge.

""When you take away the politics — if you don't have an editor with a very aggressive political agenda — all the other coverage is up for grabs,” says Dargis. ""Mainstream journalists started to cover that stuff. Mainstream papers started to poach, and some writers were comfortable in both worlds. Why shouldn’t they be?

""People like Greg Tate and C. Carr were never going to work for the mainstream press."" But Dargis says she realized that the terms had shifted, and by 2002, as film editor at LA Weekly, she was tired of toiling for alt-press wages. ""I could stay there or make twice as much money in the mainstream. I couldn't say 'f---' anymore, but maybe I could make a living."" She is now a movie critic for The New York Times.

In terms of circulation and revenues, the '90s seemed like a good time for alternative weeklies. But the seeds of demise had been planted. It wasn't just what social critic Thomas Frank has called ""the conquest of cool"" or the pressures that pushed the Voice, for instance, to stop charging for its publication in 1996. It was a wily company from Arizona.

New Times began opening new alt-weeklies and aggressively acquiring existing ones in the '90s, and their model emphasized investigative reporting but not progressive politics. In 2005, New Times, led by founder Michael Lacey, bought the Voice, LA Weekly and other papers and renamed itself Village Voice Media. At the original Voice, jazz critic Gary Giddins, photographer Sylvia Plachy, Pulitzer-winning cartoonist Jules Feiffer and senior editor and gay-rights crusader Richard Goldstein were pushed out before New Times arrived; writers Hentoff, J. Hoberman, Christgau, Michael Musto and James Ridgeway after. From '05 to '07, the Voice cycled through five top editors. LA Weekly was cannibalized, too. For those writers left, it was a culture shock.

""I got out in the nick of time,"" says Carson, the former LA Weekly and Village Voice employee, who now reviews movies for GQ. ""I could not have survived the New Times era. They seemed motivated by hatred of everything the alternative press stood for — the left-wing politics, the countercultural sensibility, the value placed on intellectualism. These guys were just aggressively demolishing everything that weeklies were good for.""

Of course, Craigslist and the Internet consumed much of the advertising that both alternative and mainstream papers depended on and altered the whole landscape. ""These retail shifts have made it harder for publishers to distribute their weeklies,"" wrote press critic Jack Shafer, a onetime alt-weekly editor in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. ""Before Tower Records went under, a paper could drop thousands of copies a week at the store's many locations, and the stacks would disappear in a day or two. The video stores that once distributed them? Gone."" Instead of opening an alt-weekly as you waited for your subway car or girlfriend, he says, young folks now pull out their cell phones.

""The alternative press comes at a very specific point in American history, and its demise does, too,"" says Dargis. ""People are going to look at it as completely a technological issue, which is totally reductive. By the time the Internet arrives, the alternative press had already given it up. It had lost its mission.""

A journalism career's start

As it happens, I am not a disinterested observer in these questions. I became a journalist largely because of the alternative press. As a left-leaning, college-radio-loving teenager in a moderately conservative Reagan-era suburb in Maryland, I found the Voice while working at a bookstore: From its political engagement to its underground music coverage to J. Hoberman's ability to make broader sense of mainstream films, this was a world I’d suspected existed but had never quite found before that.

By the latter '90s, when I was in my late 20s, I was editing a film section and writing about culture for New Times' L.A. paper, New Times Los Angeles, which the company formed after it bought two smaller weeklies and, in my boss's phrase, ""machine-gunned the staff."" I was told over and over again by my bosses about what a bunch of lazy, pontificating hippies sat across town at the Weekly, even as I blushed at the quality of their arts coverage. At New Times I met a very sharp bunch of journalists, but a business model clearly built on the promiscuous use of job termination. (I was fired once, then rehired.) They weren't quite right-wing — more macho libertarian, with a bullying streak — but when Sarah Palin broke out and began to run down coastal ""elites,"" I felt like I was back in a Monday editorial meeting.

For all the emphasis on reporting — the implication being that columns, essays or reviews were somehow unmanly — it was a film critic, Peter Rainer, who earned a Pulitzer finalist spot during my time there. Jonathan Gold, who worked for LA Weekly until last year, won his Pulitzer as a food critic.

But what seemed strange about the New Times crowd is that sometimes they were right. And sometimes they were right on important things, as when the paper helped break a scandal in which the Los Angeles Times secretly shared profits with an advertiser.

It was sad, then, when the company shut New Times Los Angeles, in 2002. I had decamped to the Los Angeles Times by then, and I watched with amazement as New Times swaggered back to town, took over the Weekly and started butchering. (Two longtime New Times editors told me the alt-press troubles come from the economy and the Internet and not anything the company did and declined to speak on the record. Similarly, the Association of American Newsmedia has said the Boston Phoenix's closing and other turmoil is not a sign of a larger decline.)

New Times' owners killed my old paper’s online archive, so most of what we wrote disappeared. They later dumped almost all of the Weekly's archive of old papers, which contained what one scribe called ""the secret history of L.A."" They moved the paper from a gritty, almost-hip location on Sunset Boulevard to a freeway-adjacent corporate box that former staffers liken to an Ikea set down in Siberia. Joe Donnelly, a gifted editor hired by one ""Weekly"" regime, fired by another, is not alone in thinking the owners ruined the paper. (Disclosure: I've worked with several people in this story, including Donnelly.)

In 2012, Lacey split to take control of Backpage, an online classified service heavy on escort services that has been linked to underage prostitution. (New York Times writer Nicholas Kristof has called it ""Where Pimps Peddle Their Goods."") He has compared his departure to Backpage to his youthful protest over the Kent State dead and to Grove Press’s Barney Rosset’s fight to publish D.H. Lawrence.

What's the significance of all this for people who read weeklies rather than write for them? Los Angeles, which had three alt-weeklies in the '80s and '90s — including an LA Weekly with fact-checkers, researchers and a large writing staff — now has just one, with a skeleton staff and fewer than 100 pages of copy. (Matt Groening's ""Life in Hell"" comic, a precursor to ""The Simpsons,"" ran in one of the papers New Times killed, the Los Angeles Reader.)

Over the years, alternative papers have paid attention to neglected issues and unjustly obscure rock bands. The members of the Pixies met through the classified pages in The Boston Phoenix. Giddins's jazz writing in the Voice remains as daring and clear as a Charlie Parker solo; Ridgeway's work on neo-Nazis and militias has no peer. LA Weekly helped document parts of its city that would literally explode in the '92 riots, and then documented the carnage, in words and pictures, better than any other outlet. Even the New Times papers have published an enormous number of gutsy investigative stories on crony politicians, corrupt sheriffs, kids victimized in foster care and vile religious cults. ""Yes, we're under tremendous pressure in the digital age, like everyone in the media,"" says Sarah Fenske, editor of LA Weekly, before naming stories that make her proud to be in the business. She cites a piece about lawyer Carmen Trutanich, whom she calls ""one of the biggest bullies in L.A. politics""; one on accusations of exploitation of would-be filmmakers on YouTube; and a third arguing that an epidemic of hit-and-run accidents has been ignored by the police.

""What factory that we'd once hear about dumping toxic chemicals are we not hearing about anymore?"" asks Ted Drozdowski, a onetime Boston Phoenix editor. ""There are less watchdogs, which is why we hear less barking.""

When those papers go down, or cut pages and staff, those stories disappear and those writers find another way to pay the rent. But it's not just what we don't see; it's the way seeing itself has changed. ""When the Voice was in muckraking mode,"" says Carson, ""and we'd go after some shitty landlord or some awful politico, that story was on the cover, and it was all over the place. Today, you can see that story online and you may be the only person reading it. A physical paper is a physical presence — and you’d see it all over the city.""

I'm now lost on how I should continue after I graduate. I see everyone else around me doing their internships and positions through their courses, and I can't help being frustrated and helpless with my lack of direction."
40h76v,40,2016-01-11,I earn more than my boyfriend,Courtyen,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/40h76v/i_earn_more_than_my_boyfriend/,"So I'm currently studying at university for a bachelor's degree in ICT, while my boyfriend is an apprentice in a trade (keeping as much information private as possible). He's always been very proud of being able to provide for me and buy me cool things, meanwhile I've been flat broke whilst studying full-time.

But recently I secured an internship. Not the best-paying, but even at the undergraduate level I'm now making quite a bit more money than him. As in, quite a bit. Granted it's only for a year, but still.

When I told my boyfriend, he acted really weird about it. He's always known that with my degree I would probably end up making more money than him, but apparently he didn't quite grasp it before.

Later that night after I told him what my pay would be, he sat me down and said some very strange and somewhat worrying things. I'm going to paraphrase as this was a while ago:

""You're smart. You're really smart. And I'm not smart at all. I don't know what I'm doing with my life, I've never had clear goals. But I don't need them anymore. For as long as I live, my goal will be to help you get as far in your career as possible. This is my purpose in life- to help you succeed.""

On the surface this is rather sweet. But he said this with an air of... Defeat. It's like realizing I was going to make more money than him killed any motivation inside him to achieve anything for himself.

I'm really worried about what is going to happen now. I don't want him depending on me for a purpose in life. I don't want him giving up on his career, his training. I'm scared that our relationship isn't going to survive if I earn more than him for a long period of time. And I'm very scared of what a breakup might do to him.

I would really appreciate some advice. I'm sorry for the essay-sized post but I just wanted to give as much information as possible.

EDIT: forgot a tiny itty bitty minor detail - he also tried to propose to me immediately after this discussion. I managed to turn it down without turning it down (a mixture of ""it doesn't feel right"", ""we said we'd wait a little longer"" etc.), and he hasn't tried since but he doesn't seem hurt about it either - I think even he knows that wasn't the right time to do so.

Edit 2: thank you so much guys, I crashed at some point and didn't get to all of you, but I'll endeavor to do so today. When I can I'll be sitting down with my boyfriend and make sure he understands that I'm not going anywhere, and keep encouraging him to finish his training, because it's important to me that he has it."

**Notable Box Office Stories:**

* If there's an adage that should be written in stone it's that you should never underestimate Leonardo DiCaprio. Early predictions for **The Revenant** had it coming in only around $20-$25 million, yet once again Leo brought in the crowds to an astounding $39.8 million making it just barely #2 behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens. A lot of people though the huge $125 million budget of The Revenant could not be satisfied, especially for a brutal two and a half hour revenge tale. Leo has consistently shown that his presence brings a lot of confidence to even the most daring of projects and it's almost certain that last nights Golden Globes' Best Picture victory for The Revenant, [the overwhelming odds in favor of Leo winning his first Oscar](http://www.goldderby.com/awardshows/experts/oscars-2015-nominations-nominations/best-actor.html), and the slew of other nominations for the film it's pretty certain this film will have great legs. The film still has a steep battle to top it's heavy budget, but with just a decent international take the film could make back it's budget and throw in some heavy awards love with it. 

* There's of course a lot **Star Wars: The Force Awakens** box office news so let's get to it. First up the film passed the all time best domestic record set by Avatar this week. Even crazier while it took two releases and almost a full year for Avatar to get that record, The Force Awakens did it in in 20 days! The film also became the first to pass $800 million domestic. However that shiny $1 billion domestic record may not be as easy as we thought. The film finally had it's first major downslide, dropping 53% domestic to a fantastic but not record breaking $41.6 mil weekend, though still coming in at #1. The Force Awakens could limp now to $1 billion but it's more than likely going to fall in the $800 - $900 mil range if it continues to drop like a summer movie. We also got a big answer to the China question this week as the film opened to a sizeable $53 million. Many wondered if the film could open well in the region as the prequels all faired poorly there and the original trilogy premiered to mixed reviews past July. While the $53 million doesn't hold a candle to the insane $69 million Furious 7 opening, it did break the China Saturday-Sunday records. However on Monday the film dropped a shocking 65% for a $7.2 mil, showing that despite the heavy marketing push Disney just couldn't break into the Asian markets quite like they hoped. The Force Awakens will most likely now make $100-150 million in it's current run in China which could slightly push it past the $2 billion mark but it seems unlikely now that it will reach that elusive $2.7 billion. It may even be a struggle to top Titanic's $2.1 billion cume. The Force Awakens will just have to settle for breaking every other major record by a huge majority. What a flop!

* On the counter-programming side **The Forest** once again proved that January horror is still a viable, critic proof time. The widely panned film set in the Japanese Suicide Forest didn't quite do as well as the shocking January horror hit The Devil Inside, but it did manage to make $12.7 million this weekend, surpassing predictions under $10 mil. However the bad reviews and ""C"" Cinemascore rating means this film could easily drop over 60% next weekend so it's unlikely to have great legs.

* Several notable flops from 2015 have closed this week. First up is the **The Last Witch Hunter** which at least made back it's $90 million budget with a $108.3 million take though obviously the film is still a loser when counting in even a modest advertising budget. This seemed like the year of Vin Diesel with Furious 7 opening so incredibly, but it seems outside of the franchises Vin remains a middling box office draw at best. Next up is **Victor Frankenstein** perhaps most notable as the second and way more noticeable 2015 flop from writer Max Landis who's been quite the social media presence this year. The film made shockingly less than $6 million in the US and only managed to scrape $38 million worldwide on a $40 million budget. The of course there's **Pan**, perhaps the most unfortunately named critical flop of the year. The film's insane $150 million budget was thoroughly not met making $126 million on a $150 million budget and likely an ad campaign pushing it well into the total $300-$400 million range. Compare that to another closer **The Intern** which earned a shocking $194 million on a budget almost five times smaller.

As the title states I have an internship I'm starting, next week actually, &amp; it's been a long time since I've had to wear anything but a uniform to work. 
I have some money to go shopping with later this week, but I would like to get the most out of the stuff I have now. 
This is everything I have that is work appropriate, so I would love some opinions on how to style some of it. A few are sleeveless dresses which, I think is okay in the workplace, but I always feel a bit out of place when I do that, plus it's winter in Ohio!
Also, my internship is at a museum so I know the dress code is a bit more relaxed. I kind of have a feeling I'll be living in sweaters + (nice) leggings, but I do love to get a little dressed up every now &amp; then. 
Some of the stuff I have doesn't fit the best, as in its just a tad too big so I'll belt it, but I'm always interested in different ways to fix that problem. 
oh &amp;, I have a love for yellow &amp; stripes haha

When I do go shopping this week something I must get are shoes. I'm not a shoe girl at all. I usually buy one pair per season, but I don't wear heels! I was thinking I should get a tan bootie &amp; a black flat/wedge.

40k3y3,7,2016-01-11,Tomorrow is one week sober.,elboro5000,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/40k3y3/tomorrow_is_one_week_sober/,"So last February in 2015 I was hospitalized because I had pancreatitis. I had been suffering the abdominal pains for over two years and had written it off as a food thing or something else. Well of course it was because I was downing 3-6 whiskey shots every night, even if I was going out to the bar or coming from said bar. So I went in, got pain meds, fluids, enzymes, the whole nine yards. Everything ended up ok and there was no permanent damage, etc. Doctor says to stop drinking for three months and then I can drink but should really stop or if I do drink, drink minimally.

I leave the hospital with a new low fat diet (awful) and am good to go. I made it two months without drinking before I went back to it. At first it wasn't bad - I was at least drinking minimally and not overdoing it. Realizing, or thinking, that I could do that I started to up the ante. Skip ahead to about 6-7 months after the hospital and I am back to the same thing.

Well no surprise here - I just got out of the hospital this past Friday for the same damn thing. Though this time it was worse because I had fluids in me from my pancreas that aren't really suppose to be there and the pain was almost worse this time somehow. Thank goodness for dilaudid. 

So as the title says, tomorrow marks one full week of having been sober again. The timing was pretty spot on as my last semester of grad school just started and I interviewed for an internship just today (think I crushed it). Hopefully all goes well and I can make it the full three months (and longer) this time without being stupid :)"

40kj8i,8,2016-01-11,"I think I'm taking a job at a startup, some questions about compensation.",realfuzzhead,programmerchat,https://www.reddit.com/r/programmerchat/comments/40kj8i/i_think_im_taking_a_job_at_a_startup_some/,"Hello all, I recently interviewed with a start-up, and they expressed interest in extending me an official offer. I haven't got this offer yet, and I was wondering what I should expect. I'm a senior CS major with internship experience at some big companies/organizations under my belt.

The company is small, ~6 people. They were valued in their last round at just under $10M. They have paying customers already, and are quickly expanding into new industries with various partnerships that seem like they might be quite lucrative. The company is based just south of SF in a pricey area. I don't think they've reached profitability yet but besides that I don't have much insight to the companies finances. I really respect the founder and the other developers, and I find the tech to be extremely compelling and useful to me. I also think it has the potential to reach a lot of people.

I'm wondering what to expect as far as compensation is concerned? I have a competing offer from a large software company, and it was $90k for salary and $10k signing bonus with some clauses that let me divide that $10k up into part stocks and part cash. Full health, dental, 401k matching, etc were provided. I am wondering if I should expect more or less from a startup?

Also, is there anything I should look out for? I know that part of my offer, maybe a considerable part of it, will consist of stock options vested over a 3-4 year period. 

One more thing, what questions should I ask to determine if this startup is the right place for me? How do I, politely, obtain more information of the companies finances?"
40knyu,1,2016-01-11,Staying in school another semester for a minor in information systems and possibly economics?,MC-Flowseidon,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/40knyu/staying_in_school_another_semester_for_a_minor_in/,"I am a week away from beginning my spring semester of my Senior year at a public university in the United Stated. I am a business major with a concentration in Accounting. I am actually a little ahead of schedule in completing my credits as I only really have 8 credits to take to fulfill my degree. I chose accounting because i took a class and did well and accounting seemed like the most challenging/impressive of the business concentrations my school offered and it seems like it could give me a platform for a variety of business careers.

However, I came into school as a computer science major ( I don't really know why, I don't have much knowledge in coding or anything it just sounded interesting and promising) and since I changed my major I have considered minoring in information systems which would only require me to take two more classes to complete. However, due to prerequisites that aren't within the track of the minor, my selection for those classes is slim. This semester I could only take Programming and Problem Solving II but I would have to stay another semester to take the last course (I emailed the department coordinator who told me this was my only option). After I complete this course it should open up a couple other course opportunities for the following semester. The thing is I haven't taken programming I since my very first semester over three years ago and I wasn't particular comfortable in that course as it was. I have forgotten nearly everything about java code and I am worried it would be very difficult. 

However, I am worried I might not like accounting and I think it could diversify my skills for other possible opportunities. I have not yet gotten an internship in accounting which makes me even more unsure if I can do this for a living but it doesn't seem like I'll have time to get one until I graduate. There is also the possibility I could tack-on an additional minor in economics to be completed within that other semester as well because I would only need 3 more classes but I'm skeptical due to scheduling and timing issues. Also 
if I did both minors it would give me enough credits for my CPA, which I don't think I'm ready/want to take the exam yet.

I was wondering what you guys thought if it is worth the extra time in school or not? My scholarship (Almost covers tuition) only lasts four years and would be expired if i continued another semester and I'm not sure if I wanna pay for more school. I am also really fed up with school at this point and if I did not pursue any minors my last semester would be a lot easier and i could take some fun classes too. Also, not sure if it matters but at this point I'm considering traveling or moving to a place where i can be a beach lifeguard year round before  begin a career in business. Any career insight or advise would be great really, I'm lost and have no idea what i really want to do with my life."

Its in particular not easy to travel when there exists sun glaring right in your eyes, which happens to be why numerous persons put on sunglasses while driving throughout the day, but at night it might be just as perilous and blinding with all of the vibrant headlights contrasting along with the dark circumstances. And of course you'll find people men and women who put halogen bulbs in cars, or individuals that forget about to turn their brights off, this means you turn out with enormous glare which will cause you to drop sight of one's lane. The makers of the Night View glasses claim that they work to chop down on glare, allowing for you to travel securely at night without the need of compromising your eyesight or earning factors any darker. They are saying that its the yellow coating on these lenses that blocks the blue light-weight waves that happen to be liable for all of that glare at night. Youll be amazed just the amount of sources of glare there are actually. Certainly within the headlights, and also brake lights, street lights, and even targeted visitors indicators. It is all meant to become minimized using these glasses. These have their own mini-infomercial that attempts to point out how they function, which adds some hoopla since youre not rather positive if they way they are staying depicted is strictly how they are intending to get the job done in authentic life after you get them dwelling. Night View glasses total out at $26 for 2 pair. The advertised price is $10 but that speedily jumps to $18 with transport, and then they tack to the 2nd pair but charge shipping for it, which provides it to $26. During the occasion of a return youd only receive a $10 credit back again on your own card, so it is a bit of a danger since $16 moreover the expense of return delivery gets squandered. When you think about that each pair is $13 delivered to your door, it is however such a competitive price tag that its worthy of using an enormous of threat for any answer to night driving. The Night View glasses are obtaining our Good Try out ranking. We checked out other night driving glasses which may manage to compete with these, but had been not able to uncover fantastic ones which are within the same price category. You end up investing all-around $40 or maybe more for a respectable pair, and because these get fantastic opinions at a rate that is below 50 percent that it would make sense to offer them the go. For those who split the price which has a mate it would make the most perception, for the reason that then by far the most every of you is risking is $8 when they dont get the job done like you hoped they would.

40namk,1,2016-01-12,"Never had a job. I'm 27, lonely and desperate",TronaldDumped,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/40namk/never_had_a_job_im_27_lonely_and_desperate/,"I don't know where to start, as I've told this story time and time again and all it's done is leave me wondering what part of it I should emphasize in order to hopefully get some help after all this time...

Like the title says: I'm a 27yo male and have never had a job. Sure, I've done *some* work, but nothing longer than a month or 2 at max.

I was abused as a child and though I hate to use this as an ""excuse"", I can't help but feel it has fucked me up for life. There was physical, verbal and emotional abuse throughout my childhood, but what influenced me the most was the emotional abuse I believe.

One of my earliest memories of my father is him storming into my room in the middle of the night, waking me to tell me that if I keep it up (whenever my parents had a fight, they somehow always found a way to put the cause with me) my mom would soon be dead.

My mom beat me all the time, and when she broke shit in the house, she'd blame it on me so I'd receive my father's rage when he got home too.

I was, and still am for a large part, socially underdeveloped. All my life I've been told I am ""shy"", though deep down I am not, I long for communication, I wish I could open up to people and be myself, but I can't, it's as if ever since I learned that ""my behavior"" would eventually kill my mom, I stopped being myself, it feels like I'm in a mental prison and I have no idea who has the key, I'd like to believe it's me, but I can't find it.

Being the socially awkward mess that I am, the only relationship I've ever had was with my now ex-gf, it lasted 8 years and I'm fully responsible for it having gone south in the end, something I still regret every day since we split up.

We used to live together, for a short time, but everything went downhill from there, as I decided I didn't want to see my parents anymore, and this led to increasing tensions both between me and my ex, as well as her and my parents, etc. I received letters, emails, some threatening, some downright sad bordering pathetic, begging me to not do this to them.

Eventually, life got the best of me and I collapsed, the relationship ended, I spent months alone in the house we once rented together, and eventually, I moved back in with my parents, who still don't seem to grasp how much my upbringing has influenced my development and how it probably explains my current position in life.

I go to a psychiatrist, a psychologist, and a therapist. I'm on meds (300mg wellbutrin and 150mg trazodone mylan) but they don't seem to work, the only effects they've had so far were negative.

I seem to be able to talk about my problems pretty well, at least when it comes to talking to professionals as not a single one of my friends knows about my struggles, I'm embarrassed and scared to lose the few people I consider ""friends"" because I feel like a failure at life

Since april 2015, the month things officially went south with my ex, I've only had a single significant ""relationship"", where a girl came up to me, we got to talking and one thing led to another. We slept together (total failure, read below), and I completely opened up to her, I told her everything. I understand now that I was way too needy and so after less than a month it all ended in drama.

She gave me hope again, a reason to get up in the morning, I looked forward to hearing from her, even more so to seeing her, she made me happy, she gave me a reason to live, and ever since I lost that, again, it's only been going downhill as far as I can see atm

To make things worse, I was on different anti-depressants back then and they completely killed my sex drive, as well as my ability to perform sexually, and so not only was I choking her with my neediness, I also fucked up sexually, adding even further to my already below zero confidence... 

I'm 99.99% certain I have attachment issues. I can't be alone, though I need my alone time, I also need someone who's there for me, someone to hold, someone to talk to. But I can't find it, and it seems like when I do find it, I embrace it so much I choke it to death.


And now... I'm lost, I'm lonely, and I'm desperate. My life at the moment pretty much consists of two things:

- Being depressed the entire week, to the point where I don't get out of the house, sleep 10-12 hours a day, and don't eat

- Being hopeful every weekend, going out till morning hours, in hopes of coming across that ""special"" someone, and though a part of me understands that this won't fix a thing, a bigger part of me is screaming for attention, to be held, to feel understood, even if it's only slightly


Everyone around me is so focused on getting me a job, and while I want nothing more than to lead a normal life like my friends, at the moment I could care less about work, even if I do land one I KNOW with certainty that I won't be able to keep it, that my loneliness will, again, get the best of me, and that I'll give up once more, only worsening my situation and self-respect/image.

As sad as it may sound, the only reason I'd be interested in landing a job right now, would be to hopefully meet people/girls my age and find who/what I'm looking for, and of course, if that's not the case, there won't be no keeping the job either, I'm sure.

I cried throughout writing this, I'm so damn lost, I don't even know where to start with fixing myself. People tell me I should fix my rhythm, that I should get a good weekly routine etc, but I can't, I'm too focused on finding someone who cares to give a damn about anything else.

This didn't start overnight either, there were symptoms 10 years back and it's only gradually worsened over time. I wasn't happy in the 8y long relationship either, it didn't feel right, and now that it's gone, I feel like an idiot for having given it up, we had a future planned out together, but I was a mental wreck who threw it all away in hopes of replacing it with something better, yet it looks like I threw away the winning lottery ticket instead.

This isn't the first time I've written a wall of text like this, and I assume it won't be my last either, but I had to get this off my chest, I had to put it down, if not to get help, at least for myself.

I seem unable to embrace the fact that, yes, my life has been a mess up to this point, but it can all be fixed in the long run. Instead, I wear a mask, every damn day, my friends think I'm fine, I don't have financial difficulties, it looks like my relationship with my parents is fine, and when I go out in the weekend I drink so I can loosen up and be the person I desire to be.

My therapist has confirmed that it's quite a tangled web I'm in, and that's what it feels like too. There is no one thing I should address or try to fix, there's dozens, I'd even dare say there's not even one thing that's going RIGHT in my life, and the realization of this fact is all the more depressing to say the least.

At the moment I'm doing an internship at a company I used to enjoy working at, I'm expected only two days a week yet since the holidays I've completely relapsed, and now I'm considering putting an end to the internship as the shame is building up inside of me, they know I have personal issues, but still, I feel a crippling sense of embarrassment over the fact that I can't even hold down a 16 hour job...

My doctor has suggested going to a psychiatric hospital, and a part of me sees this as a valid option, but on the flipside of that coin there is the realization that this will only further add to my sense of being stigmatized over my ""illness"", and besides, I'd only be interested in getting treatment there if I'd actually meet someone I liked there, of which the chances are more than likely minuscule...

I want to be helped, obviously, but more than anything, at this time, and for a long time now, I want to be loved, and be able to GIVE love. It feels like it's a vital part of me and it's slowly bleeding out, there's no use fixing everything else in my life, anything positive is drained to keep that dying part of me alive, and until I address it, heal it, nothing else will help nor matter.

And now, in fear of rolling downhill even further, I post this ridiculous wall of text, in hopes of someone, somewhere, reading it and being able to provide me with some new insight.

I'm suicidal and have been for a while, ever since I was a small child I used to fantasize about jumping in front of trucks, and I still do, but at the moment I'm too lethargic to even consider an attempt, if anything I'd just like to go to bed and never wake up again, but instead, I find myself cuddled up under my blankets every afternoon, forcing myself to get out so I at least didn't spend the entire day being useless...

Sometimes I like to think I sleep so much, because it's the closest to being dead I can achieve in my current state :)"

I am a fully bilingual (French) technical support/help desk looking for full time employment.  I am also working on some courses in web development so something that could eventually lead to a dev position would be great!

I don't drive so something within Toronto/TTC would be ideal.  I am able to start asap so if you have something that you think I'd be a good fit for, let me know!

I am also interested in some very entry level dev internships if available.

Thanks!

When you have continual again suffering, or issues with your feet, shins, knees, or hips, WalkFit orthotics insoles promise to boost consolation, stability, and foot assistance though running, going for walks or standing. Lots of of you might have almost certainly viewed WalkFit platinum orthotics getting advertised on Tv. Shoe inserts for instance these try to reduce minor common foot and back pain and so are offered as being a preventative wellbeing help. The Platinum orthotics are the latest while in the WalkFit item line.WalkFit statements their platinum insoles are much better than other shoe inserts on the market, just what exactly will make their product or service a lot far better? Let us summarize a few of the good claims made by people today who've bought WalkFit orthotics and so are supposedly happy customers: Walkfit orthotic insoles are far better at absorbing shock than other 'ordinary' orthotics available. Other more added benefits include things like, protection against foot accidents, elevated foot convenience, reduction from foot and various leg suffering. WalkFit Stage 4/Platinum orthotics realign the reduced limbs for their proper place which serves to alleviate stress from sore places by distributing body bodyweight a lot more evenly through the base area from the foot. WalkFits are perfect for people today experiencing indicators of tendinitis, arthritis, and flat feet and endorse their orthotics for people that have had foot surgical treatment executed. Also, foot tiredness as well as other outcomes of outdated age may be reduced with their products and solutions.The Walkfit orthotics attribute their better top quality to outstanding structure. They assert that similar solutions present protection against injuries or alleviate foot, back again, or hip signs but that WalkFit goes a move even further and combines protection and comfort via their usage of highly resistant semi-rigid materials.WalkFit orthotic insoles can be found in various styles and dimensions and are recommended of folks of any age, male or feminine. They will suit into any type of shoe and come delivered with three pairs of arch inserts according to the regardless of whether you've superior, minimal, or ordinary arches and they are sure to past a life time. Notice: these statements haven't been produced by the producer, these are typically only but a sampling of penned reviews of Walkfit Orthtotics, readily available over the net. Examining the above net opinions in the Walkfit Platinum, its basic to view that there is no hard scientific evidence offered to substantiate any claims which the WalkFits are classified as the ideal orthotics on the market. Furthermore, the WalkFit internet site only vaguely hints at any of the higher than statements so it seems a number of the testimonials will not be only disguising anectdotal evidence as scientific actuality but can also be interjecting claims not created by the manufacturer. So are WalkFit orthotics a scam?

I'm really hoping some of you can help me out here and offer some sage advice and money tips. So at the moment I have a full time job and I go to school part time for my masters degree. I live with my parents so the only bills I have to pay are for my credit cards, student loans and water. Therefore, I currently have about $11,000 saved up and I earn a little over $1,000 biweekly. However, come May of this year, I want to move out of my parents place and find myself a roommate and live on my own. My home life is extremely stressful for me and I feel that if I live with my parents any longer, I will grow to hate them. For my sanity, and for theirs, I need to move out and live on my own. 

However, I work in midtown Manhattan and I go to school in lower Manhattan, so I need to find a place nearby (like the Jersey City/Hoboken area) but as some of you may know, these places are ridiculously overpriced. Grad school also is requiring me to take part in research or internships and I do not think that any job is going to allow me to leave early and come in late on some days. Therefore, I need to find a part time job so that I can participate in research and I can do schoolwork without feeling overworked. But how can I survive on a part time job, while going to grad school and paying for rent?! I am planning on getting a roommate or two but I doubt I will be able to find any place around here that will be less than $700-$800. Please tell me what I should do to live comfortably and survive!? Thank you in advance. "

40o2i1,10,2016-01-12,"I need your help, TRP.",slimbarracks,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/40o2i1/i_need_your_help_trp/,"**Summary**

I am a 20 year old university student. Unplugged recently, have read all the sidebar material and a huge number of posts, and trying to build my life from the ruins of former betahood. May be a slightly long post, but I want to share my story and get some advice.

**Body**

I used to be an enormous beta. Right now I am in the no-man's land between rejecting beta thinking but still in the process of trying to assimilate alpha mentalities.

I grew up in South East Asia in a very affluent country, and lived a pretty comfortable life. Went to school, did extremely well, was a very well rounded student, doing numerous sports, playing piano at diploma level, charity and community service, was considered good looking, and had a pretty good social life, although I've always been very uncomfortable with clubbing (huge disadvantage) and quite shy. I have absolutely no experience with girls, because the girls that I liked didn't like me back (because I was beta) and the girls that I didn't like, liked me. I fell into two crippling oneitises. The first one was my best friend at the time, and she knew I liked her. She used me as an emotional tampon, and used to talk to me everyday about how infatuated she was with my best friend. I was a patient doormat and sympathised with her even though she treated me like shit, and the nicer I was to her, the meaner she was to me. I couldn't understand, and was an emotional wreck. She would make up stories about her meeting his family and travelling together just to fuck with my head, and like an idiot, I bought it. I asked her to our prom, she rejected me, and told everyone, and mocked me behind my back. I finally got pissed enough to cut her out of my life.

The second oneitis lasted for two entire years. She told a few people she would've gone out with me, but I was so scared of being fucked with again that I couldn't even muster up the courage to talk to her most of the time. She found out I liked her, I did nothing and acted like a little girl, and after almost two years, she got a boyfriend. I was devastated (good thing it didn't happen though, I don't know what I saw in her). To top it off, after that, a very cute and very nice HB9 fell into my lap because we were dance partners, and same thing happened. I thought she was way too good for me, so I didn't do anything despite her being interested. She soon got a boyfriend.

Fast forward and I got into a great university in the UK. I was unable to adjust to the environment and I got extremely depressed and lonely, and came close to suicide. My exam results were uncharacteristically shit, my social life was nonexistent, I barely went to classes, didn't do any extracurriculars, and lost every shred of ambition I used to have. I barely ate, and lost 12kg, becoming emaciated and weak. Seeing everyone else hooking up and getting into relationships made my mental state a lot worse because my ultimate (and naive) dream was always to find the perfect girl for me and stay together until we could get married (Blue Pill fantasy). I used to just stay in my room crying, watching TV shows and sleeping a lot, seething with an unbelievable amount of irrational hatred for everyone around me, and depressed because almost no one cared about me.

**What's Changed**

I got back to university for second year after doing some reflecting and reading Buddhism over the summer.

* I started going to the gym again
* Started studying hard in university again
* Started reading non-fiction
* Applied to internships in investment banks
* Fixed my attitude somewhat, and stopped blaming other people for my problems. Held myself accountable and made a clear vision of who I want to be. I am far more stoic than I used to be.



**Questions**

* I am vegetarian, which makes getting gains a bit hard. I've bought a tub of Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein, which I have twice a day when working out. Which vegetarian foods/diet plan would you recommend for building muscle, especially in the hectic university life?
* How often should I work out, and what are your preferred workout routines? Should I go with a split routine? Stronglifts? One body part a day?
* How do you completely eradicate the hatred and sadness that comes after unplugging? I see TRP truths in my own sister and mother, right up till hypergamy, branch swinging and entitlement complexes, and it fills me with a lot of hatred and sadness.
* I don't have that many friends in university, apart from a few very close ones. I want to move past being acquaintances with people and have a large social circle, but I find it difficult because a) I developed some social anxiety from the aftermath of my depression and b)by second year now, everyone already has their 'groups'. How should I do it?
* How did you cope with the loneliness of monk mode?
* The most important question for me. How do I start talking to girls? I can't ask a female friend for advice because the ones I told about my depression don't talk to me anymore (shock), and even if I did still have female friends, they'd give me the same shitty advice as my sister: 'Be yourself, girls in university really want relationships and a caring and loving guy who'll make them feel special.' Do I have to start drinking and going clubbing if I want to meet girls?



Thank you for everything TRP. Even though I have a very long way to go, I've learnt to see past the bullshit and really want to work on myself and be a man worth something. Thanks for reading, and any replies are much appreciated!"
40ofm6,3,2016-01-12,Aruba APs keep going up and down,LP970,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/40ofm6/aruba_aps_keep_going_up_and_down/,"**Quick Background:** I'm an intern at an IT company with basic networking skills. I can set up any home network and have configured physical firewalls at home (took netgear router, turned it into AP and set Untangled firewall as DHCP server etc.). At work I have diagnosed, replaced, and configured a faulty AP. I had to do a lot of Googling, but I got it done. This information is relevant because I can solve the problem I am having given proper instruction. 

**The Situation:** I'm currently trying to set up an Aruba 7005 with two AP225 access points. I have them on their own network (not connected to the office network/outside). The controller is plugged into a managed switch. The APs are plugged into the same switch. I can see the APs when I log into the controller. 

**The Problem:** The APs will stay ""up"" for around 8-9 minutes (time varies but on average it's 8-9) and then they'll drop. The APs restart and the cycle continues.

**The Question:** What is causing this behavior? I need to keep them stable so that i can further configure them.

**Secondary Question(s):** Any good resouces/links on how to set these APs up? How do I get the blasted things to broadcast their SSIDs? I have put over a week into the buggers and I'm quite honestly at a loss. The people that would have been here to help me no longer work for the company so I'm an intern on my own trying to fulfill the orders of a CEO (he's patient, but I still have to show progress).

**Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.**"
40oshf,2,2016-01-12,"Looking for a new phone, preferably Samsung as thats what I have now, but Im open for suggestions",Eirixoto,PickAnAndroidForMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickAnAndroidForMe/comments/40oshf/looking_for_a_new_phone_preferably_samsung_as/,"Hey guys. I managed to break the screen on my phone, and as its an old model and I payed almost nothing for it, it'll be better to buy a new one. The price doesn't really matter, but it doesn't _need_ to be expensive either. 

Sorry about the english, there might be some word I use that you'd not use otherwise, so please excuse me and as if you don't know what I mean. 

So what I need would be: 

- Good quality camera: I wanna use it to take photos both to have decent quality, and for snapchat, facebook etc. 

- Lots of memory space: This is really important to me. My old phone had 4GB intern memory, and while I can have an SD card, I can't really download much, as most of it can't be saved on the SD card. Therefor I need memory space on the actual phone, tho its of course a plus to also have the opportunity to have an SD. _At least_ 16GB, but more is appreciated. Im not sure how much space apps actually take, and which ones can be transfered to a potential SD. 

- Long battery time: I'm probably gonna use the phone a lot. Playing music, playing games, taking pictures, using the internet. It should have battery to go for at least one full day. 

- It would be nice if it didn't break by looking at it. Im not careless with my phones, but I did after all manage to break the one I have now, so thats that. It would also be cool if it was kind of water resistant - not like I'm gonna dive with it or anything, but Im often using my phone in wet weather and snow etc. I live in Norway for the record. 

- Screen Size: I really don't care about how big the size would be, but I really prefer it to not be _too_ big, so the size of those ""S6+"" etc would probably be a little much. Its not very important tho. 

So... If you have any phones that you think would be good for me, feel free to suggest it ;)

Thanks for your help! :)"

40qmlp,1,2016-01-13,I feel useless. I just wanna fucking die.,dragoninjasasin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/40qmlp/i_feel_useless_i_just_wanna_fucking_die/,"1 year ago my girlfriend told me she wanted a break from our relationship. 7 months went by of her not responding to my messages. I wanted to kill myself the whole time. I almost failed all my classes by I convinced myself that if I failed then it would make our relationship harder to maintain. I barely passed my classes. My GPA is shit though. No one will hire me for an internship.

She started talking to me again which was great for a while. I really love her a lot and talking to her helps me cope with my problems.

We play League of Legends together. She gets really into the games and get really frustrated when we lose. I've started playing really badly recently which has started causing problems. She keeps getting mad at more for making mistakes that cost us games. I've dropped from 95th percentile rating to 90th and her 85th to 78th.

She keeps getting really mad at me. She says stuff like you're useless, you're retarded, and you're the reason we always lose. She nitpicks a lot of the stuff I do wrong which isn't really a big deal but it just destroys me, because I know I'm making her frustrated. I try to apologize but that just frustrates her more and I'm not sure why. I'm worried if I ask her why apologizing makes her mad it'll make her even more mad at me.

Today she got so mad at me that she told me she wanted to delete me and never talk to me again. She's told me before that when she's had enough of someone she just takes them off her friend's list and never talks to them again. I'm really scared she's going to do that to me if things keep going on like they are. I'm really scared. I don't know what to do. I think if things keep going on as they are she will leave me. I think she will be happier that way because then she won't have to deal with me anymore, but it just hurts to have someone you're so committed to want to leave you. 

I don't know. It'll probably be easier to kill myself if she leave me. I wouldn't have to deal with my life anymore that way. I honestly don't know how people deal with living. It's just so fucking painful. It's just full of dissappointment. I don't know how someone could live in the same world as me and say they are happy with their life. I don't feel like I belong with the people who are happy. They would just be better off if they didn't have to deal with me being sad. And it's getting harder and harder to pretend to not want to die when I'm talking to other people.

It's all just too hard and I'm not even doing anything that's hard. I dropped out of school because I failed all my classes last semester. I don't think I can pass them this semester. I don't see a way I can move my life from where I'm at now. I don't see how I can build up the motivation and even then it would be so painful. I don't think living is worth the pain. I can't deal with this anymore. I'm just a flawed person that can't even build up the motivation to kill myself.

Edit: Speaking of motivation, every time I build up the motivation to do something it only brings more pain. I build up the motivation to try to improve at league. I think I'm improving but I just end up losing more. I build up the motivation to try really hard at school but I just fail. There is just something wrong with me that prevents me from functioning as a normal person. Trying to force myself to live like everyone else is just too painful. Building up hope and then having it robbed from you over and over again is the worst thing in the world.

Edit2: I just feel like I'm ruining her life. She already deals with enough shit and now she has to deal with me on top of it.

Edit3: I'm really scared she's not going to want to talk to me tomorrow"
40r6k2,55,2016-01-13,I went too far with a lie and it's all about to fall apart.,liarsthrowaway,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/40r6k2/i_went_too_far_with_a_lie_and_its_all_about_to/,"

I won't bore you with details - the short of it is that I failed three engineering classes in a semester, and switched to a polisci degree which I am now absolutely loving.

&amp;nbsp;



The thing is, I've always had high expectations put on me by my parents. I always performed exceptionally well academically and so was pushed to pursue a ""challenging"" program that would get me a ""real"" job. Always been the pride of the family, the smart guy, the one who's meant to become successful, etc etc. As such, I was an absolute wreck when I failed. Never could I come clean to my parents, or anyone in the family, about how much I had failed. The utter humiliation would be unbearable. Too many people would be disappointed. 

&amp;nbsp;



So I didn't. I never told my parents. I made up lies about ""my final thermodynamics exam"" here, my ""mechanics project"" there, how I'm looking for engineering internships wherever, etc. I justified this by telling myself that once I graduate, and once they see how happy I am, they'd understand. Surely they would be reasonable about it. And so it went on and on and on, the lie getting bigger with every god damn fucking inquiry they'd make about how my studies are going. It got to the point where I was faking schedules to prove that I was still enrolled in what they thought I was.

&amp;nbsp;



The point is, a couple of months from now I'm supposed to be graduating. I'm supposed to be looking for a job, but I'm obviously not. I've tried coming clean multiple times, playing out the scenario in my head, but every time I sit down with my dad to explain what I've done, I choke. It's the same way every damn time. I'll bring up that I have something to talk about, and my dad will go ""sure thing"" in a cheery voice, and then I think about how I'm about to disappoint him in a way that I never have before. I can see how proud he is of me, and I'm going to let him down. So I postpone it again. 

&amp;nbsp;



At this point, I wouldn't even care about the failed courses. What kills me is that they're going to find out I betrayed their trust for years. I've literally been living a lie to cover up for my own fucking shortcomings. It's all going to come out and there's no way for me to stop it, and I don't have what it takes to come clean either. I'm mortified.

&amp;nbsp;



Every day I wake up with a tight feeling in my chest because I know this could all fall apart at any moment. When I contact my family, I feel like every word I say is dishonest. I haven't felt at peace for years - it's a thought that's been at the back of my head at every moment. Sometimes I secretly wish that they would find out themselves, so I wouldn't have to come out with it.

&amp;nbsp;



I'm not expecting any sympathy here. I know there's no solution other than ""just come clean"". I'm at fault here and I acknowledge that. I hoped I would feel better for writing this and putting this out there, but I don't. I truly love my parents and I hate the inevitable fact that they will be so disappointed in me. I do realize that this comes off as just some college student whining - I'm not very good at expressing just how much this is affecting me mentally. 

&amp;nbsp;



Nonetheless, thank you for reading. I truly appreciate it.

40rpha,9,2016-01-13,Gamers using games as a permanent escape?,Maybethissubreddit,GFD,https://www.reddit.com/r/GFD/comments/40rpha/gamers_using_games_as_a_permanent_escape/,"I'm wondering if someone can share some thoughts on this, i have a relative that in increased gaming for over ten years now (now 27 years old), no longer does anything outside the house apart from occasional family gatherings which usually ends with a breakdown.

Refusing therapy, refusing antidepressants, refusing any activity outside the house (such as intern work, studying etc. even if it's just one day a week).

There has been therapy before, but he has weaseled himself out of it. Which i have no idea how, as it's usually required to get social benefits. The person has expressed a desire of getting out more but often stalls/cancels when it comes down to it. People are considered bad in general, and everyone is out to get you. 

Any conversation about the subject and it's shut down. Any encouragements, solutions - shut down.
Basically anything that needs to be done is a problem, and no matter how we work towards a solution and find a solution, it ends up in tears.
Anything that is a step forward - tears.

The family has exhausted their options, many tries to help during these years, amount to nothing.

I think some of it stems from family issues, no present father has created a great hole in his life, but at one point you would think anyone ""grows up"" and starts taking life for what it is, the rest of the family has always been supportive, no matter what was going on. We've tried pushing as well as leaving the person alone completely, or just being there.

I remember watching a Chinese documentary about gaming addiction, and they have many institutions in China where they send the kids to learn how to get back to real life, where no gaming is available. And they see that they lose out on real life socializing, so they are way behind other people the same age. This is also a huge block when trying to get someone out of it.

Basically we're at a loss of what to do, it's at the point where we give up, and often this behavior seems childish rather than like a depression, a way to get other people to support you so you can stay in the state of being a child. At the same time it's part depression, we know that, it seems like half half, but you cannot push the child without pushing the depression, so you end up stuck.

I can imagine some people here have been there, or are there, and can help giving insight on what to do. Thanks."
40rtuj,5,2016-01-13,5 Tips to start up your career in a hot startup,isss111,startup,https://www.reddit.com/r/startup/comments/40rtuj/5_tips_to_start_up_your_career_in_a_hot_startup/,"**1. Have a strong online presence**
You can take advantage of social networks when hunting for a job. Check if you have a high-quality LinkedIn profile: add detailed information about your experiences and skills, choose a professional-looking photo and ask colleagues for recommendations.
Adding your LinkedIn profile and website showcasing your portfolio (if you’re a designer or developer, for instance) to every job application makes you stand out from the crowd of candidates.
Make sure you have an account in relevant websites related with the position that you applied. For example: for developers, having an account on GitHub and Stack Overflow can make you a better candidate.

**2. Keep track of startup news**
Pay attention to startup news, especially the ones about funding. If a startup recently raised some funding, it means that probably the company will be hiring in the next months. Check the company’s website and send your spontaneous application – the sooner they have your resumé, the better.
To keep track of startup news, you can subscribe to the feeds of websites like TechCrunch, VentureBeat or Business Insider.

**3. Attend startup events**
Don’t miss any startup/tech events or seminars! You should attend as many events as you can, so you can make new connections, improve your skills, be aware of new trends and products, and, of course, hear about jobs.
From pre-accelerator programs – Startup Pirates, Startup Weekend or 3 Day Startup, to name a few – to well-known conferences, such as Web Summit or TechCrunch Disrupt, use these events to connect with entrepreneurs that could have a job for you.

**4. Create your own event or volunteer at events**
We know that creating an event requires much more hard work than to be a volunteer at a startup event, so you need to think wisely here. If you have the audacity to start an event from the scratch, go for it! You will have the opportunity to create strong relations with companies, entrepreneurs, speakers and media. And if you succeed, maybe you will be invited to join a startup.
Volunteering can be less stressful and also a good opportunity to make new connections. Plus, you could add the experience in your resumé.

**5. Embrace an internship abroad**
An international internship will immediately distinguish you from others candidates competing with you in the market. Programs like AIESEC Global Entrepreneur Program will give you the chance to work abroad in a promising startup and be mentored by real entrepreneurs. Even if it doesn’t turn into a job, the internship will certainly change your world’s view professionally and culturally.

I've been looking for a replacement for the G600 I currently own. I used to use the G600's macro keys, but moving on from playing WoW at a relatively high level I am looking for a more comfortable mouse to use.

The G600's shape feels quite good in my hand, but the extra 3rd button does not offer the resistance I like so I do press it randomly quite often. Now that I have no real use for the macro keys anymore either, I can think of more comfortable materials to rest my thumb against!

My hand is about 14-15cm from the bottom of my palm to the top of my middle finger. On smaller mice I need to finger grip, but it is uncomfortable and I prefer palm gripping as most of my mouse movement is done with my arm, not my wrist. The mouse I use at my internship is a Logitech B110, and that is definitely too small.

I've been eyeing the MX Master as it seems to be quite well regarded, but it seems that the sensor used on it is not too great for gaming. I estimate to be using the mouse for 50% gaming, 50% productivity (embedded software development). Gaming wise I mainly play RPGs like Runescape and Diablo 3, if I do play any FPS games I usually grab a controller. 

The mouse does need to be compatible with OS X, Windows and Linux, but I suspect that should not be a massive issue with current age mice :)

I hope you can provide me with some solid advice, it would be much appreciated!"

I have been away for about 2 months now. I just got so busy with my internship and combining it with powerplay was to much stress for me.
Really want to get involved again with the Federation but do not want to start the powerplay grind because I am afraid it will cause another burnout for me grinding that rank 5 each week was to much for me. And everytime I did not reach rank 5 felt like I had failed. This has more to do with my own ways of viewing things in life then with FDev or Elite:Dangerous so I really want to get involved and start playing again.

Are there any player groups that are federation alligned that would want to play together?

BTW what has happend in the last 2 months, A-honcho , ANT-solo and Driggers defected to the empire?

40sftk,2,2016-01-13,Car payments are becoming too much and I'm not sure what to do,noclue111,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/40sftk/car_payments_are_becoming_too_much_and_im_not/,"First off, sorry for the long post!
I’m a 21 year old full time student. However, I have a scholarship that covers all of the cost (tuition, books, housing, ect) so I pay nothing for school. On top of that, I get between 1K-3K back each semester from the school which I put into my savings account. I have a part time job which pays 12K/yr and an unpaid internship.

During the summer of 2014, I bought a 2002 Toyota Camry with my first refund from my university. Towards the end of the summer, my mother totaled the car and the insurance company gave me what I had originally payed for it. My mother convinced me to buy a new car, saying that if I made the down payment she would pay the rest. She had bought my sister’s first car and she wanted to do the same for me. My aunt, who has great credit, cosigned the loan with me. I have never missed a payment.

But, my mom was only able to pay it a few months. I payed it for about a year, until about a few months ago when she finally took over. I had other costs to pay with the income from my job, including health insurance, food, gas and tolls (my internship is pretty far away from where I live). Because of this, I also had to dig into my savings to pay for the car.

My mom is telling me that she is going to put her tax return money towards the car. The issue is that my mom’s car is a total piece of crap (taillights don’t work, a bunch of engine issues, ect), and is on the verge of giving out on her any minute. She can’t afford to pay for any repairs. She has to take care of my little sister and get to work so she really needs a car. She also just lost one of her jobs. Because of this, I have taken over paying for my car insurance, about $200 a month.

Specifics:

2014 VW Beetle, ~ 8.5K miles (probably worth about 12K now)

Price of the car: 23K

Monthly payments: 400

Amount still owed: 8.5K Amount still owed (if my mom is able to put tax return toward car): between 3.5K – 4.5K

I can’t afford to put more money towards this car right now. Along with paying the car insurance, I’m saving up for summer housing, which is the only thing my scholarship does not cover. But I’m not sure if my mom will actually be able to continue paying it, and I’m worried about what will happen if her car stops working.

Should I sell the car? Return it to the dealer? Or just finish paying it off?

I just really have no idea what to do about the situation and was hoping someone could offer some advice.

TLDR: Bought car because my mom said she was going to pay for it. I payed it for about a year and she is paying it now. I’m afraid we cannot continue to afford it."
40skq4,23,2016-01-13,I [21 F] just found out my boyfriend [20 M] of 9 month was cheating on me the entire time and feel so lost,katekatekate2,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40skq4/i_21_f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_20_m_of_9/,"Yesterday I found out my boyfriend had been lying about our relationship the entire time and I am just looking for advice on how to move on from here. 

I started dating my ex around March and we had a very casual and fun relationship, spent lots of time together but neither of us were very needy, which was a great change from my previous relationships. After about a month or two of dating I had an internship for a month that kept us apart during the weekdays, but we still saw each other every weekend and would spend that entire time together just talking and looking at the stars and being together. Since we are in college and live in different states, I figured come the summer we would probably break up especially because he would be studying abroad the following fall semester and we would not see each other for over 7 months. However, during the last weekend of seeing each other he told me he loved me and we continued to stay together. 

During the summer we still talked everyday and I started to become friends with some of his best friends from his fraternity since we were from the same town. I even went and visited him for a long weekend and he came to visit me before he left to go abroad. We mutually agreed that we would do our own things and have an open relationship while he was abroad because mistakes happen but once he got back we would try to finally get to be together. We talked every day while he was gone, continued to say I love you and were there for each other. While he was gone I began getting closer to other members of his fraternity since I was introduced to them through our now mutually shared best friend and we all hit it off very well. I now consider most of them some of my closest friends since we all would hang out almost everyday last semester and they even joked about wanting to initiate me into their frat. Everything seemed like it was great and I was looking forward to my boyfriend coming back and being able to finally get a shot at having a real relationship. 

Once he finally got back from being abroad I could tell that things were different and that he was acting very cold and awkward in person around me but he still asked me to stay and spend the night the first night he was back. It seemed like we had two relationships, one through the phone where everything was normal and comfortable and one in person where things were awkward and forced. I finally asked him to talk about what was going on a few days later to see what he was feeling and where we stood and that's when everything crumbled. 

He told me that he had being sleeping with one of the girls from our school that was on the same trip as him and he would make out with upwards of five different people a night each time he went out. He also said he had been seeing other girls the entire time we had been together even before he went abroad when we were not in an open relationship. He told me I had never been ""his girl"" and that he when I slept over the first night he had gotten back he considered asking me to leave in the middle of the night since it was like there was a stranger in his bed. He also laughed when he told me that he would have sex with this other girl while abroad and then text me that he missed and loved me afterwards. Once he finished telling about all of his extracurricular activities, he talked about how I had been a great penpal while he was gone, but that he wouldn't answer any of my texts if I continued to keep in touch with him. I was just completely surprised by all of this and don't understand why he kept leading me on the entire time he was gone. It feels like I am losing my best friend and potentially am going to lose other friends over it because we have so many mutual friends. One of his fears was that I was becoming friends with his friends only to get closer to him, but that wasn't the case at all. Now I feel like if I continue hanging out with them people might think that I am only doing it to get back with him, but if I don't then maybe they will think I was only their friends to get close to him. I don't want to lose my friends too!

I am just still in shock and embarrassed that I fell for this and am not sure how to move on from here since I feel like the last 9 months were a huge lie. 

tl;dr: Boyfriend cheated with multiple people throughout entire relationship, started essentially dating a new girl while abroad but continued to express his love and feelings for me daily. Once he got back he told me about everything he had done and that he didn't want to be together since he was with this new girl "
40tw1f,3,2016-01-13,"Got an offer today, but I'm trying to stay local. How stupid am I for not taking it?",Waltonruler5,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/40tw1f/got_an_offer_today_but_im_trying_to_stay_local/,"So I'm a senior in college and I just decided on being an actuary less than a year ago. I've since then passed P and FM (first try each). Last semester I applied to two companies just because of the circumstance but I wasn't particularly looking yet. There's a local insurance company in my city that I wanted to work for first out of convenience but they don't start looking until closer to graduation.

The two companies I applied for both gave me interviews. One is in the city over, and I really liked the people there as I interviewed. I honestly wouldn't have any problem being one city over. The other is halfway across the country, so it was a phone interview that made it hard to get a feel for them. It's a little harder for me to think about being that far, at least right now.

Well I got an offer from the place farther away. They want me to get back to them in the next couple days. I called the closer place, and they still haven't made the final decisions yet.

Obviously, whether I take it or not will be more so my personal decision. What I am asking is, would I be working myself into a corner by not taking this position? 

Things that make me feel it will be ok: I still have an entire semester to apply around and I feel very confident in my qualifications and interviewing skills. I'll have 3 exams done by the semester's end, my GPA is 3.89 (Major is applied math), I've got plenty of programming experience including VBA, I did an internship for a company outside of actuarial work but in the interviews I did it seemed that many of the skills were transferable.

Cons:
It's a fairly good offer.
If I don't get any other positions quickly, would the lack of work hinder my job search.
Would this burn any bridge that I may need to take later

So any advice or input that people have would be very helpful"

You can read my previous posts about how I met my Daddy. This is another post about my time off from school as an intern at a law firm. Long story short, I met an older man there who became my Daddy.

&amp;nbsp;

Daddy loves to parade me around in public as his little slut. The drive-thru window has been a favorite place of his to show me off.

&amp;nbsp;

One night, Daddy took us to a fast-food chain located near the university. It was late, but this being a campus area, the place was still pretty busy and the staff is always college kids. Tonight, there's a guy working the window. Daddy pulled up to the end of the line of cars waiting to place their order and told me to start sucking his cock. I dove in hungrily, took his cock out of his pants and immediately started to work it with my watering mouth. I love feeling Daddy's cock grow hard and fill up my mouth as I twirl my tongue around it.

&amp;nbsp;

When we pulled up to the window Daddy told me to keep working his cock while keeping eye contact with the drive through guy. I did I was told and when the guy realized what was happening he gave Daddy a high five and called his friend over to watch. Had there not been a line of cars behind us I'm sure we would have stayed there until I have drained Daddy's cock of his delicious cum.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the hottest things involving the drive through happened one Saturday where Daddy strapped me to a chair with a plug in my butt and a special vibrator in my pussy. The vibrator is the kind that is in a C shape and is meant to be worn half in, and half out. The inside is suppose to hit your G-spot white the outside part stimulates your clit. If worn during sex, the cock will press the inside part harder into the G-spot for more stimulation.

&amp;nbsp;

All this works well for the most part, except the outside part on the older model didn't exactly hit my clit the right way. Thus I was never able to have a true hands free orgasm with it. The newer version, though, fitted me just right. It sits right on my clit and, as a result, I'm able to have an orgasm anywhere while wearing it. This led to many adventures, most of which without me being in control of the remote. I'm sure it'll come up if I write about some of my other adventures, but I digress.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, so I'm strapped to the chair in the shower wearing a butt plug and this vibrator. Daddy also inserted a pair of rubber Ben Wa balls inside of me to make sure the inside part of the vibrator is really pressed into my G-spot. He set the vibrations on low and commanded me not to cum. I've never been really good at not coming though. I've read stories where submissives would do this, but I just don't understand how to keep from having an orgasm given enough stimulation. It's like an automated response from my body. Daddy knows this so when he tells me not to cum, I know he's going to purposely keep me on the edge, despite me doing everything I can to cum.

&amp;nbsp;

Sure enough, the vibrator is set to low, just enough to keep me extremely aroused but not enough to send me over. Every 30 minutes or so, Daddy will come back and turn up the vibrator and edge me repeatedly until I'm begging him to let me cum. At which point he will turn it back down to low and leave me to simmer.

&amp;nbsp;

This continued for several hours until Daddy finally came to untie me from the chair. He told me that we're going to get some food but I was to remain naked with the plug, balls, and vibrator still inside. Once in the car, Daddy told me to get on my knees in the passenger seat facing him, then bend over and suck his cock while he drives. In this position my ass and pussy is on full display in the passenger window and I have no idea how many people got to see me. A few minutes into the drive, Daddy started edging me again with the vibrator while I moaned with his cock in my throat. After a while Daddy pulled into a parking lot of a big box store and said that I'm going to be driving now. I had to get out of the car and walk around to the driver side while completely naked. Luckily, it was not a busy part of the parking lot and no one drove by and saw me.

&amp;nbsp;

Following my instructions, I drove us to a fast food drive through and ordered some food. There were a couple of cars in front of us and Daddy told me that I have to make him cum on my face before we get to the window. I dove in right away and was working his cock with my lips, tongue and hands. He turned on the vibrator again and the vibrations from my moaning must have also helped. I was giving his cock everything I got and it didn't take long before Daddy came, just as the car in front of us is pulling up to the window. A lot of the cum landed in my mouth since it's kind of a reflex to open my mouth for Daddy's cum, but a lot did land on my cheeks and around my mouth.

&amp;nbsp;

Daddy told me not to wipe my face and took out a credit card and told me to pay with it. But he tossed it behind him into the back seat as I was reaching for it. We're now pulling up to the window and Daddy turned up the vibrator. The guy at the window froze when he saw me sitting there smiling at him with cum on my face trying to remain composed as the vibrator worked on my G-spot and clit. It wasn't until I said hi that he finally snapped out of it and asked me to confirm my order and the price. I realized I have to pay him now and looked over at Daddy, who simply nodded his head towards the seat behind him.

&amp;nbsp;

I knew what I had to do so I tried to remain calm and turned away from the guy in the window and bent over to stretch into the back passenger-side seat to reach for the credit card. It was pretty far and I almost had it when Daddy turned the vibrator all the way up. I couldn't handle it. After being edged all day and knowing that a stranger is staring at my plugged butt and filled pussy, I couldn't hold off the orgasm that crashed over me. I was diagonally in the car on all fours while my body convulsed repeatedly. Each pulse of my pussy also contracted my ass hole, which was made very obvious as the butt plug moved slightly in and out with every contraction.

&amp;nbsp;

I finally regained some of my senses as the orgasm slowly winded down and I fully extended my body and snatched up the card and gave it to the guy. Daddy told me to clean up my face before I get the card back, so the guy got to watch me scoop cum off of my face and into my mouth before taking the card from his hand and driving away as fast as I could.

&amp;nbsp;

We have done other stuff at the drive through window, but this was definitely the most daring and exposed occasion for me.

&amp;nbsp;

**tldr**: Naked and plugged with toys, I had and orgasm in front of the drive through guy with fresh cum on my face."

A lot of people I've talked to have encouraged me to move out, but I've been terrified of making the move. I was hoping someone could give me a good bearing of my situation as I'm woefully inexperienced as an adult.

I'm graduating this semester with a bachelor's in biomedical engineering, and while I currently have no debt, I do have plans to try to get a master's by the next year or so (this may or may not take a semester longer than intended). My scholarship had previously paid for all of the tuition, but it will not cover the subsequent semesters I would have to take to get a master's.

I have over $17k in savings. I believe my car has been paid off (by my parents). I know of at least one person I can room with (they are thinking of moving out as well and are waiting on me to make a decision) to help split the cost of renting something like an apartment. I have no idea what my budget might look like, but I know for sure that I can't survive on what's in my savings right now for any longer than maybe a few months.

I have never had a job in my life and the one internship I've had has nothing to do with my major. Job searching is looking very intimidating as I have no idea how wide I should cast my net given how little experience I have.

Am I in a bad position to move out? How can I prepare myself to make this move? Where do I even begin?"

I've had acne since 2005-ish. Took a round of minocycline in high school that seemed to get rid of it (it was mostly on my forehead). 

Now, my acne is slowly spiraling out of control. It began appearing on my cheeks and chin in 2010 again when I had an internship in Florida and also began taking birth control pills.

I recently have assumed it's hormonally associated since it sprang back once I began birth control pills. But, I've also got quite a horrible digestive system. I've been diagnosed with a motility disorder of my esophagus. So I'm thinking now it could be a food allergy, Candida overgrowth, or God knows what else.

I washed with a salicylic acid wash for years, but switched to the OCM when that wasn't working. That seemed to make a slight difference for a few months, but was a pain in the ass so I just began washing with a mild cleanser and moisturizing by leaving rose hip oil on my face overnight. Recently began washing with salicylic acid again during a raging break out of cystic acne (which I normally don't get) and now my face is dryer than the Sahara, still breaking out, itchy, splotchy, and overall in pain. Going to the dermatologist soon and don't know what to ask about or suggest--can't do any antibiotics because of the birth control and stomach issues and I refuse to take Accutane. 

ANY COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS/ADVICE/VIRTUAL HUGS ACCEPTED :)"
40u4vr,2,2016-01-13,Assessment in Java,Mahri828,java_programming,https://www.reddit.com/r/java_programming/comments/40u4vr/assessment_in_java/," I have been going through Amazon's university relations program to try and get an internship position. So far the process has been going well! However, I recently received an email notifying me of my upcoming assessment (1 week). It is strictly to be done in Java OR C++. I have intermediate skills in C#, Python, CSS3, HTML5, and a small amount of JavaScript, but I have never coded in Java or C++. Due to the similarities and knowing that C++ takes quite a bit longer to master, I have decided that of the two languages, it would be easier to prepare for an assessment in Java. 

Can anyone give me resources or suggestions to help me learn how to code in Java within the 1 week time period? I will be coding as many hours a day as I have free time, but I am concerned that I won't be able to learn enough within the necessary time frame. Any suggestions would be amazing. "

Short Backstory:
Im gonna change around some info to protect the anonymity of everyone involved. So basically June 2015 I met this girl lets call Maddie. I thought Maddie was hot as fuck so I figured I would try and get with her even though she seemed a bit out of my league I had nothing to lose considering I only knew her from a friend of a friend and she didn't go to my school. Turns out she thought I was kinda cute and we end up hooking up at a local outdoor mall type area. Fast forward about a week I start realizing I like her so I decide to ask her out. Turns out she likes me a lot and we start dating. Everything goes great for about 3 months, we spend about 4 days a week together, we are sexually active (at the time hand jobs, blowjobs, and I finger her but we talk about having sex soon). Around early to mid September I go on a road trip with a close friend. Important detail: I am a senior in high school and although we are only 5ish months apart she is only a junior. This road trip is to visit a state college that I am thinking about. While driving on the road trip I start thinking about how good my relationship is with this girl. We are both beginning to fall in love and it is exciting but I start having doubts and fears about what will happen when next fall rolls around and its time for me to head off to college. My mind starts jumping around and Im kinda scared for us I'm thinking will we do long distance? Will we have a sad break up just before college? Will we break up significantly before I have to leave just due to the stress of knowing that we have a time limit? I think about options such as going to a shitty local college for a year and then going off to the same college as Maddie but I think it could be a bad idea to do this for a girl who I have only been dating for 3 months. I go home and shower and think a lot in the shower and actually end up crying for a few minutes due to the stress and I guess sadness of the subject I keep dwelling on. I decide to text my friend lets call Joe. I say Joe ive been thinking a lot about college and I kinda wanna go to (insert local college) for a year so that I can stay near Maddie and then go to a college with her somewhere else. Joe basically talks me out of it and says something along the lines of “dude its an awful idea to base your future on some girl you have been dating for only 3 months” and I respond with something along the lines of “I think you’re probably right this whole situation is just getting to me but I can’t sacrifice my future when I could go to a much better school for all four years.” The conversation ends and fast forward to about 3 days later Maddie comes to my house to hang out. This is where our first major fight happens. She is on my phone (not snooping around just checking something) and I get an irrelevant text from Joe about school. She decides to keep scrolling up out of curiosity and eventually notices her name in the chat and starts reading closely. She basically sees everything that we were texting about and is incredibly upset that I agreed with Joe. Long story short she leaves clearly upset and ignores my texts and calls for a day. She ends up accepting my apology and within a few days all is good as new. As time starts passing we get closer and closer and we start having sleep overs pretty much every Friday and Saturday night (she would come to my house and I would come to hers because both our parents were okay with it). I meet both her parents and we talk about moving in together and sharing an apartment for college and one day getting married and starting a family and having two kids one boy and one girl. 



We start having sex all the time (with protection of course) and everything seems amazing. Then in December around the week of my Birthday (around our 5th month of dating and a few months after the last fight) I discover texts between her and an ex (lets call him Steve, they never officially dated but they were hooking up for a few weeks last spring). She has been asking him for almost a month now to meet up and talk and maybe cheat on me. He says “Are you sure you want to do this?” and she says yes. They did not have a set date yet but of course I freak out… my girlfriend who I really love and want to share a future with is going to cheat on me. I instantly confront her and she starts crying. She swears she loves me and that she was just using the “bait” of a hookup to meet up with him. She wanted to talk to him about something because she was still upset about the way he treated her (he kinda treated her like shit while they were hooking up). She promises that she will never meet up with him and that she wasn’t trying to kiss him. She says she will let me check her phone any time and she will even block her number. After about an hour I really believe she is telling the truth and so I tell her everything will be okay, I still love her, and that she doesn’t need to block his number because I trust her and it is unnecessary. There is very mild tension between us about this but it is not a huge deal and this is the end of the second fight. Fast forward a week or two to the end of December. During the Christmas break we plan a trip to North Dakota (changed the name for privacy) to visit her moms side of the family. Maddie and I share a room at her Aunts house for a week before coming back. Two days after coming back Maddie and I are hanging out at her house like we usually do (we basically see each other every day except for rare occasions and we always have sleepovers whenever their isn’t school the next day for both of us) and she seems upset. I ask her what is wrong and she tells me something has been on her mind and she really needs to tell me. She tells me that about 5 days before we left for North Dakota she met Steve at his house to talk like she had been planning back in early December. She says that when she first walked in he grabbed her and kissed her for a brief moment but she quickly pulled away. According to her they talked for about 30 minutes and she went straight to my house after his to have our usual sleepover. She did not tell me the day of and I had no clue and noticed nothing suspicious. She tells me she is incredibly sorry and it will never happen again she knows he is a jerk and she doesn’t need to meet with him anymore all her questions about them together are answered. Of course I am heartbroken to the point of almost being hysterical. I was somewhat speechless and was shaky and on the verge of crying. I consider this cheating because I wasn’t sure whether she wanted him to kiss her or not. I thought it could be possible that she lied and they kissed the whole time or who knows what. I know they didn’t do anything sexual because I read all their texts since we were dating (about 60) and one of the most recent ones was I wish you would’ve done something with me I’m so hard right now.  (they rarely texted while we were dating only occasional small talk and the two times I caught her. I know she didn’t delete any texts because all the time stamps made sense and she swore she didn’t) I decide to leave for the night and cry my eyes out the whole drive home. I tell her I need to see her the next day to talk. She says she is so sorry she will never do it again and she really regrets it. She says I can check her phone and she will sign into her iMessage on my computer so I can have a copy of all her texts if I promise to only read her texts with him. A few days later (we see each other every day and have a two sleepovers during the weekend because I cant be away from her and I really love her) she is acting weird and I suspect she is texting him again. I see texts between them but she swears it is nothing bad and refuses to show me her phone or to sign into iMessage on my computer. She changes her computer and phone password and is really secretive. I am very upset because I think everything is over and I really really wanted to share my life with her and she seemed to reciprocate completely up until this week. Fast forward another two days and were still talking and hanging out and having sleepovers and having sex (basically business as usual) despite how upset I am. We discuss me going to college and she says that it sometimes upsets her and she starts crying and saying how scared she is for me to leave and I promise I will never cheat on her and that we will make long distance work (I already know where I will be going to college its about 20 hours drive or 2.5 hour flight from where we live now). I feel better after seeing her upset because I feel that it confirms all of Maddies claims about loving me. Then a few days later she claims she is at a friends house. In a moment of weakness I decide to drive 15 minutes to the friends house because the circumstances seem sketchy and I think she may be with Steve again. I arrive and she is not there so I call her and she claims she is at another friends house. I do not know where this friend leaves so I go home and she says she will meet me at my house in an hour. We meet up and I cry again but she seems to not care and seems like she is starting to get sick of my crying and me being upset. She swears she was not with Steve but I notice on Safari on her phone that she has an address typed in and I ask what it is and she says it was her friend who typed it in for something else. I realize the address is in the same neighborhood as Steve and I basically assume she was with him and can only hope they didn’t kiss and that they were just talking again. Moving on to today, I think she saw him for about an hour today and at this point I honestly don’t know what to do. I am 90% certain she has seen him two or three times since she told me he kissed her but I don’t know whether or not they have kissed since then. She swears she doesn’t like him at all anymore and even swears she kinda hates him and denies having seen him since before we left for North Dakota. I honestly don’t know what to think and have been really upset lately. On one hand I really truly believe deep down that she loves me because she is always affectionate (to this day even through the fights we still hang out every day, sleep over, and have sex because we both admit that we cant be without each other) but on the other hand I am almost certain that she has been hanging out with Steve and maybe cheating on me which I just cant settle for. At this point I don’t know what to do but a lot of options have been running through my head. Should I confront her about it and tell her I know that she has been with him no matter what she tells me? Should I break up with her? Should I talk to the guy? Should I keep dating her (and fucking her of course) until its time to go to college and then break it off with her? I feel so lost right now and my heart doesn’t know what it wants. I do love her but I cant date someone who cheats on me but I cant bear to be alone again because I am kind of clingy and really need a partner in my life. I think the best option might be to keep dating her until its time to go to college. If she still hangs out with him at least I wont be lonely and I will still be able to have sex with her and I can probably cheat on her meanwhile too if she is doing it to me. If she isn’t hanging out with him anymore then  I can continue dating her for real and I will learn to look past this bump. Oh by the way she plans on following me to the college I am going to but is a year behind. Last week (a few days after she admitted that he kissed her) she asked me to take a gap year for her. For those of you who don’t know it means taking a year off from college and working / doing an internship so that she can go to college with me and we can share an apartment. My mind is all over the place lately and my heart is confused and my dick just wants sex. I am scared that I will take the gap year and she will dump me half  way through leaving me stranded until I go to college. Another thing that has been worrying me is that we will date in college share an apartment and then eventually break up in college leaving me with nothing.  I don’t know what to do and I think I need someone elses point of view on this. I haven’t told any of my friends or anyone I know personally for that matter. I already feel better getting this off my chest but I really don’t want to cheat on her or anything like that if I could pick any option I would want her to stop seeing him, admit everything to me, promise her heart to me, and show affection and loyalty and then maybe I would be willing to take the gap year or if not maybe we could handle long distance until she comes to college with me. Guys please help me sort things out and decide what to do because I cant really handle this on my own. I really do love this girl but it just isn’t right for me to date someone who cheats on me even if she loves me back (which I think she does). Help me decide what to do :/

tldr; love of my life is cheating on me WTF do I do?? (please read though details are really critical in this case) "

I am finishing up my MSW in May and am seeing a possible opportunity to get my foot in the door to be hired at my current internship. 

I'm going to try to explain this as clearly as possible: 

My supervisor is a clinical social worker in a behavioral health setting at a hospital. She splits her time, working 20 hours in one building, and 20 hours in a second location - both under the same company. She is actively trying to get her boss to move her to be full time in one location. This would mean there would be a part-time clinical SW position at one of the locations up for grabs. 

I'm aware that there is probably a long list of applicants waiting for that spot, but I was thinking about talking to my supervisor about what I could do to ""weasel"" my way in. The company is one of the best to work for in my state and it would be a WONDERFUL opportunity for me to begin my career here. 

Would it be appropriate to speak with my supervisor about this? I am planning on offering an In-Service to the staff and directors of the building to try and impress them and show them I'm competent. I also run all of her children's groups, have a group of my own, as well as an individual client. I'm not sure if there are other tips or ideas that can make the directors WANT to hire me over other potential candidates. 

I hope this makes sense. Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you."

The office is very small which makes everyone very social. I'm a quiet person which makes it harder to join in but even when I do I get this feeling of ""who said you can speak?"" But I do try!



Recently a position opened up in November and I asked to be considered which they did and gave me an interview. Although they seemed excited that I asked, I feel like it was a pity interview. I interviewed December 17th, the interview lasted for 15 minutes, didn't ask me any question but just described the position. Also the boss didn't even know I graduated which means she didn't look at my resume. During the interview they said ""They just started their interview process and would have 2nd interview when the head of marketing comes to town."" I ask when 2nd interview would be and they said the end of January. 



 
Currently I have this feeling in my gut that I'm not going to get the position. After the interview, they have stopped giving me work and I am the last intern that they include. For example, Monday they asked another intern to sit in during team meeting and take notes. The whole office sat down at a table only a few feet away from me and I wasn't included. I took that as a deliberate way to say "" Hey you are not part of the team."" Although they are nice to my face, I just have a feeling in my gut I'm wasting my time. 



My question is should stay and maybe my gut is wrong, i'm over thinking things and I got the position?! Or should I listen to my gut and leave?"

First time posting here, but I have a problem that I tried solving on my own, but it seems impossible. English isn't my first language so i apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes :)


So,


This problem started off 3 weeks ago, I went to an amusement park with the family to have some family time together and we generally had a good time.


After about 3 and a half hours, we (of course) got very hungry, so we decided to go eat at a restaurant located IN the amusement park.


We sat down at the table and a waitress quickly made her way to our table. So, she arrives at our table and welcomes us to the restaurant and asks for our orders.

 I quickly glance at her, and THIS is where it goes downhill in my brain.

Let me give some physical description of this angel; She was about 5'4'' tall. Very toned body. Brunette with green eyes, and looked about 17 or 18 years old MAX.


I couldn't take my eyes off her, and I think my dad realized this because he looked at me and giggled a bit.


Anyways, I told myself that it's just another attractive girl, nothing special. Right... We were eating and I really couldn't concentrate on the food I was eating. 

There were many things going on in my head, it's like a tornado hits a library and there are pages flying everywhere...
I check on the other tables that she is helping and Im completely blown away. I think this is partly because I haven't felt anything like this before. 

So, as the title reads, I am 17 years old and in highschool. We obviously do have attractive girls but those attractive girls are attractive in the way that you fantasize about sexual stuff with them...


I found this waitress EXTREMELY attractive, but I didn't/couldn't think of anything sexual of her, almost as if it's a perfect souvenir that I wouldn't want to ruin...


All I could think of was us just being together and despite the snow outside and our table being close to the entrance where the door was open, this made me very warm and fuzzy. Just writing this right now makes me warm and sleepy...


Anyways, I went to talk to the waitress (I know, very desperate of me, I am sorry :/) I wanted to start the conversation in some way so I figured I should just ask something random like for example what time they open and close etc.


As I approached her I saw that she was taking off her apron and as probably ready to leave as her shift ended. This was just perfect. I asked her about their schedules, and while she was answering she took off her hair tie and this mass of beautiful hair fell down.


I know understood that this chance could not go to waste so I asked her name and number etc.
Im not going to say her real name so let's call her Sarah.
She told me that she couldn't give her number to customers as company policy or something and told me that her shift was just ending and she had to go.

 I asked her if we could chat outside and she said yes.
So, we're outside the restaurant and we start walking to the parking lot, which is like 15 mins away. So I tell her that the reason I approached her was because I found her cute and if she would like to hang out sometime.


She hears this and giggles. She tells me that she can't promise anything but asks me about my age etc. And I ask the same thing. Boom. Turns out she is 18 years old. Perfect age!
So I ask if she has a boyfriend and to my surprise she says no, because she isn't looking for one. 

This lowkey hurts me inside but I figure it's not that big of a problem, my goal is to get to hang out with her.
So on our way we talk about everything possible and Im falling in love with her every second that passes. 

I have never felt anything like this before.


We're getting pretty close to the parking lot now and as I was gonna ask her for her number, her phone rings. Apparently something had happened and she had to hurry home or something, she looks at me, smiles and tells me that she really needs to hurry home but that I should come to the restaurant the next day.


So, I go back to the restaurant to meet a very angry mother asking where I had been, haha. I told her I had to grab something from the car and we go explore the park for about an hour more until we go home.


So we arrive at our house and I'm extremely excited about what happened that day. I go to my room and just lay on my bed, thinking about her gorgeous face. I eventually fall asleep and wake up the next day.


The next day, 14:10, i decide to go to the amusement park. I go to the restaurant and go to the counter. I ask for a girl named Sarah and the guy tells me that he doesn't know the other employees names that well and calls for another person. I ask that person if they know where Sarah is and he tells me she is sick today.


I get kinda dissapointed and go home. Im not even sure what her work schedule looks like, but it seems she works tuesdays and wednesdays atleast. 

I go home and the day is pretty normal.


The next day, which is Thursday, i go to the restaurant and ask for her again, but she isn't there. I figure I should ask about her work schedule but the guy tells me that only the manager knows that and he had just left...


Everything is going wrong in my head now. I go home and decide to ignore it.


The next day, Friday, I go back and Im thinking to myself that Im crazy for going this far for a girl I barely even know. I question whether I should go home and ignore this girl or to go see if she is in the restaurant. 

I wanted to go home and just forget all this but something told me that I should go to the restaurant.


I arrive at the restaurant and ask about her, this time the manager was there. He tells me that she was an intern and she doesn't work there anymore... I lowkey panic inside, and I decide to ask if he knows where she works now etc. (I know this is very creepy of me, to stalk someone like this but I couldn't control myself) The manager didn't know... 

He had her phone number and gave it to me to call her, he asked if I was family or such and i just said I was a distant friend.
So I call her as Im on my way home, but no answer. The number is not in use anymore.


I go home and give up on all of this. I get very sad that I missed such a chance and feel bad... I decide I shouldn't worry anymore as there are plenty of fish in the sea and that maybe It wasn't that special after all...


Yeah, right...


So, fast forward a week, im out with my friends and were having a good time, and all of a sudden the image of her appears in my head and I get kind of sad. I didn't want to talk about this matter with my friends at that time as they were having a good time and I didn't want to ruin the mood.


We're about to go home and my friend, let's call him Mike, asks me why I look like as if my puppy died or something. I decide to tell him what had happened, and he hugs me and tells me to just forget it, that there are tons of attractive chicks at our school. 

I had thought the same thing, and I know most of the girls at my school, but none of them have ever had that effect on me.


So, I tried forgetting it, but the more I tried to forget it the stronger the effect got. 

Or atleast, so it felt. 

I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to ask my family about this because they ALWAYS answer with the same thing 

''Just chill, it goes over, it's just a phase''... 

I want an ACTUAL answer because Im truly lost...

It feels like the second I find the meaning of life, it get's taken away from me...

So now, 3 weeks later, here I am... Writing this depressing story of impossible love... 

I have tried everything humanly possible to forget her but she is like an irremovable tattoo in my brain...


Please, reddit. Help me find myself again... Why do I have such feelings for her? What is this? Why can't I get over it? Im 18 in 2 months, Im very soon an adult, why is my brain acting like a 4 year old?... 

Please help me.


**tl;dr;** Went to restaurant with family, saw an attractive waitress, fell in love and approached her to talk to her but failed getting her number. She moved places and now the number is not in use and im sad that I will never get to meet her again hence the name ''impossible love''...**"
40v1ix,455,2016-01-13,What is it With Hams and Awful Lawsuits? Lady Lardum at a Legal Advice Center.,HopefulMiniPeep,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/40v1ix/what_is_it_with_hams_and_awful_lawsuits_lady/,"You guys like Peep right?


Well, I'm a shitty diet version low in calories and lawyering skill. Also, I don't have my own desk to fuck people on.  


I am a glorified assistant at a center that offers free legal advice to people under 25. I sit up front and get yelled at because our three actual lawyers are only there 5 hours a week each and our law interns are very busy. 


Case facts:


&gt;&gt;I'm an 18-year-old girl.


&gt;&gt;Legal Center is giving me a 5 grand scholarship for Law school.


&gt;&gt;I couldn't quit even if I wanted to. 


&gt;&gt;We get a lot of stupid people.


&gt;&gt;This happened a few hours ago, I'm typing while still at work.


Today's hamplanet, who I shall name Lady Lardum because Latin. Was a senior in high school wanting to sue their school for DISCRIMINASUN!

Now Lady Lardum burst into the reception and immediately flopped onto one of our couches. Poor thing, the couch I mean. 


Then she started making these choking sounds, much like a cat coughing up a furball. I assumed she was just out of breath from the five small steps to our center. Then she started waving her hand and clicking her fingers and I realized she was trying, rather obnoxiously, to get my attention.



I asked her what she needed and she told me she was here to speak to a real lawyer. 



&gt;&gt;Sidenote: The Lawyers ask me about people being rude to junior staff if you are they will not help you. 



Today is not a day we have any real lawyers if she had an appointment she would know this. I told her she's welcome to explain her case to me and I'll book an appointment for next week. (Volunteer lawyers, lots of cases) 


Lady Lardum is not impressed, you guys know what she did next. *Sigh* Asked for my manager. We are a small advice center that has just come back from holiday break. The most senior volunteer is a 3L student. Just my luck he started a meeting just before Lady Lardum came in. 


Don't panic, I do this every day. I put on my big girl pants and my I'm already dead inside smile and I told her my boss is in a meeting. Quickly followed by ""I'd be happy to get you some snacks or a beverage.""


This seemed to pique her interest as she asked what kind of snacks we had. I offered to get some cookies out and as soon as I opened them in front of her 4 were snatched away. I quickly retreated to the safety of the front desk before my hand got eaten.  


About five minutes later the guy in charge was still in a meeting and Lady Lardum was making those cat noises again. I go over to see what she wants and of course, she wants more food. I go find a bag of chips for her to inhale, which she does while asking me to make here a tea with four sugars and milk. 


When I brought out the tea and she claimed the mug was too small and says I have to make her another tea, which I did because I have no authority to kick her out. She asked for one more bag of chips just before my boss came out. 


He said goodbye to his last appointment and then pulls me into his office to ask who the landwhale is.^(word for word I swear) 


I explained she won't talk to me and he decided since we were pretty dead he'd deal with her and sent me on a few errands. 


When I got back he updated me that Lady Lardum wanted to sue her school for size discrimination because the chairs in all her classes were too small and it was affecting her education. When he told her the best she could do was ask the school for a larger chair she got very angry and said a special chair would make her feel singled out. She left in tears."
40v7an,1,2016-01-13,Am I right to be pissed off at my [22m] soon-to-be-former boss?,Doctah27,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40v7an/am_i_right_to_be_pissed_off_at_my_22m/,"This may just read like venting, which I guess it is:

I graduated from college last May and spent the summer working a crappy job while looking for something more in line with my career interest: public radio. I managed to swing a great internship (unpaid but with a small stipend) with one of my favorite shows. I was thrilled, and even though the lack of pay would be difficult, my grandparents live in the show's city and offered to put me up rent-free for the few months of the internship. 

I loved the gig. I put in a lot of full days, often getting home late at night. The long hours, combined with the dwindling bank account made it a tough few months, but I thought if I worked my ass off I might get a job offer.

About two months into the internship, my boss comes by my desk and asks, ""Hey Doctah27, what're you doing after the internship is over?"" 

""No plans yet,"" I responded. 

""Good,"" she said, ""don't make any plans. I want you to stick around for a little while. I'll pay you."" 

I was over the moon. I told my family, girlfriend, and friends, all of whom knew how much I loved the show. I shelved my applications for other jobs, some of which I'd been pretty excited about, and passed on the opportunity to apply for grad school, thinking it couldn't get much better than this job. 

That was in mid-October. The internship was supposed to be over in the beginning of December. Around Thanksgiving, I asked my boss if she knew when the job would officially start. 

""Hmm... How about after New Years?"" she said. 

I was bummed that I would have to go a couple of weeks longer than I'd expected without getting paid, but I was so thrilled to even have the job that I agreed. 

After New Years, she stopped by my desk and said, ""Hey Doctah27, I forgot to file your employment forms before the break, so you'll start getting paid next week."" I was even more bummed this time, but still just happy to be employed so I agreed. 

Then, today, I got a big shock. Our show host (my boss' boss, basically) was out of town, so we were all conference-calling her. The new intern had just started, so my boss introduced him over the phone. Then she said, ""But Doctah27 will be sticking around for the month too!"" 

My heart sank. The month?? I caught up with her after the call to clarify and she said that I was only in the company system until February. I had known it wasn't a permanent gig, but I thought it would be a couple months and I would get due warning when the end was nearing. I didn't expect to have the news dropped on me in a room full of people in such an off-hand way, as if I already knew. 

My girlfriend is livid on my behalf, but I'm not exactly sure how upset to be about this whole thing. On the one hand, I'm so happy that they gave me the opportunity to join the team for a few months, learn from them, and contribute to the show. On the other hand, I do feel taken advantage of. I went unpaid for several weeks longer than I'd originally budgeted for, and I passed up three months' worth of job-searching that I would've taken full advantage of had I not thought my employment was a bit more generous than three weeks. In retrospect, I feel like an idiot for not checking immediately to see how long I would be around for. I guess I just figured she would tell me her plan. 

I know I basically just have to grin and bear it for the next few weeks, both for the pay and for the good recommendation. But I want to know how right I am to be pissed about this whole thing. I liked my boss up until now. Now I'm not so sure... Am I overreacting to something typical? This is my first experience in a pseudo-white-collar office, by the way.



   
**tl;dr**: After a three month internship, I was under the impression I had been hired. I found out today that my ""job"" is only going to last three weeks. Am I wrong to be pissed at my boss?"
40v7ss,13,2016-01-13,Me [16M] with my dad[?M]. He cheated on my boss (update),wtfdadwtf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/40v7ss/me_16m_with_my_dadm_he_cheated_on_my_boss_update/,"I went to sleep really confused last night and i guess my dad came home while I was asleep. When I woke up uncle mike and uncle al (also not a real uncle) were at home and dad's car was still home but he was in his room. 

Uncle Al &amp; Uncle Mike brought gas station breakfast tacos and we ate and I told Uncle Mike what happened. Uncle Al explained my dad never really grieved for my mom and he was just depressed right now but that everything would be okay. Uncle Mike is married so he had to go home but Uncle Al lives alone so he said he was staying for the next couple of days to help out around the house. 

Uncle Al said he'd take me to school and on my way to school, I asked him why my mom hated Ms. Wolfe and if my dad hated her. 

Apparently: Ms. Wolfe and my dad grew up together and used to be best friends and even lived a few streets away from each other. She had always liked my dad but he never asked her out until high school. Then they broke up, and Ms. Wolfe started dating Uncle Mike for a couple of weeks but they broke up pretty quickly. My dad dated my mom. 

My dad and mom broke up (that was weird to type) and dad and ms. wolfe started dating and she had to go out of town for the summer and Uncle Al had a party. My mom and dad kissed and Ms. Wolfe found out and broke up with my dad and stopped being friends with my mom. They graduated and Ms. Wolfe lived with Uncle Al &amp; Uncle Mike for college in a shitty apartment the first 2 years of college until my dad married my mom when she was pregnant with me. Ms Wolfe transferred schools and moved out of the apartment to (city 2 hours away). 

Uncle Al says my dad doesn't hate her.  He promised to show me pictures of my mom and dad when they were in middle school and high school when i got home and he talked to me about my mom and what she was like. 

I started crying and so we stopped in a walmart parking lot. I don't know why i was crying but talking about my mom really hurt because she didn't like me a lot. My dad would always be the one to take care of me and hang out with me but mom yelled a lot and hit me a lot and i know she did a lot of drugs because that's how she died. But my dad cheated on ms. wolfe so now i know my dad isn't a 100% a good guy and it's weird to think he had a life and girls who liked him and had drama and stuff. 

I ended up being late to my first class which is spanish, so i don't really care. I went to the internship and Ms. Wolfe was there as always. She said she was happy to run into me and asked if Uncle Mike was related to me.

I told her that he was a friend of my dad and she nodded. I don't think she knows who my dad is because she didn't seem awkward or anything. She had a meeting today so I was alone in the office instead of working in the lab so i just listened to music on my phone. 

I went home and my dad was in the kitchen. He sat me down and apologized saying he shouldn't have told me everything and he shouldn't have cried and questioned me. We talked a lot and I asked him about my mom so we talked about her for a bit. Uncle Al stopped by with photos and we looked through them together. 

My dad explained how he made mistakes and was young and dumb and that sometimes things are complicated and i should learn the ""easy way"" from others and not the hard way (by making those mistake myself). My mom wasn't perfect but she did love me. He said she had bipolar disordor and that he's sure she loved me.

so i guess that's it. dad seems okay now and uncle al is still around. I won't tell Ms. Wolfe who my dad is yet or mention anything to her. I wouldn't want her to not like me because of my dad. 

I know a lot more about my mom now, and i still think my dad is a good dad. 

   
**tl;dr**: My dad had a lot of drama.

I feel like Bernie actually understands what it means to work hard, to be passionate, to use genius and empathy to achieve positive outcomes for people who hardly ever have a voice.

I believe that Obama *empathized* with those of us who haven't grown up in comfortable lives, but I definitely feel that Bernie *lived* that and to some extent still lives it today.  Can you imagine any other candidate for 2016 flying coach?  Not just as a political photo op as we'll inevitably see one or more of them do.  But as a matter of course for his entire political career.

The only person I can think of who is a man *of the people* is Joe Biden (which makes it no surprise he all but endorsed Bernie recently), who rode the train to DC with all the other normal people.

Malcolm: [furious] You know what? I'm glad. This is appropriate! Now my life looks exactly how I feel! How could you screw me over like that?!

Lois: Because you were going to take that job, and we are not going to let you throw your life away!

Malcolm: How is being rich throwing my life away?!

Lois: Because it's not the life you're supposed to have! The life you're supposed to have is you go to Harvard, and you earn every fellowship and internship they have! You graduate first in your class and you start working in public service- either district attorney or running some foundation- and then you become Governor of a mid-size state and then you become President.

Malcolm: What?!

Lois: Of the United States.

Malcolm: Dad...!

Hal: I'm sorry, son. It's true. [Malcolm looks at his brothers, who all nod in agreement]

Francis: Thought you knew.

Hal: Our expectations started out much smaller, but you just kept upping the ante.

Malcolm: What if I don't want to be President?!

Lois: It's too late for that, you're gonna do it!

Malcolm: [sarcastic] Really?! Have you decided my position of capital gains tax cuts?! What are my foreign policy objectives?!

Lois: That doesn't matter. What does matters is that you will be the only person in that position who will ever give a crap about people like us! We've been getting the short end of the stick for thousands of years and I, for one, am sick of it! Now you are going to be President, mister, and that's the end of it!

Malcolm: Did it ever occur to you that I could have taken this job, gotten really rich and bought my way into being President?!

Lois: Of course it did. We decided against it.

Malcolm: WHAT?!

Lois: Because then you wouldn't be a good President. You wouldn't have suffered enough.

Malcolm: I've been suffering all my life!

Lois: I'm sorry, but it's not enough. You know what it's like to be poor and you know what it's like to work hard. Now you're going to learn what it's like to sweep floors and bust your ass and accomplish twice as much as all the kids around you. And it won't mean anything because they will still look down on you, and you will want so much for them to like you and they just won't. And that'll break your heart, and that'll make your heart bigger and open your eyes, and finally you will realize that there's more to life than proving you're the smartest person in the world! I'm sorry, Malcolm, but you don't get the easy path. You don't get to just have fun and be rich and live the life of luxury.

Hal: That's Dewey.

Dewey: [gleeful] Really?

Malcolm: This is unbelievable! You actually expect me to become President?! No, no, I'm sorry- you expect me to be one of the greatest Presidents in the history of the United States!

Lois: You look me in the eye and tell me you can't do it.

40vi7o,1,2016-01-13,A Detailed Analysis of the Evolution of an Undergraduate Student Resume,rezi_io,collegejobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegejobs/comments/40vi7o/a_detailed_analysis_of_the_evolution_of_an/,"###A Detailed Analysis of the Evolution of an Undergraduate Student Resume


I thought I would take some time to reflect on my career path this fall Sunday, and more importantly, countless mistakes I had made with my resume.
This morning I found a file of old resumes as I was cleaning my hard drive. In fact, I was able to locate one from each year of college.


Let’s profile the progression of an undergraduate student resume to help you benchmark your current resume. Use this analysis of past resumes to identify best practices, learn when to seek help, and what mistakes to avoid.


###Freshmen Year^r^r^r^r

A lack of professional experience coupled with insufficient knowledge of resume mechanics will make it difficult to position yourself as a competitive candidate, especially for those who are seeking their first internship.


Freshmen don’t have time to worry about effective resume preparation, let alone educate themselves on tedious resume details. I was not an exception. Rather then grouping sections by experience, I chose to organize sections by competencies and use examples from various self-directed projects and organizations to support the claim. This approach resulted in some weird resume/cover letter hybrid:

[Freshman Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y11.png)
##Resume Elements include

• Objective

• Skills summary

• Skills and Experience

• Computer Skills

• Education and Training


Luckily, as an undergraduate, you’ll have many university provided resources at your disposal. I suggest reaching out to your university’s career advising center…but heed my warning, those guys are busy; really, really busy. If I remember correctly, they suggested I highlight any time I learned or used a technical skill.


###Sophomoreo Year^r^r^r^r

While freshman year should be spent integrating yourself into student organizations, exploring academic opportunities and developing technical skills (I suggest you take advantage of free university-provided software training classes. These courses will help develop a foundational technical understanding and can be included on your resume). Sophomore year is a time where the ambitious gain an advantage by applying to competitive internships or research positions. A proper resume is paramount to landing such a position…


Fall semester of my sophomore year I started an e-commerce business and was faced with a dilemma…how does this new experience fit into my existing resume? The answer: It didn’t. The resume of freshmen year had to go.


This iteration of my resume focused on proper formatting mechanics (poorly) more so than the content:

[Sophomore Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y2_Page_1.png)


##Resume Elements include:

• Objective shortened

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections. Organized by themes of freshmen achievements

• Introduced bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

If you’ve developed great experience but have little knowledge of formatting,  take a look at the [Rezi BETA Resume Template.](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) Let our knowledge of resume mechanics take care of the dirty work while your experience does the talking.

###Junior Year^r^r^r^r

Career fairs, mock interviews, networking…junior year should be your busiest yet. Hopefully by now, you are well emerged in student organizations and maybe your persistent dedication has landed you a leadership position (LPT: that’s the goal of student organizations).

Your chosen career path should be more clearly defined. Now that you’re past the halfway point, you should really think about want you want to do post-graduation. The summer following your junior year will be the launching pad of your career. Aim to use this period to excel in a position related to your vocational goals.

Keep in mind these positions are even more competitive. Your resume must be on point, master the tedious mechanics if you want to see results. Luckily, my roommate was a resume reviewer for the university business school. Here is the resume we created together:

[Junior Year Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y3.png
)
##Resume Elements include:

• Objective deleted

• Education highlighted

• Defined experience sections organized by accomplishments

• Introduced well thought out and actionable bullet points

• Skills section in list form to increased ATS readability

• Font &amp; typeface selection

In this iteration I focused on quantifying accomplishments and making sure my experience descriptors contained critical elements. I also made a major shift in the format. This is the resume was used to land my first “competitive” internship

If you are behind in your resume at this point check out the [Rezi Complete Resume](https://rezi.io/). It’s a safe bet.


###Senior Year^r^r^r^r

Senior year was essentially building on the experience I developed during the previous years and tailoring my resume to reflect this. It was around this time that I first heard about Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS. The first version was used to land my second “competitive” internship. The second semester version of this resume is my first attempt at optimizing it to pass ATS.  Let’s take a look:

[Senior Year 1st Semester Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y4.1.png)

##This is the final resume:

[Senior Year 2nd Semester Resume](https://rezi.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Y4.21.png
)

Your resume may take a similar path of continued improvement but we suggest you skip right to the punch. Take advantage of years of development and check out the Rezi BETA Resume Template.  From the students Rezi has talked with, a commonality that we are seeing with student resumes is they do a pretty poor job of pulling key skills out from education. 

Many students don't have relevant work experience to highlight those skill sets. The goal of the [Rezi BETA Resume Template](https://rezi.io/optimized-resume-template/) is twofold, to show the employer that the student has learned the skills they need to be a successful employee, and simultaneously increase employer knowledge on educational programs to increase the perceived relevance and value of education.

40vu8w,6,2016-01-13,I became Christian because of my fears and am now in need to God's healing power,thisdfcn,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/40vu8w/i_became_christian_because_of_my_fears_and_am_now/,"I will word this the best I can, but I'm sure that it will sound pretty absurd regardless. Nevertheless, everything I am saying about me is true and have been exaggerated. Please, just hear me out as this is a serious and debilitating issue for me.

I am posting on a throwaway account as my peers know my real Reddit username (I am very active on Reddit) and I just don't want this to be associated with me.

***

I am sixteen, and have been Christian for nearly a year now, and the reason I became Christian is odd at best. Around this time last year, I started binge reading horror stories from /r/nosleep. At first I found them amusing despite having a tendency to be overly afraid and worrisome. Then I came across a series of stories that involved ""rituals"", games with the paranormal that you can partake in where the consequence of losing is death. Some of the so called rituals were as easy as calling or texting to a phone number (which *was* provided). At the same time, I also came across another story that depicts someone who finds that the human race was created by extraterritorial beings as living experiments. He learns this by being captured, and having tests run on his mind to test the mental characteristics of his species. This story also claims that God does exist, and that he created that extraterrestrial species which intern created us. 

For some reason (which I am still not sure of), these stories *terrified* me. To the point that I thought for a *few months* that the same things will happen to me and that I would die horribly and alone. For those who don't know how /r/nosleep works, all the stories are in first person, and no one is allowed to doubt any story is fake (the author must stay in character while within the thread). The stories that I have read seemed so real that they genuinely had me terrified (not just scared or spooked, but literally afraid for my life). 

Some time later, after the fear had tore at my emotions for quite a while, I started praying to God. I had been an atheist (I even dare say an ""anti-theist""), but for some unknown reason started praying to a God that (at the time) I wasn't even sure existed, and surprisingly it comforted me. Some time later, I had a dream that was relating to God and after I woke up, I couldn't stop suspecting that God is real and eventually made the decision to become Christian. This helped me quite a lot, as I was no longer afraid of those ridiculous stories. I found comfort in the fact that there is a God that cares for me and have since become quite devout in my faith. 

Now here is the part that I need help with. I was recently accepted into a very demanding academic program and in the midst of the pressure it has been exerting on me I have noticed that my old fears have started to bother me again. Namely the latter story (about the extraterrestrial thing), which has me wondering that if God had created another species, and it *is* true that they then created us, would God still care about *us* or would we all just be sent to hell or have no afterlife at all? I know it doesn't make sense, but it's honestly what I am wondering right now and has been causing me a lot of stress. It's a horrible feeling and have even caused me to begin to doubt God's existence. 

I am in need of healing, of purification to remove these fears once again, something I feel that only a true God can deliver. I have prayed about this, but nothing seems to be changing. 

If you are still reading and have not shrugged this off as a troll post, thank you. For now, I just want to ask for some advice in how to deal with this (quite frankly) very weird and childish fear of mine that has actually been affecting my emotional health. Maybe you've gone through something similar? If so, please share them if you are comfortable. Finally, if anyone would like to offer a prayer, please do as I would truly appreciate it."
40waxv,70,2016-01-14,"Stockings, high heels, and (f)ullfilling one of my hubbys fantasies (ffm)",sexiikat,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/40waxv/stockings_high_heels_and_fullfilling_one_of_my/,"Before my Chris and I were married, we both found out how sexual each other was. While we were dating we would tell each other our fantasies and do our best to fulfill them. One fantasy we both had was seeing each other have sex with another person. I was hesitant to share my lover at the time, but once we became married I opened up to the idea more, and craved having another man myself. After a few threesomes and separate encounters with other people, Chris and I found our sex life to become more and more electrified.

Which brings us to another fantasy. My husband had always wanted to have sex with one of his coworkers. Although he tried and tried none of his female coworkers ever wanted to be more than friends.

Luckily, two years ago at my place of work we had a very stunning intern named Nicki who wasn't shy about her sexuality with me. Nicki was a junior in college at the time who told me one weekend about how crazy her 21st birthday was. Nicki was a very good looking woman, She had long blonde hair, 34 D cup breasts, a toned six pack of abs and butt you can only get from squats. I was envious of the shape she was in, but it was clear how she attracted so many guys.

I invited Nicki out to drinks later that week after she had told me about her birthday and asked if she was okay with my husband coming along. She agreed saying she was excited to see meet him.

On Friday of that week Nicki and I planned on getting picked up from work from Chris and heading straight to dinner and then the bars. Since my husband knew the plan he got himself together in a nice shirt with a sport coat and some matching pants. Chris made sure he was clean shaven and put on my favorite cologne of his.

Since I was coming from work I had on a light blue button down blouse, with a black pencil skirt and some tan heels. Underneath though I decided to surprise my husband. After he left for work in the morning I snuck back into my room and put on a pair of black stockings, with a black garter belt to match my lacy black thong. I wore my matching bra and headed of to work feeling sexy. 

As soon as I showed up Nicki greeted me telling me how excited she was to get drinks later and I could see the excitement through her shirt. Nicki had on a red blouse with a tight white skirt. You could see her erect nipples through the sheer fabric of her blouse, and when she turned around her skirt hugged to her ass skin tight. I was even getting a little turned on.

After a miserable day at the office I was more than ready to go out and attempt to give my husband the threesome he longed for.

Chris picked us up from our office around 5:30 and drove into town to a restaurant my husband and I liked for special date nights. We all sat and had a nice dinner, laughing and talking about our lives. At some point I went to the restroom and came back to a totally different conversation about how many partners Nicki has been with sexually. When I sat back down they both grinned at me and continued the conversation eventually leading it to talking about a night club we were going to next. We were all eager to go so we payed our bill and drive straight there.

As soon as we got into the club Nicki dragged us both to the bar to do shots. We all took a few shots and they got a few more drinks before I called it quits since someone needed to drive home. She then dragged us onto the dance floor where she wasted to time grinding up on Chris and I. The more songs we stayed out for the, the more intimate the dancing became between us. Nicki undid a few buttons from her top letting her breasts bounce around to the point where they almost made an appearance. I could feel my husbands budge growing, which meant Nicki could certainly feel it.

We danced some more before Nicki and I excused ourselves to the bathroom. The line was long so we got to talking. ""Chris seems to be enjoying himself out there, do you two go dancing often?"" Nicki asked. ""Not too often but I think he really likes you, at least it feels that way"" I giggled. Nicki laughed back before getting closer to me and whispering ""How would you two feel about getting out of here and seeing what else your husband likes"". I smiled and bit my lip and gave her a quick kiss. We finally made it into the bathroom and back to Chris where we explained we were going home to continue the party.

Once we got back to the party I offered to make them a few drinks and excused myself to the kitchen. I immediately stripped out of my skirt and blouse leaving me in just my lingerie and heels. I made their drinks and made my way back to them. When I turned the corner Nicki was already sitting on top of my husbands lap with her skirt riding up her waist making out with him. They stopped kissing to turn and see me and Nicki's jaw dropped. She got off my husband and came over to me and immediately stripping off her shirt exposing her bare chest. Her nipples were still hard as she came up to me and kissed me. We made out for a few seconds before turning around to my husband. We both knelt down in front of him while he sat and tugged at his buckle. Nicki unzipped his fly and pulled slide his pants and briefs from under him. 

She wasted no time and took my husbands cock into her hand. While Chris became hard I unbuttoned his shirt and helped take it off him. Nicki then lowered her head down and took my husbands dick into her mouth. Chris doesn't have the biggest dick but he has a decent size and knows how to use it. Its a little over 6 inches long and about as thick as three of my fingers. 

Nicki licked the tip lightly before quickly forcing as much of his cock in her mouth as she could. Unbelievably she did not even gag. I decided now was a good time to give his balls and nice sucking. I lowered my head and took of his balls in my mouth. Nicki kept sucking away at his dick quickly as I filled my mouth with his sack.

After a few minutes I could feel my husbands balls tense up. I lifted my head level with Nicki's and whispered ""keep sucking he's about to cum"".

A few seconds later Chris let out a grunt while he came into Nicki's mouth as she continued to suck up each drop. Nicki lifted her head up and my husbands dick flopped down onto his leg. She looked and me and swallowed before kissing me and smiling. She then stood up and slipped out of her skirt revealing that she wasn't wearing any panties.

I stood up next to her and took off my bra while my husband pulled down my thong. I walked over to Nicki and played her down on the couch and spread her legs open. Chris jumped down before I could to get a taste of her bare pussy. He licked down her thighs before reaching her clit and circling his tongue around it.

Nicki grabbed my hand and pulled me up to her. I leaned into kiss her and as I did I felt her hand slide between my legs and run her fingers down my trimmed landing strip before reaching my pussy. She pulled it closer to her face before motioning me to straddle her face. I was so turned on that forgot how to walk and tripped as I tried to get on top of her. She laughed as did I before she got back to being serious and pulling me onto her face. My her nose was now brushing my landing strip as her tongue licked back and forth on my clit. I was in heaven.

My husband became hard again and by Nicki's reaction I could tell that he had just entered her. I looked behind me to see my husband staring me in the eyes with nothing but pure lust as he slowly slide in and out of Nicki's pussy. He increased his speed over time before Nicki was now moaning into my pussy as I sat on top of her face. This set me over the edge as I trembled while riding her face into my orgasm. I slowly rolled off her and laid on the floor as I watch her get screwed by my husband. 

Their eyes locked as he now fucked her hard into the couch. With every pump, Nicki let out a small sequel. Time went by as I laid spent on the floor before Nicki was clenching her legs around Chris tightly screaming out in pleasure. He slowed down a bit to let her ride out her orgasm. She breathed deeply with her eyes slowly closing and opening as she looked up at him.

Chris gave her a minute before starting up again going as fast as he could. He pumped into her hard as their bodies slammed together. I could tell he was about to cum again as his vein started to pop in his forehead. My husband quickly pulled out and jerked his cock shooting out a few ropes of cum onto Nicki's stomach. He fell down into the couch breathing from exhaustion before saying ""That was fucking unreal"". Nicki and I both laughed before I got up and got her a towel. While I was in the bathroom I started the shower and got it warm. I went back to join them and helped clean Nicki up. ""Feel like taking a hot shower and spending the night?"" I asked.

""That sounds almost more amazing than the sex"" she laughed.
We all walked into our bathroom and took turn together showering and cleaning up. When we finished and dried off we all just dropped our towels and hopped into the warm bed for some sleep.

Nicki slept with us that night and even offered to make us breakfast in the morning. I took her home later and told her we should do that again. She agreed and thanked us for the night.

As soon as I got home my I pounced onto Chris and spent the whole afternoon fucking him before I was too tired to do it anymore.

40xohz,3,2016-01-14,10 days in and already running into a huge problem,distancesucks123,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/40xohz/10_days_in_and_already_running_into_a_huge_problem/,"**TL:DR Basically, my girlfriend has decided that distancing herself from our relationship as far as possible is the only way to last until we're together again.**

Me: 21 (Male)

Her:20 (Female)

How long we've been dating: 1 year

How long we're going to be apart: I'm visiting in May. In June we're going to EDC Las Vegas with 4 friends, but I won't be finally home until mid-July. She'll be in school and I'll be working at an internship.

&amp;nbsp;

What's happened so far.

Bascally, my program of study (Comp. Engineering and French) has me on a five year plan. Three at home, 1 spent abroad in France, and then 1 final year before I get my BS and BA. My girlfriend and I knew this going into our relationship last year. By the luck of it, she had chosen to spend a semester broad in Italy the same time I was leaving. Before we dated, she'd been very shut in. She probably hadn't cried more than 5 times over the last 2-3 years. Our relationship broke down those walls and she really opened up emotionally and it's been amazing having that side of her. We've gone on two vacations together and it's a relationship I don't see ending any time soon. (avoiding the sappy ""she's the one"" line)

So I left in August and we were apart for a month. The time difference was tough but we got through it by Skyping, video messages, etc. After that time, I was able to visit her in Italy several times and she visited me several times over the course of the next 4 months. She lived with me in France for about weeks until we both went home for the holidays. I was home for twelve days and I've been back now for about 11 days.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem started a couple days after I came back. My girlfriend responds to really stressful situations by putting up walls and basically shutting down. There's no actually talking any more; it's moreso just responses to my attempts to hold the conversation. It started up really early and her texts got shorter and more robotic until the last couple of days. Her texts were a couple words at most, and no matter how much I pushed to Skype or really talk she pushed it away.

&amp;nbsp;

Last night I decided I wanted to get down to the bottom of it and just pour out what I've been thinking of the situation. Unfortunately she didn't want to skype so it was all done over texting. I avoided using any sort of ""you"" statements and just said that I felt that she's distancing herself and talking to me is a chore that seems more robotic then natural. 

She was evasive and didn't answer any of the points I made. Our conversation finally reached a point of her telling me what she's feeling and it was (almost verbatim):

&amp;nbsp;

""I feel like I've lost my boyfriend, not because of anything you did, just in me. I feel back to where I was before I knew you. I'm focusing on getting through the next day and working and fixing my body and how I affect people. I'm [her feelings] gone again with everything you put in me. I'm back to the old ""her name"". I don't know. That's just how I feel right now""

&amp;nbsp;

I really don't know how to proceed with this. I know how important both communication and space are but she's turned to only space between us. There's no deeper conversation than ""what are you up to?"" ""doing laundry"" etc. This didn't happen the first time, and I really don't know what to do at this point I'm hoping you guys might be able to chime in and maybe work something out so I can turn this back around before it gets any worse. Any ideas?"
40xx8r,0,2016-01-14,Job help,londonthrowawayc,london,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/40xx8r/job_help/,"My situation: 

Education: degree in law from a top 10 UK uni, did my masters in Middle East politics.

Employment: marketing intern (3 months - UK), audio typist (9 months - UK), legal PA (2 years - Asia).

I moved back to Asia to look after a relative, who has now passed away. I've since moved back to London but not much luck on the job front. Fortunately the law firm I'm working for is still paying me to do work remotely but I really want a permanent job in London. I've signed up with a few recruiters but I've had better luck with applying for jobs myself. So far, I've gotten 5 interviews, three of which I found myself in the final rounds only to be rejected for lack of experience.

Is the fact that my most recent job is in Asia a massive hindrance? What kind of other jobs should I be looking for? So far I've only been applying for PA jobs. I hate being a legal PA to be honest, and I'm interested in more client facing, relationship building, business development support roles. I am willing to take a pay cut for a role that is non-legal. 

Am I missing anything or does it really take this long to get a job? I've been job hunting for about 4 months now, properly so for about 7 weeks. 

Thanks in advance for any help!

40yfv8,0,2016-01-14,Should I [22/m] break up with my GF [23/f] for my final Semester?,stevenp93,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/40yfv8/should_i_22m_break_up_with_my_gf_23f_for_my_final/,"I (M22) have been dating my girlfriend (23) for 6 months. I am heading into my final semester of college in NYC and have accepted an internship offer in Boston this summer. The semester begins in a few weeks. I’m struggling to decide if I should:
1.	Stay with her, finish my degree. Evaluate after. 
2.	Be honest with my feelings now, play it by ear. Regardless of what happens commit to serving myself and enjoy the last semester.
3.	Take the break now. Be single. 

When I met/began dating my gf I was going through a tough time transferring to a new school and regretting leaving my last university. I started seeing a therapist about my depression and finally worked out some esteem/health issues I never opened up about growing up. 

She has been my first serious girlfriend and been nothing but good to me. She’s very attractive, fun and hard-working. However, sometimes I feel I’m all she has. Her Latin family is strict, they do not speak English or know we are dating! Her mom died when she was a teen. She graduated, lives an hour away but still works in the city. 

Admittedly I was the more desperate one at first but the last couple of months I have matured, developed better self-awareness and have bright opportunities ahead of me. In addition we had a pregnancy scare about a month ago which really put my life in perspective for a solid 5 days. 

Half of me wants to enjoy this time, focus on myself and be open to other girls. I’ve stopped making excuses and want to be the most confident version of myself. Again I’m still just 22. The other half recognizes she makes me happy, how rare a “good” relationship is and doesn’t want to give up on sex multiple times a week while getting through 6 classes. 

I felt that description was as succinct as I could make it. I am eager to hear any thoughts or opinions. What would you tell your 22 year old self? How did you handle your first relationship, what did you learn? Thanks. Peace and love."
40ygi5,1,2016-01-14,Fucking My Teen Age Summer Intern,UrGuiltyPleazurez,Naughtyphonefun,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naughtyphonefun/comments/40ygi5/fucking_my_teen_age_summer_intern/,"Another late night at the office. What ever happened to my personal life?  Since making partner at the firm…I quite simply HAVE NONE.  It’s a sad, sad world when a girl carries her rabbit and glass wand with her in the briefcase! But, I have time for nothing but work these days. So, what’s a girl to do? I’m sitting here all alone in the building. Well, all except that fucking hot teenage summer intern. What the fuck was he hanging around for?

Can’t I just work my glass wand and get my shirt open so those magical tit lickers can do their thing?  Was that little perv trying to check me out, or (God forbid) actually trying to gain some brownie points for being a good little worker?  Either way, he is sooo busting my groove.  And here he is strutting around after dark, all alone with the world’s horniest fucking boss…And with a dripping pussy? Oh, his ass is so TOAST!

I’m watching him bend and lift and sweat and…fuck! I want his teenage cock bursting in my tight, wet pussy. Every muscle ripples as if in symphony…all of one accord. It’s as if he’s not even wearing that shirt…I can see it ALL. And my pussy is exxxtra wet when I see him stroke that beard and mustache…both being the only hints that he’s a burgeoning MAN!  Okay…the huge bulge in his pants that say he could fuck the shit out of any woman alive…he looked like a kid.  Maybe he’s 19…Maybe. Giggle

“HI!. I’M RICHEY…THE TEEN SUMMER INTERN…I HAVE THOSE FILES YOU NEEDED EARLIER.”

I just glared at him, never realizing my shirt was still open and his eyes were LOCKED on my swollen tits.

“WELL, THAT HELPS A LOT, RICHEY! I NEEDED THESE YESTERDAY! NOW, I’M STUCK HERE AT THE OFFICE LATE…AGAIN BECAUSE OF YOUR INCOMPETENCE!  THIS CANNOT HAPPEN EVER AGAIN! IS THAT CLEAR?”

He was clearly shocked…but, also turned on by my anger. His cock was growing, like teenage cock tends to do…and filling his khakis to capacity. And my pussy swelled and dripped right there at my desk.  I told him to cum behind my desk to look at my computer screen so he could see how much it takes to run this business!  When he stepped around, his dick receding him by at least 9 inches, he bent to gaze at the screen and came face to tits with my still open blouse.

Richey licked his lips and I could hear his breath catch in his young boy throat…I asked him if he was willing to help me lighten my load…and in return, I would help him lighten his load. LOL  My barely legal, teenage boy-toy was about to get the lesson of a lifetime.  He agreed to assist me and took the hidden wand from my desktop, massaging it on my throbbing clit over my soaked panties. This kind of nubile pleasuring should be considered criminal behavior. Deliciously criminal.

Richey took over like a BOSS, suckling at my tits, nibbling, biting, pulling at them until I cried out in a primal howl. He lowered his teeth and trailed his lips along my belly and down over my mound, gobbling at my clit as he went.  My hips thrust off my chair to meet his mouth and grabbed the back of his head.  I fucked his face so hard he could feel my bones under the skin as it slammed against his wanton mouth and tongue. He drank my squirt down and continued his attack of cunnilingus until I nearly blacked out with pleasure.

Richey staggered to his feet and shoved that big dick down my throat in one felled-swoop and I gagged until the tears ran from the corners of my eyes and spittle dripped from my chin…His dick made that wonderful “splash”, “splosh”, “drip” sound with which I am more than a little familiar…His fingers curled into fists in my hair and he fucked my face like it was the pussy he left behind for war!

We fucked and sucked until the sun came up and we had to flee to keep from being discovered by my other workers…I took him home with me and he’s been here the entire summer…He’s turned out to be the best teenage summer intern I could have ever imagined…But, there’s still so much to teach him. Good thing I keep him at my house now. He’s much more useful to me here.

You think I should keep him around during his college breaks? I’m going to need lots of time to teach him EVERYTHING I know…And that’s a LOT!!!!!!  Call me…Let’s discuss all the naughty lessons I plan on teaching his fresh, young ass!

40zl8b,2,2016-01-14,I feel a heavy burden and all I want is to be a happy college student,overwhelmedopport,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/40zl8b/i_feel_a_heavy_burden_and_all_i_want_is_to_be_a/,"I feel like I'm hiding a huge burden from a lot of my friends and family. I'm 18f in college, just finished my first semester. I don't like the self-pity party I'm about to throw, but I need to get this out.

My father was verbally/slightly physically abusive when I grew up. He was a pack-a-day smoker since the age of 15, and he never quit. His body gave out on him and he got sick, lost his job, couldn't work or walk but huff and puff and feel pain. He resorted to taking out his pain on my mother, my sister, and I. He would call us awful things, manipulate things in his favor, and often get violent. I remember locking myself in my room and he'd slam on the door until it broke. I remember seeing him corner my mother in the bathroom and threaten to literally kill her, she was on the floor cowering. I would sit in my room and listen with a phone in my hands, ready to call 911 if he hurt her. He'd dump huge glasses of ice-cold drinks at my mother and I when we'd stand up for ourselves. It goes on and on.

It was even worse because my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent chemo, had a double masectomy, and had to deal with his anger throughout all of this. It broke my heart to see her have to shave her head while crying, just utterly defeated, and then have to go home and get berated by my father. He told her on numerous occasions that she was hideous, told her she was a man (lost all her ""feminine"" features such as hair, breasts, and period because of forced menopause through hysterectomy). 

To round all this off, my father passed away six months ago due to a sudden heart attack. He was placed on a vent and lost all brain activity, we had to pull the plug. I remember walking in and seeing him unnaturally slouched over, his eyes lifeless and blank on the last day of his ""life"". This image haunts me every day when I try to go to sleep, I just cry and toss and turn all night. I can't help but think about it a lot and it disturbs me.

 I don't know how to cope with any of this. I went to a therapist for around three years and it helped, but I had to stop sessions because I moved to college. He died a month before I left, so I moved three hours away from home. It gave me a fresh start- and I haven't told anyone about any of this. About four people here know that ""my father died, and that my mom had cancer."" It took me a full month to even mention the death to my roommates. There's no way I could tell them everything - and even if I did, it's my burden and I don't need other people to look down or think of me differently because of it. 

I'm in the Honors program at my school. I won a scholarship to pay off 90% of my tuition, but I'm still extremely worried about money. I didn't do too well this past semester - it's all been a fog, honestly, and my grades turned out alright. I've been job hunting and trying to earn scholarships but I can't seem to find anything. 

I've been turning to weed to help me. I know it's not good, but I smoke before bed every night and at least it puts me to sleep without thinking endlessly about death and other things. I make sure not to pour tons of money into it like some people do ($20 a month max). Before you shoot it down, please understand. It's real easy to tell me to stop and then go home and then forget about it, while I have to have anxiety attacks and freak for hours while reliving these scenes over in my head. I get my work done and I don't fuck around. If other kids roll joints and head to class for the fuck of it, then I'm sure as hell allowed to use it in a more controlled setting for something legit. I'm venting about this because I feel like it's a nasty secret that's formed and I don't like it, but these are my reasons. 

I just want to be happy. I want to go into medicine and I want to help people. I tried to apply for a red cross volunteer position but there were so many requirements and classes necessary (it'll be a goal), but in the same way it's disheartening to have to wait because I'm not qualified enough. The same goes for internships, most want juniors/seniors. I'm scared that I won't get my foot in the door now, and then I'll be washed away like everyone else when it comes down to the wire. I don't know how to distinguish myself and I'm just so, so, so lost. I'm just really confused.

Sorry and thanks if you read this whole biography."

40zv7v,0,2016-01-14,Curse if being a short male in London..maybe its not that bad? ohh opinions and positivism please :),VibesandThat,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/40zv7v/curse_if_being_a_short_male_in_londonmaybe_its/,"Hey Guys,

So been feeling down this start if the year.. but why?
I've got the job I've always wanted, took me a degree, 3 unpaid internships, a very horrible badly paid admin job for 2 years.. so I should be really happy right? and I am, at work its great im getting stuck in, making a good impression..

BUT! one thing that haunts me everyday (some of you might think I should not take this seriously but it does affect me) 

So im like 5'2 not even sure if that! quite confident with women I'd say, fell in love with someone but they had someone so got it bit messy and I got hurt however she was the only person who made me feel my height did not matter and she seemed to find me attractive and 'sexy' which I never reallly had with other women to this extent (have had 1 gf at 18 and few more unofficial situationships, think the sex was good really, that's why they stayed lol)..

so I look at that situation as a 'one off' and I know I shouldn't look for it but yes im on pof, happn, even tinder now like every day tapping, checking..its ridiculous and guess what!? no replies/matches makes me feel terrible..then just delete it?

but then what I can't go a club and talk to women it happened with groups of friends but not like me go up to a girl? probs get laughed at due to my height..this has happened a few times, just random people looking and laughing lol, and I guess being 25 this year has made me think.. will I meet someone? 

No one who reads this can answer me, I guess this was just a rant I feel only strangers can be told.. but yeah feel free to say your opinions, thoughts, stories :) "
410qd2,7,2016-01-14,How to best control my emotions with my uBPD mom?,ob1kenobi56,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/410qd2/how_to_best_control_my_emotions_with_my_ubpd_mom/,"So my mom is uBPD and I've got to live here until I finish college in May. She and I have a really garbage relationship because she's super condescending and overbearing. I try my best to do okay and I think I am. I'm 21 about to graduate with a 3.7 GPA, I don't do any drugs or even drink that much. I'm not pregnant and I'm home every night at around 11 and up every day at 7 for work. She always makes me feel like the bad guy when we have talks and I try to enforce boundaries.

She's always on my case and never my sister's or my brother's. Sister doesn't clean her room for a month? Whatever. I leave a cup in my room? She leaves three notes around the house, a voicemail, and a text about it. She also lies ALL the time to people about me (like telling my brother's probation officer I was on medication?? I'm taking an iron supplement to help with my RLS).  

Whenever I hear her walk in the house I go on edge and my anxiety goes through the roof. Every time she talks to me she's accusatory and it drives me crazy. She texts me calling me a liar and accusing me of liking my father better because I visit him or walk his dog. She bullies me and makes fun of my body, telling me I'm too skinny and must have some sort of eating disorder. She's so in my business I feel like I'm being questioned for murder when I get a package in the mail. Whenever I get a new boyfriend I don't bring them home for obvious reasons and she constantly texts me guesses about him and what he's like. When I try to tell her it's my personal life and I want my privacy it just goes over her head. I feel the need to hide everything from her.

She and my sister are really loud in the morning and I asked her to please try and be a little quieter as I'm having a hard time falling asleep and am a light sleeper, and was told that I should just suck it up and stop complaining and it's not her problem that she wakes me up. She's so condescending I can barely stand it. Today she told me to pick up my shoes and jacket I left downstairs by telling me ""This is how I want the house to look when I get home."" Okay, whatever. I grab the jacket and put it on the back of a chair to put the shoes away, and she starts screaming at me about how I NEED TO START PUTTING MY STUFF AWAY AND NOT LEAVE IT OUT. I put the shoes down to grab the jacket since apparently she wants that put away first, and she starts yelling at me that where I put the shoes down ISN'T where they go (like, I know? What do you WANT). I literally put it on the chair for one second to walk to the other side of the room. It's this garbage every day. I can't seem to do anything right. 

We can exchange about one or two sentences before she drives me up the wall and I explode with anger. I just have so much built up resentment I can barely function when communicating with her. It's so stressful. I've got an internship that is also really emotionally draining and I don't have the energy to do this anymore. I told her a couple weeks ago I was thinking about killing myself and she told me to make sure I did it at my dad's house and not at hers because she didn't want to deal with the mess. I don't understand how I'm supposed to respect or love a woman who says stuff like that to their daughter.

Am I just being a jerk or is there some sort of magical way to have a functional relationship/control my emotions with a uBPD mother?? Sorry for the long post I just really needed to vent."
410uw5,5,2016-01-14,Handling difficult interactions with my (27F) ex (26M),dryopteris_e,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/410uw5/handling_difficult_interactions_with_my_27f_ex_26m/,"I separated from my husband after 5yrs of marriage. I asked for the separation, as i no longer loved him and really felt like he was not a nice person. I would not want my kids to be in a relationship like ours. He moved out in Sept. We have two children together, so obviously no contact is not an option. When we were together, i was mostly a SAHM. I've also been a student for the last year and a half now.   

I'm moving on with my life. I've started dating a guy friend. I now work about 30 hours a week at a new job that i really love (my job is also my internship). I work until 7 four or five days a week, and have a late class one night. I'm in the floral industry and we are prepping for Valentine's which is the busiest time of year for us, so my hours will increase some over the next month. Obviously, i need a job to pay bills. I'm barely scraping by. I get my school dispersements in a few weeks (combo of grants and loans), which will help tremendously.   

My ex keeps the kids overnight three nights a week. Another night he picks them up from school, feeds them dinner, and then i get them when i get off.   

So here's the problem. I think we're getting along. Things are going okay. Then he freaks out on me over whatever offense I've committed most recently. Today he is upset with me because of something my sister posted on Facebook, about abusive relationships. It was actually about another friend, but if the shoe fits, feel free to lace that bitch up and wear it. But i digress.  

During our fifteen minute call today, he told me (excuse the language, but this is basically how the call went): i don't spend enough time with the kids. I need to figure out my fucked up work schedule because it's not working for him. Picking them up at 730 doesn't count as spending time with them because they're winding down for the night (we do homework, play a little, take a bath, read stories, and are in bed by ten). Our 5yo is having problems in school bc of my work schedule. Our 5yo keeps telling him that he's a good daddy, and he thinks she's doing that because I've been talking shit about him in front of her. I've been having my little fuckboy around the kids. He knows that Facebook post my sister made was about him, and she's a fool, and why didn't she message him over the holidays. She used to text him occasionally. Everyone he tells about me agrees that I'm doing some really fucked up stuff, but he's sure my shitty little friends are telling me I'm doing just fine. I've got everyone convinced that he's an asshole because I'm trying to convince myself, but i know that he treated me well. He's only cussed me out three times. I told him that he used to call me a dick/bitch when he tried to get me to have sex with him before work. His response was, that's how he knows I'm fucking crazy because that never happened. And if it did happen, it's because i *was* being a dick because i was already pursuing my little fuckboy. And i always took him seriously but he was joking. God, my stupid fucking therapist was so unprofessional. She convinced me that he was horrible because she was a man-hating lesbian (he used to always ask if she was my lesbian girlfriend, but that's a funny story for another day). It was wrong of her to tell me that i needed a safe place away from my husband. No good therapist would ever try to encourage someone to leave a relationship. We need to see a therapist together, who will actually call me out on my bullshit. Etc etc.  

Whenever i get one of these calls from him, i try to remain calm but assertive. This just makes him angrier. He likes to tell me I'm crazy, ask me if I'm on drugs, etc. He's been communicating with my parents and grandparents (they are pretty young and were very heavily involved in raising me). My grandma is very concerned and every time i talk to her, she tells me that my ex and his mom are watching me. I've stopped using my Facebook because his mom sent messages to me and all my parents/grandparents about how they were worried about my mental state (because my boyfriend posted a picture of us together on NYE).   

He's threatening to file an at fault divorce for adultery and try to get custody of the kids.   

What the hell do i do? I want him to be involved in the kids' lives, but i also want to live my own life without being made to question my own sanity on a regular basis. I need help establishing boundaries.  

Tl;dr: separated from my husband in Sept. Still receiving ranty phone calls and texts on a weekly basis. What do i do to make the madness end?"

410wjo,9,2016-01-14,Bouncing back from an abusive/manipulative situation?,j_low74,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/410wjo/bouncing_back_from_an_abusivemanipulative/,"I apologize if this is a long-winded post; it's my first time writing on askgaybros after a year of lurking. 

Recently, I moved across the country to go to university. It was my opportunity to reinvent myself and hopefully get a degree or internship in an industry I always loved. Being all alone (as none of my high school friends left the east coast for college) and already quite introverted, it was hard for me to adapt and meet new people. However, there was one upperclassman who was both president of the LGBTQ Services on campus and an RA who I met and, being a first year student, figured I could trust to help me navigate my way around and sorta teach me the ropes.

This person quickly became obsessive over me and I soon learned he had a history of suicidal behavior and extreme self-esteem issues; many people were aware that he was previously reported for harassing and acting inappropriate towards new students and yet no one figured to warn me ahead of time (but decided to tell me at the end of the semester instead). 

As desperately as he wanted a relationship or something with me, I excessively refused, as I saw him more as a ""friend"" and resource because you're supposed to trust your RA's, right? He didn't like that, and began to consistently yell, scream, break objects, throw things, come very close to hitting me, and threaten to commit suicide over and over while I was in his presence in an attempt to guilt me into spending time with him. By halfway through the semester he had gotten so suicidal in my presence that I genuinely feared if I did anything to leave the situation, he would end his own life. And I knew he had tried before, even once being contained in a psychiatric hospital for those attempts.

On top of all this, he would make sexual advances upon me regularly and try and pressure me to disclose my sexual past. I come from a very small suburban town and never really got to explore my sexuality, so college was the beginning of that process.  This person got a hold of my phone and started going through my messages to find out I was talking to another guy on campus. He had a violent outburst that turned into a very traumatizing night where he was on the brink of suicide and forced me to calm him down as if it were my fault.

I was caught in an extremely difficult spot that led to my mental health deteriorating and having constant anxiety and breakdowns over this one person who was solely ruining my college experience. People no longer wanted to speak to me for my association with this person and I retreated into my dorm room spending most days in solitude. 

To speed up the story, my friends and family finally convinced me to try and get out of the situation after months of emotional torture of this person so I cut off all contact after sending a text explaining my reasoning. The people across the hall from his room reported excessive plate breaking that night after he kicked all his residents out and locked himself in his room. 

The next time I saw this kid on campus, I swear he looked like he was coming off of a heroin addiction he looked so distraught. I passed him in a hall when I was walking with a friend and we made brief eye contact and I have never felt as scared in my life as I did in that moment. Knowing of his violent and suicidal history, just seeing that look in his eyes made me feel like he could be set off and hurt me, himself, or anyone else around. So we ran as fast as we could and locked ourselves in a room for hours until I knew he wouldn't be out.

Public Safety soon caught wind of myself and his residents feeling unsafe around him, and I was dragged into a extremely draining and personal investigation of our history over the semester; it led to both a restraining order and a sexual misconduct trial that is still open and ongoing today. 

I was forced to leave campus for fear of my safety and having my outlook of the school basically tarnished. I've moved back home and opted not to return for the spring semester. I've slipped into a depression of my own where I still have schoolwork incomplete and no motivation for productivity of any sort. I've had to enlist in therapy and have been suspected of potentially having suicidal behaviors. I have developed immense trust issues, fear for my safety, and no longer want to be around strangers for extended periods of time.

The question is, where do you go from here? Being a student with aspirations and having your whole life derail while watching everyone else continue on with their lives has made me feel like a personal failure and I’ve pushed everyone away as a result. I can’t help but blame myself for letting this person torture me for so long; all I could do was watch as he took every opportunity I had away from me. 

I’m a writer, and most people I’ve disclosed my feelings to have asked me if I have written about my experiences or feelings, so I figured why not give it a shot. This was just one outlet I knew I could turn to, so any advice, support, or just friends and open arms are really appreciated. There are obviously a lot more layers to the story and specific events that I have skipped over to save space, but the truth of the matter was that things spiraled so far out of control that the only option was to remove myself from the environment and try and recover in the presence of family back home. 

Thank you, gaybros. &lt;3"
411ose,5,2016-01-15,My major (Computer Science) is driving me insane,themooseexperience,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/411ose/my_major_computer_science_is_driving_me_insane/,"Hey all, I know this may not be the biggest of deals compared with other posts on this page, but it's just something I need to get, well, off my chest. 

To put it short: I'm a freshman in college and my major is already driving me insane. I go to a school generally recognized as top 20 in CS nationally, and the pressure is already unbelievable. I don't know how it is in other majors, I'm just speaking from experience, but the sheer amount of work that goes into CS is almost nauseating. 

The classwork is fine, I'm able to do well in all of my classes. But the tests are only going to get harder, the material is only going to get more difficult, and the projects are going to get longer. This would be fine if I didn't feel the need to almost constantly be doing stuff related to my major outside of schoolwork. I'm constantly learning new languages, working on creating apps and websites and games and trying to make a million different things in a short amount of times because apparently that's all companies want to see.

I wasn't able to really even get close to an internship, the closest I got was a phone interview from Microsoft's explorer program. They all ask what I've built or developed or won, and as a freshman I just don't have anything yet. And some of these programs are *designed* for freshmen. They take kids that are my age that have somehow managed to create bestselling apps or highly-trafficked websites by 18 or 19 years old.

I feel like I'm constantly behind, and the sheer amount of work I need to put into this major is exhausting. I just realized I hadn't mentioned this, but I **love** computers and computer science in general. The subject fascinates me more than anything else, and if I didn't have an unnerving sense of urgency to learn *everything* in no time at all I would be so much happier.

**TL;DR** Current freshman at a university known to be ""elite"" in CS. The constant pressure to not just be doing extremely well in classwork but constantly developing countless apps/websites/programs, working on collaborative works, contributing to everything on GitHub, etc is driving me crazy. It's my winter break and I've spent 8 hours a day simply learning stuff that I would normally enjoy but can't because of the pressure I have on me. I just feel like I'm constantly behind, and will never be able to land an internship let alone a job. :("
411sav,2,2016-01-15,Self Destructive Cycle... Doing it again...,artemisdragmire,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/411sav/self_destructive_cycle_doing_it_again/,"EDIT - UPDATE -- I didn't get fired today. Given another chance, but if I am even 1 minute late, for any reason, weather included, I'll be in the shitter.

Should make a throwaway but fuckit.

I am about at the end of another cycle of self destruction.

You see, every few years I inevitably implode in my professional life. Losing jobs, quitting school, failing classes, whatever.

This has been going on since I was a little kid. I would skip assignments and never turn in projects because I was bored of them and didn't want to do the work. I was called lazy and stupid. I probably am.

Enter high school, I'm given more freedom. I can come and go from school as I please, I have my own car. I start skipping classes. I call in sick. Whatever. On top of the ""not handing in work"" stuff and tardiness because I can't drag myself out of bed in the morning.

Almost get expelled for truancy and low grades. My teachers look at me forlornly and say shit like ""you have so much potential if you could just show up on time and do the work"". Maybe they're right, but for some reason I keep doing it.

I go to work after high school, putting off college, despite knowing better. The job isn't bad, and I stay there for 3.5 years, the longest I've ever held a job to date. (I am 30 now)

I have an abusive manager, but even with that, the place would NOT fire me. But I kept up with my bullshit, calling in to work sick right up to the very LIMIT of what policy allowed, showing up late, not doing assigned work in reasonable amounts of time.

The only reason I didn't get fired is the place was desperate for employees because it was kinda a shithole.

I eventually quit because the stress was killing me, from the job, from the effort it took to play the tightrope game I had made myself do, and from my abusive manager. 

When I quit, the GOOD manager in the building said to me ""I hope you do well for yourself, you got a good head on your shoulders, you just need to work harder and show up on time.""

Maybe he's right.

Some time off work between jobs here, bounce around a couple shitty part time jobs that aren't worth talking about, of course, I pull the same shit at them, nearly get fired from one.

Eventually, decide ""I'm gonna go to college and stop being useless, I'm better than this.""

So I go. Have to quit my job to go, because they won't let me work part time. Fine, fuck them, I'll get a personal loan.

College is great the first few years. Ace everything. Feeling great about myself.

Then toward the end of it, the old habits creeped back in. I stop showing up for classes. I stop handing in work. I skirt by and am teetering on academic suspension for poor grades, and losing financial assistance, which I'm living off of.

I have a couple internships during this time as well. One of which I basically got fired from, for tardiness and excessive absenteeism, but it didn't go on record as a firing, they were just like ""We're going to end the internship right now and give your school passing marks, cya""

The second internship goes better, but in the middle of it I get caught up in the school bullshit that is making me teeter on the edge of destruction there.

I panic, and start job hunting, figuring, fuck college, I can get a job NOW, I have a 2 year degree, who needs the bachelors.

I ask my colleagues if they'd be willing to be references during my job hunt, since we seem to all get along and work well together. I only ask one of them before I give up, his response was:

""I can't in good faith and honesty recommend you to an employer, so you should not list me as a reference. You have tardiness and attendance issues and your work ethic isn't very good. You're very smart when you do work, but more often than not you do not deliver.""

I don't ask any other colleagues and job hunt anyways. Fuck them.

I find one, I get an interview at a bank that is SUPER excited to hire me. I'd be one of 2 IT people. Perfect spot for a young budding IT professional. The staff are all extremely friendly and happy and the CFO loves me in the interview, practically hiring me on the spot.

But guess what? I fucked it up. After a year at that job I get canned for excessive tardiness, calling in sick too much, and using PTO I didn't have to cover for it.

Enter 6 months of unemployment and me finally seeking help for depression.

Destroy my credit and my mom's credit because I can't pay student loans that she signed off on, and I'm not able to even buy myself food. I live off my roommate's charity, he lets me stay and not pay rent until I find a job. Don't know why, but he does.

I get on some meds, think, hey, maybe things will get better now.

I find a new job eventually, the one I'm at currently, the one I will probably get fired from tomorrow.

I've been here for about 2 years, coming up on a record for me... but guess what, I'm fucking it up again. Even with treatment for my depression and anxiety, I still struggle to get out of bed in the morning, end up calling in to work, and this has landed me in hot water.

In addition, this job has a very strict timeclock policy, and I've had a few 1 or 2 minute late punches in addition to calling out frequently, which has landed me in multiple disciplinary talks.

A few weeks ago I was put on a final disciplinary and told that further tardiness would lead to termination.

I went to the doctor, a new one. Got put on a different medication regiment. It's been about a week since, I think the meds are working... sorta, I feel a little better, but not all that much. I haven't missed work though.

Well, today we had shit weather in ND and the roads were terrible. I didn't leave early enough, even though it was 15 minutes earlier than I left. I SPED down the highway trying to get to work, dangerously passing cars and nearly spinning out twice.

But I was 2 minutes late.

My boss says he's gotta talk to HR tomorrow and he'll let me know what the outcome is, but it's not looking good.

EDIT -- You should know that this company doesn't consider bad weather a valid excuse for tardiness or calling out of work. It's a shitty policy but it is what it is.

I guess I am just a lazy, worthless individual.

After I lose this job I'm going to file for disability insurance with my depression, hopefully I'll be accepted, as it seems I am not fit for the workforce."

I got busted before I did my shot. I convinced myself one last shot is going to be worth a week in jail. I already have my bond money ready, but I'm going to have to pee clean to get bonded out again. It was a decision I made to see my mistress one last time before I go on the straight and narrow. Least I won't be kickin' in jail this time, so it ain't bad. Fuck, half my friends are in there anyway ha.

I'm going to try and get an internship at a law office of an aquiantance, and hope he can ""pay"" me in 5-10-240 mins of legal advice every day in exchange for shoveling show, getting coffee/lunch, reception work, etc. I'm researching my own case, which is tough without my police report yet but I'm no stranger to litigation so I have 3 notebook pages full of (hopefully) applicable statutes. This shit would be a LOT EASIER if I WASNT GOING TO JAIL tomorrow. But I have the necessary century codes written down so I can continue researching in jail. Who knows though, maybe I can dilute it enough.. I've passed a UA in rehab doing that once before. Or I might pull the ol' switcheroo. I like to look 'em in the eye and smile as they look at my dick, every CO that watched me pee in jail backed off but one when I did that. I don't want to do heroin anymore, I just want to get on with my life. I'm hoping to become a paralegal so I can help out people like myself when they get fucked by crooked cops and the court system, and maybe one day I can attend law school and pass the bar. 

I'm hoping I can get someone close to me to help put up some money for a lawyer.. I don't want to ask though, because that's a pricey god damn request. I'm weighing my options. For now I'm trying to figure out how to get my phone out of custody. Fuck man. My head's spinning with all the shit I gotta do, and the last thing I want right now is heroin. I was finally well. The person I used with wasn't able to find anything (whole town's dried up after the ODs) so I had to hold the damn spoon/cook it up for her cause she was shaking so hard. I realized I wasn't even excited or anxious, I was just kind of.. ambivalent. It's like post-break up sex with a girl... kinda melancholy. Just makes me hate all the guys that are gonna be inside her next when I'm moving on with my life, haha. 

Oh well, maybe one day I will come back to driving my life into the ground but I really want to move on now. Going to jail was a blessing in disguise, I'm sorry for the petulant whining in my last post. This is an opportunity to fix some of the shit wrong in my life and get my affairs in order once and for all. I have the rest of my life to be a junky, I don't have long to make something of myself still.

You guys are awesome, all of you. I love you, I truly mean that, in the strongest sense of the world. You guys are interesting, funny, awesome, unique, kind, everything good in the world I didn't think still existed. Of course our existence online doesn't show the dirt we've done, but that said you all have some beautiful souls and I think junkies are still some of the most beautiful people on the planet. I'm retiring the word ""junky"" now, I'm hoping Im leaving the ranks forever and it's one of those words like fag.. you gotta be one to use it. Like Mr. Garrison.

Thanks for all the support, you guys are awesome, I hope you continue to help and support each other and the newbies and the lurkers and the hurt ones like Boebee and ol Alice_cooper's baby mama or whatevs. People like street and EIS and tracey and FEERN make the world a better place, you guys should hold your heads up high out in public. You're better human beings than most the cops on patrol. 

I will still lurk once in a great while and may even come in to share some ramblings here and there, but I can't sit and read/talk about opiates while I'm trying to move on. I'm going to set up apts with an addiction counsellor and a new therapist tomorrow morning before my bond gets revoked (ha) so I have some pretty words for the judge next week. And more importantly, some tools to help myself get back to where I need to be.

Continue being awesome, and please guys, always do the test shot. There's fentanyl going around all over the god damn place right now and it's some serious shit. I hate how the best people always seem to leave the earliest, so please stick around guys, for the people you love and people who love you.

Also, I had two r/opiate crushes i never shared cause it's kinda embarassing. But fash and street are two peeps I'd totally kick it with. I can't say anything sexually, but personality wise you two are top shit on this sub. You guys could usurp the EIS/HK homosex monarchy and make the cutest puppies. Ha, sorry monarchy. You guys are awesome too.

Love, always and forever,

S - if you're reading this, be good girl. Take care of yourself. I always got your back if you ever need, but I'm gonna be a little preoccupied til summer. That said my rents phone is in the book, you can call whenever and I will always do whatever I can. I hope you get back up soon. I love hard and forever, maybe not in the same way but it'll always be there, so don't let me see you go out like this. You're too beautiful of a soul. Sorry I don't have your number, can't get into it but i don't have anyones right now and anything you hear from ""me"" is compromised until I say something only I know.

Oh I'll prolly be hanging out in here tonight catching up on all the posts I missed in jail. The high's long long gone, but I'm very content just knowing I'm going to SLEEP tonight. One shot for a potential week in lock down? Yeah, if it's the last one maybe. Guess we'll see how it pans out."

In 6 weeks i'm moving into spain for my internship, the first two weeks there will be fulltime spanish lessons. But i don't want to step into the country without knowing the language at all.

So my question is: Do you guys know any good methods of learning the language from the start? I'm currently learning from culturealley.com

I need you to listen to me, Charlotte. Out of all people, you know best what I've been through and why I have trust issues. We were officially together for what, 5 months? Then your parents got in the way of things and we had to keep things ""unofficial"" and ""platonic"" as you would put it. We've almost spent a year together now... or... however you would describe what we are.

&amp;nbsp;
You know how things ended between ____ and I. We might still be young, but I was heads over heels for that girl. You know how long it took me to get over her. You KNOW the things I had to do to myself and other people to get over her. You KNOW everything I ever had to do and every friend I had to lose to be with you. Some call me a jerk for ditching my friends for you... Deep down I told myself that it was worth it, that I finally got my feelings for ____ thrown out of my head. I was right for a while...


&amp;nbsp;
Remember that first date we went on? (Granted, it was when we were 4 and a half months in) We went beach hopping across this godforsaken island. We met up in Central, struggled to find the bus terminal to go to Stanley (what a joke we were, huh), took the bus to Stanley and we just spent so much time there. We just... spent the time ***together***. You told me when we were alone that you were glad we got together. You told me that you've been looking forward to this day since you left for Germany for an internship and when I went to England for a summer camp. You told me all your plans in the future - backpacking in Europe, spending time with me in Amsterdam just like Hazel and Gus did in The Fault in Our Stars, getting into a great dentistry school and chasing your dreams of one day become a dentist. You even told me that you could never see yourself with anyone else. I told you the same thing and we just... we just embraced each other that day. We spent the whole day together. Who the fuck knew that was going to be the only date we'd go on in the course of our fucking relationship?

&amp;nbsp;
Then one day you just stopped talking to me. You never acknowledged my presence, even when I was **RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU**. You did anything and everything you could to avoid me. It was like deja vu just stuck a stick up my ass. You avoided me like **THE GOD DAMNED PLAGUE**. I was hurt. Confused. Irritated. I felt betrayed, backstabbed, depressed. You avoiding me made me feel all the emotions of my past altogether as one. It was just that one solid lump of emotion in my heart, slowly eating me away as I laid on my bed unable to sleep.

&amp;nbsp;
Weeks passed, and I eventually told myself that I have to do something about this - that I wasn't gonna let someone do this to me again. Not again. So I confronted you about it. We met up, talked about stuff, then I just brought it up. I was direct and clear about what I had to say - that it felt like you were avoiding me and that this obviously wasn't working out. You told me that your parents pressured her into staying the hell away from me and that it was nothing personal from them. ""They just don't like the idea of me being in a relationship right now, that's all."" Fair enough I suppose. We're still young (ish). Your parents have always been protective of you, seeing as you're a single child. We broke up that day (or ""broke up""). It hurt. A lot. I didn't show it to anyone, I didn't even tell anyone about how I truly felt. I actually cried. *A lot*. 


&amp;nbsp;
After we broke up, we kinda avoided each other for a week or so. That's normal. It's fine. After that ""transitional"" week, we started talking again. We hit it off again and we just got along so well. But what you did during the few weeks after the break up made me confused and frustrated. You just... held my hand, hugged me and looked at me in the eyes like you did at the beach, when we were together. I didn't know what to do... I just froze in shock. I was... delighted, confused, angry, irritated and happy all at the same time. I didn't know WHAT the fuck was going on. Honestly, no one even knew what we were before we broke up. I didn't think about asking you what you were doing. I just smiled at you.

&amp;nbsp;
Then came our expedition. You did things that made me question what we were, and when I approached you on the second day about it during our assessment expedition out in the woods, you told me that we made it clear we're not dating, and that we're just really good friends, but the night after that... you won't believe how confused but happy I was to be there. I was lying on the grass, out in the middle of the fields, just thinking about stuff, and you come along and lie next to me, putting your head on my chest and we just spent the next 10 or so minutes looking at each other and watching the stars. I've never felt the way you made me feel ever since... you know... my first girlfriend. I missed that feeling.

&amp;nbsp;
That same night, though, one of my friends came to me and he told me about the conversation the both of you had the night before. He told me that you didn't actually like me. He wasn't even the only one who brought this idea up. I keep hearing people tell me that you don't actually like me... that you've been playing me this whole time. In fact, about 90% of my friends have been telling me the same damn thing since we got together. 

&amp;nbsp;
You know what told me that they weren't trying to get me to stop everything that was happening between us just to get me single again? The fact that you keep telling me that you don't have the time to meet up with me anymore. Fucking ***LIES***. You have the time to go on a shopping spree, spend time with others, and the thing that fucked me up the most: spending time alone with other guys, but you weren't able to spend even the slightest minute with me outside of school? Fuck you for that. The promises you broke during our expedition, telling me how we'd meet up over the Christmas holidays - how'd we go roof topping and spend a whole day together on a movie spree. You got my hopes up, and all you did with that was throw them back down to the fucking gutter. Fuck you, Charlotte. You had the fucking time to go out for dinner with just another guy, one that clearly fancies you, but not the time to spend with the person you claimed to never let go of. That's right, you said that during our expedition when we were lying in the grass. I bet you don't even fucking remember.

&amp;nbsp;
I'm giving you one last chance. I need you to stop with the fucking seen-zoning. I need you to step up and tell me the truth. Spare me the rollercoaster of emotions that I've already had to endure the past few years. I need you to mean what you say this time. I need you to make up your mind."

While my parents have always had an unhappy marriage without personal respect or affection, our family unit of four has always functioned to the outside world. I excelled in high school and college, my father's career is always moving in a better direction, there's a house in a nice neighborhood with a mortgage we live in, and...actually, that's where the functionality ends. I know I'm lucky to have these conditions, but recent events have left me shaking and almost vomiting with helplessness, rage, and frustration at our inability to leave toxic patterns behind. I feel like they're slowly killing us, and especially ruining my brother and his future.

When we were in grade school, my mother was usually the only parent in charge, and my dad never took responsibility for disciplining, rewarding, or keeping up with us kids' activities, grades, or really lives. If my dad ever told us we could take a break from studying, it was meaningless unless my mother chose to allow it, you get the idea. And when she hit or used other corporeal punishment on us, my dad would laughingly intercede for her to stop (making us cry or beg), which made her threaten to hit us harder after he left. In the cases (usually once a year) where he successfully intervened long enough for her to give up on the corporeal punishment, she would retaliate against him and the child by refusing to talk to, make eye contact with, touch, cook for, or do laundry for the child. She wouldn't take us to school, activities...essentially she boycotted by acting like the child didn't exist for a month each time. I still remember the dread and relief in the pit of my stomach every time she spat, ""You are dead to me"" and started these month-long withdrawals from my life. It always ended with my dad and the child (I'm going to say ""me"" to keep things clearer from now on) begging her and repenting all their wrongful actions and promising to change, usually when my dad got irritated enough by the snowballing demands of parenting and work together. My mother always preceded her ""returns"" to being a parent (she doesn't usually work, stays at home reading online novels except for a three-year period where she worked part-time starting in 2010. She speaks English with a stutter and is defensive about being rejected for jobs based on that because she has a Master's, also refuses to apply for jobs unrelated to her degree) with a lecture about how she always tried to do the best for us, how we always fought her to our own detriment.

The parenting itself, I always thought, gave me access to lessons and tools most young adults would kill to have started so early. My mother always insisted my dad pay for (to his voiced annoyance, sometimes) training and lessons for my brother and me, which I'm still grateful for today. Then there was her other behavior. She would sit in on every lesson taking notes, force us to practice for hours, and expect sensational results because according to her, there was ""no reason we could do less than the best if we really cared."" I still remember car rides home after lessons where she learned we'd performed inadequately (she always asked the oblivious teacher explicitly), and the screaming tirades that didn't stop for the whole forty minutes, about how much money I had wasted, comparing me to pigs in the mud, self-degrading prostitutes, and people who murdered their own parents in cold blood. I'd cry, sit in silence, and usually it would blow over. Also, whenever she ignored me my brother would become the fawned-over golden child, and she'd speak loudly about a mindless pig stinking up the house whenever I was around during those times.

That was another thing, the language she always used. I grew up thinking all parents screamed at their children and called them worthless pigs, unambitious low-lives, and ungrateful traitors. She would say the most horrible things to me that made me feel inadequate, selfish, lazy, and worthless on an almost cosmic level for messing up things like a performance, competition, or a public interaction. Making all these comments a hundred times worse was the fact that she always had a lecture ready listing all the past wrongs we've committed, from slacking off to not following directions to failing to correct our flaws...the list only gets longer as we get older, and it plays every time she gets infuriated.

Growing up, I occasionally performed beyond expectations, and she would praise me, saying that I was smart and talented all along, and that I just needed to focus and ""use heart"" to show it. I got addicted to the rare bursts of validation from my mom and worked hard like a fiend through high school, to my own success. Looking back on that time, she didn't lecture me on anything except regarding chores around the house, and we were all happier when she completely backed out of my life as I took over making all of my decisions related to school and activities. She went from exerting total, painstakingly detailed control over my every action to only insisting on exerting full control over what I wore, how short I kept my hair, and when I could leave the house. But as my tangible achievements tallied up, she would relax and let me go to sleepovers, pick out my own clothes, wear makeup, etc. During this time I actually would talk for hours a day to my mom, telling her about all the plans I had to better myself, updating her on my progress, and how competitive I was with the other kids in my grade. I would say we were close.

Alright. Fast forward a few years after I leave for college and almost never come back because of internships, trips with friends, and visits to our relatives' homes instead, my brother is in high school. I come home this holiday season and am shocked to find that he has been bringing home grades of D and F regularly on his report cards, with only a small handful of A's and B's in the past three semesters of high school. He's completely unmotivated to study, do homework, go to school, plan for college, pick out and improve at his activities (my mom made him do the exact same things I chose in high school, as if that was some magical formula)...essentially he takes every opportunity to hide from my parents and just procrastinate the hours of each day away online. It's heartbreaking to see my brother hiding from reality and counting down each day to the moment he can fall asleep.

My parents, also, have changed. My mother, who's been justifying her job-search inertia with ""taking care of my brother's future,"" has been so much worse to him than I ever remember her being to me. She gets defensive about it when I've tried to explain to her in private (most of her flare-ups with my dad are about microaggressions -some of them very valid, because I see him do the same to me- in which he humiliates her in front of the kids for his pleasure), citing menopause and ""her naturally hot temper"" as the reasons she regularly screams at my brother slinging verbal abuse like ""you gay piece of filth"" (for crying at her other words), ""worthless, ungrateful waste of my life and love,"" ""sensitive cry-baby""...the list goes on. I'm shocked at the frequency and volume of the names she uses- not the content, because I remember hearing similar things, but at the disturbingly short intervals between explosions. It was usually once a month for me growing up, but I've been home for a month and it's happened twice every fucking day to my brother.

Making this a disaster is the fact that my dad, previously hands-off except to intercept corporeal punishment once a month, is now keenly invested in ""turning my brother around"" or ""changing him."" It makes my blood boil. They now use rhetoric like ""we treated your sister like this and she had self-respect and cared about us, so now she's making us proud"" to ""inspire"" my brother and ""give him a role model,"" but all it does is wedge us apart and make him feel more hopeless about turning things around. I've never seen someone more downtrodden and ashamed of himself for every little thing, and I've furious that my parents see their child like this and only see laziness, defiance, defensiveness, denial of failures, and complacency. I've tried telling them so many times that he just needs to feel their support and love and encouragement instead of their abuse -I've tried so many ways of telling him so many times- and each time they spit out something like ""what is there about him to love and support?"" It makes me want to smash my head into a stove.

Another justification they have is that since I turned out fine given the way they treated/raised me, my brother is the freak, the failure, the weakling. And my mother has convinced herself that constantly taunting him throughout the day about his poor grades, his distracted study habits, his slow comprehension of new topics, his low motivation to excel, is going to ""work."" I think she's always enjoyed letting her own frustrations with her ""malfunctioning"" children air, and then rationalizing them as effective parenting techniques after. And my dad has never been involved in his children's lives or expressed interest in getting to know them as people -I'm grateful he provides for us, obviously- but in the few years I've been gone at college, he's started to lecture at my brother too, just ranting at him like some list of all his failures will spur him into becoming the high-achieving son he wants. My father is successful in the workplace so this isn't him lacking the skills to empathize and persuade people to change- I almost suspect he's taking out his frustrations with his marriage and stilted personal life on his underachieving son. But it's gotten so toxic. Look at the state of my brother.

When I've cajoled him into talking about himself, it's heartbreaking. He moved to a new school after 8th grade and doesn't have a single person in his life he considers a friend. It's so messed up. It's painful, intensely stressful, and constantly sets him on edge making the simplest of interactions with people- which, hey, my parents have noticed, but only shamed him for it, as if this difficulty was something he perversely created for himself to make their lives miserable. It's always about how he inconveniences their lives. When answering a phone call, you can hear his throat tighten so much and his voice feels squashed and suppressed in the back of his throat, as if he's afraid of being heard even while he's trying to sound loud and clear. Even when I talk to him, most of the time his body language is shielding himself from me, his eyes are everywhere else, and he's blatantly doing something else, like browsing on a nearby laptop or folding a piece of paper. I've been through my poorly adjusted phase before, so I can see how clearly he's begging me to keep talking to him, to ask him questions, to listen to him.

He'll do this around other kids his age too, but worse. He can't make eye contact with anyone, mumbles all his words, and comes off in a way that people would call ""very disturbed."" On a questionnaire from school, there was a question asking ""who are you friends?"" and he simply wrote ""no"" on it. Things like that. When we're at social gatherings with families around our community, he actively evades the other kids and spends his time feigning interest in magazines lying around, scrubbing surfaces clean, and occasionally playing with the toddler children. When he's spoken to, he stiffens and turns away with a one-word answer that's usually completely irrelevant to the topic at hand or just disjointed, or simply doesn't respond. His teachers have written things saying that he has trouble with these things too.

It doesn't help at all that my mother spends her time all day sitting around on the Internet instead of actively looking for a job she's afraid of being told she's unqualified for- so she just doesn't try. And I'm getting the feeling she's taking out her frustrations with her own impotence on my brother, and blaming his ""incompetence"" and ""laziness"" as a scapegoat for her own social troubles, like her stutter, her shrill loudness of voice when overexcited, and tendency to repeat herself over other people our family socializes with. I get the sense she's ashamed of him even as she'll claim to the high heavens -often using generalizing super-kumbaya-sounding reasons like ""all mothers would die for their children""- she loves him and just wants the best for him. And this tight leash she has him on, this constant ear-piercing abuse she's filling the house with, my father allying with her only when it comes to dismantling my brother's self-image and thus isolating him further from living people, all this seems so bleak.

I've been doing his homework with him, asking him to point to anything he doesn't understand so that I can resolve it for him on the spot, asking about his favorite things, and arranging simple, encouraging things where the whole family is in a good mood (and thus can't go wrong). But on a recent museum trip it backfired: everyone snapped at each other for wanting to prioritize their time on exhibits differently, and almost immediately went separate ways before meeting up to drive back in silence- of course my mother spat about my father and brother being selfish and too stupid to understand her method of browsing the exhibits. She'll also evade chores as often as she can, already leaves everything -paying bills, filing taxes, researching insurance, gardening, laundry- that's not ""child-rearing"" and cooking/dishes to my father, and stays up online until 4-6 AM so she can sleep in until 1 PM each day.

Her disengagement/externalizing her shame on my brother, and my brother's crippled social skills have gotten so bad that when my aunt (mother's sister) visited with her two daughters (15 and 5) for a week over the summer, she was so disturbed by what she saw around the house (nothing changes when I'm around because ""I'm family,"" so it's no wonder she saw the day-to-day as well) that she's repeatedly called my father and me urging us to consider seeking out therapy for my mother under the guise of ""counseling for the entire family"" and also for my brother. She's even asked my father (he complains to her about my mother's dependency on him, even as she disrespects him and takes him for granted) to consider divorcing her so that my brother could have space and start reclaiming some shred of self-esteem and start making his own decisions instead of simply evading my mother's. My mother's her older sister.

What the fuck can I do? Please, I'm at my wit's end with the toxic environment in the house and I can't stand seeing my brother be systematically destroyed and crippled by a woman who's projecting and denying her own issues while my father stands by idle except to join in shaming sessions against my brother in bursts of frustration. Help! I can't be here forever and I'm so worried about my brother and want to see him see what he's capable of. What concrete steps can I take to put him on the right path?
   
**TL;DR**: MY mother deals with her shame at her social and professional failures/incompetence by screaming vile names at my brother several times a day, by listing tallied past failures in his face, and micromanaging his EVERY action, to the point that he's consistently getting D's and F's in school (almost getting held back last year), doesn't have a single friend in the world, and speaks in a strangely strangled, smothered voice, carries himself with a defensive posture, can't make eye contact with anyone except me, and often replies in social situations with silence or non sequiturs. My father is disengaged except to join my mother in verbally abusing my brother, which I've told him worsens the situation and that my brother needs his help, but after which my father still thinks my brother is ""just lazy, ungrateful, and evil."" What can I do to save my brother from our toxic parents?? Please help us."

See TL;DR at bottom.  Also, has been edited!**

Hey /r/relationships.  I frequently comment but rarely post, so let me know if I’m in the wrong.  I don’t think my boyfriend notices how emotionally manipulative his parents are because he is clouded by so many years of exposure to their berating comments.  Jerry explains that this is just who they are, it's part of their culture, etc. When I think about the possibility of having kids with him, and having out future children exposed to constant judgment, never being good enough… I don’t know how I feel about that.  The way I see it, I have a boyfriend problem and an in-law problem.  Let me know if you agree.

**BACKGROUND:**

I’ll start with a little background about us.  My boyfriend Jerry (21M) and I, Caroline (21F), have been together for 1.5 years.  We met at a university in the central US, and when we graduate in May we are moving to San Francisco for his tech job.  I already have a job there as well.  We have lived together for most of our relationship, and it’s brought us closer together and showed us what it means to be partners.  His parents (late 40s) moved from China to the US east coast, and just recently to San Francisco.  Jerry moved from China to the US as a toddler and speaks English fluently.  He isn’t very in touch with his primary culture, but his parents are traditional Asian parents.  I love them for their kindness, but we do have differences that Jerry mainly attributes to culture.  The other minor character is Jerry’s little brother (13M).  About me:  I am an only-child of a single-mother, in a white family.  So you can see, very different upbringings.   I love his parents, and I want to make every effort to respect them as well as their culture, but their overbearing judgment is grating on my nerves.  Last year, I sent them bamboo for Chinese New Year as a token of good luck, and I’ve spoken to Jerry about how to bridge the gap between our cultures at our future wedding or in our own customs in our home.  I’m trying to be a good future daughter-in-law, but I’m feeling uncomfortable nonetheless.

Jerry and I have a very strong relationship, and we communicate with each other frequently about how we’re feeling.  He is very supportive and patient, and he takes the time to truly understand how I’m feeling.  However, we both are trying to fix our own struggles with communication.  He bottles up his emotions until he’s really upset.  When I’m hurt, I get too emotional and take out my frustration on him.  Regardless, we are happy overall because we have a healthy relationship where we are trying to improve our faults and become better partners.  We have planned an engagement and marriage, and we have a basic timeline laid out.  After moving to SF in May, we plan to be engaged within a year, get married, have kids, etc.  

Jerry told me that his dad is a “master planner.”  When he was in high school, he got Jerry a car on the one condition that he get a job.  Jerry’s dad knew he would realize how difficult minimum wage work is and it would give him the kick he needed to pursue college seriously to set himself up for future employment.  Before, he was an average student.  Well here he is years later, seriously driven to finish his tech degree.  Jerry is here because his dad got his masters in engineering as well years before, and he led Jerry here.  When he struggled to get an internship last summer, Jerry’s dad got him an internship at his company… so he would be offered a full-time position there and he would stay there after graduation.  It might sound innocent, but there was a lot of Inception-level seed planting going on here. Although Jerry makes all of his own decisions, I’ve watched how his parents gently guide him to do what they think is best.  There would be no problem with their generosity if it wasn’t used as leverage.  (I’ll get back to this later… See Jerry’s parents clutching on the purse strings). I haven’t really been handed anything in life, so I guess I’m unsure how to interpret how his parents are willing to give him anything, but for a cost.  He told me that his parents are all doing this as a part of an overarching plan, but he doesn’t see it as being manipulative.  I have always made my own decisions 100%, so I’m not sure how to feel about this.  Is this just normal parental behavior?

**PROBLEM:**

Jerry’s parents bought us tickets for a cruise this January.  And you’re probably thinking, “How the hell is this a problem?”  Of course, that isn’t the problem.  However, it did set the scene for the problem.  Jerry’s dad helped get him an internship at his tech company last summer, and Jerry planned to use some of his internship money to pay for our cruise.  I was elated and so grateful!  No one has ever done something so nice for me.  He was really proud of himself for budgeting for the cruise and planning everything out, but he still happily accepted when his dad offered to pay for it for him.  They also planned a road trip down to Los Angeles for New Year, and this is where things started to get sticky.  We were in SF with his family from 12/21-27, and then the whole family drove down to Los Angeles stopping along the way.  This amounted to multiple hotel rooms (thankfully with Jerry and I in our own room), and lots of criticism from his parents along the way.  I learned on our trip to Yosemite with his parents last year that they get testy when they’re travelling.  Constantly bickering with each other and the kids… it just made me really uncomfortable.  Don’t get me wrong, I was seriously grateful to be there, but I knew I really had no choice in anything.  I was walking on eggshells constantly, and I generally just shut my mouth and put on a smile as to not create tension.  

**Example 1:**  

Boyfriend problem.  Jerry knows I don’t want to eat greasy fast food or Chinese food for 100% of my meals for a week.  However, I know it’s his parents’ trip, so it’s their decision, and I just go with the flow and try to keep a smile on my face.  When Jerry suggested we go to Chipotle for dinner, I asked him if it was okay with his parents.  He said yes, they like Chipotle, plus it will make me happy.  He only suggested it because he knew I wanted to eat something I was more comfortable with, but his parents accepted begrudgingly (of course, criticizing the food the entire time we were there).  Great.  So then I felt guilty because this was essentially my fault, at least in Jerry’s eyes.  Jerry started feeling resentful towards me for wanting something different than his parents, even though I knew not to ask for it.  I tried to act normal around his parents/brother, but I tended to get quiet and just shut down emotionally because Jerry kept continually asking me if every food choice was okay, knowing full well that I was just dealing with it and trying to get through the week like an adult.  I just didn’t understand why he asked me, if the answer didn’t matter.  He essentially set a trap, and I fell for it by taking the bait.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, am I right? 

**Example 2:**  

In-laws problem.  I was feeling really cold in the car immediately after we went horseback riding in 40 degree weather for two hours, so I mumbled to my boyfriend that I was cold and asked him to turn up the heat.  When he asked his parents, they thought he was cold and said judgmental stuff like, “What?  It’s 72.  72 is warm enough. Why do you need it to be warmer?”  As soon as he said “Caroline is cold” they immediately stopped and just turned it up.  I don’t think they want to be rude to me, but they’re making me really uncomfortable with how they’ve been treating Jerry and by association, me.  This one interaction on its own would not really bother me, except stuff like this happened every day, multiple times per day.  Every little thing was criticized.  For an introvert who spent most of her childhood alone, this trip was utterly exhausting for me, both mentally and emotionally.  Jerry and I took the cruise together, and now we’re back at school.  The cruise was dampened a lot by both of our resentment for each other.  He thinks I hate his parents, I think his parents are pushing him around a lot.  It was a mistake for me to rag on them to him.  I was genuinely trying to show him that his parents are emotionally manipulative and I think that judgmental attitude is just really unhealthy.  

**Additional information that makes me uncomfortable for our future:**

* About those purse-strings… Jerry is an authorized user on his mom’s credit card, and so she just puts money into his account.  Consequentially, she tells him when he’s spending too much and can see anything he buys.  Every couple of months, he’ll ask me to buy something on my card and he’ll pay me back in cash because he doesn’t want his mom to see.  When I told him I thought he should get his own bank account (when I thought he could use his savings from his internship), he said he agreed but felt like I was being controlling by suggesting it.  I found out that the funds from the internship are gone and he’s living 100% off of parents’ money.  He says this will change when we graduate.
* On looking for an apartment, they have so much to say about where we need to live, a house vs. apartment, in the city or out of it, etc.  They regularly tell us that we’re wrong.  I get motion sick really easily, so I want to live less than a 30 minute commute each way.  This means either living in the city or very close to it.  They say we need to live further away, even after Jerry tells them the reason.  No matter what, we are never right.  I don’t feel supported either, because I tell him how I feel controlled and he says they’re just trying to help and he appreciates their advice.  I say that if he just wants an insider’s perspective, why not do additional research on his own or look at other testimonies rather than people who have been there for little over a year?  He said I had a point but didn’t really see why I thought the controlling attitude was harmful overall.  He got angry at me for turning him against his parents and “making him choose between us.”

**CONCLUSION:**

I’m not willing to be controlled and manipulated for the rest of my life, and I’m certainly not going to start a family in that environment.  But I don’t feel like he’s willing to stick up for me.  He says he’s trying to be the middleman between what I want and what his parents want, but he doesn’t really think his parents are doing anything wrong.  He resents me for not going along with it.

The real question is, do I even deserve for him to stick up for me?  I’ve seen a lot of people on here say that when you choose to marry someone, you are making them your family, so they become your primary priority.  We have committed to getting married (no engagement yet), so where does this put me?  Should he stick up for me?  Should I just sit tight and deal?  Do you think his parents are being too controlling, or is it not even my business?  If it is, how do I make him see that this is something that’s really important to me?  When do we shut down the controlling attitude?  If they won’t give it up, when do we start setting firm boundaries?

**TL;DR:**  Boyfriend’s Asian parents are being really controlling and he’s stuck between not wanting to be controlled and wanting me to just get used to it.  Do I have the right to say anything about it?  If not, do I get that right when we get married?

**EDIT:**  Thank you to everyone who has replied so far!  You've helped me realize that Jerry's parents aren't being controlling, just helping him figure shit out.  BUT, you've also made me realize that Jerry is acting like a child and relying on his parents too much.  That's his choice.  Key details:  he can't even remember his SSN, he doesn't know how to make his own bank account, he doesn't know how to even view the details of his university account to see how much is charged to him... doesn't remember the password and can't be assed to figure it out.  I understand the last one because his parents do all of it, but it just shows that he is relying on them to take care of everything for him instead of knowing basic information about his life.  Man, I need some advice.  Is there any way to talk to him about really growing up and taking charge or his life, or is this it?  Do I have to choose between playing mommy and breaking up?  Is there a middle-ground here?"
4153gu,6,2016-01-15,[Review] First month and a half on adderall (22/M).,overworkedintern,adderall,https://www.reddit.com/r/adderall/comments/4153gu/review_first_month_and_a_half_on_adderall_22m/,"I am in my senior year of college. I've always known that I have had some sort of attention disorder. I have a 2.5 GPA and my academics have been horrible for as long as I can remember. I come from a medically conservative Hispanic family that does not believe in medication.

I have always done my best to make up for my shortcomings. I have some pretty insane intern experience and am an incredible networker (I'm a business student). In August, I scored an internship with a small investment fund with about $200+ million under management. The tasks I was given were within my abilities but for some reason there was just not enough time in the day. For months I struggled on to keep my head above water while taking a full time course load at my university. I continued to get reprimanded at work and although they were nice to me about my errors most of the time, I could tell that their patience was waining. Depression started creeping in and I felt like nothing was going right. Throughout this time, I wasn't even thinking that ADHD was the issue; I just thought I wasn't trying hard enough.

I needed someone to talk to but I didn't feel comfortable talking to friends and family (People see me as the perfect student; no one knows that I have terrible grades, they just know my great work experience) so I decided to use some of the money I was making for an appointment with a therapist. 

I poured my heart out to this poor old lady and it took 3 sessions for me to paint the entire picture for her. She said that she suspected it may be ADHD so she tested me for it. Low and behold, I got a really high score and she prescribed me 10mg adderall/day to start.

I took it for the first time the next day right before I left for work.  I started feeling really weird and energetic in traffic but thought nothing of it. When I came in to the office, I felt like everything clicked. An assignment that took me a month to get halfway through, took be a single day to finish. Eventually, I was able to handle 3 times the amount of work I was doing pre-diagnosis. Also, for the first time in my academic life, I made all A's 

I noticed changes at home to. For the first time in my life, I was cleaning my room and folding my own clothes. Pre-diagnosis my room would always be a mess and I would take clean and wrinkled clothes from the basket and put them in the dryer to dewrinkle every morning. 

I finally became the person I knew I could be and everything was going great.

Winter break started two weeks into my diagnosis so I was able to work full-time up until my last day which was the end of the year. I noticed that I would be very productive in the morning that I took adderall but I would start slowing down around 1 or 2 (I was taking IR). On days that I had tons of work to do I would self medicate and take an extra 10mg pill in the afternoon. Self medication would happen very rarely at the beginning but I started doing it more and more as I felt my tolerance increasing. I talked to my therapist about my issues and concluded that it would be okay to increase my dosage to 20mg/day (10mg in the morning and 10mg in the afternoon). 

My internship ended 15 days ago and I have cut down my adderall consumption down to 10mg on days that I am studying. I have noticed that 10mg no longer gives me that initial hyperfocus that it gave me before. Although it's not nearly as bad as when I'm not on addy, I do have to put in a sizable amount of effort to get started on any task at hand.

In Conclusion:
Adderall has changed my life. My tolerance is increasing faster than I thought it would be but it may only because I started with a very tiny dose. I actually like the fact that my tolerance requires me to put in extra effort because I am a part of the school of thought that adderall should be supplemental to your efforts, not a total replacement. I take addy only on days that I need it and since I am no longer working, I don't take it very often. My room is getting a little messier but I trick myself into thinking to myself ""What would I do if I was on adderall?"" and I can manage to be a little more productive. I expect to start taking my prescription as intended when school starts next week. I have experienced the euphoria feeling but I have never chased it. I think I can attribute that to the fact that I have an outstanding amount of respect for adderall since I started so late in life compared to people starting in primary or secondary school. When you start, make a schedule of the times you need to eat because you will forget. My general doctor was very concerned that I had accidentally lost 10lbs in a month. Good luck to the newbies. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me!"

While my parents have always had an unhappy marriage without personal respect or affection, our family unit of four has always functioned to the outside world. I excelled in high school and college, my father's career is always moving in a better direction, there's a house in a nice neighborhood with a mortgage we live in, and...actually, that's where the functionality ends. I know I'm lucky to have these conditions, but recent events have left me shaking and almost vomiting with helplessness, rage, and frustration at our inability to leave toxic patterns behind. I feel like they're slowly killing us, and especially ruining my brother and his future.

When we were in grade school, my mother was usually the only parent in charge, and my dad never took responsibility for disciplining, rewarding, or keeping up with us kids' activities, grades, or really lives. If my dad ever told us we could take a break from studying, it was meaningless unless my mother chose to allow it, you get the idea. And when she hit or used other corporeal punishment on us, my dad would laughingly intercede for her to stop (making us cry or beg), which made her threaten to hit us harder after he left. In the cases (usually once a year) where he successfully intervened long enough for her to give up on the corporeal punishment, she would retaliate against him and the child by refusing to talk to, make eye contact with, touch, cook for, or do laundry for the child. She wouldn't take us to school, activities...essentially she boycotted by acting like the child didn't exist for a month each time. I still remember the dread and relief in the pit of my stomach every time she spat, ""You are dead to me"" and started these month-long withdrawals from my life. It always ended with my dad and the child (I'm going to say ""me"" to keep things clearer from now on) begging her and repenting all their wrongful actions and promising to change, usually when my dad got irritated enough by the snowballing demands of parenting and work together. My mother always preceded her ""returns"" to being a parent (she doesn't usually work, stays at home reading online novels except for a three-year period where she worked part-time starting in 2010. She speaks English with a stutter and is defensive about being rejected for jobs based on that because she has a Master's, also refuses to apply for jobs unrelated to her degree) with a lecture about how she always tried to do the best for us, how we always fought her to our own detriment.

The parenting itself, I always thought, gave me access to lessons and tools most young adults would kill to have started so early. My mother always insisted my dad pay for (to his voiced annoyance, sometimes) training and lessons for my brother and me, which I'm still grateful for today. Then there was her other behavior. She would sit in on every lesson taking notes, force us to practice for hours, and expect sensational results because according to her, there was ""no reason we could do less than the best if we really cared."" I still remember car rides home after lessons where she learned we'd performed inadequately (she always asked the oblivious teacher explicitly), and the screaming tirades that didn't stop for the whole forty minutes, about how much money I had wasted, comparing me to pigs in the mud, self-degrading prostitutes, and people who murdered their own parents in cold blood. I'd cry, sit in silence, and usually it would blow over. Also, whenever she ignored me my brother would become the fawned-over golden child, and she'd speak loudly about a mindless pig stinking up the house whenever I was around during those times.

That was another thing, the language she always used. I grew up thinking all parents screamed at their children and called them worthless pigs, unambitious low-lives, and ungrateful traitors. She would say the most horrible things to me that made me feel inadequate, selfish, lazy, and worthless on an almost cosmic level for messing up things like a performance, competition, or a public interaction. Making all these comments a hundred times worse was the fact that she always had a lecture ready listing all the past wrongs we've committed, from slacking off to not following directions to failing to correct our flaws...the list only gets longer as we get older, and it plays every time she gets infuriated.

Growing up, I occasionally performed beyond expectations, and she would praise me, saying that I was smart and talented all along, and that I just needed to focus and ""use heart"" to show it. I got addicted to the rare bursts of validation from my mom and worked hard like a fiend through high school, to my own success. Looking back on that time, she didn't lecture me on anything except regarding chores around the house, and we were all happier when she completely backed out of my life as I took over making all of my decisions related to school and activities. She went from exerting total, painstakingly detailed control over my every action to only insisting on exerting full control over what I wore, how short I kept my hair, and when I could leave the house. But as my tangible achievements tallied up, she would relax and let me go to sleepovers, pick out my own clothes, wear makeup, etc. During this time I actually would talk for hours a day to my mom, telling her about all the plans I had to better myself, updating her on my progress, and how competitive I was with the other kids in my grade. I would say we were close.

Alright. Fast forward a few years after I leave for college and almost never come back because of internships, trips with friends, and visits to our relatives' homes instead, my brother is in high school. I come home this holiday season and am shocked to find that he has been bringing home grades of D and F regularly on his report cards, with only a small handful of A's and B's in the past three semesters of high school. He's completely unmotivated to study, do homework, go to school, plan for college, pick out and improve at his activities (my mom made him do the exact same things I chose in high school, as if that was some magical formula)...essentially he takes every opportunity to hide from my parents and just procrastinate the hours of each day away online. It's heartbreaking to see my brother hiding from reality and counting down each day to the moment he can fall asleep.

My parents, also, have changed. My mother, who's been justifying her job-search inertia with ""taking care of my brother's future,"" has been so much worse to him than I ever remember her being to me. She gets defensive about it when I've tried to explain to her in private (most of her flare-ups with my dad are about microaggressions -some of them very valid, because I see him do the same to me- in which he humiliates her in front of the kids for his pleasure), citing menopause and ""her naturally hot temper"" as the reasons she regularly screams at my brother slinging verbal abuse like ""you gay piece of filth"" (for crying at her other words), ""worthless, ungrateful waste of my life and love,"" ""sensitive cry-baby""...the list goes on. I'm shocked at the frequency and volume of the names she uses- not the content, because I remember hearing similar things, but at the disturbingly short intervals between explosions. It was usually once a month for me growing up, but I've been home for a month and it's happened twice every fucking day to my brother.

Making this a disaster is the fact that my dad, previously hands-off except to intercept corporeal punishment once a month, is now keenly invested in ""turning my brother around"" or ""changing him."" It makes my blood boil. They now use rhetoric like ""we treated your sister like this and she had self-respect and cared about us, so now she's making us proud"" to ""inspire"" my brother and ""give him a role model,"" but all it does is wedge us apart and make him feel more hopeless about turning things around. I've never seen someone more downtrodden and ashamed of himself for every little thing, and I've furious that my parents see their child like this and only see laziness, defiance, defensiveness, denial of failures, and complacency. I've tried telling them so many times that he just needs to feel their support and love and encouragement instead of their abuse -I've tried so many ways of telling him so many times- and each time they spit out something like ""what is there about him to love and support?"" It makes me want to smash my head into a stove.

Another justification they have is that since I turned out fine given the way they treated/raised me, my brother is the freak, the failure, the weakling. And my mother has convinced herself that constantly taunting him throughout the day about his poor grades, his distracted study habits, his slow comprehension of new topics, his low motivation to excel, is going to ""work."" I think she's always enjoyed letting her own frustrations with her ""malfunctioning"" children air, and then rationalizing them as effective parenting techniques after. And my dad has never been involved in his children's lives or expressed interest in getting to know them as people -I'm grateful he provides for us, obviously- but in the few years I've been gone at college, he's started to lecture at my brother too, just ranting at him like some list of all his failures will spur him into becoming the high-achieving son he wants. My father is successful in the workplace so this isn't him lacking the skills to empathize and persuade people to change- I almost suspect he's taking out his frustrations with his marriage and stilted personal life on his underachieving son. But it's gotten so toxic. Look at the state of my brother.

When I've cajoled him into talking about himself, it's heartbreaking. He moved to a new school after 8th grade and doesn't have a single person in his life he considers a friend. It's so messed up. It's painful, intensely stressful, and constantly sets him on edge making the simplest of interactions with people- which, hey, my parents have noticed, but only shamed him for it, as if this difficulty was something he perversely created for himself to make their lives miserable. It's always about how he inconveniences their lives. When answering a phone call, you can hear his throat tighten so much and his voice feels squashed and suppressed in the back of his throat, as if he's afraid of being heard even while he's trying to sound loud and clear. Even when I talk to him, most of the time his body language is shielding himself from me, his eyes are everywhere else, and he's blatantly doing something else, like browsing on a nearby laptop or folding a piece of paper. I've been through my poorly adjusted phase before, so I can see how clearly he's begging me to keep talking to him, to ask him questions, to listen to him.

He'll do this around other kids his age too, but worse. He can't make eye contact with anyone, mumbles all his words, and comes off in a way that people would call ""very disturbed."" On a questionnaire from school, there was a question asking ""who are you friends?"" and he simply wrote ""no"" on it. Things like that. When we're at social gatherings with families around our community, he actively evades the other kids and spends his time feigning interest in magazines lying around, scrubbing surfaces clean, and occasionally playing with the toddler children. When he's spoken to, he stiffens and turns away with a one-word answer that's usually completely irrelevant to the topic at hand or just disjointed, or simply doesn't respond. His teachers have written things saying that he has trouble with these things too.

It doesn't help at all that my mother spends her time all day sitting around on the Internet instead of actively looking for a job she's afraid of being told she's unqualified for- so she just doesn't try. And I'm getting the feeling she's taking out her frustrations with her own impotence on my brother, and blaming his ""incompetence"" and ""laziness"" as a scapegoat for her own social troubles, like her stutter, her shrill loudness of voice when overexcited, and tendency to repeat herself over other people our family socializes with. I get the sense she's ashamed of him even as she'll claim to the high heavens -often using generalizing super-kumbaya-sounding reasons like ""all mothers would die for their children""- she loves him and just wants the best for him. And this tight leash she has him on, this constant ear-piercing abuse she's filling the house with, my father allying with her only when it comes to dismantling my brother's self-image and thus isolating him further from living people, all this seems so bleak.

I've been doing his homework with him, asking him to point to anything he doesn't understand so that I can resolve it for him on the spot, asking about his favorite things, and arranging simple, encouraging things where the whole family is in a good mood (and thus can't go wrong). But on a recent museum trip it backfired: everyone snapped at each other for wanting to prioritize their time on exhibits differently, and almost immediately went separate ways before meeting up to drive back in silence- of course my mother spat about my father and brother being selfish and too stupid to understand her method of browsing the exhibits. She'll also evade chores as often as she can, already leaves everything -paying bills, filing taxes, researching insurance, gardening, laundry- that's not ""child-rearing"" and cooking/dishes to my father, and stays up online until 4-6 AM so she can sleep in until 1 PM each day.

Her disengagement/externalizing her shame on my brother, and my brother's crippled social skills have gotten so bad that when my aunt (mother's sister) visited with her two daughters (15 and 5) for a week over the summer, she was so disturbed by what she saw around the house (nothing changes when I'm around because ""I'm family,"" so it's no wonder she saw the day-to-day as well) that she's repeatedly called my father and me urging us to consider seeking out therapy for my mother under the guise of ""counseling for the entire family"" and also for my brother. She's even asked my father (he complains to her about my mother's dependency on him, even as she disrespects him and takes him for granted) to consider divorcing her so that my brother could have space and start reclaiming some shred of self-esteem and start making his own decisions instead of simply evading my mother's. My mother's her older sister.

What the fuck can I do? Please, I'm at my wit's end with the toxic environment in the house and I can't stand seeing my brother be systematically destroyed and crippled by a woman who's projecting and denying her own issues while my father stands by idle except to join in shaming sessions against my brother in bursts of frustration. Help! I can't be here forever and I'm so worried about my brother and want to see him see what he's capable of. What concrete steps can I take to put him on the right path?
   
**TL;DR**: MY mother deals with her shame at her social and professional failures/incompetence by screaming vile names at my brother several times a day, by listing tallied past failures in his face, and micromanaging his EVERY action, to the point that he's consistently getting D's and F's in school (almost getting held back last year), doesn't have a single friend in the world, and speaks in a strangely strangled, smothered voice, carries himself with a defensive posture, can't make eye contact with anyone except me, and often replies in social situations with silence or non sequiturs. My father is disengaged except to join my mother in verbally abusing my brother, which I've told him worsens the situation and that my brother needs his help, but after which my father still thinks my brother is ""just lazy, ungrateful, and evil."" What can I do to save my brother from our toxic parents?? Please help us."

My mother is utterly distraught and taking time off to be with her. 

While she is gone, I have stepped up to fill the mother role: getting my brother ready for school, cooking dinner, making sure my brother gets where he needs to be for all of his extra-curricular activities (he's in middle school band and show choir). On top of having started my first big girl internship it has been stressful, but nothing compared to how strung out my mother feels.

Like I said in the title this past one week has been just a glimpse of parenthood and it is just fucking enough for me. Trying to get this little shit to school on time was like sticking bamboo shards under both of our nails. Don't get me wrong, this kid is the world to me, but he also makes me want to slit my wrists with a dull spoon on off days. On the other side, I got to watch his first show choir exhibition and I was just so goddamn proud I teared up.

However this entire week has done nothing but worsen my acute alcoholism and further solidify my already resounding ""no"" to having children.

Thanks for reading, cheers!"
416eot,9,2016-01-15,I don't know how to handle this situation at work.,WildlifeAnalysis,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/416eot/i_dont_know_how_to_handle_this_situation_at_work/,"I work as a programming intern at a major tech company. I like the company but I don't really like my particular job. I've been working there as an intern for a year. I graduate in May, at which point my internship will end. Traditionally, when you finish your internship, you'll hopefully get a full time position at the company, depending on what positions are available. It's normal to end up taking a job that isn't with your current team.

Today, my boss had a chat with me. (My boss is normally a pretty nice guy, btw.) He told me that when I graduate, I won't be able to get a job with my current team because I'm ""not the right fit."" I felt awful at first because I thought he was firing me. But then he said that my internship is going to continue like normal. I asked if I could still get a position on another team, and he said yes. We talked about potential positions on other teams, and who I should talk to about them. He asked me to send him my updated resume so he could send it around and help me find something. We've already had conversations like this before, but this one was different because of the rejection part.

I feel very confused right now, and a little sad. I'm not sure what to do. If my boss had just told me that I couldn't get a job on our team because there are no positions available, I would have been totally cool with that. But why would he tell me that I'm not the right fit for the team, even though I still have four months left working on the team for my internship? How am I supposed to feel motivated at work when I know that I have no future on the team and my boss doesn't want me there?

During our conversation, he mentioned that since I'm close to graduating, I should be able to get a full time position even though I don't have my degree yet. So was this conversation his way of indirectly firing me by suggesting that I quit?

I have depression, but the way. I'm very mentally unhealthy. Everyone else at work is so enthusiastic about their jobs and I'm not. In the past I've gotten fired from a programming job for not fitting in, (although they didn't say that explicitly,) and it looks like the same thing is happening again. This time I didn't ask my boss to clarify what he meant when he said I'm not the right fit, because I didn't want to hear it. Last time I got fired from a job for ""not being the right fit"" it really hurt.

I don't know. I don't understand what the point of this conversation was. Do you guys have any insight?"

416mlv,396,2016-01-15,I tried to shitlord a patient today.,AddyPose,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/416mlv/i_tried_to_shitlord_a_patient_today/,"I'm a nurse in a hospital on a cardiac unit who just finished a 12 hour shift so bear with my ramblings. The majority of my patients are obese, but a lot of them think they are normal because they are not ""deathfat"" or bedbound from their weight. (I mean if that's their measure of their quality of life whatever) Most of the time I can't say much besides ""try eating more fresh vegetables and going for walks"" because telling someone directly ""you need to eat less"" ""you need to lose weight"" will probably result in low patient satisfaction scores. So I leave that conversation for the residents and interns to practice. (lol just kidding I've yet to see a doctor tell a patient straight that their excess weight caused their condition). 

So the patient in question wasn't even my assigned patient. I guess maybe that's why I had the balls to say what I did. This is a 50-something year old male, BMI of at least 40, I'm guessing 5'7"" 275 lbs or so. He's in with alcohol withdrawal plus some heart arrhythmia issues. He puts on the call light and I answered because his nurse was busy and I'm trying to help out. He says he ""needs to go number one and two."" Alright, well I see he's hooked up to an IV with a medication infusing that's meant to try and control his heart rate, plus he also has IV fluids running at a fast rate to try and keep his blood pressure up while we slow down his heart. So I knew I wasn't going to try and walk this guy to the bathroom. Luckily there was a bedside commode in his room. I asked if he could stand and sit on the commode and he replied in the affirmative. 

While I'm helping him to the commode he comments how I'm so much nicer than *other nurse.* I ignore this because I know *other nurse* is awesome and nicer than me, and this type of statement from patients automatically puts me on alert because it's something they try to use to manipulate and garner sympathy. (can you tell I've become more cynical over the years?) 

Patient sits on commode and immediately states ""Wow this thing is tiny!"" And for some reason at that moment, instead of ignoring or laughing along with the patient, my overly-suppressed inner shitlord said deadpan, ""No, this is our standard large sized commode."" Which was true. It was not a bariatric-sized commode but it was a ""large"" size, which is pretty much all our hospital stocks. The regular sized commodes you see if you search ""bedside commode"" look legitimately tiny next to what this guy was perched on. 

He was amused by my response, and said ""You're just trying to make me feel bad."" 

Well anyway, I stood just outside his door to give him some privacy. So I heard clearly when his stream of urine hit the floor instead of inside the commode bucket, and his mumbled, ""Aw fuck."" 

I poked my head in the door, knowing what I would find. ""Are you alright?"" I asked the grown man who has soaked his boxers, socks, and created a puddle of urine on the floor. 

He was apologetic and embarrassed, though later I found out from *other nurse* that this was probably the 3rd or 4th time this happened today. He complained, ""There's not enough space for both my butt and my junk!"" (his words.)

As I tossed some towels on the floor I said matter of factly, ""Looks like your stomach is just too big and in the way."" 

""No it's not that!"" he said, ""There's literally no room! It's like a softball size space!"" He then demonstrated for me by attempting to shove his fupa and penis down into the toilet of the commode.

I didn't say anything in reply, just helped clean up the mess. I've learned long ago if people don't want to hear the truth, it's not worth trying to force it on them.

At least this guy wiped his own ass. "

A plea from a Pre-Comp.E. major",chemicalphysicist,fsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/fsu/comments/416t97/opinions_on_calculus_ii_physics_a_1st_yr/,"Just as the title states. I'm a Freshmen-Spring Semester Computer Science major switching into Computer Engineering. I'm behind on Calculus, as I was unable to take it in the first semester, so I have to do something to catch up if I want to do the degree in four years.

[Here is my current plan for my classes.](http://i.imgur.com/InBDBf2.png) (THE CURRENT SEMESTER IS FRESHMEN-SPRING) I am an average student with average work ethic (I got A's in my fall semester classes [Discovering Physics was pass or fail, please ignore that]), so I'm not entirely sure if I'm capable of any super loaded semesters (I am thinking about trying one of those eventually). My current GPA is 3.48. The plan will complete all of the F.S.U. requirements for liberal arts, statewide core requirements, and anything else you can think about (I've triple checked!)

**My Main Concerns:**

1. Am I being smart by trying to complete this in four years, or would doing it in 4.5 years (I'm an out-of-state student, but will have in-state tuition by this upcoming Summer of my Sophomore year (the one with General Physics A)) not be that big of a deal and better for me in terms of learning the material (being less stressed, spreading out the material over time so I can focus more intensely on each of the subjects and get a better understanding).

2. As a related question to #1: I really enjoy programming projects and having personal projects in general (currently working on personal website now, an Android app, studying for CompTIA A+ certificate (and eventually CCNA), and other programming projects (mostly focused on games with C++/OpenGL/other common libaries and learning Python/Java/common libraries)). I list these to try and convey how much I enjoy my free-time and being able to use it to the best of my abilities... and I don't want to lose it to a super loaded course schedule that'll have me stressed and give me no time to pursue any of these (or future projects). Am I wrong in prioritizing these projects over my education (and thus should I be more open to the larger credit counts), or is it okay to have these side projects to pursue?

3. I want to do internships eventually, but where would those fit in with a 4-year plan or a 4.5-year plan? 

4. Should I be more concerned about not taking any summers off? Is that a necessary part of having a relaxed life? I don't think that I do well with breaks as I like to have myself being occupied most of the time, and I got into a fairly bad and distracting habit during one summer during highschool, so my original thought was to not take any summers off (that, and I love to learn... so it seemed like a good fit).

I'll edit with any more questions that I can think of here with an already included ""edited"" section... thanks for reading this ^too long post! :D

419jri,0,2016-01-16,How I graduated college loan free and I hope these personal experiences will help future college students,lpiratel,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/419jri/how_i_graduated_college_loan_free_and_i_hope/,"College loans are a never ending topic here at PF and I just want to say that kudos to those who seek helps in dealing with these situations. For me, it's all about preventive action and I hope through my experience somehow will get the same result - graduate college debt free.


Start out in high school - it was 2006 when i graduated high school and got accepted into UCI (yup just UCI :( ) and few other Cal states. I was indecisive with my major and through the college workshop provided at school, i knew exactly how much it would cost me to attend these universities. At the same time, my parents whom worked minimum wages worked a ton of overtime in the past few years are getting ready to buy a house. After applying FAFSA, i did not qualified for any aid. So i decided to go with community colleges near my house and transfer after two years. I worked part times and grind it out.

Fast forward to 2 years, i was no where near transferring and STILL DON'T KNOW what i want to major in; however, although i'm not qualify for grants, i was qualified for California fee waiver in which I don't have to pay for any credits. only books and other materials.   I met my girlfriend which she is now my fiancee. We talked and somehow I was motivated to finish CC and transfer. It took me another 2 years to finally get all the credits to transfer. within that 2 years, I continued to work part time and I saved at least 4k getting ready for universities for engineering degree.

At the University:
I transferred to CSULB while all my friends went to Cal Poly Pomona and get to experienced dorming or sharing a SFR house. At this point you may know that i'm still staying with my parents paying $200 dollars a month everything included and this right here saved me a lot of money. yes I missed out all the partying and the private life with mom nagging at me for going out too late, or over little thing but i'm telling you. if you can suck it up everything will be worth it. The tuition for classes alone is approximately 7k annually at my first year and gradually increased up to 9k I believed. So with the money I saved I put it all in tuition and book and started with 12 units. I continued to work part time (20 hours /week; 10$/ hr), still have the same girlfriend with monthly anniversary dinner (yes we do it every month and we still do it now) and live with my parents.

During my stay at CSU, i met a bunch of friends and soon learn that in the engineering field, you don't have to buy books. there a PDF version available online for download or if you are nice enough, your friends whom are one or two semester ahead of you will let you borrow it. I also learned one thing, there is a flat tuition price after you registered a certain units in the semester. For example: if you take 12 units. it will cost you 3.5k/ semester, but if you take 15 units, it will be 4k, but any other units after that such as 21 units, will still be 4k that semester. 

Knowing that, i took advantaged of this and come my second semester, i took 18 units have all the books for classes without paying a single bucks. The next two semesters, I continued to take  21 units and 19 units respectively and had to pay for a few books here or there. but by doing that. I saved approximately 6-8k in tuition annually by cutting my time there shorter. 

Let me tell you this, it was not easy it was never easy and till this day I still don't know how I balanced everything out but I was pretty much at school M-Thurs from 7am - 10pm and then work on the weekend. All the part time money that I worked? went straight to tuition, I""m pretty much didn't have the college life that you see on the movie, but at this point i knew i was on the right track. At one point, i lost my job and that was my single source of income. my family and SO helped me out but i don't want to be their burden, so I was forced to take out a 5k subsidize loan. Soon, I got creative and start out a tutoring business at the library which I learned while I was studying at my local library. at first it was 1 kid for $10/hr. soon, I was managing 4 kids at the same time and we do this 2 hours a day, 3 days a week. 

I did this for a while but soon come the fafsa application for the last semester  (i took a total of 5 semesters, 2 years and a half and graduate in the fall instead of spring) of my college because i was working in cash, i actually qualified for grants for my last semester. With the grants, my last semester was free however, i was stuck in a 5k debt i took out last year for tuition. Taking experiences from my friends whom graduated one-two semester ahead of me, I started to apply for internship. I do this almost everyday and sent out roughly 10 applications a day. I am encouraging you to do this since starting out is always hard but it will get even harder once you graduated college without any skills in your field. 

I finally got an internship  with a big aerospace company right next to my engineering building. I sent out 100+ of application, so don't give up if you get rejected. LB affiliated with many aerospace companies and we do have a huge secret laboratory lab full of cool stuffs. It was my first internship and i learned a ton there, the skills that i acquired here in 1 day is worth all my time spent going through colleges. I was getting paid $16/ hour and working 30 hours a week while taking 19 units worth of classes. noted i'm still in my second to last semester. At that same time, my gf also got transfer to Fullerton major in accounting (after she dropped out of nursing school; yes she is super smart but it was not meant for her), we get smarter with budgeting our money...all of this before i learned bout PF on reddit. we decided to suck it up and continue to stay with our parents and use that money and save it to pay of my 5k debt when i graduated. 

Graduated: So that time came and i graduated, the loan is interest free for 6 months so instead of waiting for 6 months, the first that i did was making installments. there were actually two loan, 1 sub and one 1sub total of 5k with the interest rate averaging 4% for each loan. I paid off the interest loan first and did installments on the other.

back to my job, i got offer a full time position at the lab...but not here in California but in Seattle (by now you should know what company i was interning for), the dum me back then didn't want to leave my gf and my family so i declined their offers...but don't do this, never ever do it, i actually regret it because i love working with plane and yea i regret it everyday :(. that was my dream job, doing something i love, with great prospect and free tuitions. if i can turn back time i would, but hey we are human right?

so i'm gonna stop here because that is how i graduated debt free. it wasn't easy at all, taking a ton of classes while going to work, managing a girlfriend while living with your parents? yes i was pretty much gave up everything that a sub 24 years old guys would do, but I did it and to be honest, it is the best feeling in the world when you have no debt and your career is bright ahead of you. if you want to know what happened after i declined my very first engineer job i would love to update it but i'm gonna stick to the topic for now. 

This is my first time posting and I know there are probably a lot of errors on grammar as well missing a few things or there. So kindly forgive me. I hope this help after seeing so many posts struggling with loans. i'm no where near perfect and I was lucky to have a family that let me leech off of them and a gf that was very patience with me and understand me. 

TLDR: graduated high school, got accepted to UC but went to community colleges and did the transferring method to save money. Worked my ass off, studied my ass off, live with my parents until i'm 25. Graduated with no loan.

419lvb,5,2016-01-16,Barrett for medical school?,wfx1234,ASU,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASU/comments/419lvb/barrett_for_medical_school/,"As someone who plans to go to medical school after receiving my undergraduate degree, how will attending Barrett versus simply ASU affect my chances for admission? 

I've heard that Barrett is a lot more time consuming with its Human Event class, honors credits, and thesis, which might negatively affect my GPA and make it more difficult to do hospital volunteering, internships, and research aside from the thesis. Barrett also costs a fair amount more money over the course of 4 years, so it would have to significantly help with medical school admissions for me to spend the extra money.

On the other side, I've heard that Barrett makes it easier to receive research/internship opportunities, and they have advisers that make the process easier. I have also read that Barrett students get priority registration, so I'd like to hear if this does indeed make a significant difference in getting the classes I want. In terms of the room/board advantages of Barrett, I live right next to ASU and won't need to live/eat on campus.

Also, as an FYI, I plan to major in computer science with a minor in bio/chem, if that makes any difference in terms of honors credits or research opportunities."

Essentially it was just a security guard position. I applied and got accepted, elected to work weekend nights from 2100-0600 (yes, I'm an idiot.) The school also contracted out to the local PD to have an officer up there from 1800 to around 0200. 

I worked with some great officers during my two years there. One of them, while he was a fantastic guy and I loved hanging out with him, was apparently cursed. EVERY night he worked something strange/awful/hilarious would happen. And it just so happened he always worked fridays. We'll call him ""Sgt. B""

So I roll into the office that night to get my gear and he's there already. We start bullshitting as usual. I go on my rounds and keep an ear on the radio. 

We made it till 0100 until the first call came in (it was a pretty sleepy campus). Thankfully it was actually a good one. Someone heard meowing coming from under a storage shed and we went to check it out. Just a little kitten and momma wasn't around. We got her out and ""dawwwwed"" for a bit before animal control took her.*

So that's done. We're back in the office just hanging out. 0150, ten minutes before he's supposed to leave, Sgt. B starts getting his stuff to go home and he jokes about the cat being the most exciting thing he's dealt with that day. THAT'S when the radio goes off. Shit.

""Unit 19, dispatch.""

""Dispatch, 19. Go ahead.""

""Reports of...umm...reports of a horse loose on campus near the arts center...with a...a...naked man riding it...""

Pause. ""Roger that, we'll check it out.""

I'm trying to figure out if I should laugh or cry at this point, and Sgt. B looks like he's about to do the latter. Hop in his car and drive the 500 yards over towards the parking lot of the arts building. Suuuure enough, there's a horse. With a guy on top of it. With no clothes. Balls and ass flapping in the wind uggghhhhh.

He's just prancing around in circles and the horse doesn't seem too bothered despite the guy singing loudly, and terribly I might add, Bohemian Rhapsody. I'm just flabbergasted at this point and the Sgt looks about the same. But we approach and start chatting with the guy who's clearly lost his marbles. We didn't smell any alcohol, and after a few minutes managed to get him to climb down where he just stands there, hugging this poor horse like it's a life buoy in a sea of his insanity. 

It takes us damn near fifteen minutes to get a name out of him, since apparently he didn't think to stick his ID up his asscrack before leaving home. At some point another officer shows up but has to stay in his car for a minute because he's laughing so hard. 

Turns out the guy was supposed to be on meds for some psych condition but hadn't taken them, and also ran a boarding home for horses. He wasn't acting violent or /too/ unstable, so we made the call to just have his wife take him home for the night and get the horse back to the barn. Guy gets a ride home (after giving him a pair of pants), horse gets loaded up into a trailer and that's that. 

Sgt. B and I get back in his car, by now it's almost 0400 and he's hating life. 

Sgt B: ""I've got to be up at seven for day shift, what the fuck.""

Me: ""Dude, you're cursed, I swear to god. Did you piss off a gypsy or something?""

Sgt B: ""I ain't ever arrested one, so I don't think so. But holy shit this is getting stupid.""

Me: ""Y'know what, your new name is Officer Shitmagnet.""

Sgt B: ""...I won't even argue with that.""

*Said kitty was actually adopted by Sgt B a week later. We're hoping it's somehow turned his god-awful luck around but I seriously doubt it. 

Hope ya'll enjoyed! "

She is a Saudi national who lives in Egypt. We hit it off quite well, and were romantic with one another, though we never officially dated. We continued to talk after she went back to Egypt, but after a while the distance just got to be too much. We drifted apart, but have remained friends sporadically talking here and there. 

About two weeks ago I messaged her, and she didn't reply. I thought it was odd, so I persisted, and come to find out she is back with her ex. I dont know a lot about his guy, but while I was with her he would occasionally call and yell in Arabic. In some of those phone calls he would threaten to tell her parents she was fucking an infidel though this is not the case. He even at one point made a fake fb profile, and tried to flirt with me as a girl. 

Obviously this guy is a little crazy, but my friend insists its a good fit. I'm extremely concerned. I asked to talk to her over the phone about it, but she said she didn't want to upset him, and that he's very jealous. After that she removed me from all social media, and skype. I'm really at a loss for what to do here. My only avenue for communication is email. 

The worst part of it is she said 'this relationship could lead to marriage very soon'

Is there anything I can do to help her? 


EDIT: I suppose its also worth mentioning that I helped set up 2 step verification on her email as she was scared he would try, and hack it. Apparently he had gotten her FB before.

It's hard to make friends in this town, given the aging population and a very 'redneck' youth culture. Of course there are people from the university but it's a very small population, and I really don't connect too well with some of the people I've met here.Over these past few months I made a really good (perhaps you could call 'best') friend who is a classmate from the same program. We decided to share an apartment and pretty much do everything together. We haven't really professed this 'label' of being best friends to each other but to me, it is rightly so.

There's this ongoing joke of a 'bromance' from other friends because we're usually a package deal to any event in school or elsewhere. But things turned out pretty fast and now he just decided to take an internship in a far off city. Although it's still in the same country and there's that chance of seeing each other occassionally while we are still here, I am already feeling very lonely and am obsessing over when that moment comes that he leaves.

I've never had such a strong connection - a person who is essentially much the same person as me. It's hard to find someone who you can talk to and have good agreements and has the same way of thinking as you. Before you ask, it's not any romantic/sexual feelings I am having but more of a brotherly thing in which I can be confident and talk to someone with no filters. 

I'm just not sure how to deal once my friend leaves - me living in a town with no one to talk to in the apartment, hang out with etc. I have other friends of course but no one comes close to this buddy.

I've worked and travelled around abroad during my younger years but this is the first time I'm feeling that a part of me is being ripped off. I'm feeling a little bit paralysed. We've discussed about how hard it will be for both of us once he leaves but will try to get in touch, although it won't be the same not hanging out w/ him regularly. Of course we will have those moments we've shared these past few months but the idea of not being to be in touch (or perhaps, be completely out of touch) kills me.
   
**tl;dr**: My best friend is leaving for another town, don't know how to deal."
41d3wq,1,2016-01-17,Tonight I hit a new low.,Anon09215,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/41d3wq/tonight_i_hit_a_new_low/,"Tonight I really shocked myself.
I've been in a deep depression for several weeks now and it always wreaks havoc on different areas of my life. I stop doing work at work, or stop going altogether. I stop trying to keep in touch with people and then get even more depressed when I'm not hearing from them.

I'm (25 f) dating someone (29 m) who has had depression too and is really understanding about it, and he's the only one I feel comfortable opening up to about how bad it really is. He is basically my only support because I alienate everyone else. And tonight I really fucked up.

We went out for his roommates birthday and I probably shouldn't have been there because I was in a terrible mood and was in his bed all day. His roommate is an assistant to a major film producer and my bf is an actor so he was out to get to know some of his connections. I was feeling really misanthropic and antisocial but I didn't want to be alone... I drank a little too much, lost track of my sweatshirt and then got irrationally upset about it and smashed a glass on the floor under the table and ran out of the bar and took an uber home.

I am really embarrassed. My guy was still texting me a little during my ride home and was being pretty gentle with me all things considered, and instead of begging for forgiveness for behaving like an asshole I got mad that he didn't follow me out of the bar.

That's when he lost his patience and told me that his roommates friends started asking him why he was seeing someone like that, and that he was embarrassed by what I did and didn't want to talk to me. I tried calling him 3 times but he didn't pick up. I honestly cannot believe I've become this way and I feel like maybe no one should be dating me. Right now I'm feeling pretty suicidal and out of control. As far as the party, I don't think anyone really major was there maybe just some other twentysomething interns for the producer, but I hate to think that my behavior might be causing my bf to lose out on professional connections too. I really just can't believe that I did that. 

tl;dr   Tonight I got drunk and smashed a glass on the floor over losing a sweatshirt and I'm wondering how the hell I became a person who acts like that and whether I should admit myself..."
41db19,5,2016-01-17,"I got dumped yesterday, just a little rant and things I experienced and how I screwed up. Probably couldn't post this on the main page though.",_smosbol_,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/41db19/i_got_dumped_yesterday_just_a_little_rant_and/,"I'm a 25 year old guy and I have been seeing this 20 year old girl since september. The 'relationship' started in november, but when I look back, there wasn't really a relationship and I made loads of mistakes and the blue pill took over eventually.

The first thing that bothered me and was a pretty obvious mistake was me always agreeing to date when she had some spare time. She was still in school and has a hobby she's thorougly invested in, she had to practise three times a week. I do my work during the day, exercise and hang out with my bro's, so I had more spare time than her. She could only hang out on sunday evenings and occasionaly on tuesday or wednesday. I knew what I was doing but I was blind, and I always arranged myself to fit in her schedule. She also lives about 50 miles from where I live so I could only see her when she was staying at her dorm. I always waited on her when she arrived by train on sunday evenings. I stood there every week, without exception, even when I didn't feel like it. Another grave mistake.

I noticed that things were fun when we hung out, but when we didn't see each other for a couple of days, there was almost radio silence. I thought I was doing good at not texting if not necessary and only to get together, but she wasn't texting me also, and if a girl you're interested in doesn't text you or contact you in some way chances are she's not interested.

I thought I had a unicorn because she was a virgin, from a conservative family, with decent hobbies and a good work ethic. I valued this too much and in the end I valued her more than she valued me, although I was slightly out of her league, which doesn't  matter at all if you start getting too comfortable.

I thought I had what I needed, and the moment I started thinking that, I started losing her. I took her virginity after a couple of months and took it really slow. She invited me to her home to meet her family so I genuinly thought I was doing good, but in the meantime things didn't change, I still tried to fit myself into her life while she didn't try to fit hers in mine. 

I went to Japan for two weeks with two buddies and had a really good time but with her still in the back of my head. After that I also didn't see her for two weeks because she also has exams at school. I thought things were going really slow and it wasn't all that great, but I was ready to try and make the best out of it, which was also a great mistake. She invited me yesterday to her place and I felt she was going to drop the bomb on me from a couple of days beforehand. The signs were pretty clear. She didn't thumbs up my new facebook profile picture, which sounds arbitrary and childish, but if 'your' girl is liking profile pics of other people and not yours it's probably a sign. She was also very short when she contacted me to hang out.

She made me come to her dorm in the city where she studies. I had to take a train for ten minutes to get there. She opens the door, I'm happy to see her, I kiss her but I feel that she dried up almost entirely. We go upstairs and she starts explaining with a shaking voice while twitching with her head how she noticed that she didn't miss me during the month while I was gone. She also told me that since she got an internship close to where she lived and she was moving out of her dorm, it was going to take some effort to meet up with me and since she wasn't 'enough' in love with me, she didn't really feel like it. She also told me cut and dry that she just wanted to do other stuff. She also tried to guilt trip me for not being there for her during her exams, which was nonsense because she never contacted me either and would've resented me even more if I tried to contact her more often.

I basically thought I had a chill girl who didn't need a lot of attention from me. I was wrong. She wanted attention, but just not from me. She kept me on the line as long it was convenient for her and she didn't need to put in too much work to see me. I got too comfortable and I was blind, so I didn't see all of this until yesterday. End of rant.

41ddu2,2,2016-01-17,[Story] My State of the Year Speech,Urban_Blabbermouth,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/41ddu2/story_my_state_of_the_year_speech/,"Every year, the President of the United States gives a State of the Union speech.  Following in his example, I shall give a State of My Year speech.

Ladies and Gentlemen of the Universe, the State of My Year was good.  The first thing is that I made it to the end of the year in one piece. I am still alive and well.  Whatever the good time or the bad time, here I am and to me this is the best news.  Interestingly enough, I feel that have gotten wiser but I could not tell you one wise thing.  I don't know how that is.  My car also made it to the end of the year alive and well.  It's ten years old.  That like sixty in people years.  I can relate.

First the bad news.  There has been lots of illness in my family, from cancer, to knees, to back, and some other things.  We are still here and working on improving our health. This year, we have run up against the limits of The Science of Medicine and crossed into The Art of Medicine.  We ran into the limits of what doctors truly know and entered into the trial and error phase. ""Let's do this and see what happens, then we will react to the results.""  Scary, but what other choice do we have?  Doctors do not know everything as much as try try.

My father's treatments have worked so far.  Knock wood.  He is in good spirits and we expect that he will recover.  My health has not gotten any worse but I do have some aches and pains that come from aging.  I am the knees previously mentioned.  Just getting older and slower.  I like to go ooh and aah as I get started moving.  My own personal sound effects.  It sound worse than it is.   

I had little personal troubles other than my ailments, at least nothing out of the ordinary.  Just the usual stuff of life.  One of the utility companies did some stupid billing, some dumb thing with the meter.  I am still struggling with them on that.  My credit card was stolen in the breach of Home Depot, Target, or some other place.  I don't know where the theft came from but I did shop in those places.  The bank caught it and dealt with it.  I ask them for more information but they did not want to say fearing that the thieves learn from it.

The good news is that I have stated going to church in the middle of the week.  I go to the big church in the downtown area.  It is a huge Cathedral with the ancient architecture of spires and gothic trimmings.  The place is always full of people.  I light a candle and offer prayers for my family, friends, and even those people with whom I am in dispute starting with the utility company.

I am still married.  Not that there was any threat in this area but I want to acknowledge my wonderful wife and how much I still love her and want to keep her around for some more years.

The company where I work had improved economics and so management announced some pay increases .  This is the first increases since the pay freezes when the downturn began seven or more years ago.  Hopefully it is a good sign that the economy is getting better all across the country and the world.  I have gotten used to living with limited means and don't plan to change no matter what pay increases come my way.

I have met some nice people particularly the interns in my office.  They seem so young and so lost.  They are going to school but have no real definite shape to their future.  They go to college and hope that their future works out in some way.   I wonder if some person many years older than me would have said same of me.  There is one fellow who wants to be an Opera singer.  That unusual but here he is studying business.  I would have advised him to give up the business study for now and concentrate of the singing.  He can always take up a business career later if singing doesn't work out.  One intern wants to be a lawyer.  Sheesh, we have enough of those but who am I to say otherwise.

Lastly, blogging has been interesting.  I can write anything I want and there is at least a handful of people who want to read it.  Blogging has been tougher than I thought.  It takes so much time to get it right.  So many times I have had to start over or to throw out an idea because I ran out of something to say after three sentences.   I now have a fine appreciation for those authors who turn out book after book every year. 

I do not know what will happen in the new year but right now, I feel blessed.  Maybe that extra week day visit to Church to pray has more to do with it.  One never really knows where and when God decides to show up to deliver His Blessing but you do know that He is always there.

Happy New Year and may God bless you all

41dgsg,7,2016-01-17,"M - 31, San Diego, California. Making video games isn't all its cracked up to be..... what a trap, such stress, very debt, wow.",justifications,lifeinapost,https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeinapost/comments/41dgsg/m_31_san_diego_california_making_video_games_isnt/,"I think theres something to be said to teach people/children to think critically. It honestly took me going to art school to ""learn how to learn"" before I could strive for self-actualization.

My broken path was basically.... graduate from high school, immediately join the workforce because my parents followed that path, and I didn't have much of an interest in going to college. I had no clue what I wanted to do at 18 years of age. At the time, my then girlfriend convinced me to attend my local community college, I didn't take it seriously and essentially failed myself out of it. Worked retail jobs that I hated for about 5 years before making a switch to ""get in to computers"" as I was always crafty with the machines. Ended up being a dude who sold computers at BestBuy, then switched over to various places working as a help desk technician. 

THEN THE FINANCIAL CRASH OF 2007ish. I lost my job, I couldn't find any work, and I was beginning to find debt as a solution. I determined that I wanted to go to school at that point because I learned that ""game design"" was a thing you could go to school for. I picked the best school I could find, because gaming was the only thing I was passionate about.

So I get accepted to art school, convince myself that I need to make this work, and I worked my ass off to try to A- get an internship during the summers, and B- graduate with a job lined up before receiving my diploma. I was successful on both, two internships, and I was hired before I even graduated (still graduated). I went on to work for EA (Maxis), and eventually my studio got shut down after some moderately questionable studio decisions, but thats this industry.

Since then, I've been unemployed (again) and I have been looking for work non-stop. I'm basically 1 step away from being homeless, and so I moved in with my girlfriend's parents. I'm 31. In the time since my layoff, I've been constantly working to upgrade my portfolio site to prove to employers that I should be hired, and I'm employable. Each month that passed, I worked on a new project and I was contacted by another studio for an interview, or an art test. First it was Bioware, then it was Bungie, then a few months were quiet, but GDC (game developers conference) happened. 

Then Cities Skylines released in March, and I started modding it out of sheer love of the game. Someone took notice, suggested to me that I set up a Patreon account, which I did, almost as a joke. Moments after setting it up, literally the next morning, Kotaku senpai noticed me and created an article based off of my creations. This generated so much PR for me, something that I was hoping would result in a job offer. Alas, one never came, but suddenly I was being paid to create this artwork for people? So that has to mean something. Eventually, multiple articles were written, I kept getting lots of interview requests, it was great. A couple of big name youtube guys talked about my efforts, how I was supporting myself though Patreon... but the reality was, it wasn't enough money to REALLY pay off these student loans Ive buried myself in. I also kinda wanted to still work in this industry as well, you know, at a ""real job"" like a good cog in the wheel, but the type of content I was creating in Skylines wasnt cutting it.

So I decided that I should get back to focusing on other aspects of my personal development. I took up learning how to create particle FX in games, also known as VFX. I made a demo reel over the course of about a month, and suddenly I had Blizzard knocking on my door asking me to do an art test for them because they liked my reel. I was super excited to have a chance to work at my favorite company from my childhood, AND THEN I PASSED THE ART TEST! I was blown away, I thought I'd never get the chance to talk with them. But -- as the wheel turned, I ended up being declined after an interview with the team, they decided I was not a good fit.

Struggle continues, and there would be many more art tests to come that would continue down in to the next year. Its now 2016, and I've already applied to 60+ jobs in the last 2 weeks. That effort has not been met in vain, as I've actually been talking with four different studios lately for potential fits. I'm working on one art test, and I'm bidding a salary at another location -- so things might finally be looking up. Its just amazing to me that after all this time, after a lot of self discovery and hard work, I just kinda feel like the deck is stacked against me.

I'm genuinely surprised as to how hard it is to obtain a good job in the world of game art and design. If I had to choose to do it all over again, I wouldnt. Not for this much stress. Its literally not worth the effort. I'm practically burned out, but merely from my overzealous attempts at finding a dependable wage. No matter the expanse of my knowledge, the jobs are nearly impossible to find, the wage is relatively competitive but only with itself, and there are 1000s of kids every year fresh-out of college gunning for your job right next to the dude who just got laid off from ""x-company"" who now has 6+ years of seniority on you. Goodluck, have fun... they say.

Anyway this post is a lot longer than I anticipated, and I sorta feel like im typing in to the abyss tonight because I'm about to hit the hay, but you know... life, and stuff.

41elov,18,2016-01-17,"I was dumped yesterday by a girl who without knowing helped me conquer my anxiety. The relationship lasted about 5 months and it wasn't great, but I valued it enormously and now I'm very emotional.",_smosbol_,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/41elov/i_was_dumped_yesterday_by_a_girl_who_without/,"The girl was 20 and I am 25. I met her in a city nearby and I asked if she wanted to go out for a drink. I was enormously anxious at that time and nearly agoraphobic, leaving the house made my heart pound like crazy, I always thought I was going to die etc.

This girl was very young, friendly and played football which I liked very much. She wasn't my type at all, she listened to different music, had other tastes in general, but what I liked about her was her lust for life and her young attitude. I only saw her every sunday evening and maybe one day during the week when she didn't have to train which she had to do a lot.

We didn't text much except for logistics to meet up which perhaps was a sign that she wasn't really that crazy about me, but I wasn't really that crazy about her either. Just the fact that I knew she was there on these set moments every week gave me comfort, and just talking to her and kissing and hugging made me feel amazing. It made me sleep better, I got the courage to start exercising again, and I can even say that 85 % of my anxiety vanished, indirectly due to her.

We had sex a couple of times, which wasn't great because she was a virgin, but I enjoyed that I could have this intimate moment with her and I was just happy to have this connection with someone new, aside from my friends and family. I am also finishing school so I was alone quite often, working on my final projects and it gave me great comfort that apart from my friends, I knew I could visit this girl and she was there for me.

She broke up with me yesterday. I didn't see her for a whole month before that, I had to go to Japan during the christmas holidays and she also had exams so it was kind of difficult. She invited me over and almost dropped the bomb immediately. She felt weird about it, as if she didn't miss me when I was gone, and since she had an internship close to where her parents live, which is about an hour driving from where I live, it would be too difficult to continue this and there wasn't enough love according to her to continue. I always acted pretty detached also because I felt that she never invested much in our relationship, but that was fine and I always imagined that things could get better after knowing her for a longer time, which clearly wasn't the case.

I knew this was coming and I knew that there wasn't enough fire or passion to keep this going, also from my perspective. But what she doesn't know is that she was there for me and that she helped me indirectly to improve my life and put it on the rails again, and therefore I miss her greatly and therefore I also loved her actually, not so much for the person she was but for what she did without knowing it.

I'm kind of emotional right now and I feel the urge to contact her and tell her what she meant for me, which would be counterproductive I guess. I want to talk to her again and hear her babble about all the stuff I wasn't interested in at all, but she was so cheerful and full of life that it inspired me. I want closure as to why she didn't love me enough at the end, but I know that it's futile.

If you read this and you understand somewhat, thank you. Please comment, I could use the advice and the encouragement of some strangers."

First off, I apologize in advance to the mods if this isn't the correct Atlanta-based subreddit to post this in. I'll be more than happy to move to another subreddit if this post violates any of the rules here.

Alright, so, I'm a senior journalism major at GSU, and aside from an ""internship"" (it was counted as a class, despite being heavily involved in investigative research between various Georgia universities, AJC and WSB-TV), I'd like to have something else to show for after graduation (attempting to jump into the film industry at the moment, but that's another story...).

After plenty of brainstorming and planning, I've decided to create a blog that caters to local music, events, artists of various backgrounds/trades and businesses. I was pretty involved in the music scene in my mid-to-late teens, albeit a little bit south of downtown, and since I still have contacts very heavily involved with Atlanta's music throughout the state, I'd love to give some recognition to those gaining traction and starting to make a name for themselves. Eventually, if this project gains some attention, I'd love to feature acts from different states and countries.

So, with all of that being said, this brings me here to ask you all what you'd like to see in a local music blog. Despite having plans and ideas, I'd still like to hear from the community to see what interests my target audience.

Thanks in advance!"

41fgm6,1,2016-01-17,(?) I'm living at home and taking a 6-8 month break from college to pay off money I owe my university. What do you think of my plan?,thatjournalist,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/41fgm6/im_living_at_home_and_taking_a_68_month_break/,"I'm a 21-year-old college student in San Francisco who is taking the next 6-12 months off from school, living at home, and working full-time to pay off $9,000 in unpaid tuition that I owe my university. 

In short, I was burned out last semester due to personal issues and decided to take a leave of absence from school--i.e. a sabbatical of sorts. What I didn't carefully consider at the time was that I would end up owing my school more than my original balance for the term. I originally owed my school ~$5,000 but I now owe a total of $9,000 because of financial aid I'm responsible for paying back too. In retrospect, I screwed myself over twice with this shortsighted decision but now I'm dealing with consequences head-on.

Here's my plan: I'm currently living in Southern California rent free for the next 6-8 months to work full-time to payoff the debt I owe my school. I'm currently looking for a job, or jobs, and have had a bunch of interviews thus far so I'm hopeful I'll be working within a week. Every position I've applied for pays at least $15 an hour so I should be able to pay it off within the aforementioned time frame and possibly even save a little in the process if I'm extremely frugal.

Here's where I'm a bit uncertain. I'm a junior at an expensive private university that costs ~$40,000, but because of financial aid end up paying between $7,000-$9,000 per year out of pocket. On top of that, I end up taking out roughly $10,000 per year in federal student loans (no private loans or co-signed loans). Thus far, I have $26,000 in student loan debt and I anticipate ending up with about $40,000 by the time I graduate with my BA if I continue going to my current school. I have three or four semesters left to graduate depending on how things work out.

One of the reasons I decided to take a break from school was to carefully consider transferring to a public university that costs ~$7,000 per year instead. This would likely require me to take an extra semester to graduate, meaning 4 instead of three semesters. The upshot is that I would likely take out far less, if anymore, student loans by transferring.

Career wise, I'm a freelance journalist majoring in International Studies with a minor in Middle Eastern Studies. I have quite a bit of professional experience--i.e. internships and freelance experience--already. My goal is to cover conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. I know that realistically I will only earn $20,000-$40,000 annually, if that. I have no illusions that I'll be ""suffering"" for a while given what I want to do with my life.

I'm not certain which option I'll choose since my main concern right now is paying off the $9,000 I currently owe my school so I have the option of going back to school. 

Given all this, what do you all think makes the most sense, transfer to a cheaper school or stay the course at my current college?

Thanks in advance."

I need the advice of some experienced console players if 500gb less for 50$ less is worth it in the long run.

I already have around 100+ Games on my steam account and my PC is a beast so I probably won't use the Xbox for something other than playing Halo. 

Also: Are there any SinglePlayer games that everybody with an Xbox One should've played?

Nice evening (if you're from EU),

NOV3LIST ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

EDIT:
Thanks to everyone for sooo many replies! :) 
Based on your comments I came to the conclusion that I'll get a 500gb XB1 + a external 1-4TB HDD since it's faster than the built in Drive. 

EDIT 2:
Now I think about picking up the elite Version since I probably won't need an external hard drive and the intern SSD is lightning fast compared to the normal HDD or external HDD. fml ._. "

I'm currently almost done pursuing my BS in computer science and simultaneously almost finished with a BA in linguistics.  I'm going to do an internship this year and will probably work in the US for 6mo-1yr after I graduate, longer if necessary, I just started learning Korean several months ago and I'm hoping to get to business proficiency by the time I start applying.  I'm JLPT N1 which I achieved within 2 years start to finish with no prior Japanese knowledge and Korean has been easier for me so its something I should be able to achieve.

I'll take what I get but I decided a while ago that I wanted to move to Korea after spending some time there.  I know about how the job market is for Chaebols and bigger companies for foreigners (and Koreans) but is it easier to get into the tech startups and smaller companies popping up if you lower your standards?  I'm definitely willing to work below my US pay grade.  Also I'm open to and may at some point go on to get my masters in Korea.  Anyone here know someone who is working at a startup or are working at one themselves?  How hard is it to get in?"

I hope I will be able to find someone who will be able to help me.

I'm 21, I've dabbled with webdevelopment (html,css) for a few years nothing serious. I always liked being around computers but also happend to play a lot of video games... so even though i got my first html book when i was 15 i didn't really do much.

In March of 2015 I was able to land unpaid internship thanks to one of my classmates from highschool who was on unpaid internship there as well. The company is ad agency primarily focused on digital (mostly websites, landing pages, SEO, social media, print design, though the printing isn't done in-house). At the time I knew what RWD was, what a media query was but haven't done a single responsive website. 

So I get an interview for a front-end position talk with this cool guy  (the one that turned out to be a dick) and even more cooler owner (he is still great) They assign me to code front-end for one of their existing websites as a test using bootstrap and LESS, I've used SASS so I was pretty familiar with pre-processor, but i had 0 experience with bootstrap. Got home spent few hours studying the bootstrap docs, got to work and in 3 days I pretty much made a fine looking responsive website (well at least at my level of experience I though it was good) It was just simple HTML, CSS, some simple js/jquery and responsivness of course.

Long story short i got the unpaid internship and i got to work at a landingpage for one of their clients. Simple landing page though there were aspects that I have not done such as sliders etc. asked the front end colleague a few question, he was quite helpful, we had great discussions about technologies, workflow etc.

For some time I was very happy with the job even though it was unpaid, I actually wasn't there for the money but for the experience so I was ok with that.

Than after some time I was assigned to do editing to flatsome woocommerce theme. I had some experience with wordpress but mostly as a user (All of the websites at the company are built using wordpress) So i was only getting accustomed to the backend stuff, wordpress structure and so on. Anyway the design was pretty customised, I was to use the pagebuilder of flatsome which proved quite buggy and sometimes it was very hard to attain the result that the lead designer was going for. Anyway I was okay with that even though it was mostly rewriting classes and not learning that much because I hoped for better projects and was thankful for the opportunity.

After that another e-commerce client came, again using the flatsome... this was a little better as I already learned the quirks of the flatsome theme and actually knew what i was getting into...

after that i spent few months mostly working on existing projects which wasn't that bad.

However there was one jQuery thing that i was just not able to do with my level of skill with JS and jQuery (I'm not good at learning while under pressure)that's when things started to go downhill with the other frontend guy, I guess it started earlier as his ""mentor"" motivation was only short term.

It actually got to a point where I was thinking whether i should break my keyboard over his head or not, anyway one of the normal guys who had more experience with jQuery decided to do the thing.

this was around august and since then i had to endure a never ending line of little jokes and pranks from the guy (which only he seems to find funny) Example: I go to get some lunch, when i get back I have to look for my laptop, because he though it would be funny to print a pic of macbook from internet and place it on my table. I don't want to come off as a cry baby but this incident happend after few weeks of verbal jokes directed solely from this guy on me... 

I also decided to ask for a pay as i was doing stuff that just wasn't pushing me. I asked for 4.5€/hour which got flat our refused and got 3€/hour but it was better than nothing and i still get to learn something from time to time (to compare the other front end guy had about 5.5€ and the lead dev and designer (not the same person) had 10€/hour)

It's just constant remarks towards me, which can be funny the first time, second time, even the third time but usually the fourth time is when i have enough.

In September I also started Uni (compscience) but still was able to keep up with the work for agency. From what I heard agencies like these are really having a lot of work before christmas... unfortunately I also had exams before christmas. Even though i stressed several times they put me on 4 different projects, with unrealistic deadlines. I actually pulled through most of them, finishing them, though there were some final touches that had to be done by someone else as i already said that i really need to study for my exams at which point i stopped replying to emails with new tasks.

The thing was that in September I also landed my first freelancing gig, which paid way more, i enjoyed a lot more, and overall was happier. Now I'm looking into starting fully on my own though I don't really know that much but i have entrepreneurial mind and heart and wish to learn new things. I'm still a student so this is more of an experience journey than an economic one.

**The reason I want to quit is mainly because of the harassment and the fact that i'm still hovering in the html,css little bit of JS realm and would love to get more into more of software enginnering/webapp realm**


**sorry for the long all-over the post, it's 3AM and i really had to put this somewhere**

**TL;DR**Worked as an unpaid intern;great projects = happy;no more great projects,
colleague became major pain the ass; started to get paid, not growing, getting too many projects; expected to stay till 8PM (I never really did unless it was somethin really urgent) Looking to get into freelancing, possibly webapps, grow as a programmer, entreprenuer, be happy, should i go for it?

41gud3,0,2016-01-17,Low self-esteem because of my nationality...how to deal with it?,roman_erudite,selfesteemsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfesteemsupport/comments/41gud3/low_selfesteem_because_of_my_nationalityhow_to/,"I always hated my life back in my country: I'm Western-oriented and grew up in a Middle Eastern country. It's not fun. I came to Canada as a student and then just started a great job, and even found a wonderful girlfriend.

Now what's getting to me is how I have to suffer, simply because I was born in the wrong place. Most First World citizens aren't even aware of the concept of a visa. If they want to go to Europe, they just book a ticket and go, while I (even though I passed so many security checks and hold visas such as the US &amp; Canada), must EVERY SINGLE time put aside around 15% extra budget just for visa fees. I have also to plan waaay ahead because of how long it takes to process. Sometimes it's infeasible if you're waiting on a permit extension or something.

Even living day to day, I pay taxes, get NO benefits, AND regularly pay permit and visa fees JUST to exist! Every couple years, every internship or whatever I have to re-take a language test (I already speak fluently and score full-marks...a good speller here lol) and I spell better than many natives even, but that's another ~$300 of yearly expenses.

Westerners might decide that they hate their job and quit. I can't, because my status is dependent on being sponsored by an employer, even though I am better qualified or hell, I just want go for a better chance and take some break between jobs, but no....because I'm guilty of being born 6000 miles too far to the East.

I know this can't be my only issue, but this really hits hard and is a huge blow to my self-esteem. I caught myself so many times hiding my passport with a boarding pass or whatever because I feel so ashamed that someone might see it my hand and know that I'm from a low citizenship.

How do I get over these feelings and build more self-esteem in myself?"
41h05w,1,2016-01-17,My [21M] brother [25M] threatened to kill us. Mother [60's F] won't do anything,CrashbugAbyss,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41h05w/my_21m_brother_25m_threatened_to_kill_us_mother/,"Ok, things are shaken in my family right now so maybe I'll miss something, but here's the situation from my perspective. Sorry if my english fails, not native speaker and this is just a throwaway account. And sorry for the caps, I have to do it...

I was playing video games upstairs in my bedroom when I heard a loud scream from my brother, not just loud but very loud. First thing I do is take my headset off and try to listen what had just happened and suddenly all my mother (60's F), brother and sister (27 F) are all screaming so I head down to try and give them all a little of brain to shut up and have some peace, we're not usually a fighting family.

So I'm downstairs and my brother wants to maul my sister, he's 1.90m and over 100kgs, and me, the second tallest in the family, I'm just 1.67m and less than half his weight but I still get in the middle of my brother to stop him from touching my sister and barely do it with my sister running and locking herself up in her bedroom. My mother, which I love but tbh I think she's stupid, tries and talk with my sister with screams, because he's also screaming and I'm screaming, you get it. So he's mad, tries to punch my mother but I still stop him and he tells me to go outside and fight, and I tell him ""do you realise what the fuck are you saying?"". He's mad heavy and goes to our bedroom (he and I share bedroom). He comes out with one of his knifes (he's studying gastronomy), a really big one. I know my sister is safe but my mom and I aren't right now.

So, against all reason my mother goes to him and I'm like ""WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK"" and she struggles with him. I can't believe what I'm seeing but they talk while he plays with the knife. I take the phone and call the police, but my mother tells me to leave it down since ""I don't know what the hell I'm doing"" and I'll just fuck shit up, and doubting, I just call off.

Next he says he wants to kill all of us, he hates my dad and how he is going to murder him, ""after all, I've already sent him to the hospital once"" he says. He talks about how he wants to kill himself and how his life sucks and how my mother and us have never done anything for him. He then proceeds to lock himself up in our bedroom (while I'm praying for him to do nothing to my gaming laptop). My mother is exhausted mentally and she calls an uncle who is very good with words.

So, my uncle (40's? M) and my cousin (23 F) come to my house since they are really good treating with people and they think they can help us in this situation. While they arrive my sister also leaves the house because she can't deal with this (oh, it started because she was seeing what he was cooking). Anyway, first thing my uncle and cousin try is to talk to him across the door, but he doesn't answer so we head downstairs and see our options:

I say that we should call the cops and denounce him, but my mother doesn't want to because then we have to deal with his legal issues WHILE OUR LIVES ARE IN THREAT MOM. I tell her we don't have to look for him after the cops take him, since he's been making our family life shit for years (will talk about this later), but she can't just turn her back on her son. My uncle says it's hard to make this decisions for my brother and I answer back that he doesn't act like a brother, why should I treat him like such.

Next option is to take him to a psychiatrist and have him there as an intern, but we would have to pay for him and since my dad has been jobless for over a year, it's a hard decision. But to do this we need to take him out of the room, which is right now his little fortress. We don't think he'll just say ""yes"" to the treatment and we can't force him, so there is that problem.

After a while, we decide to wait for my grandfather (80 M) who has a very good relationship with my brother and that my brother will have to leave the house permanently since we don't feel safe anymore with him but It's going to be 3 hours for him to come. So my uncle and cousin leave and we just wait.

After some hours the house is ""back to normal"" with just his fortress up and he opens the door. He comes out with a knife and ignores both me and my mom. He goes to the kitchen and meanwhile I go into my bedroom and take my important stuff out (one change of clothes, my laptop and my backpack for school) and while I try to go for my multitool with knife I hear him coming back so I retreat to my mother's bedroom. He goes into his fortress again and locks up. Lucky me, my mom took my multitool and cellphone so at least my important stuff is with me... except for my wallet. Anyways, we just wait for my grandfather to come

So 7pm comes and my grandfather finally arrives, my mother and I talk with him a little and explain him what just happened, and we all agree that his behaviour isn't normal and that he needs help. So my grandfather goes in and after like half an hour of talking he comes out by himself, saying that he refuses to leave the house. I tell my mom we NEED to force him out and we should call the police, but she says no. She decides to try and get some big guys to take him out and since my sister knows somebody we think she could help us, but she refuses saying that she doesn't want anybody to know about her situation (Fuck you sis). So my mother mad hangs up on her.

My sister comes home and ask what is happening and we tell her that we need her help but she says she doesn't want to, she gets mad and leaves again (Fuck you sis, seriously).

So then, two big guys come and try to talk with him along with my grandfather, I don't really listen to what they say since I'm downstairs but after what feels like an hour, they leave with my brother with no force, which is good.

The thing is, now we have to see what's the next step since my mom doesn't want to involve the police and I understand her role as a mother, but we also think that a psychiatrist will just end up breaking him more and that's not the goal. Also my mom doesn't want to take decisions since my father went to close a business deal and he isn't coming back until next Sunday and she doesn't want to worry him, which I understand since he won't be able of doing anything.

CONTEXT
So, if you're kind of interested, his talk topics in this situation are not new for us. And it's not the first time he gets physical with any of us. He has been violent since I have memory, where he used to threaten my sister and me. As we grew up he got big and heavy and the threats went then to my mother and finally my father (who isn't taller than me now and ended up in the hospital once).

Also, my father has lived out of town for most of our lives so our relationship with him is not ""the best"", but I have no problems with him. My mother tells me when we were kids my dad used to be very physical against us and that maybe that scarred him.

It's not the first time he ""explodes"" but it's the first time he takes a knife against us (or himself). And usually this ends up in a cycle where he gets kicked out of the house and in less than a week he gets back because my mother is worried about him.

Brother also went to several psychologists in his life but stopped around 5 years ago and things were not that bad this few years, at least not as bad as before, but now things reached a new level.

   
**tl;dr**: My brother got mad with my sister and then took a knife a threatened all us and locked himself up. After talking to a lot of people he left the house with my grandfather and now we're waiting for my father to come back and take a decision with my brother's relationship."
41hxe2,3,2016-01-18,[Intro] My experience with depression,holosaur,GFD,https://www.reddit.com/r/GFD/comments/41hxe2/intro_my_experience_with_depression/,"Hey everyone. I saw the /r/games post for this sub last week and thought I'd post my experience here.


I'm 23 years old living with my parents to save money. I don't have a college degree above associates, but I sort of fell into a software development internship which ended up turning into a job some months ago. I was planning on transfering to a 4 year college to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, but decided to stick with the job as the money/benefits/experience is all very good, and I'm enjoying the work I'm doing. In addition, paying for the higher level education was going to be very difficult. Until now I had been attending a community college for my associates degree. I'm fairly socially awkward, and find it difficult interacting with people. I've never had a girlfriend, and all the people I'd consider good friends are people I knew from highschool (most of whom have moved away for college).


I've been depressed now on and off for some time. It's difficult to give an estimate, as it comes and goes as I hit slumps here and there. My earliest memories of depression are probably from middle school. I think my current slump has been going on on/off for about 5 years. I think this is largely to due self-esteem, and a negative self perspective. Sometimes I feel like I hate myself. I can't seem to do simple things that come so easily for other people. Just the thought of simple things, like completing forms for school, writing this, or talking to people give me anxiety. When I talk with people I don't really know about things, I can feel my brain get fuzzy as I try to process what to say next, causing me to lose track of the conversation.


I feel like I'm destined for failure in life. Sure I have a good job now, but I can't help but fear that my lack of a bachelor's degree will fuck up my future by the time I leave this company (like not being able to get a job). I feel like the kind of person I am, I'm just incompetent when it comes to doing basic, required things in life.


The absolute worst part is, I KNOW that I have a good life. I have a loving family. I have a good job. Most importantly, I'm healthy. Shit, some people will never know what it's like to walk. Some people have terminal illnesses and won't live to my age. Some people are living on the streets. I have a lot to be grateful for, and it makes me feel worse about myself for not being happy.


I just wish I could flip a switch in my head. It feels like it was only yesterday I was a stupid kid with nothing but time and already I'm in my twenties dealing with life's responsibilities. I don't want to wake up tomorrow to realize I'm 80 and pissed away my life being depressed/stressed/negative. I'm trying really, really hard to be happy, and live in the moment but it is very difficult for me.


To this end, I enjoy gaming. Lately I've been playing through the Uncharted collection, and EDF 4.1. EDF is a damn fun, and silly/absurd game. It's my first EDF game, and it's crazy how full of surprises it is. It's probably the first game since childhood that I've gone into knowing nothing, and having that experience in which you discover the game as you play. I've also been trying to improve my art skills, and allocate a bit of time each week to draw. I'm also trying to keep a journal to write something positive about myself, and things I'm grateful for each day in the morning.


Some days are better than others. I feel as a whole I'm still depressed, but my condition may be improving.
I guess I'm just hoping to get my thoughts out there as a means of coping with things, and perhaps hear from people that might relate to my situation. 

Thanks to anyone that stuck through and read all of this.

41i2sg,3,2016-01-18,I'm a BUM leeching off my parents,water_bottle_goggles,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/41i2sg/im_a_bum_leeching_off_my_parents/,"**Context**: I spent most of 2015 being upset/depressed following a relationship rejection. Proceeded to spending all my time and energy over self pity and regret. Fuck me, seriously fuck me. I hate myself over this. Funny thing is, she doesn't have a single clue. I brought it up and apologized about what happened in New Years Eve. She couldn't believe that it was still in my mind after 9 months. As an excuse, I told her that it just bothered me once in a while. ONCE IN AS WHILE?? **ONCE IN A FUCKING WHILE??** *Bullshit*. It bothered the hell out of me. It destroyed my year. I wallowed in paralyzing self-pity.



I'll make a fucking list aye? 



1. **Job opportunities:**



During the year, lodging Cover Letter + CV to a number of engineering firms is a MUST as they hire summer interns. This is crucial as they not only offer work and experience, getting hours is REQUIRED for graduating. Writing them up takes quite a bit of time so effective timetabling on top of university work is very crucial. What did I do? Kick myself over the girl that I ‘hurt’. Most of my friends now have an internship over the summer. But ME? NOPE, FUCKING NOPE. Im just bumming this summer. 



2. **GPA:**



You may ask; Wouldn't it be a great idea to distract yourself with study instead of thinking about this girl all the time? That's what I did during the first semester. Studied my eyeballs off and it worked! Then second semester came, I tried the same strategy, but this time I was restless over the same shit in my mind (It wasn’t healthy anymore). Couple this with an atrocious programming professor, my GPA took a huge dump in a space of 3 months. Fucking wonderful.



3. **Flatmate** &amp; **Close Friend:**



I screwed up big time on this one. He saw the whole thing unload in his eyes. The day I went home from being rejected and all the emotional shit that went with it. He was stuck with me for the year, crying every other night, ignoring chores (vacuuming apartment, getting groceries, dishes, etc.). Hell, I was so depressed by this time, I couldn't function as a normal human being. Apparently my room had a stench coming off of it because of unwashed clothes, I would smell like a homeless man for taking a shower once-a-fucking-week (no kidding), my clothes would discolour because I'd stay in the same clothes day in day out. It became so bad that we stopped having friends over. Funny thing is, we used to cook together but then it fell apart when I asked the girl out. Yup, I'm a piece of shit. I'm sorry Dylan.



4. **Friendships:**



I love people and love being the clown of the group. When I went to this depression-like state, I gained even more friends and was in company of even more people. Then I got scolded by my bestfriend pointing out that I was doing it because I was compensating for lost company (her). This made me feel even more shit than I already did before. 



---



So what happened as a result of this? What has 2016 in store me because of how poorly handled 2015 has been?



1. **Repeating second year:**



I took Engineering Science for my sophomore year because it would give me prestige amongst my friends and family. 



**Person 1:** ""So Jamie (me), what field of Engineering are you taking?"" 



**Me:** ""Uhh, just Engineering Science""



**Person 1:** ""Holy fucking shit, Jamie. What do Engineering Scientists do? Your so fucking smart""



Fuck this shit. I'm taking Civil engineering Fuck my ‘prestige’. Fuck my ego, fuck engineering science. Even if I fall behind my peers taking another year for a different course. It’s worth it. I want a 

future.



On average, my student loan is about $13k a year. So yeah, a fuck up with how I handle a rejection just cost me 13K in loan. Wonderful. 



2. **A more expensive Apartment**



Was planning to be a great flatmate because my friend was rich as fuck. Buys great furniture without charging me. But I was a shit flat mate remember, no way in hell he’d take me again. So instead of looking for a new flatmate. I proceed to wallow in self-pity and ignore the fact that I don’t have anywhere to live next year. Wonderful. 

Being an idiot. I left it until it was too late. Only available accommodation close to uni was a $300/week apartment so that I can live close to University. Ohh did I say, IM going to pay for it? I don’t have a fucking job remember? So my parent will take the hit for me yet another year.



But hang the fuck on. Im paying for roughly ~41 weeks. So that’s 300*41 = $12,300 out of my pocket. Wait… wait. MY POCKET? FUCKING NOPE. IVE NEVER WORKED IN MY LIFE AND IM 20 YEARS OLD. So my mom will also take the hit for that thank you very much.



---



**TL;DR** I couldn’t handle relationship rejection. Lost Job Opportunities, Shitty Grades, Fucked Off Flatmate. As a result, I will now live in an expensive apartment by myself and will be repeating second year. Leeching off my parent's finances



My parents aren’t even rich. I feel so fucking useless. I feel like a leech. What kind of son am I? FUCK ME. IM SUCH A USELESS FUCK. This whole thing is such a degrading experience but thanks for reading, it means a lot.

41isb0,5,2016-01-18,Where am i heading?,vagician2015,Chefit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chefit/comments/41isb0/where_am_i_heading/,"hi first of all please do forgive for my grammar is not that good,  English is not my first language. 

im still kinda new in the kitchen and im wondering where im heading

so just a little background  
i graduated from a culinary school,

staged for 6 months as a line cook at an italian restaurant.

  had 4 months experience in a hotel banquet (hot station) , as an apprentice,  and 1 year experience, still at the same hotel but now in the cold station,  doing nothing but prep work of fruits for the whole hotel,  not that im being cocky but i have insanely fast knife skills

then into a luxury buffet restaurant as a commis, grill station for a year

then a steakhouse inside an uppity country club as a line cook, in which it didn't go so well because of politics within the clubs board of directors 

and now im here working as a dishie at ramen house (to be honest im only here because of the money), saving up for going abroad

now the question what is my next move?  apply and work for a cruise ship? or go and pursue a training visa in Australia and do internship in a restaurant? 



i really really want to work at a fine dining michelin star-like restaurant,  but my family needs my help financially,  "
41j4rv,47,2016-01-18,Happy birth story (hypnobirthing ending with epi) and 8 weeks PP advice,mrsmooseq,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/41j4rv/happy_birth_story_hypnobirthing_ending_with_epi/,"On Tuesday 11/17 I went to the doc and after a cervical check he stated that I had 1-2 more weeks to go (my due date was 11/21.) I made a post to BabyBumps about it, and then Wednesday night I had to update it! My water broke at 11:30pm. 

I wanted to work right up until we had the baby, and I figured I would be able to kind of feel something coming on, so when I woke up at 6am on Wednesday, and then worked a full day, and then went to Roller Derby practice and coached, you can imagine my surprise when I laid down in bed at 11:30pm and felt a pop out of nowhere. I was in the middle of writing an e-mail to my HypnoBirthing coach about some fears I had, and I ended it with ""Hang on, I might need to call L&amp;D."" To my surprise Dawn, my coach, picked up! I said ""I just sent you an e-mail..."" and explained to her what happened. She said to take a shower, eat something and come in. Between shaking with excitement and a good dose of anxiety, my husband helped me get ready and we headed to the hospital. 

I naively wore a large pad, but that was soaked through half way tot he hospital. There was so much fluid that when they put me in the wheel chair to bring me to triage, when I sat up, they just swabbed the soaked wheelchair seat to get the fluid. It was indeed my water breaking, so I was sent up to L&amp;D. Dawn met us there, and helped calm me down. I wasn't having contractions, and was so shocked that the whole thing started with my water breaking that it took a while for reality to set in. I was told I had 24 to deliver since my water breaking, so we got to it. I started walking, and moving, trying to get things going. Eventually I settled into the rocker and just rocked for a while. I also used their breast pump for nipple stimulation, and that helped a lot also. Within an hour some contractions started. I tried to move to the bed to sleep a little but when I stopped rocking the contractions stopped, so I put on a CD and just rocked until about 3am. 

Somewhere in there the ultrasound tech came in to make sure the baby was head down. As soon as he put the thing on my belly a very clear face appeared and I knew we were in for back labor. The contractions weren't bad at the start, just like waves. My husband cheered me through them knowing that ""pain is progress"" and we would get to meet out baby soon. 

At 5am(ish) Dawn came in to introduce me to her ""hand picked"" nurse for us, whose name was Britney. Britney had two kids via HypnoBirthing and was a complete and total sweet heart. Since it was a teaching hospital lots of interns came in and introduced themselves, which I was fine with. They started talking Pitocin and I said I wanted to wait. They got a little pushy but I repeated ""Am I okay? Is my baby okay? Then I don't want it."" and they backed off. Then my doctor came in (and I made fun of him for telling me 36 hours beforehand that I had weeks to go.) and he said not to even think the word Pitocin until after noon, at which point I would be 12 hours in. This made me feel much more relaxed. He said he was coming off a 48 hour on call shift, so Dr. Riley (who I had never met) would most likely be there for the delivery.

I continued to labor in the chair but my husband couldn't get to my back that way, so I transferred to the birthing ball. He would apply pressure and help distract me, and it was really effective. At 10am my friend Crystal showed up to help coach and relieve my husband. My husband's father's cousin also came in, (she also happens to be an L&amp;D RN at the hospital we were at, she is also a total sweetheart) and we all hung out and chatted for about 40 minutes. Eventually though I noticed my contractions slowed down, and looking at the clock, I had my husband usher them out so I could rest and keep going. 

At 11am Dr. Riley appeared. Britney warned me he would be a little rude, but as it turns out my father in law did consulting work for him and he knew the family (we live in a small town, can you tell?) and he was great. He asked about pain meds, I said that I wasn't shy and would tell him when and if I wanted any. He said that sounded like a good plan. Shortly after that I agreed to have the interns check my dilation. This was the only odd part. One did, and I breathed through it (it was mid contraction, of course.) But then she pulled her hand out and looked at the other and said ""okay, now just like that..."" and suddenly I had another set of hands in me. This pissed Britney off since I was an increased risk of infection, and no one told me there would be two sets of hands, and she gave them a stern talking to outside the room. (I felt like I had a little guard dog nurse! It was great!) I was 4cm. This felt mildly discouraging since the clock was ticking (though Britney was really impressed with my progress.)

The contractions got stronger by noon, and at 12:30 Britney said I might need to think about a little bit of Pitocin to help since they were still 4 minutes apart. I was just thinking that I was going to have to start vocalizing and the idea of Pitocin was really not appealing. The deal I made with myself is that if I had to get Pitocin, I would allow myself the epidural, the plan was the use HypnoBirthing as a tool, and not feel bad about it if I changed my mind. So with no guilt, I asked for the epidural. It took about an hour from asking for it to getting it put in, so if you want one, don't wait until you can't wait anymore, because you might have to anyways! Getting the epidural really was not bad, I can't emphasize that enough. I've heard it was like a bee sting, and it felt even less than that, no worse than getting an IV (and maybe better because you can't even see it being done!) My blood pressure dropped and I got a pretty woobly, but it only lasted 30 seconds or so. Something I learned was that Epidurals are ""relative"", so if you lay on your side, it will ""pool"" on your side and you can regain some feeling on the proper up side. I ended up with a ""hot spot"" as they call it (where the Epidural doesn't kick in) in my hip, so we moved me around and got that sorted out. I ended up needing a higher dose, (I'm a red head, so that wasn't surprising) and once that got all set I really just kind of dozed. After that they ramped up the Pitocin since I was numb, and all that was left to do was wait.

My body would go through phases where it would shake violently, and my husband would just let me sip ginger ale and hold my hand. It was the only way I knew that progress was being made since I couldn't feel it. I don't know if I was just *really* tired or if it was the epidural and the antibiotics and everything hitting me, but I certainly felt a bit doped up.

At about 5pm my husband's cousin came back, she was in her scrubs and everything, and she came and just sat with me and chatted and made me comfortable. Checked all my fluids and lines, about an hour later I asked her if she had other patients, but she said she was clocked out, she was just there for us. It was such a gift to have her there! I felt so taken care of. 

At about 6:30pm a new resident came in and wanted to check my progress. I said sure, and to my surprise (and hers) I was fully dilated! This is when the room changed pace: the bed ""dropped"" and the stirrups went up, nurses began prepping things I couldn't see, more interns appears (one almost hit my cousin in law in the head with a lamp). I had my husband with one leg, his cousin with the other, two residents and an intern, the resident who was between my legs and would help deliver, Britney by my head (who stayed even though her shift was over because she wanted to see what the sex was too and she is an angel) and a nurse watching for my contractions. Once we started I got so hot, so I opted to just be in my bra, which was the right choice. 

I did a few practice pushes and the nurses seems happy with those. The plan to not push and breathe the baby out via HypnoBirthing was thrown out the window, but I was okay with that. After so much rest I was ready to get something done! The pushing was easy with an epidural; I just used the same muscles I used for a squat, and that seemed to work. We were all laughing and joking, getting excited to meet our baby, everything went so smoothly. I was told pushing would be harder since baby wasn't turned right, but about 15 minutes before being born, the baby turned so violently that I felt it through the epidural. You could see my whole belly move, it was very dramatic. Shortly after that they said they saw some hair, and would I like a mirror to see. I said ""I want to want to, but I don't.."" and so they offered to just guide my hand down to feel it. I was so glad I did, I got to pet this sweet little head and I yelped with delight and the reality that we were almost there. After that everything was moving so quickly, the resident between my legs asked for Dr. Riley. Turns out on Thursday nights he buys the whole floor pizza, and he had gone down to pick it up from the ER. I said to the resident ""you want to catch? I'm good to keep pushing if you don't mind catching..."" so we all agreed not to wait and just go for it. I was pushing in sets of three, and the last set that I did, on the first push, Dr. Riley came running in, but push two he had gloves on, and by push three he had muscled his way in and helped catch our beautiful baby GIRL! She was born at 7:29pm, 19 hours after my water broke. She was put right on my chest, screaming bloody murder, which I was overjoyed about. I listened to hear the APGAR score (I was born with an APGAR of 1, so I knew if I heard a good score I'd feel better) and to my joy I heard a ""APGAR is a 9"" and I just relaxed. I held my 7# 10oz, full head of hair little beauty and let out some sobs. I was elated. Husband and I agreed on our girl name (""Ada May"", both family names) I had to push the placenta out, which felt like the equivalent of the most satisfying dump I've ever taken, I felt 10 pounds lighter after that. I had two 2nd degree tears that got sewn up, and after Ada got cleaned up she was brought over to me to nurse. 

It was literally the perfect birth, there was nothing I would have changed. I worked really hard at having no expectations so that if things changed I wouldn't be disappointed. Allowing myself to make my owns rules was very empowering, and I'm happy with the whole experience. 

So, 8 weeks out, here is my advice.

1. Cotten breast pads are a bagillion times more comfy than disposable ones. Cut up pieces of flannel also work just fine. 

2. Don't worry about having to pee and poop during, or right after labor. Catheters are no big deal, and the nurses assured me very very rarely is someone not able to pee after giving birth even with swelling. (This was a huge fear of mine.)

3. Breast feeding takes some work, but it is worth it even just from an economical standpoint. 

3.5. Buy a case of ready made formula and just keep in in your cupboard. We keep some in the diaper bag in case we run out of milk, and having it around takes the pressure off. We dip into it maybe once or twice a week, and my anxiety is better for it. 

4. If you are able to shave your pubic area, I would. I wish I had. There was so much vaginal discharge after birth, and it was so sensitive to the touch, things got kind of gross. No need for a bikini wax, but if you are able to just trim a bit, you might be more comfortable. 

5. They clean up poop so fast when you are pushing it is unlikely anyone will notice you did it. 

6. Be nice to yourself. You just used your muscles so hard that they likely ripped our skin. You will also feel lots of things, and they are all okay to feel, whatever they are.

6.5 . I'm a health food person, but eating an American grilled cheese on white bread and tomato soup was The Best Thing ever. So eat what you want, again, you just worked really hard.

7. It's worth it. The whole thing. Maybe not right away, maybe not even until week five postpartum, but it will be worth it. 



Best of luck you gorgeous mamas! You are all capable of great things! You made a human for fucks sake, stand proud.

41jg24,12,2016-01-18,Hello! + My 2016 goals | plans,Subalee,KaizenBrotherhood,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaizenBrotherhood/comments/41jg24/hello_my_2016_goals_plans/,"Hey everyone,

***LOT'S OF SELF PITTY COMING IN 3..2..1.. SCROLL DOWN TO SKIP TO THE IMPORTANT PART***

Since the end of 2015 I've been thinking a lot (as every year before it). I always had dreams and these bursts of motivation for so many things. I usually spent some time and than simply gave up.

I think that most of my struggles come from video games. I started playing WoW at the age of 11. I actually decided to give it up several times but i think I easily clocked between 7k to  10k of hours playing video games to this day.

It wasn't all for naught, during this time I learned a lot about computer maintenance, built several computers, repaired several computers, built my own watercooled and overclocked machine, got into video editing, got into photography (i wasn't good at those things but I did 2 wedding photoshoots, 2 proms, but i mostly did it for fun). I also learned a little programming but I always seem to get to certain point and give up.

this was all around 2009 to 2014 (basically highschool) I choosed wrong highschool, struggled with depression and anxiety, got almost to 96 kg of weight.

After that I got admitted to one of the best (and hardest) computer science universities in my country, but for the first time since I was 5 years old I had more than a 2 month old holidays, I was worry free, found a girlfriend, basically life was ok, but I didn't really grow.
I also lost a lot of weight because there was no anxiety I went to almost 80kg from 96kg just because I was eating as much as when i was stressed out about my future.

Started to go to Uni, I was pretty good at most of the stuff (programming included) but i horribly sucked at math due to **math anxiety**, now i don't think i would be better than average, if I didn't have math anxiety, but basically when I encounter math I just stress out entirely and the only thing i think about is how i'm going to fuck up and how stupid I am.

So I decided to drop out after my 1st semester. I actually passed my math exam, I was only like 2.5 points above the failure mark and decided i dont want to spend next 4.5 years this way.

So I dropped out on 19th of December 2014. Basically I didn't do much, I finished JS on codecademy, started working out which was great. I did stronglifts as I don't really like the bodybuilder mindset, I prefer functional and strong body over a good looking one, though it's surely a benefit in some areas :). However my body being accustomed to computer guy posture, having my muscles and tendons very inflexible and joints very immobile and no weightlifting experience I started to experience pains in my body (mostly my shoulders - too much overhead press) I also decided to film myself and found out that during my deadlifts and squats i was rounding my lower back waaay too much. At the time I was already squatting and deadlifting almost 100kg It felt super great actually, but having suffred several sports injuries when i was younger (did a lot of crazy stuff on ATV and bikes) 

I decided to get a break from lifting and went into another short term depression thanks to my classmate from highschool who got me an interview for unpaid internship at one of the best advertisement agencies in our town. Long story short i got the place and was able to turn it into a very low paid position within a matter of 2.5 months, I didn't mind the low pay as I didn't really need the money and I was there for the experience which started to go downhill so i told myself, If i'm not learning might as well get paid for it. 

I was very happy at the company because for the first time in a very long time i felt i was growing and i felt as if i was progressing towards my goals (I don't really have specific goals atm, i try be more open minded about life now) However during my time there the guy who also does front-end same as me started to be kind of an ass to me, which i swallowed, then came some projects which either didn't push me to grow or were well-over my current experience and skillset, don't get me wrong I like challenge, but I'm also a realist and I usually don't feel good glueing together stuff for someone who is paying a lot of money for it.

Anyway in September I started attending another university (computer science again) I only have one exam left (math ironically, but i think i have chance at passing..) During my ""exam season"" the work got a bit out of hand at the agency and i was given around 4 projects to work on at the same time (along with all the work at other already existing websites) My social life struggled, my sleep and health struggled **(did i mention i got back to 96kg during the sedentary nature of the job and my inclination for Mcdonalds and local fast food place?)** I also had some clients of my own so yeah at some points I felt like I'm gonna be dead from exhaustion by the end of 2015. didn't happen.. obviously :D 

even though I have not officially quit, I will because I realised that I'm not growing there as much and in ways that I'd like (the most grown thing is my waist at the moment) both professionally and personally.

***SORRY FOR THE ESSAY, THE IMPORTANT PART STARTS HERE***

I have so many ideas, visions, dreams, ambitions that I want to pursue and spent so many years thinking about those things but not doing any action. **this ends now**


**MY 2016 GOALS | PLAN**

**Body**

* get my muscles and joints into better state, this includes stretching, mobility exercises and yoga (haven't started the yoga part yet)

* body weight exercises because even with muscles imbalances, bad posture, past injuries most of them are pretty safe.

* Currently I'm around 92kg and plan to get to 80kg. To put it into perspective though as weight can be relative Iam 180cm high and would consider myself in the 25%-30% body fat range. I think the sweet spot for this year will be anywhere below 20% though I aim for 15%

* Once my body is ready I will get back to Stronglifts and the gym to lift again as it did wonders for my mental state (Also yoga as much as possible)

* *Diet, Diet Diet* As far as my diet is concerned I eat like shit. I love fast food especially Mcdonalds, I also used to drink litres of our local caffeine soda (very similar to coca cola, though I like the taste of our local drink more). So yeah that has to stop. Not in a head first way, because I know myself and would relapse, but in a small steps. I suffer from sever food allergy  to nuts, fish, bananas, kiwi and basically I should avoid most of the exotic and sea-world stuff unless I want to choke on my own tongue (I carry around epinephrin injection) And I also want to get into *paleo diet* it's just makes sense for me from the evolutionary perspective, though it's going to be hard with my nut free diet (small steps again as I don't really know how to cook past the point of scrambled eggs)

**Mind and Spirit**

* Throughout the years of my motivational bursts I acquired quite a lot of books, I have read few of them but in reality for every 10 books i read maybe one. I went through the stacks of my books and sorted 27 of them that I actually want to read (mostly non-fiction but there are some fantasy books thrown in to the mix) Some of the books you might know (Thinking Fast and Slow, Mastery by Greene, The Game, Orwell's 1984, Gladwell's Tipping point, The Social Animal and so on..) **So the goal for 2016 is to read *at least* 20 of those**

* Battle my anxieties and insecurities with meditation and positive mindset. I haven't started this yet.

* Yoga - I believe the mind and the body are very connected things so that's why yoga appears in both body and mind.

* **Adopt growth-mindset (warrior mindset)**

**Eductaion/Work**

*  **MATH** I struggled with math all my life (not that I really put much time into studying rather the time I spent in class, I feel that math will help me in my programming endeavours, though I still believe that you don't have to be math genius to be a programmer I still think that math is very important in so many aspects of our lives. Obviously khan academy is the biggest help here. some books that i downloaded as well

* Read Head First Java, we code in java at school, I already have some basics down, most of the jobs in my country and in many others are Java. Android. Multiplatform

* Continue improving with web technologies especially learn Javascript (vanilla) and some backend technology. I wanted to go with Ruby on Rails, but i think I'll go with PHP7 give the advancements with new version

* Start freelancing as a webdev, I already do this, but I plan to do it as an agency to appear more professional and in the end be more professional, maybe partner up with someone and create something that will profit both us and our clients

* Learn German. I'm very close to the german speaking countries so I think it only makes sense to learn it. The other reason is I had german in primary school and I already have some basics to built on

* (Maybe) Get into design and drawing

**Habits I want to get rid of**

* Nail biting

* Oversleeping

* Junkfood/eating when i'm frustrated or sad

* **One of the most important goals is this:** I spent hours with googling up stuff like this: *What is the best way to learn X*, *Do you have to be smart to do Y*, *What is the best programming language*, *Is math inborn ability or can it be learned* **I NEED TO STOP THIS** and actually work on the stuff i want to pursue.

**Habits i want to get**

* better sleeping regime

* reading regularly

* working out regularly

* be positive

**IN CONCLUSION**

I'm sorry for the rant... I know it's way too long and not that interesting. It also serves as sort of a post to myself. Whenever I'll be down I can get back to this and remember why I started. Also at the end of this year I will come here and smile upon it either in victory or failure, though this time it will be different.

***In great attempts it is glorious even to fail***

Thanks.


**EDIT:** Clearly, I need to work on my writing skills as well.

From the get-go I thought she was cute and wanted to make a move. She avoided hanging out with me or even a group(later found out she was just nervous) 

Anyway, fast forward to a month or so later and I started seriously flirting with her. Asked her to come over for some drinks and ended making out for hours. Went pretty fast from there(said ily even before dating) but we had been hardcore talking for about a month, she was just hesitant to date because she'd be moving back. Funny, cause the same night we said ily we decided to date. The next month or two were honestly the best in my life. I felt like I found THE ONE, you know? But then it came time for her to move back to her hometown and I was freaking devastated. We both were I think. 

Obviously it got easier as the days went on and we would skype and watch anime and shit every night together. A month after she went home, it was my birthday so I took a week vacation and visited and stayed with her. This is where stuff started to go down hill. It was freaking awesome seeing her, and honestly that trip was the best in my life. However on the night before my birthday, she had left her phone in the room with me(her parents wouldn't let us sleep in the same room obv, and she had just gotten a new phone, too.) So me being the curious person(and someone who's gotten cheated on a few times) looked through her phone. Honestly, wholeheartedly, didn't think she would ever do anything because we were that in love. Well I found a chat log on her phone to some dude she later said she met online. Nothing like direct cheating but the dude was h/c flirting with her and even said he'd wanna marry her/meet later in life. I'm like wtf? We were already texting so I just said ""goodnight."" and she got all worried and kept texting me asking what was wrong. She eventually came and I told her what was wrong and she just said she'd do anything to make it up and not talk to said dude again. I have real bad trust issues because of things from my past so I guess you can say I never really let it go. Which is what I regret the most.

Anyway, I went home and we were going strong for a month before she came back to my area for a job interview. We both(I think) wanted her to get it so bad. And she didn't. I wish she had because maybe I wouldn't be writing this right now. She went back home after spending a week with me and things kinda went stagnant for a while. Around september, she started acting weird one day. I kept asking her what was wrong and she kept telling me nothing. She broke up with me the next day. I had never experienced a heartbreak like that, it destroyed me. I felt like my freaking soulmate just vanished.(I know, it's only a short time but still) I thought and thought, why? What would make her do this? A few weeks went by and we still talked a little each day. We both still loved eachother. And I understood, it was because the long distance was making us not care about much else, (ex: we'd have to not make plans a lot just to skype)  We started ""talking"" after a little while and things went pretty much back to the way they were. Just without the bf/gf title. 

Things were going good(or so I thought) and we had a healthy medium between spending time with friends and eachother. More problems started to come up when I wouldn't text her for a little while sometimes (be it, working, napping, or just busy) which is unfair, and I know that. She kept telling me that she wanted me to text her more(which I guess boils down to caring more) and a part of me tried. I'm a forgetful person as it is, and a horrible texter. But I tried. But another part of me had lingering doubt(which in the end was the kicker, and beat myself up for it everyday) about what had happened when I looked through her phone, and also when she broke up with me. I couldn't let myself be ripped apart like that again. So, whilst I cared and wanted to try, a part of me didn't. Which is horrible. 

In the end, she said we can't be together right now, which may be for the best. She also deleted me from social media, so I can't even see what she's up to and I just don't know what to do. I still feel like she's my soulmate and it kills me to think she's probably seeing someone else already.(This happened maybe a month ago)
It's just hard for me to get over that fact. I know I need to work on myself before get into another/hopefully this relationship, but how can I just get her back in my life, even as a friend?

TL;DR : thought(and still think) I met my soulmate, but long distance and my own selfishness destroyed the relationship. How can I fix it, and at the very least be friends with her, or how can I move on with my life? I've run out of outlets and people to talk about it with, so thanks for listening Reddit.

41kd53,50,2016-01-18,I'm [F23] torn between following my dreams and supporting my parents [M/F 50's].,dontwanttodisappoint,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41kd53/im_f23_torn_between_following_my_dreams_and/,"Hi Reddit; I need some advice.  I'm drowning and I don't know what to do anymore.  Sorry for the wall of text.


Some background: I'm from a very small, close knit family where it's expected you do everything to take care of your own.  In my sophomore year of high school, my mom got sick and had to have emergency surgery.  One complication led to another, and fast forward eight years later my once vibrant, type A, go getter mother has turned into a shut in who only leaves the house for doctors appointments.  She has severe chronic pain amongst other issues, and there is little that the doctors can do to improve her quality of life.  She isn't able to do much cleaning or cooking, which was previously her domain.  My dad works a very busy job and takes care of all the bills and bigger house things, like if a pipe bursts, but he doesn't do much day to day cleaning.  I worry about them both; if no one cooks, they just eat fast food.  I'm terrified my dad is going to have a heart attack.



I tried to do as much as I could to help in high school.  I went to a state school nearby, and came home as often as I could to help out or just spend time with them.  My mom is incredibly isolated and lonely; she's lost all contact with her friends, so my dad and I are the only people she interacts with besides our pets.  I struggled with depression in college, but it was tempered by having an amazing support system in my sorority sisters and other friends, being involved in clubs I was passionate about, and having jobs and a major I loved.  

I graduated back in May, and everything seems to have gone down hill.  My mom had to go into the hospital for almost a month for another emergency surgery soon after I graduated and moved back home.  My plan had always been to look for a job in a city about ten hours away.  That's where all the jobs in my field are, and I did a summer internship there and fell in love with the city.  But with my mom in the hospital, my dad drowning in debt from her increasing medical bills, and my own credit card debt increasing because I no longer had my two part time campus jobs, I started applying for jobs near my parents.  Panicked with everything that was going on, I took the first one that was offered to me.

Reddit, I hate this job.  I recently got promoted, and I couldn't turn it down without getting fired (The position I had before was an entry level meant to lead to the one I have now; sort of like saying “I won't  move in with you ever” is a deal breaker for a five year relationship).  The hours are horrible, and my personality and passions are incredibly ill suited for the job.  Plus, I have anywhere from a two to three hour commute total each day.  I'm miserable to the point of having panic attacks before I go into work.

I've been applying for new jobs, but there just aren't really any I'm interested in where I live currently.  I also don't really like the area/state I live in.  I keep thinking about moving back to my dream city, reconnecting with old friends (the majority of my friends moved away post graduation, and several of them are in the city I want to move to).  But what's stopping me is my parents.  By moving out and so far away, I would be abandoning them.  No one would be doing the cooking or cleaning anymore (My parents can't afford to hire someone because of my mom's medical bills).  My mom would be miserable, and my dad would have no one to help him out with things like picking him up from the garage if his car was broken.

I'm from a culture where abandoning your sick parents is as bad as abandoning your sick child.  My mom took care of my grandmother with severe Alzheimers even with all of her health issues.  My dad is constantly doing things for his aging parents.  Neither of them were super excited by these responsibilities, but they sucked it up and did what had to be done.  I don't know why I can't do the same.  I feel selfish and like a horrible child, but I'm miserable and living in the same city I grew up doing jobs I hate is so far from my dream in life you can't even see it on the same map.  I know I need to see a professional, and I'm looking for one I can afford, but I feel like I'm drowning and I wanted to get someone else's opinion until I find someone, because I don't know what to do anymore.

Tl;dr: I'm miserable in my personal and professional life, but following my dreams requires me moving  several hours away from my ill mother and overworked dad, and leaving them with no support.  I want to pursue my dream life, but I think the guilt of leaving them would eat me alive."
41l53y,5,2016-01-18,Well I'm a 15 year old boy and I'm bi also I think in trans so I just need some advice one what to do.,kirito1342,asktransgender,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/41l53y/well_im_a_15_year_old_boy_and_im_bi_also_i_think/,Well I guess if u want to help you need to know my story. Ps i legit made this account just to ask this question i want NO ONE i know to even have a hint this is happening the chances they would see this is small but idc lol. It all started when I was around 9 and I had fantasy's and dreams about becoming a girl. I hid my feminine self as a kid. I wanted to take my pic with the princesses but was to embarrassed. One time as a joke my sister asked me to put on a dress so she can take a pic and joke bout it to her friends and I got so excited. This may sound hella retarted but I was young and I still find it dumb to this day. But I tried to stay on my laptop 4 a long time then put the hot bottom lol hot bottom. I put that on my... Well you know. I had a plan to mess up my you know what then the doctors would change me into a girl cuz my dic was so messed up. You can laugh I know I even laugh thinking back to it. Then at 12 I just kinda got used to acting really manly. I tried to never let my feminine self get out and I just lived with it. Now I'm 15 I now am clearer on who I am. I have experimented and sometimes I like girls sometimes I like men. I like girls majority of the time. But for the past half year I have been worried about my gender AGAIN. I act feminine in my daily life but not to much. I do act more like a girl when I'm alone. Ps most people may not understand but I have dressed as a girl and still will because it just feels right and think I do actually look like a girl pretty hot one also. Also when i see a hot girl I'm not like other men (I dont think) I dont think man I wanna f that. I think what would it be like to be that. Pretty funny story I txted one of my friends over kik that I wanted to talk I had some personal stuff ill tell you when you get on. Then I pass it off as I almost died and I just wanted to think bout life. Then like a week later I txted him that I lied bout that txt and I told him I thought I was trans. Then I told him im lesbian. Then I passed that off as a huge joke cuz he thought I was joking. So I was like ahh you fell for it you actually felt sorry for me your gay. Well back to the story it just weird 4 me cuz at one point I feel I'm a girl then the next I feel I'm male. I'm just confused and the more time I wait the more I get frustrated bout this. Its like I don't know if I feel male cuz I was born male or I feel female to cuz its something different. Its like I'm arguing with myself I have just been going back and forth but lately I have been trying to reveal my feminine self I have been hiding to my parents cuz my brothers and sister are to old to be living with there parents. So basically I have been playing my music so they can hear talking more feminine wearing necklaces and jewelry. But my parents have been unreasonable lately. My mom just screams at me telling me I'm doing nothing with my life but when I do something like make a YouTube with 1000 subs or getting 1st place in the state for an art contest. Or me getting a job and making 30 dollars per hour at 15. She just doesn't care all she does is sit down on her bed with a tablet. But I do like to play games. Video games are my life but I all she brings up is that all I do is play games and do nothing else but b%&amp; I work out and do stuff with my life i make sure i dont become fat and lazy like her all she does is sit down on her tablet and never works out and eats healthy. But that's a different problem for another day. Well basicly my mom its just like I can't talk to her. And my dad he is very helpful and we fight sometimes but majority of the time we hang out talk go go karting and he actually was the one who got me the job. But I go with him when he goes out because he like to talk. I just agree with his options cuz he tells the most safest storys bout his childhood and I just feel bad for him. And today I was going to tell him I want to see a gender therapist. But yesterday we were talking. And to see on how he'd think of me being bi and trans I started a convo bout my brother who is bi he has straight out said he was. He acts WAY more feminine than me and he got fired from Disney world cuz interns were comin in and they made cut backs. So he said that oh he wouldn't have gotten fired if he didn't always wear Minnie mouse hat like where did he think to do that. This is why I dont want to talk to him he just acts to gay. But I should have expected that. He is very racist. Like one time when he came to pick me up from school just as a surprise. I usually walk like 1 mile but he likes to help me. Then my friends where saying bye and stuff and most of them were black. Then my dad says you really hang out with these n words then he laughs and says there n words why do you even talk to them. So in short of an essays worth bout my parents they would not understand me being bi or trans and its just I don't know who else to talk to or tell for some advice. Like is what I'm going though normal or wat. Ps if u post f up shiza u just wasted time in your life to post something that someone would not care and just ignore. Ps man I posted alot I was just sitting here watchin a movie while typing this and I didn't realize I typed so much lol.well
41lgai,1,2016-01-18,Question for Federal LEOs about Master's Degrees,Braz90,ProtectAndServe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/41lgai/question_for_federal_leos_about_masters_degrees/,"I am a police officer, have a bachelor's degree in law enforcement, internship completed with the Secret Service. My question is, if I were to go for my master's (would have to be completed online), which degree would be the best for federal agencies? Computer science? Cyber security? One thing I learned from my internship is that computers are the future of federal LE. 

Does anyone have experience with this or has anyone gotten their master's degree online? We rotate shifts monthly so I could never commit to school in person. Thanks guys, just looking to do something MORE and be a part of something larger. Always looking to better myself. "
41lh9u,1,2016-01-18,OCS or ROTC possibility for a 4th year STEM College Student,LashisaBread,Militaryfaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Militaryfaq/comments/41lh9u/ocs_or_rotc_possibility_for_a_4th_year_stem/,"Hey guys, so I'm in my 4th year of uni at the University of Pittsburgh with a 3.3 GPA in the InfoSci field with a CCNA certification. 

That being said, I never played high-school sports and I haven't had many extra-curriculars as I've mostly just hung out with friends throughout my educational life. I've done an Internship at a Pfizer as an IT guy and my Father is a retired Major in the Marine corps (not sure if this helps, but just in case.) 

Those are pretty much the extent of my qualifications. I'm in decent physical shape, and I'm currently improving each month thanks to my own program I'm on (and according to a friend who is in ROTC, I outperform most of the Freshmen/sophomores here.)

After the internship mentioned earlier, I realized I can't sit behind a desk for the rest of my life without pursuing my dream of being an Army Officer (specifically a Tank Commander) first. I've weighed my options and I'm looking to either apply to ROTC (and get my Masters during the 2 years required) or OCS for a more direct route. 

I did at one point meet with West Point officers on-campus during my applications for Freshman year and I seemed to make a good impression. Ultimately, I was convinced to attend Pitt after a visit and never fully completed my application, so I can't say whether I would have been accepted or not, but I did at least get some ""good vibes"" from the men I met with while there. As with the info about my father, not sure if this matters, but it might give an idea of how I present myself, since I know appearance and manner is an important aspect for portions of the application process.

So my question is this: From what I've said here, is there at least a decent possibility of getting in to (OCS preferably) either one of them? I'm refraining from letting enlistment be an option thanks to my family's military officer history across branches. Also, is there anything in particular I could do or strive for to prepare me for application physically or mentally, or even appearance-wise (although I don't think this is much of an issue, any special additions that could help are welcome tips.) 

Any feedback is appreciated, thanks. "
41li1v,1,2016-01-18,When do I [21 M] talk to my girlfriend [21 F] of four months about post-college plans and break the magic?,greatestweakness,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41li1v/when_do_i_21_m_talk_to_my_girlfriend_21_f_of_four/,"My girlfriend and I met each other five months ago, and we've been official for four. The relationship always had a crucial hill that we'd need to address, that neither of us have addressed at this point -- she graduates in May, and I'm still going to be in college for another year.

Not only that, her current opportunities have her out staying outside of the USA for international English teaching. Due to my major in computer science, the best cities for me are places in the USA, like Seattle, SF, NYC, etc. So our trajectory paths aren't really compatible. Even if we decided after eight months that we wanted to mold our lives around each other, it would be extremely difficult.

So it's pretty clearly spelled out that the relationship has an expiry date of, at the latest, graduation. I'm not really down for a long distance relationship. Neither of us is planning on getting married or having kids in the next ten years, so it just doesn't make sense at all. Unless somebody has a contrary opinion, I think this is the best way to go.

With that in mind, here's the contention.

We've both agreed that this relationship has been the best we've had thus far. She and I both act as amazing emotional/mental supports to each other. It definitely helps, because we're both taking full course loads at an extremely academically rigorous college, have part-time jobs, and are currently looking for job opportunities after this year (I've found a summer internship, but she's still searching for full-time positions). Any time we get to spend together (messaging or IRL) helps keep us sane. We both just genuinely love and care about each other, and in this stage of our lives, providing an escape from a busy life seems to be the best way to show that. Not to mention, we also have an awesome sex life.

But we need to talk about this eventually. The last four months went by in a breeze, and she'll be graduating in no time at all. I'm just afraid of ruining the magic we have. I feel like once we talk about this, there will be a seed of doubt why we're even together if it's eventually going to end, and the relationship will fall apart much sooner than it has to. On the flip side, I've heard that it's beneficial for both of us to break it off early so we have time to adjust to being single before jumping into our actual lives.

I'd say I care for her more than any other girlfriend I've had. So I have her best interests in mind. A sub-question I have here is what's best for her personal growth? She dated another guy for three years, and only had a three month hiatus before dating me. That means only three months of being single since 17. But I've been single for half of my college career, so I'm used to it and think I would adjust easily.

My main question is this: when is the best time to bring this up? I don't want to bring this up too early and ruin potential months of the best relationship we've both had. There's genuine love and caring on both sides, something I think is a unicorn when it comes to relationships this young. On the other hand, I don't want to address it too late and blindside her with the inevitable.

Thanks for any and all feedback.

**tl;dr**: GF and I have an amazing relationship, but we should probably break up after college. When should we have that talk? I don't want to ruin too much time I could spend with her."

The Misfit Islanders, I am not surprised to see you here again. You started strong and now the team went downhill. Beardo, Mickey, and Cody. Only two of you will move on the other will be joining the losers. 

Cody, you constantly participated in each challenge and even if you were not great, you at least helped. You are the first player safe from this elimination! 

*hands Cody his marshmallow* 

Mickey and Beardo, two strong players. Only one will move on and one will stay. Ultimately, it was Cody's vote that would put one of you through and send the other one home. 

The final marshmallow of the night goes to...

*stares at Mickey then at Beardo*

Hm...

Mickey! 

*tosses the marshmallow to Mickey*

You have officially been saved and Beardo is the next to go home!

Cody: ""Hehe. Sorry I was looking through all the past challenges and Mickey has helped more. That is how I voted. Sorry Beardo.""

***

Goodbye, Beardo! *the interns drag away Beardo and toss him into the cave* Feel free to send me a letter if you want to! 

With that, you two are the only survivors of this team and should feel happy.

Today is the last day where everyone will be on their current teams because I'm going to be changing this game up! Good luck everyone and I hope you find your new team to be pleasant!

41mt2l,17,2016-01-18,So you think you want to OCS... (not a question),SAONS12,Militaryfaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Militaryfaq/comments/41mt2l/so_you_think_you_want_to_ocs_not_a_question/,"This has been live for noob questions for less than a week and there have already been several questions regarding OCS. Once upon a time I wrote this up while bored on battalion staff duty and resurrected it this summer on r/army. This is written for active duty Army- anyone else with Marine/Air Force/Navy/Coast Guard (do you guys have OCS??) experience, please chime in! 

DISCLAIMER This information is most relevant to those interested in active duty; different rules apply for Reserves and National Guard Officer Candidates.

Bottom line up front: google is your friend. The first and second true steps to starting the OCS application process are Google and research. If your first stop is r/army or r/militaryfaq weekly question board...you are not ready to Officer

Step 1. Use the search bar. Or Google- because it will take you to OCS specific sites and boards where people can answer even the most mundane and detailed questions like what the role of an assistant S-3 is within a FA battalion stationed at Ft. Lewis. Or what the training curriculum is like as an Armor Officer. Nobody here on Reddit can tell you how strong your packet is or what job might be best for you. We joined (or were given) our branches for a reason and have personal prejudices. You have to make this decision yourself yet be open to new paths. Walking into the recruiters office on day 1 set on military intelligence and nothing else is a bad idea because, frankly, you don't know what you're talking about. In the months between my board and actually branching, I changed my mind countless times as I encountered different Officers, learned about their jobs, and learned about the Army in general. If you're at a loss, my personal criteria was 1) a job that had a meaningful peace and war time mission; 2) a job that would develop skills I could take into the civilian world, beyond leadership; and, 3) a job that would take me to the field where I could blow stuff up. Engineers lead the way.
Check this out www.armyocs.com. It can be a bit dead at times but is a treasure trove of information.

Step 2: Ask yourself if you're a good candidate. A recruiter is going to invest a lot of time and effort in your packet. They will look at the following criteria:

* Be in good health. Anything that will disqualify you from enlisting will disqualify you from being an Officer. You can read about that here. Precious few MEPS doctors hang out on Reddit so save yourself the karma and don't ask about the inhaler you had for 3 weeks when you were 6.

* Degrees. The recruiters are not blowing smoke when they tell you the Army is leaning towards STEM degrees. Weekly I sob over my Political Science degree while stroking my engineer branch pins. That being said, while the Army favors STEM degrees less than other branches, it still looks favorably on anything with a +3.4. A STEM degree will make you more competitive but intelligence, time management and proven competence will always come out on top. Do you have a graduate degree? Unless its in health/law you will still be a O1. Only an O1 with a masters degree. Even those with a health/law degree that don't go JAG or Medical Corp are still O1s...with peers that think you make odd decisions. 

* GPA. 3.4 and above is pretty solid. A 2.8 in Civil/Mechanical/Chemical Engineering is competitive but a 2.8 in Liberal Arts/English/International Relations/History is not. One time I made a joke that Theater majors need not apply and then all the Surge Theater majors showed up and proclaimed their success. They've probably been separated now.

* Age. If you haven't enrolled in college yet look into ROTC. Remember that ROTC doesn't guarantee Active Duty- so you could work your rear off for four/two years to end up where you don't want to be. When you're selected for Active Duty OCS/OTS there's nothing that can change that. Maybe you graduated five years ago and are looking to switch careers, that's fine. However, generally 35 (current HRC age limit for active) is too old for Active duty, 42 is too old for the Reserves (current HRC age limit for reserves/national guard). At 32+ many of your peers are already Majors and sitting on staff...there's a physical reason for that.

* Past experience. OCS draws on candidates who've had some life experience either as prior enlisted or post-college. What have you done with your life that shows leadership potential? Feel like you're lacking in that area? Take a year and develop yourself through an internship or community involvement, the Army will still be there and you'll be better prepared for it.

* Nobody cares what your ethnic background is or what gender you are. All they care about is the demonstrated capacity to effectively lead Soldiers.

* Have a clean record. A few years ago the Army would take anyone with a beating heart and a college degree. Those days are over. Moral waivers are no longer approved. No misdemeanors, drug/alcohol charges, or even too many speeding tickets. Seriously, 9 speeding tickets will keep you from being an active duty Officer.

Step 3. You're still reading- think you will make a good Candidate? Time to call the recruiter. Make sure that your recruiter knows what they're doing and has put together a OCS packet before. The Marines and Navy have specific Officer recruiters but the Army does not. It's a long, drawn out process already and ineptitude/inexperience just makes it worse. Expect your packet to get kicked back at least once. It's a test. If you want to be an Officer, don't enlist first. It's not a short cut. Doing shitty work and shamming for 2 years as an E4 will not make you a better officer or better respected as ""prior service"". That's not to say salty Corporals or Specialists shouldn't apply- please apply, we need your saltiness. NCOs are always welcome to come over to the dark side, we have a keurig and computers for everyone.

Step 4. Prepare for the board. Ask your recruiters to do a mock board, they will murder you and you will thank them later. Ask influential people of influential standing to write letters of recommendation for you. If they're in the military and in the grades O1-O2 do not ask them to write a letter of recommendation for you. Lieutenants only impress themselves. College professors are great, bosses are great, and local/state/national government leaders are fantastic. Have a back up plan and a back up to that back up plan. Do not put all your eggs in this rapidly shrinking basket. The application process can take 6-8 months and sometimes double that. Be patient. Put work into your packet. It will probably get kicked back at least once, it's a test. Put it in again. Use this time to prepare for the board; if you don't get accepted the first time, wait 6 months and try again. It is worth the effort.

Step 5. Congratulations, you only have 8 months until you ship out. Time to start working out like a mad man/women so you don't fall out and hurt yourself. Never fall out.

Step 6. Continue researching branches that interest you. See above. Ask your recruiters if they can put you in touch with recent commissionees or ask your college buddies who commissioned through ROTC/West Point what their jobs are like. Civil Affairs, Psychological Ops (now called MISO), Rangers, SF, and other functional area branches are non-accession branches. That means you cannot apply and be selected for them until you are a 1LT-Promotable aka you've served about three years, haven't gotten a DUI, lost a major end item, and remembered to take your DA photo. Medical Services and Aviation generally do not give open slots to OCS but you can put together an application packet to be selected by the branch."

[26F]/[25M]/[23M]",datingthrowaway4,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41n59g/is_it_better_to_date_someone_you_have_chemistry/,"I've been dating around for the past couple months after ending my last serious relationship, and I've noticed that it's very difficult to find someone with every quality I desire.  There's a lot on my long list of ""requirements"" for a guy that I can fall in love with, and I realized that I probably need to start settling on a few points or else I'm going to end up spending the rest of my life alone.  I just don't know how to start lowering my probably ridiculous standards in a way that will actually make me happy in the end.

Right now, I'm caught in a situation where I'm kind of dating two guys, neither of them exclusive yet, and it's pretty much a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  Both like me (I think).

One is really, really awesome.  We have everything in common, and he's super fun.  We have a ton in common, we like the same activities, and we converse really well.  His life is super interesting and I could listen to him talk for hours.  He's extroverted, happy, and really smart too.  He's a bit younger than me and he's in school, but he's got a well paying internship and he's doing really well for himself given that he's still a student.  He's pretty much everything I want in a guy.  Only problem is that the chemistry isn't really there.  We've been on 3-4 dates so far and I can't really bring myself to kiss him.  It's not even like he's unattractive.  I just can't.  I think if he kissed me I might go along with it, but I don't know if I'd like it or not.  He's a fairly handsome guy, but I'm just not attracted personally.  I can't even come up with a reason why.  Thinking about kissing him doesn't give me pleasant feelings, even though I really want it to.

The other guy is sweet, and a really nice guy, but, honestly kind of a loser.  He lives with his parents, about 30 minutes away in the hickish next town over, and doesn't have a car.  He works at a fast food place even though he just graduated university.  He has no friends, no life, he sits around on the internet all day since he only works like, 20 hours per week.  He's kind of got a mess of red (well, red-ish) flags surrounding him.  Yet, for whatever reason that I cannot fathom, I'm crazy about him.  I just want to make out with him for hours, and then cuddle in his arms.  I haven't even had sex with him, but he turns me on like it's nobody's business.  I feel comfortable around him and want to be in his presence.  

The fuck is wrong with me?  Am I taking crazy pills?  Should I try and force attraction with guy 1?  Should I learn to accept guy 2's societal failings and love him anyway?  Or should I take the secret third option of maintaining my standards and hoping someone will come along that can actually meet them?  I'm asking for both this particular situation, and similar situations in general.

TLDR:  Is it better to go out with someone who you're super attracted to, but isn't mature or stable, or someone you're less attracted to, but is a much better catch?  Or is it better to hold out for someone who is both?"

41n8bv,6,2016-01-19,UPDATE: Thank you for your kind words re birthday tears.,troweytrblslpn,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/41n8bv/update_thank_you_for_your_kind_words_re_birthday/,"I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/40824q/its_my_birthday_and_i_cant_stop_crying/) on my birthday 10 days ago and I'm only just returning to see it blew up much more than I expected. To avoid being repetitive by replying the same thing to every comment I figured I'd create this post as an update and to help everyone understand my perspective better.

I'm usually not one to compare myself to others, and I really do believe we all have our own paths to follow; however, I felt especially despondent on my birthday because of how broke I was (and still am) and how I had to rely on my best friend for something so basic. I'm an international student, so my parents and family live in my home country. We're going through an economic downturn and exchange rates have skyrocketed so it is near impossible for them to assist me, even if they had the money to (which they don't). All my close friends are from the same country as me- we all came here for college, and so have parity on the education front. However, I'm the only one of my friends STILL in school as they all completed their masters degrees May last year. I also started school a year before them, so... yeah.

I also don't have a lot of confidence in myself or ability to get a job. I have a lot of limitations as an international student: working off campus isn't allowed except it's an internship/coop/full time job. Unfortunately, not a lot of employers like to employ international students as we require visa sponsorship which comes as an additional cost to them. As such, I haven't had any luck on the internship front and my resume is empty even though I'm about to have a masters degree in engineering. The continued rejection has eaten away at my confidence, and I'm in a terrible state mentally as I'd rather lay in bed than apply myself because *there's no point*.

However, I'm trying to change that. I'm still not registered, but I've reached out to a few people at my school and I hope to get that sorted within the week. I'm working on changing my mindset, and I'm trying to teach myself SQL because, while it has nothing to do with my major, I figure it'd be a handy skill to list on my resume. At the back of my mind, I know this is my low point and it is in my hands to climb out of it. I know things *will* get better.

Thank you all for your kind words!"

If something falls out my pocket even if its just lint she starts yelling OMG WHY ARE YOU DROPPING S$&amp;* ON THE FLOOR DO YOU WANT TO LITER.

Then my friends were waving bye and most of them were black, so my dad says ""you really hang out with these n word (laughs) why there n words"". He talked on how he couldn't get my sister a job cuz she is a girl and will only be eye candy. Then just a few days ago I asked him on how he felt bout my brother who is admittedly bi and acts very feminine. All he talked bout is on how he probably wouldn't have gotten fired from Disney if he wasn't so gay PS. My brother got fired from Disney cuz interns replaced him and they had to many workers already.

FIELD ASSISTANT / CAMP MANAGER POSITION AVAILABLE STUDYING WILD PRIMATE
BEHAVIOR IN THE ETHIOPIAN HIGHLANDS

ONE field assistant / camp manager needed for The University of
Michigan Gelada Research Project, a study of the evolutionary biology,
behavior, communication, endocrinology, and conservation of wild
geladas (Theropithecus gelada) - a close relative of baboons. All
research is conducted at a remote field station located in the Simien
Mountains National Park of Ethiopia. Directors of the project are Dr.
Thore Bergman and Dr. Jacinta Beehner, faculty at the University of
Michigan. The successful candidate will be responsible for (a)
collecting basic demographic and reproductive data as part of routine
monitoring of the well-habituated study population, (b) conducting
focal animal samples, taking growth photos, and collecting fecal and
urine samples from individually-recognized geladas (for later
laboratory steroid hormone analysis in the USA), (c) downloading the
data each day to a computer and sending this data back to the U.S. on a
monthly basis, and (d) maintaining camp equipment and managing
personnel. The gelada population has been studied on a near-daily basis
since 2006, and we currently recognize approximately 250 individuals
(that you will learn to identify and love).

Our field station is a stone hut located deep within the national park
that is shared with 0-3 American graduate students (depending on the
time of year).  The project employs 3 Ethiopian field assistants, and
1-2 Ethiopian staff (for cooking and cleaning) who live down the path
from the project hut in the Park outpost that consists of 4-5 rangers
and their families. The hut has 3 bedrooms (sleeps 6 comfortably), a
full kitchen set-up (including a propane-powered freezer, and a
propane-powered stove and oven), a propane-powered hot shower, solar
panels to power computers and lights, a generator (for electricity
during the rainy season), a satellite telephone and modem (for email),
and a Toyota 4x4 pickup truck. There is no running water at the
fieldsite, but fresh water is brought to the camp daily from a nearby
spring (and filtered at the camp). For more information on the project
directors, the project publications, and some photos of the fieldsite,
please see the project website:
http://www.umich.edu/~gelada/UMGRP/Home.html.

 Qualified applicants will have a B.S. or B.A in Biology, Zoology,
Biological Anthropology, or a related field. Prior travel and/or field
experience in Africa or mountainous regions of Asia or South America
preferred. Applicants must be fluent in English and eager to learn
Amharic (the national language of Ethiopia). Good physical fitness is
absolutely essential - the terrain is hilly, the air is thin (due to
the high elevation), and the temperatures can get quite cold during the
rainy season (nights are sometimes below freezing and days can be
cold). Good organizational skills and experience with basic database
management a must. Must be able to drive a stick-shift 4x4 truck over
rough terrain. Experience with leadership also a plus - as you will
be working closely with several graduate students and field
assistants.

Salary/funding: This is a volunteer position, so there is no salary.
However, round-trip airfare and living support will be provided for the
volunteer (visa expenses, travel, meals, lodging). Additionally,
volunteer will be provided with basic accommodation, food and other
basic supplies while at the field site. The volunteer is responsible
for any additional expenses incurred while traveling in Ethiopia. The
project will provide emergency travel health insurance, but the
volunteer is required to have basic health care coverage and must
acquire the necessary vaccinations prior to entry to Ethiopia. The
volunteer will need to provide their own winter/alpine condition
clothing, footwear and sleeping bag. Advice about what items are
necessary for life in the Simien Mountains will be provided to the
successful applicant.

Appointment: 1-2 years beginning early-May, 2016. Because the training
process requires 2-4 months (mostly learning the animals), the
successful applicant must be willing to work for a minimum of 1 year.
Applicants committing to a longer period will receive one round-trip
flight to their home country halfway through their internship. Note
that 4 (out of 5) previous camp managers have found this experience
quite rewarding and have signed on to a second year. Ethiopia is a safe
and extremely friendly country to live in.

Deadline: Position will remain open until filled. Earlier applications
will receive priority. We hope to fill the position before the end of
February, 2016.

Application: Please email the following materials to Dr. Jacinta
Beehner at jbeehner@umich.edu: (1) a letter of interest stating how and
why this position satisfies your interest and future career goals,
explaining your suitability for this project, plus a time frame during
which you are available to work (when you are free to travel), (2) a CV
or resume detailing relevant experience, (3) a summary of college
courses taken and the grades received, to be followed by an official
transcript, and (4) contact information for at least two references,
preferably at least one academic reference as well as one person who
has worked closely with you or who has closely supervised your work.
The subject heading of the email message should read: Application
for field research position.

41oceu,3,2016-01-19,I wish things were simpler,onesimplelife,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/41oceu/i_wish_things_were_simpler/,"I mean seriously, I dont understand how I could become such a mess internally. I had a really messed up 2015- I was screwing up this freelance project because of serious mistakes I made along the way, but thankfully the project was delayed so I was somewhat saved for the most part, but there was no denying that it was a confidence killing disaster. Its still up in the air, and while I'm am on track with it- I'm still worried about how it will turn out and if I'd even get paid fully. But everything said and done, I wasn't feeling too bad as I always assumed that I had an exit plan. I wanted to shift careers and that involved getting out of the country for a while and studying something elsewhere. Now while that meant emptying my savings I was ok with it because it meant getting out of this miserable city that I was completely fed up off. But sadly that didn't work out either as there was a mistake with the file in the Canadian University I applied for and it was only after sending them a few more emails that my file finally moved through the system. By the time I was granted admission it was too late- I couldn't just pack bags and leave nor could I apply for the visa on such short notice.

&amp;nbsp;

Now all this would've been bad enough, but I have had other problems too. My girlfriend understood that I had to leave and was surprisingly cool with that but somehow along the way (perhaps I was too busy with my project) that I never realised how apathetic she had become. She just lost faith in everything- she refused to leave the house and do anything, nor go to college (she regretted and hated it) and she refused to meet her friends or build any kind of relationships other than what we had (shes on good terms with her family but they work elsewhere for most of the year). By the end of the year I was under the impression that things would get better for her, but they didn't and even with my encouraging she refused to meet friends, family, work, intern- pretty much anything. She made me the center of her universe and while it didn't bother me initially despite her not wanting my help, it started getting to me when she got pissed when I went to meet my friends or was too wrapped up in work or if I had any kind of party/celebration plans with my friends. So when my study plans got canned naturally she was pretty happy to have me around for a longer, but her empty life still bothered me. I hated that I had become an excuse for her to do nothing for her and her lonely life. She was clearly not happy but instead was just happy exisiting in this bubble that she created for her self that seemed to have no promise of a future, happiness or satisfaction in anything. I couldn't deal with this life she was living beside me when things were going so wrong with my life too and so I finally snapped last month. I asked her for some space- because I felt I needed to do something in my new career to make myself feel like I'm not wasting time (keep myself busy basically) and she needed the space to work on her life and her future too. I wasn't worried about abandoning her as she had her family staying with her for a few months so I was certain that with such a bold step- things would get better. But again that didn't work either. Around Christmas she had this massive melt down claiming I'm leaving and abandoning her and pretty much got suicidal and self-harming crazy and I just couldn't deal with it- I just couldn't come to terms with this person who I've dated for almost 5 years could be like this. This person who used to mean the world to me just wanted to be sad, lonely and miserable with only me in her life and refused to fix things or herself. I was already nervous about my future with her considering how she was going about things, but now I lost almost all hope. I told her pretty clearly that I didn't want to be with someone like this and the fact that she refused my help for the past year meant that there was nothing I could do for her and she needed to figure things out on her own. In retrospect, that probably wasn't the best way to go about it- a relationship runs on trust and communication but back then (and thinking on it clearly) I just wanted to break off from this constant source of negative energy. I just wanted to be left alone and think things through. Now again all this would've been enough. But then I met somebody.

&amp;nbsp;

Around a month ago (before Christmas), me and my friends had been getting awfully friendly with this ex-co worker of a friend. Honestly, I think shes fascinating and awesome but I was pretty level headed with my girlfriend and so I wasn't ready to flip tables to act on this crush I seemed to be quickly developing. But I just couldn't control the way things were developing- we were getting along so well, better than all my friends combined and I had to take a stand on the closeness I was getting with this new person in my life and so I made it very clear I wasn't interested in her and put down all of her advances and instead resorted to discussing how much I missed my girlfriend while I was with her. She got the message pretty quick and instead started focusing on my friend who was (and is still) clearly not interested while also trying to work things out with some other guy who always liked her. It was infuriating initially as this girl seemed to be everything I missed in my girlfriend. Sure she wasn't as pretty, but she had this cute charm to her and gosh we shared so many interests to the point where we could talk for hours alone if we had the chance. She seemed so determined to work out her future what with her juggling 2 internships, a distance learning course and even working part time that she really appealed to me. I didn't want to hook up or sleep with this woman I just wanted to be with someone awesome who had a life and a clear idea for her future. She read books, listened to great music, watched awesome shows and did awesome stuff that my girlfriend didn't seem to do and she seemed to know so much that I felt so taken up by her. But on the other hand I knew this would lead nowhere- she has her own set of mental illness issues which I'm sure I wouldn't be able to put up with (atleast not currently), she doesn't have good history as she has messed around with 2 of my close friends and she has plans to leave the country by this semester to study more (like me) so obviously a future isn't possible at all. So obviously I made the right decision here- I'd have better chances of working things out if I stuck to my girlfriend and figured things out with her than throw away an amazing relationship, disappoint my friends and ruin everything by acting on my feelings for this new girl. I made a decision with my head, but somehow I'm struggling to keep to it. I can't stop thinking about this girl and how I feel for her. She seems to be doing alright with that other guy whos always liked her, but I can't control myself from not messaging her and then feeling frustrated when she replies late and is now clearly not interested in me. I feel like I should've gone down the rabbit hole and seen where it led rather than think with my fucking head and feel frustrated and angry now. Clearly cutting her out of my life is the best solution here, but now thats shes friends with my friends- thats going to be near impossible to do. Interestingly, my girlfriend has been improving from the past week or so- going around on her own, attending class and spending time with her family but its not enough to get me to start thinking of her again. 

&amp;nbsp;

Outwardly my friends know I'm in a mess but they suppose it is only cause of the current break I'm on with my girlfriend but I'm pretty sure they'd be pretty disappointed in me if they knew how I was cheating on my girlfriend for feeling these things for someone else. They don't particularly like my girlfriend, but they think shes nice. I doubt they'd understand what I'm going through and how weak I actually am and how I feel inside and so I can't tell them these things and that frustrates me further. My friends have always supported me, given me good advice and also told me off in almost everything I've done in my life, but here I am having to pretend and be fake to my own friends so they don't realise whats up and ruin things with the new friend we all seem to be making.

41ofgl,1,2016-01-19,"27, bad cv and degree, patchy work history. Thinking about working to become a software developer and would love some advice.",sdta88,developers,https://www.reddit.com/r/developers/comments/41ofgl/27_bad_cv_and_degree_patchy_work_history_thinking/,"Hi guys,

Long story short my career/degree path has not really worked out, and the industry I'm in isn't for me. I've been spending the past few weeks looking at every career under the sun, as what I'm doing now has been my passion since I was 16.

I keep coming back to software development. I have this silly dream of wanting to work in bleeding edge/future tech stuff, yet I *cannot* afford the time or money of going back to school, so stuff like engineering is out. I've always enjoyed working with computers and my current line of work relies on them heavily as well (albeit more in a media creation/manipulation scenario). I find the idea of creating/working on software very appealing, in part because of the scope of applications/industries that it could cover.

I have no idea where to start. It seems *huge* mountain in front of me of an entire world I know nothing about. I'd appreciate if anyone here could offer some guidance.

- Where do I start? There seems to be so many different programming languages, networks, servers. If I learn a few do the others become easier, or are they all completely separate? 

- Am I able to learn this myself? There seems to be many resources online (Lynda etc) for learning programming.

- How long would you estimate I'd need to learn/practice before I can start looking for work in the field? Is there a more employable language/skill set to follow?

- How does one get jobs in this field - is it portfolio based? I'll be coming at it without a computer science degree so realise the odds will be stacked against me. What is generally the progression for software developers? Are there internships then junior positions?

- Could any vets comment on the lifestyle of a software developer? Long hours and shit pay with bad treatment, or somewhere in between? I'm coming from the media industry which is an abysmal work/life/pay balance.


Many, many thanks in advance."

I have the absolute honour to have landed an internship at a top notch tech company in the UK. Excitement aside, I was wondering how I should process the loan, taxwise. I will be earning an approximate 4400GBP/month, and I will be working there for 12 weeks. I will also be relocated by them, so I will be ""living"" there during the whole span of the internship.

How do I go about filing taxes? Do I pay them in the UK? Or in Belgium? Maybe both? I've been doing some reading, and there is supposed to be a 10600GBP limit under which no taxes have to be paid, but this is for the UK.

I just want to do things right, I don't want to commit tax fraud.

41oxue,1,2016-01-19,Can we afford to buy this house if we sell or rent our current home?,lilmichigander,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/41oxue/can_we_afford_to_buy_this_house_if_we_sell_or/,"My husband and I currently live downriver of Detroit, MI. We own a little bungalow, 3 bedrooms, 1000 square feet.  We bought it about 5 years ago for 25k, according to Zillow's database of recently sold homes we could probably get around 50k-60k if we were to sell it now.

I currently make 62k. My husband is a full time electrical engineering student with a GI Bill and he also works as an intern at the local energy provider, bringing in approximately 600 USD a month, sometimes less sometimes more depending on his schedule. All in all, I would say our yearly income is probably around 85k a year. We don't have any debt, we only pay for utilities and 1.2k a month for daycare for our two small kids.

We have been thinking about buying a larger home for a while now, maybe two years from now when my husband graduates and gets a full time job. Of course, while snooping around Zillow (that stuff is addictive) we found a house that we really like. It is a 125k colonial, 1800k  sqft, 3 bedrooms, 2.5 baths, partially finished basement. Downside: it is still downriver whereas we would have liked to move north of Detroit. However, it is in the really nice part of our town, close to a very nice little park and playground, the home is nice and hardly needs any updating.

So now comes the question: should we buy or should we wait? We have about 70k in savings and excellent credit. This would be the first time we have to finance a home, so not even completely sure how the process goes but I don't think getting a loan would be an issue. We were thinking maybe put down a 20% down payment of 25k and account for about 9k worth of closing costs. That would leave a healthy chunk of our savings intact and keep the down payment relatively low. I did some research and if we wanted to, we could rent our current home for approximately 950 USD if we wanted to.

I guess my question is this: can we afford to buy this house? Is there something I am not taking into account? Should we just be patient and wait until my husband graduates and buy a home in a nicer area? Prices seem to be going up, we're afraid that maybe two years from now we won't be able to afford a home like this in a better area. Should be sell or rent our house?

I guess any tips would be helpful. My husband bought his first house cash and never really went through the process. This is my first home buying experience and I am from a foreign country... just want to make sure we do things right and don't get ourselves into a hole we would have a hard time climbing out of. "

I have an unrelated but still relevant degree to HR. I spent approximately 4 months as an HR intern before I took over an HR department of one. I have been in this current position for approximately a year. In the past year, I have been able to drastically reduce turnover, worked with a team that substantially reduced workplace injuries, transitioned to a new payroll/HRIS company that is saving us thousands of dollars a year, and brought benefit administration in-house. 

I would like to sit for the PHR in the spring but do not know if I will be able to adequately prepare myself in time. 

Despite these accomplishments, there was a change in executive leadership a few months ago and they do not appreciate the role of HR in any form. They believe my responsibilities should be mostly administrative in function. 

I accepted this position at a very low compensation rate so I could break into the HR field (and had extremely little experience). Because I do not see the responsibility, respect, or compensation improving, I think it may be time to start planning my exit strategy. 

Is it too soon Reddit? Should I just ""put up"" with the current situation to gain the experience that I know will make me more attractive when I do decide to move forward?  "

At the end of the summer, I found out that a decent amount of fellow interns that were graduating this spring were offered full-time positions. If I have another good summer and stay up to date on exam progress, the conversations that I had last summer lead me to believe that I have a good chance of being offered a student position upon graduation next year. 

That being said -- is it rude to decline the offer at first and express desire to apply to other companies during the fall? I wouldn't mind working at the company full time at all, I would just want to interview around and look at all of my options first. In this case would they write me off because I didn't accept right away? Or would I just talk to them at the Fall career fair again and submit a full-time application even though I already declined one.

I would prefer not to burn bridges with a company that I like in my home town but I am interested in working in other locations as well that could offer better salary and benefits.

41phqg,4,2016-01-19,"Financing Question: Graduate student, high credit score, but part time income and no co signer. (Virginia)",jerinx,askcarsales,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/41phqg/financing_question_graduate_student_high_credit/,"I'd like to preface this by saying I really have already tried to find the answer to this through the FAQs and searching, but haven't found a fully satisfactory answer. I really appreciate anyone's time in looking this over and helping me get an idea of what I'm looking at.

**TL;DR:** The title says it all, more details below, but the pertinent questions are at the end.

**My living/financial situation:** I am in the the US. I'm in the 2nd year of a 4 year grad program (PharmD). I have 10 months in my present job as a pharmacist intern. I have a very long work history before this, and my FICO score is solid (715 right now, floats between 710 and 730).  Here's the rub: I am 29, have no practical co-signer, and the thing that's seriously concerning me is the fact I'm *part time*. I work ~15 hours a week, pulling in about ~800 a month outside of school. Student loans cover all my expenses and then some - I can afford the payment, but I understand how tenuous a situation this may be to finance and I don't know how to go from here. 

**My car situation and wants:** I want to buy (through financing) a recent model year (this side of 2010) Mazda 3 or Ford Focus, with a heavy preference toward at 2014 Mazda 3. I drive manuals, and I'm looking at absolutely no more than $15000 out the door, with $2000 to put down for a down payment, so a loan for no more than $13k. I have a rust bucket 96 ranger now, so functionally no trade-in.

**For those who might ask: ""why don't you just go buy a rust bucket off craigslist for 2k until you graduate and get paid?""** Well, the simple answer is in the 4th year of this graduate program requires a *lot* of driving. Internships and on-site experiential rotations will require that I put ~40k miles. Also, there's 10 weeks out of the year I need a reliable vehicle starting last year, because I have to be able to get to rotation sites which happen each semester. I've taped together my Ranger with hopes and duct tape, but it's now not worth repairing. It died 2 months ago and I've been crossing all my Is and dotting all my Ts with credit card balances and accounts to maximize my score for this upcoming month. I'll do what I have to, but this is kind of where I want to be.

**My questions:** Is it a reasonable request/expectation to have a bank finance me without a co-signer? I only have one parent (my mom), and my sister tanked my mother's credit when she co-signed for my sister...so she's gun-shy about cosigning for me. However, this purchase is within my budget and unfortunately a long-term 'need'. So, the questions:

*If financing is a reasonable request/expectation:* is it better to deal with the dealership, or go through independently to find my own financing? I've read dealerships have better leverage with loans, but I'm here looking for your guys' expertise. What can I expect in this situation?

*If it is not reasonable to request/expect financing:* Is leasing feasible in my situation, or am I looking at dropping the notion of purchasing a car through financing? "

I wanted to take pictures with the princesses and I always dreamed of being a girl and dressing up exe. But I always hid that me and never told others what I wanted, I told them the more masculine thing to say.

   So I just got used to doing this and now I'm 15 and its just like I get more feminine and more worried each day. I know I'm bi but I'm not sure if I'm trans. Its like I argue with myself each day. One point I tell myself its a phase, then the next I tell myself im trapped in a mans body. I can't tell if seem masculine cuz its instinct for years of acting. 

   When im alone I love to dress and act as a girl. Even going online pretending im a girl. But is this just my mind's sexual fantasy (I do get pretty aroused by the thought of me as a girl). This is why I want to see a gender therapist it has been REALLY bothering me 4 almost 3 months. I have seen YouTube channels about if your trans and took quizes and asked others online. Those signs point to im trans. But that's just the internet I need a real person telling me and giving me professional medical advice. But I need my parents to get me into a gender therapist.
  
    My mom I think not care or try and bring me down from getting a therapist. She just hates me and I dont know why. I help her with her work and when she gets any chance she just yells at me. Like if I talk to a friend on Xbox too loud even if its one word she makes a big deal. If something falls out my pocket even if its just lint she starts yelling OMG WHY ARE YOU DROPPING S$&amp;* ON THE FLOOR DO YOU WANT TO LITER. Then even if I get a achievement in my life like getting a job that pays 30 dollars per hour AT 15, or getting 1st place in my state in a art contest, and even starting a YouTube channel and do what I love. She either doesn't care or finds a way to yell at me like saying oh you have a job well that's more of a reason for you not to clean. But all she does is sit down in her bed ALL DAY doing no work playing games on her tablet. She does foster dogs but all she does is put them in a room and make my dad and I do the work and pick up after her. 

    Then there's my dad, dont get me wrong he is a great guy he helps me alot, always believe in me, help me get that job I mentioned b4. I mean we argue sometimes but mostly we r good. The thing is he is racist and sexist. One time he picked me up from school even though I can walk home its like less than a mile walk. Then my friends were waving bye and most of them were black, so my dad says ""you really hang out with these n word (laughs) why there n words"". He talked on how he couldn't get my sister a job cuz she is a girl and will only be eye candy. Then just a few days ago I asked him on how he felt bout my brother who is admittedly bi and acts very feminine. All he talked bout is on how he probably wouldn't have gotten fired from Disney if he wasn't so gay PS. My brother got fired from Disney cuz interns replaced him and they had to many workers already. Then my dad talked on how he can't even talk to him he acts to feminine and that he knows he didn't learn how to act that way by him.

   And I have been trying to reveal the feminine self by wearing jewelry and acting on how I act when im alone an listening to my music which is kinda feminine, I did this so my parents could see something was wrong and they would ask. My mom never said anything and my dad sometimes said to stop playing that music and listen to real music and another time him saying to take off that necklace I look gay but that was in a joking way I think.
But I think I REALLY NEED A GENDER THERAPIST but how can I get one with my parents being like this. 

   I have told them something I wrong and I think I need a therapist but I think they forgot. My dad was very concerned 4 me and wanted to help. I didn't tell them what was happening or I wanted a gender therapist. So any advice or any thing at all I just need help."

I met this girl, let's call her C, at the office. She was a cute intern and i had a crush on her from the first time I saw her. We quickly became friends and realised we liked pretty much the same things.

As the months went by, we became really close and I got to be that friend that she tells everything to. I got to hear everything about her dates and hear the occasional ""oh, I wish I could find a guy just like you"" (which really means ""just like you but someone I am actually attracted to"").

We eventually hit an awkward phase when she became aware of the full extent of my feelings towards her. She would push me away but then always bring me back to give her emotional support. 

When things with her mother started getting tough, she decided to move away from home and when to live temporarily at my apartment. Eventually, the temporary became not so temporary and we became roommates. There was still the question of the whole awkwardness to be solved. I told her everything I felt and I also told her that I knew she loved me back but was confused because of her lack of sexual attraction towards me. I let her know that I loved her and would do anything for her, provide her with anything she needed except sex as it was clear she wasn't interested in that with me. She was hesitant with it but decided to try it out.

Since both my mother and her mother were pressuring us to find someone, we soon introduced each other to each other's families and became an official couple. Only two of my friends and one of her's know of our arrangement.

We've been together as a couple for just over one year now, sharing the same apartment. We decided to sleep in the same bed and use the other room as a shared office. When she brings someone over, I lock myself in the office and they think I am her roommate who sleeps on the room next door. This gives me the privilege of hearing everything she does with the guy in our room.

I can't say this is what I expected would happen when I found my SO. We love each other, we talk about everything and do pretty much everything together except sex.

***
***
Considering the fact that the murder victim had, in his last moments, been stripped of his clothing and painstakingly mummified in peanut butter from his hair to his toenails, there was a dangerously high risk of contaminating the body and it was quite clear that Detective Pulaski should not have been smoking over it.

Detective Pulaski smoked anyway, and frankly, no one dared correct him.

""How many has it been now?""

""Seventeen."" Frank, the medical examiner, stood and dusted the legs of his pants, smearing peanut butter and bodily fluids on his coveralls. 

""Call came at the same time?""

""Yep. Eight A.M. sharp. Body's off though.""

""What?""

""I've looked at the victim."" Detective Pulaski picked up the victim's wallet from the side table as Frank spoke. ""He died two days ago. That means Miss Queen has started killing faster.""

Ilya Purmanov. Male, blue eyes, height who-the-f *** -cares. Pulaski slammed the wallet down. ""Peanut butter. How did she kill him with *peanut butter*?""

""He was allergic, of course. He died of anaphylactic shock perhaps... thirty minutes?... thirty minutes after she started. So that was that."" Frank looked at his notes. ""But the, ah, covering probably took about two hours.""

""And the writing on the wall?""

""Yeah, that's all peanut butter too, but we don't know how long it took. It's pretty gross.""

""Gross. That's all you have to say.""

""Adrian, look-""

""No, hey, *I get it,*"" Pulaski hissed. ""*I* am the only one *losing sleep* over the fact that the Queen of Death has killed her *seventeenth victim* with yet another *common household object.*""

""What do you want from me?"" Frank flung his arms listlessly. ""I'm doing my job. You do yours.""

""Why yes! That's a wonderful idea! Hey, why don't I start with the crowd of reporters outside? I'm sure they'll have a much more appropriate reaction to the murder!""

""Wh... What is wrong with you? Are you insane?""

""***YES!***"" Pulaski screamed. ""I have been insane for the last four months! I would like to go *one week* without looking at another PATHETIC dead body, reported every Monday at eight A.M. sharp as though I'm being delivered *the weekly f*****ing paper*!""

The room was quiet, intensely so. The CSI team knew Detective Pulaski's breakdown was a long time coming, but it was quite another thing to see it in action. His eyes were bloodshot and his unshaven beard lay slapped across his face, as though he knew he was about to end his career and couldn't be bothered to look presentable on such a momentous occasion. It was some sick fascination that kept them watching, in much the same way the public outside waited to know who had been judged by the Queen.

""Give me your camera.""

""What?""

""Give it to me, Frank. Now.""

""N-no."" Frank stood still, too scared to move forward and too stubborn to step back. ""You don't have to do this.""

Pulaski considered this, briefly unclenching his fists at his waist. Then he turned and snapped his fingers at the intern, who immediately threw his camera into the detective's chest, cringing in fear.

""I hate all of you,"" Pulaski announced. His voice echoed within the vacuum of silence the house created. ""And I never want to see you again.""

Then he stomped out his cigarrette and walked out the door.
***

""Sir, can you answer a few-""

""Who was the victim?""

""How will the police respond to the growing threat-""

""Sir, how did the victim die?""

""You! There!"" Adrian heard just the question he wanted, spoken by a blonde female reporter from Channel 7 News. Among the half-dozen other channels and various YouTube cameraphone idiots, this woman had given him the perfect match to begin his final blaze of glory.

""Yes, you! What was that question you asked? Speak up now, really sell it to the cheap seats."" His voice leaked with sarcasm.

""Ah-heh."" The woman's smile faltered. ""I asked how the victim died? How did Miss Queen kill them?""

""Ah yes, that is the question of the hour, isn't it? Who else wants to know how he died? Raise your hands!"" 

No one raised their hands.

""You guys know you're supposed to wait for an official statement from the Sheriff's Office, right? Well, I guess I can't blame you for wanting to hear about *yet another grisly murder* perpetrated by a *deranged serial killer*.""

""Paul, turn off the cam-""

""*Don't turn off the f*****ing camera!* You wanted to know how he died, and I am going to f *** ing tell you!"" 

Adrian tore at the side of the camera, removing the roll of film and nearly shredding it to ribbons in the process.

""Now look what you made me do! I broke it! The film is exposed!"" Somewhere in the distance, a dog began barking at the racket being made. ""You should have seen it! It was absolutely *beautiful!*""

The crowd backed away almost in unison. Adrian stepped forward. ""You want to know how the Queen of Death killed her victim? She killed him *TENDERLY!* With *AFFECTION,* even! She spent *the better part of two hours* painting over Mr. Purmanov's body with name brand peanut butter, and brushstrokes finer than the *Sistine Chapel*, until the anaphylaxis took hold and he choked to death! ISN'T THAT AWESOME?""

By now, those with any degree of sanity remaining were attempting to remove themselves mentally from the situation, plugging their ears and remarking on the fact that the neighbor's dog *simply would not shut up* and neither would the detective, and if only they had called in sick or decided not to skip school they wouldn't be watching a man bring his career to an earth-shattering halt. The former detective saw all their misery, their distress at the realization that Adrian's soul had died along with Ilya Purmanov's body. And he decided that he wasn't quite finished.

""My name is Adrian Pulaski. I have worked with Crime Scene Investigation for nine years, the Queen has reigned for seventeen weeks, and I am officially handing in my *zero days' notice*. But don't let me stop you from treating MURDER like your weekly source of ENTERTAINMENT.""

Adrian lifted the police issue single-lens reflex above his head, and brought it down onto the pavement with a sickening crunch.

""If you have the guts to see how the victim died, ***go inside and look for yourself.***""

I'm currently a senior in high school with a 3.98 GPA with 3 credit hours of college classes (yay college algebra). In my area, a community college and vocational school are here (I live in the Oklahoma City area). I currently go to the vocational school as a senior, which waives my tuition. Anyways, after high school I think I'm guaranteed a full/part time job at a school district south of me (for the district computer center for that school district since my aunt works there and the fact that I was an intern last summer there.) One thing that worries me though is the thought of college. I don't know if I want to go, even though I have been accepted into a private school under a $28,000 scholarship (which I'd still end up with $60K in debt assuming I go for 4 years). The cost is honestly what's making me not want to go.. I don't want to be a failure; I just want to live comfortably, but my counselor at school is making it seem like I'll be one if I don't go to college.. I honestly don't care about making a six figure sum. I want something livable, as in I can have internet, a decent home, and no worries about starving or anything. And also the occasional leisure of maybe going out to a club to enjoy myself. I am probably worrying too much about this (I have bad anxiety), but it still bothers me (and I apologize in advance if this post is unorganized as hell). My parents (which one of them has a vocational degree in accounting and the other just has a high school degree) tell me not to worry because I have decent grades and that I need to take things one step at a time and that they won't allow me to fail. I have a great interest in technology and usually help my friends with their phones and computers when they have issues. At the vocational school I'm at, I'm taking computer programming and it's very stressful, which is making me consider taking accounting because my mom is an accountant. I just don't see why I feel like I'll be a failure if I don't go to college considering that both my parents didn't and we easily clear $100K a year in income. I'm a mess, honestly. If this is a shitpost, I apologize. I'm just looking for advice and some words of encouragement. It'd mean a lot. I just fear failure..."
41ra0z,10,2016-01-19,"Can Bernie Win the Working Class? Clinton's Anti-Labor Legacy, a Lack of Capital Investment in Production/Infrastructure, Big Banks, Economic History. Current Stock Market, Oil Prices, and our Building Movement",rtscott2001,SandersForPresident,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/41ra0z/can_bernie_win_the_working_class_clintons/,"A recent article by The Nation [""Can Bernie Sanders Win Back Iowa’s Working Class?""](http://www.thenation.com/article/can-bernie-sanders-win-back-iowas-working-class/), gets at the anti-labor legacy of the Clinton Administration, and the dissolution of the working class political support for the Democratic Party. The Clinton administration could be seen as a consolidation of the anti-working-class shift in Democratic Party domestic policy that increased the political convergence of the two leading parties of the ruling wealthy class.


A bit of history which set this up. In 74-75 and in 81-82, two recessions synchronously hit world capitalism and its centers of power in USA/Europe/Asia. This resulted in working people be kicked in the gut with mounting joblessness and also faced steeply rising prices (meat, &amp; gasoline “shortages""). Even using the deceptive statistics from the government, the unemployment rate nearly reached double digits in 82-83. This put downward pressure on the rate of profit of the ruling wealthy boss class.


In an effort to shore up their profit margins, during the 80's, and during the Clinton years, the ruling wealthy worked to counteract this trend by cutting real wages/benefits, speeding up production, lengthening the workweek, increasing part-time and temporary labor, and reducing government-funded social security programs.


Keep in mind that the **'post-Cold War surplus'** was NOT a 'peace time dividend' spent in the interests of working people. NOT WHATSOEVER. There was a concentrated campaign to **reduce federal expenditures on Social Security, education, veterans benefits, public transportation, scientific research**—every major category of government spending except health and Medicare (organized as a boon to insurance companies, HMOs, and medical businesses), agriculture (more fat subsidies for capitalist farmers and agribusiness), and “ justice” (billions for additional and more heavily armed cops, and for courts, prisons, surveillance modernization, and death chambers).


And the ruling class was successful in stoking a **capitalist cyclic upswing during the 90's.** BUT, while this business swing did last around 10 years, **what was it based on?** It was NOT based on a historic acceleration of capacity-expanding capital investment. It was not based on drawing more and more workers into plants, mines, and mills and massively increasing the production of salable goods. Nor was it about rebuilding badly needed infrastructure of bridges, rail, airports, schools, parks, health care centers, etc etc. Instead the long upturn in the United States was the product of piling up an enormous mountain of debt and a giant increase in speculative derivative ‘debt instruments.' This is what the Nation Article gets at so well. That Maytag plant is representative of much of a much broader attack on working people. 


This trajectory of their economic policy was codified in the 1990's, as policy matriculated by the Clinton Admininstration to pass the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. You have heard of this mentioned in Bernie's Campaign. This was the act which allowed 'investment banks' (for speculative, stock brokerages, insurance, and futures markets in the amount of trillions of dollars) become merged with 'commercial banks' for savings, home buyers, mortgages, pensions, loans.


A key aspect of this can be accredited to **Robert Rubin, who as the Treasury Secretary of Clinton**, along with Lawrence Summers, and the Admin --- oversaw the dissolution of the Glass-Steagall Act. This action allowed the birth of Citigroup, the largest commercial bank. Citigroup was the merging of Travelers Insurance company, and the Salomon Smith Barney investment house. Here is the good stuff and why I mention them in particular. Rubin then literally left his Clinton Admin position to take a seat on **Citigroup board for 40million$.** Perhaps the 'greatest' gangster act of all time, right? Pass an act to deregulate banking laws, then take seat at the top of a bank to reap rewards. By the way Rubin was on stage recently showing his moral based compass and contempt for all working people, along with one of his former Goldman Sachs colleagues Henry Paulsen, and Tim Geithner. **They publicly laugh about wealth income inequality**, that's how much they underestimate us: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/geithner-rubin-paulson-income-inequality_55e9eabde4b093be51bb73c3


Anyhow, regarding the need for stable markets and trade. We should be clear: a stable monetary system with worth is necessary---- the merging of these instituions literally mixed up empty bundles of speculative value (investment bank) with a functioning currency for tender/savings (commercial). Empty 'futures' 'speculations' with your pension, mortgage.


This is precisely what Glass-Steagall was designed to prevent back in the 1930's. The passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 ended it. This then opened the floodgates to a massive expansion of these rampant so-called derivatives, “securitized” debts, “off-balance-sheet” banking operations. It has grown to such heights of devalued speculation and bundling, rebundling, and trading, that they themselves can't precisely ascertain a specific dollar sign on their holdings. Furthermore, before the 2008 crash, 60 percent of derivatives were held by only five financial institutions, with J.P. Morgan Chase holding the largest share—some $25 trillion—followed by Bank of America and Citigroup.


In 1999, Clinton’s new treasury secretary Lawrence Summers hailed the 1999 Act as “the foundation for a 21st century financial system."" Indeed! 2008 was a good testament to their work! For example Citigroup alone in 2008 reported being 40 Billion 'short'! And these 'losses' &amp; 'write-offs' over the previous fifteen months were a result of derivatives and other 'debt instruments' having gone sour. Billions of dollars of holdings had ZERO monetarily associated value.
This history was what was missing in the recent film ""The Big Short."" The Democratic Party approved policy which enabled the system to have a stranglehold.


The term ""Too big to fail?"" Also a reference to how banks and other lenders slice up mortgages they’ve issued, package them according to risk, and then sell them to big, government-backed financial institutions such as:

-Federal National Mortgage Association—Fannie Mae

-Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation—Freddie Mac


Putting both data together, their share of residential mortgage debt in the United States was 7 percent in 1980, which then jumped to nearly 50 percent at the opening of the 2007 housing crisis --- together they issued some 75 percent of so-called mortgaged-backed securities. In 2005, they held some $3 trillion in mortgages. Clinton mandated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to step up their trafficking in what are today called “subprime” loans, targeting working people (Greenspan argued this point on the Admin's behalf too, go read his book) - and beyond that, these machinations of financial wizardry preferentially devastated families who are of color.


In 2003 it was revealed that Fannie Mae had covered up $7 billion in derivatives losses in 2003 and $12.1 billion in 2002. That same year Freddie Mac was exposed as having used derivatives between 2000 and 2002 to cook its books. No one in their management went to jail. By September 2004 the federal agency charged with “overseeing” Fannie Mae had little choice but to issue a report confirming growing evidence that management was manipulating financial records to make its earnings look good, make its derivative holdings look less risky, and—naturally—justify massive executive bonuses.
In the broader economic context: the elite oligarchic class have also held back expenditures for the expansion of productive capacity and large-scale employment of labor, while massively expanding credit markets. They’ve lured many working people to manacle ourselves and our families with “low-down-payment” (or even “no-down-payment”) loans, “adjustable rate” financing, and other forms of high-risk debt servitude. Also in this equation for economic profiteering machinations are student loans, auto loans, home 'equity' loans. Mix this with: the drive for profit-through-home-ownership, the commercial-investment banking merging of Clinton-driven 1999 Act, along with the steep attack on wages at union-scale with benefits --- and its a recipe for major disaster.


Big Banks have a uniquely critical effect on the economy: When Microsoft stock goes down, some people in Washington State are sad. When Apple stock goes down, a different set of people in California are sad. When IBM stock goes down, some people in New York are sad. When Enron went under, a lot of people in Texas were sad. And Ole Miss weeped for WorldCom. When J.P. Morgan (used to be Chase too, aka MASSIVE bank) stock heads south, it will be the leading families of U.S. finance capital who shudder, and the entire monetary holdings of the world financial system decimated - again.


Also worth mentioning regarding the Clinton Administration:
- Reworking of the consumer price index (screwing millions of working people)

- Erasing millions of jobless workers off their official numbers utilizing the magical statistical wand and wording

- Actively worked to keep world gold prices low, through the gold carry trade, and through the IMF and Euros to sell their bullion reserves which lead to the 1999 20-year low of $253 (check out Gordon Brown, then-U.K. Treasury minister's actions). This devastated semicolonial countries such as Peru, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Papua New Guinea, Chile, Ghana, Mali, and Tanzania, as well as South Africa, whose revenues from mining and exporting gold and other precious metals plummeted.

**CURRENT** Stocks, Markets, Oil Prices, Grinding Conditions, and a building Working Class Movement
--- 
Journalists, 'pundits' --- they all just don't get our developing movement. They have no pulse on the life condition of working families within the U.S. Those dramatically inaccurate skewed Labor Department statistics on 'unemployment' have led them to these misinformed conclusions. **5% unemployment? The labor force participation rate remains at a nearly 40-year low.** Real wages for production workers remain at their 1970 level, and production per worker has more than doubled, with more goods being created by fewer workers. **Many more jobs are now contract, temporary, 'internships', adjunct, etc etc etc.** Of course, “discouraged” and underemployed workers from the workforce don't account for the Labor Departments equations too. So when Obama proclaims during his SOTU that ""Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction,"" I respectfully disagree.


Industrial production is contracting with shrinking demand, evaporating profit margins and overproduction worldwide in most products of basic industry, with a building downturn in worldwide trade. Capital has NOT been invested by the ruling wealthy into productive capacity, plants, mills, infrastructure, schools, bridges, airports, etc etc.... They have been ploughing their money into stocks, bonds and other paper in search of higher returns, boosting stock prices on the market to levels today that have no relation to the real economy.


We are in the middle of ANOTHER speculative bubble. Check out this article entitled, **""The Next Big Short: The Third Crest of a Rolling Tsunami""** http://www.hussmanfunds.com/wmc/wmc160104.htm


I mention all this, because the pundits have no sense for the palpable movement growing around working class, poor farmers, toiler, communities of color demands for raising minimum wage, pubic works program for jobs/infrastructure, prosecuting killer cops, calling for an end to systemic institutionalized racism. This is the working class anger and frustration at deplorable life conditions - health care, wages, education, police brutality, housing, Wall Street. These pundits and journalists don't search out picket lines, protests, public meetings, organizing events, search out working class neighborhoods. Insulated sections of the ruling class and their media machine, lawyers, businessmen, investors, are NOT representative, nor give an informed picture of the state of the grinding depression the working class, poor farmers, and communities of color are facing within the U.S.


Noticed the recent stock market and oil prices/market?


http://www.wsj.com/video/oil-plunge-could-sink-us-energy-companies-into-bankruptcy/2B104376-F6A1-4A65-AE25-B39674B7DC41.html


A quarter of a million oil workers have lost their jobs worldwide as overproduction has pushed prices through the floor. **Anyone in Houston, Gulf, North Dakota, USW Oil and Chemical Workers, etc., I would enjoy hearing your opinion and take on the oil industry.** A third of all U.S. oil producers could end up in bankruptcy. Remember last year when media gushed over N.D. easy money shale oil production?


Cuts in oil and coal production and the manufacturing depression mean rail bosses are slashing jobs and cutting routes too. Union Pacific has put more than 2,700 rail workers on furlough, saying transport of agricultural and industrial products, chemicals, and coal has tumbled. This also translates into entire community economies of stores, restaurants, income tax revenue, schools, etc - working people face an even deeper grinding depression.


Industrial production is contracting with shrinking demand, evaporating profit margins and overproduction worldwide in most products of basic industry, with a building downturn in worldwide trade. Capital has NOT been invested by the ruling wealthy into productive capacity, plants, mills, infrastructure, schools, bridges, airports, etc etc.... They have been ploughing their money into stocks, bonds and other paper in search of higher returns, boosting stock prices on the market to levels today that have no relation to the real economy.

The working class, poor farmers and all underrepresented oppressed communities are going to catch hell. The main tool we have is build a movement to stand up to the ruling billionaires and their hangers-on, cross pollinate between social struggles, engage in the current political process. We must stay in the streets, not be afraid to stand together on the job. Fight for 15$, demand jailing of killer cops, an end to institutional racism, defend abortion rights, fight for equal pay, paid maternity leave. These types of things were what social democratic movement won in outer countries when they struggled. It wasn't simply a matter of elections. It was the programmatic demands of active movements. "

I wanted to share my story, because maybe it could help me, maybe it could help someone else too. 

I've been addicted to porn and masturbation for a decade. A way to run away from the problems facing me back then, in a broken home, not in a bad world but worse, indifferent. A sweet moment of ignorant bliss was an experience I required daily to get through the worst. But the habit stuck even after the hardships. It took a malignant course guided by internet porn.

Now it has really started to erode me in many ways. My sexual drive, my relationships, now even my studies. 

I cannot get my head around this - I am a succesful human being. Why cannot I complete this one task I want of myself, being NoFap, doing the reboot. I've tried for over a year now, relapsing time after time. Best record is now two weeks. 

In other parts of my life, I succeed, I have self discipline. I study in a competitive field, having good grades, already doing research in my field, publishing scientific papers. I have recommendations from prestigious employers from my internships. I have a beautiful girlfriend who probably has no idea of my problems and the abyss of my demise when I am my worst and relapse for days. My friends and my family look up to me, and it is that much worse to know what a failure I have been and their complete ignorance of these failings.

Today, after few days of porn and masturbation binge, all my studies and research set aside to make time for my addiction, I felt the gripping emptiness in my soul. And again I have to decide that this has to change. 

It is sobering, that moment when you climax and you look at the meat on your screen, moving, hear the voices that just few seconds ago were sweet sounds and now they are but painful noise. Then comes the same routine with shame. Cleaning up after the binge, washing your hands, looking yourself in the bathroom mirror, again, disappointed. Red eyes from staying awake, unshaven.

I need to put some distance to porn and masturbation.

I am here to declare that today I lost, but I am ready to fight again. I will deconstruct this habit, I will destroy it. 

Your stories have been a big help, and provide constant inspiration. Thank you. "

Back in April '15, when my Inventory was around 15k(eys) in total, I had some quickbuy posts going on lounge. Six trades, bumped by hand, without SIH telling me that I got an offer was a miserable experience, but it made every key I made feel even more precious.

Then - someday - a guy wrote on my comments, that I should add him. He seemed cool, had some nice stuff in his inventory and I felt the excitment of possibly making a nice deal. He sold me his M4 Asii Ft for .. uh.. 12 or 13k I think and told me to hit him up whenever I have more keys. 

Well as it turned out, he was one of the cofounders of a gambling site (not the real big ones, but still big enough to still be in buisness as of today) and he was **the man** for me. After two and some months, I finally reached 80 keys, feeling like a boss...

The dude eventually left his country for some internships and the partnership dried up, but hey. It just got better from then on. Dopplers, Lores, Rub/Sapphs, etc. And I still like to think that its just because of this one fortunate bump which I (manually) did back then in April...

----

Enough, lets get down to business. (**tl;dr**)

I guess that there are atleast two of you out there that know that I started my own trade bot two months ago due to me starting to work in se IT and suddenly not having enough time to trade the real way anymore. A couple more of you which actually talked to me may know, that I always liked to help starters with advice, but I always felt that I wanna do some more..

Thats where the story from above and *you* come into play. I'm looking for two starters out there from this lovely sub that helped me so much, who would like to follow my steps. And I'd like to raffle these spots. 

I'm currently preparing an account. All the items on that account will be buyable for 85% Avg. Price in keys and the account will be constantly refilled (well.. there may be one day every now and then where I wont find the time to refill). I am planning to put around 15-20k in Items on it in every batch, give or take.

Your profile:

- 1k = 1key = 2.49$ 

- Minimum Inventory Value: 6 keys (minimum since 6 * 0.85 = 5.1)

- Maximum Inventory Value: 20 keys 

- Able to communicate in english (or german. Although I am really bad at ""talking trading"" in my native by now :P)

- Steamrep as clean as Kim Jungs Balls

- No smurf account

----

I am starting with two for now, depending on how its going (selling :P) I may adjust that number and raffle some more spots away. On top of that I will throw you out when you reach 50k or more (well I wont throw you out, but yaknow. Give others a chance =) )

---

How to enter: (**tl;dr the tl;dr**)

Pick a number between 1 and 1337 (dang) and please format it exactly like this: --0001-- or --0251-- or --1337-- or --xxxx--. Makes it easier to search. If multiple people pick a winning number, the earlier pick wins. 

If you got any questions... uhh... put a --Q-- tag in there, makes it easier aswell I guess :) 

The raffle will end somewhere around tomorrow evening (~~~8pm gmt+1). Ill be heading to bed soon and got work tomorrow.

Thanks for the read and good luck peeps

If you plan on replying to either of them, please read the following expectations:

* Effort - seriously, if you don't plan on putting effort into your message, please don't bother messaging me!
* Detail - if your message is under a paragraph long, I probably won't even bother to read the whole thing, as all of the criteria I've mentioned should stretch longer than a paragraph.
* Proper grammar, capitalization... LITERACY! - please proof read your message! It is such a pet peeve to be reading a good response but noticing so many mistakes! I know that no one is perfect, but if I see consistent errors, it's really discouraging!
* Character description - this one should be pretty easy for you guys. Just give me a character description, including physical attributes and some background information. You can even include a picture from Google as a visual aid, I'm perfectly fine with that.
* Kinks and limits - again, this should be pretty easy. Tell me what you like and don't like and I'll be sure to let you know the same so we can come up with some boundaries.

**#1: The Intern**
I had just finished my second year of university, and it was now time to find a job for the summer. In this day and age, that was not easy. You had overqualified people working in minimum wage jobs, and underqualified people not working at all. So... where did a soon to be second year business major fit in that picture? Absolutely no where. I searched everywhere for a job, even going so far as to check Craigslist, which let me tell you, I will never do again. I basically did nothing for two months while I waited to hear back from several prospective employers, but I had heard nothing. 

The whole reason I was taking business was so that I could one day open up my own. I wasn't sure what it was going to be yet. A restaurant, a boutique, a salon. It could be any of those, but I still had at least three more years before I had to put my education to the test. The aspiration had come from my mother and father, who owned a restaurant together. It was a thriving Greek restaurant. My father was the brain, and my mother was the brawn... the brawn being the cook, in this case. They had taken some family recipes and built on it, and now they were preparing to open their second location. You'd think with success like that they'd be willing to give their own daughter a job, but no. They wanted me to earn things in life, not take hand outs. This was ironic, considering they were paying for my education and the fact that they spoiled me to death. But they still wouldn't give me a job. Did they think I was incompetent?

Anyways, me trying to earn a job didn't last very long. About a month into my summer vacation, my father introduced me to a friend of his who ran an accounting firm. He told me about a summer intern position that didn't pay very much. I wouldn't be doing real accounting work, either. More like just getting coffee, photocopying, and the likes. But my father preached about how it would be a great experience. Accounting and business were two different things, so this would exactly be a meaningful experience, but it would be better than sitting around all day. Plus, he told me that I would get my own cubicle, which meant that I had a place to go and hide and slack off.

So, I applied and I was basically given the job. So much for not taking hand outs. Twenty years old, now an intern at Zickler Chartered Accountants, a position that was handed to me. Despite the hand out, I was going to take the position seriously. I was going to kick ass at doing coffee runs and making copies. I was going to be the best damn intern that this accounting firm had ever seen. My mom even went out and bought me a bunch of outfits for me to look more professional... another handout. I didn't complain, though, I thought I looked cute in most of them. 

The whole 'taking the job seriously' phase lasted for about a week. I soon realized that I could literally sit in my cubicle all day and do absolutely nothing, and no one would care. This was going to be a long summer if I was just sitting around for hours on end. A lot of the guys here are nice, at least.
***
This was basically just a back story of how my character ends up working at the accounting firm you work at. You can pick who you are, however, there are a few attributes I would like your character to have.

* I do not want him to be my boss. I don't want a power exchange, unless you want me being slightly dominant. If not, I'm fine with that.
* I'd like your character to be 30 or older (my character will be 20).
* I'd like your character to have worked at the firm for some time now.

How I see this going is your character taking a particular liking to me, being flirty and what not. Depending on how old you choose to be, it may seem more and more unlikely that our characters will someone end up having sex. But eventually, they will, and you know you'll have to keep it quiet or you'll lose your job for having sex with the intern that is at least ten years younger than you, which is where I would have the upper hand (if you're into femdom).

**#2: The Office Affair**
Supreme Marketing Solutions was a small marketing firm, based out of two floors of a tall office building in the wonderful city that is New York. It was not exactly as diverse or dynamic as other marketing firms, but it was not the *worst* place in the world to work. Aside from the stuffy atmosphere with everyone crammed into cubicles, the people were nice, the bosses were relaxed, and the work was relatively easy. Best of all, it paid well, and living in New York didn't exactly come cheap. 

Most of the employees at Supreme Marketing Solutions were young, a majority being in their early to mid twenties. Besides Rhonda, the secretary who mostly kept to herself, the office population was mostly comprised of college graduates and young office executives. The younger crowd meant a more relaxed work day, but it also meant wild weeknights and weekends. The people that you spent your days with were usually the same ones you spent your nights with, and it was not uncommon for co-workers to end up going out and getting smashed together. It also wasn't uncommon for co-workers to end up sleeping together, which made for some awkward workdays. 

Despite many of the employees being young and reckless, some had married right out of college. That didn't stop them from getting drunk and enjoying life. It simple meant that they couldn't go around fucking their co-workers, no matter how young and attractive they were. No matter how tempting it could be sometimes, you had to remember that there was someone waiting for you at home.

I was one of those people. Here's a little bit of information about me, Kayla, a junior executive at Supreme Marketing Solutions. Life before my job at the marketing firm was great, not that I'm saying it isn't now. I went to a lower level college, as I wasn't very interested in school. I took economics and just barely got through my degree. I wasn't stupid, but I wasn't motivated. I spent most of my time partying. I was probably drunk more of the time than I was sober. If I wasn't out at a frat party with my girlfriends or out bar hopping, I was probably sleeping, waiting to do it all over again. One thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I was kind've a slut... I loved getting fucked, I couldn't help it. Being drunk most of the time didn't help with my decision making either. Boys just came naturally to me... and  on me... and in me. It's not like it was an every day thing. Maybe a few times a week? It was college, though, so I can use that as my excuse. In my fourth year, I was placed on academic probation. That was when I realized that I needed to get my shit together. I literally quit drinking, I started doing my work, and to my surprise, I scraped by and got my degree in business. But then, I had to find a job. Who the hell was going to hire me with my grades? I searched and searched, looking at job postings all across the country, hoping I could find something. Long story short, I somehow managed to land an internship at Supreme Marketing, and I worked my ass off. I spent my first few months doing everything I could to secure a permanent position. That was three years ago. Now I'm a junior executive, and I *still* work my ass off, but I've regressed to my old ways a bit. I do my work, but I still go get smashed a few times a week. I haven't regressed to my old sexual ways, though. It's hard to do that when I have my husband, Trevor, who's a police officer with the NYPD. Not that I want to do it, but I kind've miss be able to go out and get whoever's dick I wanted. Trevor works nights a lot, too, so I don't always get his dick. I'm still young, I still need dick! Who knows, maybe Trevor will start working days and we'll be able to spend more time together, or maybe something else will happen...
***
I am not the greatest writer, I'm aware of this, but this is the most effort I've ever put into a prompt in hopes that it'll attract some great writers and willing, detailed roleplayers. My plans for this roleplay are to have a lot of build up. You can choose who you want to be. A co-worker who I've known for a while, a new employee, the IT guy... I really don't care, you can pick. And if you haven't realized, I'm looking for an office affair that will eventually turn into more. Again, I want lots of build up. In the first few encounters, there will be no sex. There will be flirtation, sure, and perhaps a realized attraction, but no sex or anything sex related for a little while. Unless you think you can seduce me right away... but you'll have to do that in-character. Anyways, yeah, realistic tension build-up, leading to a steamy office affair.

I am planning to apply for MD/PhD program for 2016-2017 cycle and I really need some outer perspective about my stats right now.

--
To give you brief history and stats:

I applied to MD programs in 2014-2015 cycle but did not get accepted to any program.
So instead I am doing Masters Program (MA in Biotech), in which I am doing really great, getting near 4.0 GPA. I will be graduating this October. 

Undergrad major: engineering (BS in Engineering)

Undergrad cGPA: 3.67

Undergrad sGPA: 3.87

I am also working as a lab technician / research associate at my undergraduate school since May 2015, doing my own research and mentoring 3 undergraduate and 2 high school students doing their own research in biomedical science.

As for my research, it is on genetic engineering and Ive been doing it for over a year now. Hopefully, if everything works as my plan, I will get publication later this year.

My previous research experiences include:

- biophysical modeling of RNA folding using statistical mechanics (this was my senior thesis) (a year)
- simulation of EM field in brain tissue using finite element methods (6 month)
- designing bone scaffolding using direct 3d printing methods (about two years)

As for my volunteering/clinical experiences:

- worked as intern at tuberculosis research facility abroad (2012), during which I volunteered at public clinic and shadowed a physician. I also worked on public health policy initiative project.
- volunteered at hospital for elderly for six month (2011)
- tutored high school students as part of free-education organization that I participated (for two years)

Finally, my other experiences include:

- worked as vp and treasurer for a organization (about 50-60 members) during undergrad (2 years)
- senior council member as a representative of my major (six month)

Oh and forgot to mention, my MCAT score is 35 (96 percentile).

What do you guys think I should do in the next 4 months to increase my chances?

Thank you in advance!

41sp1l,2,2016-01-19,"I [22 M] have become attracted to my friend [22 F], and she does not share my feelings",Svdharma,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41sp1l/i_22_m_have_become_attracted_to_my_friend_22_f/,"I have a friend who I have known for about 6 months who I have become attracted to. We work together, we where both hired at the same time, and we went through a grueling internship together to get the job with a class of about 60 other people, maybe 40 of whom where hired. We relied on each other heavily throughout that process both for emotional support and to get the job done, so we have built up a huge degree of trust and comfort with each other. I am particularly close with her because I got her interested in rock climbing near the beginning of our internship and we have climbed regularly every since. We are part of a group of about 5 or 6 climbers who went through the same class and we all climb together almost every weekend. 

When I met this woman, we where both in relationships, so although I may have vaguely considered her attractive, I filed her more into the ""bro"" or ""sister"" category in my mind. Recently, I broke up with my girlfriend, and became very attracted to my friend. She is smart, shares my sense of humor, lives and works nearby, shares my hobbies, and has an attractive body, etc. I knew she was in a long distance relationship, so I asked her how it was going with the clear intention of asking her out if she told me that it was over/nearly over. I have seen a lot of long term relationships in college etc. and unless the couple is very committed and have a long history I know they tend to fall apart relatively quickly. She told me that they where still doing well, so I told her I would not give it any more thought, which I really didn't, until a few days later when she told me they had broken up.

She told me that my asking how the relationship was going had gotten her thinking about it and she started to see flaws, which she pointed out to her boyfriend. From what I gather, it turns out that he had already realized the relationship was not going to work out and had written it off without telling her. When I heard this I was obviously sad for her, but at the same time I was excited that now I might have a chance. A few days later I asked her out and her response was ""I Can't"" without elaboration. It was an awkward situation and I left it at that, although we probably should have talked it out a little further. 

The problem I am having is that I really like her as a friend, but I don't think a relationship where I am so heavily attracted to her is healthy if she does not have the same feelings for me. If I cannot curb my enthusiasm, so to speak, I definitely don't want to continue hanging out with her.  Knowing myself, I am not going to lose this attraction any time soon, especially not when I don't see a reason why the relationship could not work. When I imagine a relationship with someone, I obviously imagine us both being happy in that relationship and I think that if I understood why that would not be possible I could get over being attracted to her. For example, I am sure that if I found out she was a lesbian this whole problem would disappear (she isn't, and also she would have to be like 100% not attracted to guys or else I would continue to think I have a chance) 

I want to talk to her about this, but it is a super delicate situation and I am not sure if it is a good idea. I known that I have no right to demand justification for her not wanting to be in a relationship with me, but that is essentially what I want to do. Also, we work in an industry that is at least 90% men, so I know she is constantly fending off dudes that are trying to demand justification for why she is not interested in them, which will make it a lot harder for me to start a conversation without triggering her ""weirdo"" defenses.  Also, we often see each other at work, and we share a lot of friends and often see each other on the weekends. To make things even less clear, this whole idea of me being able to suppress my own attraction if I know why the relationship can't work is definitely influenced by the notion that maybe in the course of the conversation she will reconsider whatever her reasoning is. I am not sure that even if I did find out it was 100% impossible for us to be together that that would stop me from wishing we could be. Also, most reasons for not wanting to be with someone are not absolute. Chances are that I will get an answer that does not completely shut out a relationship as a possibility, in which case the whole conversation would be pointless.

My questions are, how have other people out there dealt with attraction to existing friends who don't share that attraction? Do you think it is a good idea for me to try to talk this out, or should I just distance myself as much as possible without making things weird? If I were to try to talk this out with her, do you have any ideas about how I could approach the conversation? 
   
**tl;dr**: 

Have developed an comfortably strong attraction for a female friend who does not seem to be interested. Want to save friendship, but unsure about how to go about doing so. Delicate situation due to working together. How do I approach a conversation about this? Is talking about it worth risking extreme awkwardness at work?


edit:

Wow that came out long, maybe I will try to pair it down tommorow."
41sv14,8,2016-01-20,365 days,DvO20,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/41sv14/365_days/,"I wasn't anticipating it, but just typing 365 days, my eyes suddenly got heavy and I had to wipe away a couple soft tears. Not to be ultra dramatic, but this post is bringing on a lot of mixed emotions. I just can't believe it's been one whole year, and right around this time of the night I sent what ended up being the last text I sent to her. A text that never got responded too.

I had been dealing with the fact that she was with someone even longer than a year. I kept in contact, she threw me bread crumbs, some seemed like they had real substance and that she wasn't completely over me. Most of them though just ended up seeming like she was keeping me around to because her b/f was slacking and used me to make him step it up.

I still hate how it ended. I was angry at her. We had been out of contact for a few months, and randomly one night I got a snapchat request from her, and my hopes went through the roof. I was punched in the stomach seconds later, recognizing her new username. A name that was a twist on her bf's. In her defense, she probably never would have thought I'd recognize the similarity. But I did, and that's what sent me off. I told her how special she had been to me, but I was done with being kicked in the f***** stomach. I regret the language. I regret that this was the moment set me off, when I had much more dignified reasons in the past. But still, she never responded. I don't know if that was her showing her true colors, or her running from confrontation, or tired of the fact that I wasn't over her, or a combination of all those.

I was in a dark place before then, and those few months after I still was. She was the best thing I had. And I still miss her. But I am proud to see and say just how far I've come.

I have gotten over her for the most part. I got into incredible shape, did very well on tinder, had a few dates and a few hookups.  And getting into EDM, with all the positivity embedded in it, even in the sad songs, has really helped me along the way.

Still though, there are things missing in my life. I just turned 27. I was hired for a real big boy job in the spring, but had to leave it to come home to help with some family issues. So I still don't have a real job, and honestly besides a couple good internships from years ago, I don't have a lot on my resume. I don't know where I want to be, and I don't know what I want to do. I'm also extremely alone. The good friends that I have are all spread out across the country, and the one social outlet I have is when I goto the gym. Just to be around people. And I believe that she will continue to be what I fall back to thinking about, when thinking about those others things that I don't have.

I miss her. I really do. I still believe she is a great girl, but she had some growing up to do as far as handling relationships goes, it was just unfortunate I came along at the wrong time for her. But I'm doing a lot better, and I'm determined to keep bettering myself.

41t8eh,5,2016-01-20,What really truly draws you to CARE?,AwsumSaus,pridestrong,https://www.reddit.com/r/pridestrong/comments/41t8eh/what_really_truly_draws_you_to_care/,"It's something that has been on my mind the past few weeks since I visited. I had a total fangirl experience, and not once did I even think ""oh neat, there's a big cat over there"". No, it was ""omg it's Serena! holy shit there's Mwali and Noel!!"" I was waiting in line to use the bathroom before the tour started and about pee'd myself when I spotted the beebees.

I worry sometimes though that I love that place a little too much, and I gush. I'm sure I slightly creeped Heidi out because I couldn't contain my emotions lol. My friends and family just don't understand haha. I am a broke nursing student living on the other side of the country, but I happily put $250 on the credit card for a teegee painting during the fundraiser. I happily put I don't know how much on my credit card to fly down there (more to visit friends but still), and bought way too much memorabilia. Now as I sit here eating Ramen, I wouldn't have changed a thing.

But in the end I guess Derek is hilarious. Heidi is my hero. CARE Jamie has a rockin' playlist. All of the volunteers and interns that keep that place running have my utmost respect. The cats are belly-up happy, the place is clean/nice/spotless, and they have some of the most positive atmospheres on their social media accounts. I hardly see any trolls on YouTube (compared to other videos at least) and I'm really loving this subreddit so far. As Derek said in the last WATC, they have a Pride and I'm only too happy to be a part of it.

I also have a bit of anxiety and some depression, and I believe CARE is just one of those experiences that truly gives me a few moments of true happiness. Every WATC, every Vine, every Instagram pic...they all just make me grin from ear to ear.

So....what keeps you hooked?"

This is going to sound cliche' but my girlfriend of a year just broke up with me on our anniversary of our first date. To give background because this one needs background for it's unusual. We met at tomorrowland summer 2014 in Belgium I used to do an internship in Germany and she was traveling Europe at the time, probably the craziest thing I've been apart of in my young 22 years (she's 19). We hooked up and hung out alot of the festival. I didn't really hang out with my friends much because I met this really cool girl. Months go by it's 2015 I'm back in school in America at a community college to get proper credits to go to a University I like and I find out that she's going to school pretty close (2 hours away by car) to where I live. I messaged her over the internet started finding out she was more than just a girl at a festival and had 95% of the same interests as me and whatever we disagreed on wasn't huge. The connection through text was so large we wanted to meet up in person. So I started doing these weekend drives to see her. Surprising her with various things like candle light sushi on the ground (guys take notes), dancing classes that were free (thanks bank of america), museum tours (thanks bank of america again) etc nothing to crazy costly yet showed i was different and interested. I also spent a lot of time getting her english better so we could communicate better and we both could proudly be successfully bilingual. She loved it and would return the favors herself by taking me to various local hangouts, doing jiu jitsu (she's Brazilian) workout classes, finding out community events, taking me on running paths, buying me dinners as well. I also managed to meet her mother who visited from Brazil, her mother took us out to eat for free (i paid 1) to any restaurants I wanted to try in NYC and I showed them a tour of NYC that most tourists would love. 

Summer came she got done with her classes (she did art courses at an ivy league school but wasn't an enrolled student due to not having a full visa yet), I got out of community college and got into good schools but decided I didn't want the south or the city so I choose University of Somewhere more west than I had ever thought. She was really happy for me. I was happy for me. We decided so that she wouldn't have to go back to Brazil so early due to her visa still being valid she'd live with me and my mom for half the summer. That went amazingly too I'll spare you the details but it was both of us a very fun summer, we fell in love with each other in that time. We had a little fight on the way to the airport before she left mostly because I didn't want her to leave but made up over video chat the next day. 

Thus began our long distance relationship. I've had a couple of them living in Europe for some time so to me it was/is nothing as long as I knew the other person really liked me and it seemed like she did AND COMMUNICATION IS THERE (pro tip). We'd videochat every night, then every night turned into 3/7 weeks cause I was getting situated with a new school, she was preparing to do her Tofel and SAT so she could do 4 years at an ivy league school. That's fine. Time went by and I realized I wasn't making friends as I learned being a transfer student with a really different life than everyone, along with being too old to be in a frat, too old to do what I normally do with my home and Europe friends with kids in my mostly freshman classes (big fan of bar scene),and too far away from campus to connect to anyone besides my roommates whom already have established life here I became depressed (got diagnosed last week) and lonely. My grades failed, I didn't give a damn about school. I'd show up do my homework but not go past that amount of effort. To help myself I kept up with my gym activity by going 5 times a week, I joined a club relative to my degree, and play basketball at times. No friends still. 23 weeks nothing (somehow kept my sobriety) However I'd still try with her. 

This past christmas I got my grades and they were bs so and cs from 16 credits. I told my girlfriend and she freaked on me. She got very emotional and passionate said I need to get my act together. I like I am now, not totally into anything whole heartedly saying yes I'll change. (first time i've lied to her in 11 months)

To break down her. She is...different...the good different. She's well cultured, really well spoken for her age, wishes it was 1950 some times because all this shit around us is too much of a distraction to become great, she'll paint and read russian authors for hours while appreciating Kanye west with mozart and knife party blended in the mix. She is very religious and sees her self at her max capacity as the next dali with intense discipline, dedication, hard work, and patience. (she is very talented for her age) She is more mature than anyone i've worked with and will be this serious philosophical brilliant child one minute and the next she'll be sending me a dumb gif of a cat falling off a roof. A lot of this comes from her working with a high profile jiu jitsu teacher in sao paulo that has imprinted in her head to be disciplined at all cost. I love it. Even asked to do that class with her. I express it to her all the time. To find negative in her is hard, the only thing I feel is she needs time to enjoy her youth a bit and slow it down. Take an off day. Her response is always, that's such a 15 year old thing. (i'm not totally used to it but I still love It)

We had a videochat last night and I told her it's getting worse every day and I don't feel like I want to be apart of the club I'm in anymore. She told me, that's she's been feeling unsatisfied for 3 weeks now. I said is cause we can't be in person for another 3 months and she said no..although she does from time acknowledge she gets cold to lovers without physical contact (she loves sex, i do too). She said since I've came to my new school I've shown I'm not as serious as she thought I was and she once saw me as a really good guy who treated her that way she liked (but feels she doesn't totally 100% deserve..that was new). She wanted a long future with me, like I did with her. She said my ambitions aren't good enough for hers right now to take over and be a strong leader. She doesn't know what a power couple is because of her english but at 19 she wants a power couple so she herself can be extremely successful and fulfilled in life. 

I knew she wanted that but to the extent of today I received one of those it's not going the way I thought it would texts she'd break up with me. We videochated for 3 hours before she could say it and I had to have her say it but when she did she wasn't sure. 12 hours have past and she's more sure than before. I've blocked her on Facebook and told her I just started the semester and need good grades for my future. I've also signed up for weekly therapy sessions for the next month. When that month is over I'll unblock her from all social media. I would like to enjoy her but she said a lot that at this moment in my life I can't fufill. Her passion for art is something I don't have for anything at the moment. My friends that know our relationship are confused and can't help me out and the walk in therapist today said wow with understanding words with no meaning. My loneliness is now worse due to her being my primary interaction and I've lost all the confidence I had since we first met. 

We said I love you in the summer after she left and agreed to a serious relationship. Never once on either side hinting what was above. We still love each other as of today but with her tmrw is a new day and I can just be the past in a second. She does think she has a more analytical love and I have more of the openly proud disney love (don't know how to put it) but that's just how my parents raised me idk if I can change that. She had trouble at times showing her eyes to me when we videochated the last two days which isn't normal. Idk what to do. She says go find a girl that's more not like her but I don't date those girls. 
Side note she visited me in October and said I love you every time she got for my birthday all the way from brazil and i was never more certain of our love. My mom came out that weekend to and surprised me with tickets to visit her on my spring break. I have the tickets and want to go to sao paulo and rio still but from what she has told me it's a better/safer city when you know your way around. 

Sex life 8/10...one time one of us queefed so laughed a roomate yelled ""what the fuck was that!!"" from the adjacent room and was a bit embarrassed to have sex for a good two weeks lol. 

tldr: i've become depressed and at the same time my now ex (only 19) whom is very disciplined feels as if i'm not for her in the last two weeks. This is out of left field for me, my friends, her family, and mine.

41tg7t,4,2016-01-20,[Long Post] A Push in the Right Direction Makes All the Difference,QuothTheRaven1992,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/41tg7t/long_post_a_push_in_the_right_direction_makes_all/,"So to start this off, I will give a little background about myself. I am currently 24 year old male, INTJ (for those who care), a high-school dropout, separated from the Military and I am currently a student pursuing a degree in Information Security. 

It's been a long and really harsh road for me the past 15 years. I had no ambition for school, my mother whom I was living with at the time wasn't really pushing me to be better or advocate that I do the things I love. My father was a Senior Chief in the Navy and was deployed a lot and also only received visitation from me and my sister. I dropped out of High School at 17, failing the 9th grade twice, almost a third time. I enrolled in a school which allowed me to acquire an equivalent, slacked off on that and a girlfriend I had been dating on and off for 6 years, taken advantage of every time, had broken up with me. Things really started to go downhill from here.

By the time I was half-way through that program, I was stuck with staying in the state I was living in/paying my own way or the easy way out and moving with my parents to Ohio. I chose the easy way out. I spent about 6 months not knowing what to do with myself at this point and I had reached the harsh realization that I was a failure. I believed I was destined as a failure and lost interest in a lot of creative outlets I used to pursue. I used to skate, draw, play/make music and had a decent interest in finding a partner.

In 2012, I decided to start branching out and looking for better opportunities for myself. I enrolled in a federal program known as Job Corps for their Computer Repair program, acquired my GED, graduated with two industry level certifications under my belt and work experience from an internship at a really large IT Certification/Training institution. I moved to NW Indiana, hoping that I could somehow find a good opportunity within the Chicago/NW Indiana area, which turned out to be a pipe dream. The area was an economic toilet bowl, was infested with low-wage labor and retail jobs, and the IT industry wanted people with credentials way outside of my expertise. My only option at this point was to go to a college. 

I felt that I had accomplished nothing at this point. I didn't want to be an IT guy who went to a desk job every day. I wanted to take it to the next level, filling a gap which I had thought about for a long time. I decided that I was going to enlist in the Navy. When I swore the oath, it was the happiest I had been in a very long time. I was motivated and ready to start a new future, thinking that I was not only doing something better for myself, but for all people. However, this was the facet of a very messed up situation.

When I had first talked to a recruiter in Ohio, I didn't have paperwork for ADHD that I was diagnosed with when I was younger. At the time I talked to them, it had been years since I had taken any kind of medication or had gone to therapy for it. The Chief in command (E-7 to E-9) of that recruiting station had left and a Petty Officer (E-4 to E-6) had pulled me to the back and had told me that *If the paperwork didn't exist, the ADHD didn't exist* and to come back when they purged documents in 6 months. I decided I was going to graduate Job Corps first and then think about it. 

Finally, when I was in Indiana, I had gone through with all of the paperwork and physicals, MEPS, the whole 9 yards. I didn't mention the ADHD per advice previously given and swore the oath. I was set to go to Recruit Training Command in Great Lakes. When I arrived, I was ready. When I put the uniform on, I almost cried tears of joy. I felt like I had really accomplished something. I had 2 fatherly figures who both did 20 years in the Navy to somewhat prepare me for the trials I was about to face... so I thought. Shit hit the fan when we did disciplinary PT. I was taken to the hospital and treated for Rhabdomyolysis because I pushed myself too far, and was admitted for about a week. I had missed so much of what our division was learning that week. When I got back, I was clueless. I didn't have my shots, my dental or any other per-requisites to my training done. I was surprised they didn't hold me back and put me into another division. My anxiety levels started shooting through the roof and I was told to go to Recruit Evaluation Unit (where they see if recruits are fit for duty under medical/mental circumstances). 

When I arrived, they started asking some questions about my medical history. A Lt. Commander had asked if I had *ever been diagnosed with ADHD, taken medication or received treatment from a therapist for it.* Me not thinking straight, I unconsciously answer the question truthfully. When it came out of my mouth, I panicked. It was nothing but shit from this point forward. What I figured was a white lie turned out to be the end of a dream I wanted to pursue. I told I was a liar to get what I wanted and that I was a shit sailor, etc etc. So all in all, I was perceived as a criminal in the eyes of the Navy, because I took some advice I was given seriously. I was given an Entry Level Separation with the option to re-enlist with a waiver, but after that, I didn't want anything to do with it. I didn't want anything to do with life at this point. My hopes and dreams were crushed. That was the longest and most miserable train ride home of my life. I felt ashamed of myself, even though I hadn't really done anything wrong. Maybe it was a lack of integrity, but people make mistakes. I was willing to correct it, but was never afforded a chance to prove myself. 

I was stuck at square one again. I didn't know what to do with myself. I was afraid to go to college, mostly because of reading student's accounts of ridiculously high student loans and little employment opportunity after they had gotten out of college. I didn't want to do anything anymore, out of fear that I was suffer consequences more severe than what had happened to me in the Navy. My mind was filled with *What If's* that eventually led to me doing nothing about my problems. I stayed in my safe space, being miserable and alone. 

It wasn't until my mother and stepfather had really started to sit down to listen to me somewhat. They had suggested that I go to University, maybe find something I didn't know was there and experience new things and meet new people. I was really hesitant, as I really didn't know anything about college. I grew up in a Military family where none of my relatives, outside of a few that I really don't talk to, had never gone to college. I was frustrated, because I felt that there was going to be some kind of terrible repercussion to messing something up, even if it was small, as that's what I was drilled to think when I was in basic training. Nothing but excellence. There is only right and wrong, and what is right is what they say is right. However, I finally pushed through the process of understanding how the system worked and I pushed myself to stay in the dorm on campus. 

I feel like this was the beginning of my major turning point. In my first semester, I was taking a sociology course, probably one of the best professors I had ever received a lecture from in my life. He opened my eyes about the world, humanity, things that could be accomplished and ways of understanding not only how the world interacts with itself, but how *you* as a person interact with it. It made me not feel like I wasn't this husk of a failure that was a defect of manufacturing in the womb. I felt... somewhat human again. This was only the beginning of the healing process. I had talked to a doctor about my issue with depression and I had been taking medication for about 6-7 months now. Not only is my anxiety under control, but I don't feel as crappy.

After I had finished my first semester, I had found that I scored too low on the math placement and in order to get into my major I would have to take a remedial course at another college, which wasn't very accessible for me as it was a 30 minutes drive back and forth. This was a major roadblock to progress. At this point, I was talking with my father regularly. He had recently moved to Maryland, a little outside of Washington D.C., and was talking with me about coming out there with him and looking for better opportunities. I kind of played around with the idea for a bit and finally said *fuck it, I'm doing it.* I made the arrangements, packed my shit and went somewhere I've never been, didn't have any clue what I was doing. I had a lot more family back on the East Coast anyway, and some friends I used to hang out with were only a few hours drive from there if I wanted to meet up with them or spend a weekend or whatever. 

What I've learned from all of this, and what I've learned from my professor after having some deep and personal conversations, is that sometimes stress and sadness are necessary emotions. It's how you control those emotions that predict the outcome of your life and whether or not you succeed in your ambitions. How you handle, process and move on with those emotions, while asking for help when needed, really determines how you gain the strength to deal with problems in the future. 

Not everything is as hopeless as it seems. You really have to believe and push yourself, no matter if a Lt. Commander, your parents, your peers or anyone else says otherwise. **Fuck them.** They don't know your feelings and ambitions, the context of your life and being as well as you do. Liberate yourself from the constraints of how others perceive you and make mistakes. Shit happens. Sometimes shit that is completely out of mine/yours/anyone's control. You just have to let it go, do something about it or don't, and move on.

At present, I am enrolled in college, been to several interviews with really high end businesses and government agencies looking for people with my experience and expertise, have been working out to get into better shape since I stopped skateboarding 8 years ago, been taking an interest again in my creative side and all around have been leaving the past in the past. 

I felt like this was something I should share with people and be more open about, as I still felt like I was lying to the world for holding my experiences and history back. Maybe someone else can learn from it or someone with a similar situation might be able to cope with their own a lot better.

=====================================================

tl;dr version: Fucked up really bad, tried to make things better, fucked up again, finally on the right track. A lot of lessons learned and feeling a lot better about myself. Hope this will help someone else."

This is going to sound cliche' but my girlfriend of a year just broke up with me on our anniversary of our first date. To give background because this one needs background for it's unusual. We met at tomorrowland summer 2014 in Belgium I used to do an internship in Germany and she was traveling Europe at the time, probably the craziest thing I've been apart of in my young 22 years (she's 19).

I also spent a lot of time getting her english better so we could communicate better and we both could proudly be successfully bilingual. She loved it and would return the favors herself by taking me to various local hangouts, doing jiu jitsu (she's Brazilian) workout classes, finding out community events, taking me on running paths, buying me dinners as well. I also managed to meet her mother who visited from Brazil, her mother took us out to eat for free (i paid 1) to any restaurants I wanted to try in NYC and I showed them a tour of NYC that most tourists would love.

She was really happy for me. I was happy for me. We decided so that she wouldn't have to go back to Brazil so early due to her visa still being valid she'd live with me and my mom for half the summer. That went amazingly too I'll spare you the details but it was both of us a very fun summer, we fell in love with each other in that time. We had a little fight on the way to the airport before she left mostly because I didn't want her to leave but made up over video chat the next day.

I've had a couple of them living in Europe for some time so to me it was/is nothing as long as I knew the other person really liked me and it seemed like she did AND COMMUNICATION IS THERE (pro tip). We'd videochat every night, then every night turned into 3/7 weeks cause I was getting situated with a new school, she was preparing to do her Tofel and SAT so she could do 4 years at an ivy league school. That's fine. Time went by and I realized I wasn't making friends as I learned being a transfer student with a really different life than everyone, along with being too old to be in a frat, too old to do what I normally do with my home and Europe friends with kids in my mostly freshman classes (big fan of bar scene),and too far away from campus to connect to anyone besides my roommates whom already have established life here I became depressed (got diagnosed last week) and lonely. My grades failed, I didn't give a damn about school. I'd show up do my homework but not go past that amount of effort. To help myself I kept up with my gym activity by going 5 times a week, I joined a club relative to my degree, and play basketball at times. No friends still. 23 weeks nothing (somehow kept my sobriety) However I'd still try with her. 

This past christmas I got my grades and they were bs so and cs from 16 credits. I told my girlfriend and she freaked on me. She got very emotional and passionate said I need to get my act together. I like I am now, not totally into anything whole heartedly saying yes I'll change. (first time i've lied to her in 11 months)

To break down her. She is...different...the good different. She's well cultured, really well spoken for her age, wishes it was 1950 some times because all this shit around us is too much of a distraction to become great, she'll paint and read russian authors for hours while appreciating Kanye west with mozart and knife party blended in the mix. She is very religious and sees her self at her max capacity as the next dali with intense discipline, dedication, hard work, and patience. (she is very talented for her age) She is more mature than anyone i've worked with and will be this serious philosophical brilliant child one minute and the next she'll be sending me a dumb gif of a cat falling off a roof. A lot of this comes from her working with a high profile jiu jitsu teacher in sao paulo that has imprinted in her head to be disciplined at all cost. I love it. Even asked to do that class with her. I express it to her all the time. To find negative in her is hard, the only thing I feel is she needs time to enjoy her youth a bit and slow it down. Take an off day. Her response is always, that's such a 15 year old thing. (i'm not totally used to it but I still love It)

We had a videochat last night and I told her it's getting worse every day and I don't feel like I want to be apart of the club I'm in anymore. She told me, that's she's been feeling unsatisfied for 3 weeks now. I said is cause we can't be in person for another 3 months and she said no..although she does from time acknowledge she gets cold to lovers without physical contact (she loves sex, i do too). She said since I've came to my new school I've shown I'm not as serious as she thought I was and she once saw me as a really good guy who treated her that way she liked (but feels she doesn't totally 100% deserve..that was new). She wanted a long future with me, like I did with her. She said my ambitions aren't good enough for hers right now to take over and be a strong leader. She doesn't know what a power couple is because of her english but at 19 she wants a power couple so she herself can be extremely successful and fulfilled in life. 

I knew she wanted that but to the extent of today I received one of those it's not going the way I thought it would texts she'd break up with me. We videochated for 3 hours before she could say it and I had to have her say it but when she did she wasn't sure. 12 hours have past and she's more sure than before. I've blocked her on Facebook and told her I just started the semester and need good grades for my future. I've also signed up for weekly therapy sessions for the next month. When that month is over I'll unblock her from all social media. I would like to enjoy her but she said a lot that at this moment in my life I can't fufill. Her passion for art is something I don't have for anything at the moment. My friends that know our relationship are confused and can't help me out and the walk in therapist today said wow with understanding words with no meaning. My loneliness is now worse due to her being my primary interaction and I've lost all the confidence I had since we first met. 

We said I love you in the summer after she left and agreed to a serious relationship. Never once on either side hinting what was above. We still love each other as of today but with her tmrw is a new day and I can just be the past in a second. She does think she has a more analytical love and I have more of the openly proud disney love (don't know how to put it) but that's just how my parents raised me idk if I can change that. She had trouble at times showing her eyes to me when we videochated the last two days which isn't normal. Idk what to do. She says go find a girl that's more not like her but I don't date those girls. 
Side note she visited me in October and said I love you every time she got for my birthday all the way from brazil and i was never more certain of our love. My mom came out that weekend to and surprised me with tickets to visit her on my spring break. I have the tickets and want to go to sao paulo and rio still but from what she has told me it's a better/safer city when you know your way around. 

Sex life 8/10...one time one of us queefed so laughed a roomate yelled ""what the fuck was that!!"" from the adjacent room and was a bit embarrassed to have sex for a good two weeks lol. 

tldr: i've become depressed and at the same time my now ex (only 19) whom is very disciplined and beyond ambitious feels as if i'm not for her in the last two weeks. This is out of left field for me, my friends, her family, and mine.

This past christmas I got my grades and they were bs so and cs from 16 credits. I told my girlfriend and she freaked on me. She got very emotional and passionate said I need to get my act together. I like I am now, not totally into anything whole heartedly saying yes I'll change. (first time i've lied to her in 11 months)

To break down her. She is...different...the good different. She's well cultured, really well spoken for her age, wishes it was 1950 some times because all this shit around us is too much of a distraction to become great, she'll paint and read russian authors for hours while appreciating Kanye west with mozart and knife party blended in the mix. She is very religious and sees her self at her max capacity as the next dali with intense discipline, dedication, hard work, and patience. (she is very talented for her age) She is more mature than anyone i've worked with and will be this serious philosophical brilliant child one minute and the next she'll be sending me a dumb gif of a cat falling off a roof. A lot of this comes from her working with a high profile jiu jitsu teacher in sao paulo that has imprinted in her head to be disciplined at all cost. I love it. Even asked to do that class with her. I express it to her all the time. To find negative in her is hard, the only thing I feel is she needs time to enjoy her youth a bit and slow it down. Take an off day. Her response is always, that's such a 15 year old thing. (i'm not totally used to it but I still love It)

We had a videochat last night and I told her it's getting worse every day and I don't feel like I want to be apart of the club I'm in anymore. She told me, that's she's been feeling unsatisfied for 3 weeks now. I said is cause we can't be in person for another 3 months and she said no..although she does from time acknowledge she gets cold to lovers without physical contact (she loves sex, i do too). She said since I've came to my new school I've shown I'm not as serious as she thought I was and she once saw me as a really good guy who treated her that way she liked (but feels she doesn't totally 100% deserve..that was new). She wanted a long future with me, like I did with her. She said my ambitions aren't good enough for hers right now to take over and be a strong leader. She doesn't know what a power couple is because of her english but at 19 she wants a power couple so she herself can be extremely successful and fulfilled in life. 

I knew she wanted that but to the extent of today I received one of those it's not going the way I thought it would texts she'd break up with me. We videochated for 3 hours before she could say it and I had to have her say it but when she did she wasn't sure. 12 hours have past and she's more sure than before. I've blocked her on Facebook and told her I just started the semester and need good grades for my future. I've also signed up for weekly therapy sessions for the next month. When that month is over I'll unblock her from all social media. I would like to enjoy her but she said a lot that at this point in my life I can't fufill. Her passion for art is something I don't have for anything at the moment. My friends that know our relationship are confused and can't help me out and the walk in therapist today said wow with understanding words with no meaning. My loneliness is now worse due to her being my primary interaction and I've lost all the confidence I had since we first met. 

We said I love you in the summer after she left and agreed to a serious relationship. Never once on either side hinting what was above. We still love each other as of today but with her tmrw is a new day and I can just be the past in a second. She does think she has a more analytical love and I have more of the openly proud disney love (don't know how to put it) but that's just how my parents raised me idk if I can change that. She had trouble at times showing her eyes to me when we videochated the last two days which isn't normal.

Side note she visited me in October and said I love you every time she got for my birthday all the way from brazil and i was never more certain of our love. My mom came out that weekend to and surprised me with tickets to visit her on my spring break. I have the tickets and want to go to sao paulo and rio still but from what she has told me it's a better/safer city when you know your way around. 

Sex life 8/10...one time one of us queefed so laughed a roomate yelled ""what the fuck was that!!"" from the adjacent room and was a bit embarrassed to have sex for a good two weeks lol. 

tldr: i've become depressed and at the same time my now ex (only 19) whom is very disciplined feels as if i'm not for her in the last two weeks. This is out of left field for me, my friends, her family, and mine. My parents, divorced were really excited about her  unlike my other sibling I was finding a constant relationship in a good person. The day my father met her he told me she was too beautiful for me and it was the first time in a long time he expressed his pride to be his son. That meant a lot. They've known about relationships in the past and my ups and downs but they saw something in her as well. idk..

pls don't judge grammar and sentence errors i've had a long day.
The gym and my work ethic shall be my only friend for a while I suppose...
-thanks ya'll, dan."

What should I be tracking? Any thoughts about what would be informative, provide fun, shareable visualizations, and use Tableau effectively?

Currently:


1. **Expenses** - 
Spiked during moving in and getting all the documents, but now it is trickling off, and it's tracked well because I use plastic mostly.


2. **Wake up times** - 
I was waking up around 3-5 am for the first week, and then gradually adjusted. The classes at KTH are *randomly* scheduled, so some mornings I must wake up at 6 am, whereas other days I have no class.


3. **Exercise per day** - 


4. **Study times per day** -


5. **Skype per day** - 
I skype my girlfriend a fair amount, and I can connect how much we talk with how busy she/I am.


6. **FB Calling per day** -
I call my parents a fair amount using FB calling.


Thanks a ton! I **love** the visualizations online of people's goals (fitness/finances/etc), so I thought I would try to make one of my own, but I want to make sure I have some visualizable data. 

FYI: My first post on Reddit. I'm about to intern at Tableau this summer in Fremont."

During this time I'd love to get a feel for the Denver/Boulder area tech community, as well as work on sharpening my skills (specifically, interview skills) outside of work.

1. Does anyone know of any good tech meetups in the area? 

2. Does anyone know of any good meetups in the area specifically catered towards working on interview prep (data structures/algorithm questions)?

Deck built on [NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com).

Inspiration:

“HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.”  - AM from ""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream""

I built this deck not to win, but to make the runners life miserable (especially faust), and to get some practice with Biotech.  You can imagine my surprise when such a lousy starting goal actually led to me getting a lot more wins than I usually do (or in several cases a lot more winnable games that I totally screwed up and threw away on stupid plays).

Despite how stupid inconsistent this deck looks, it's actually surprisingly decent, and one of the few decks that I don't think could just be replaced with a better ID, as biotech works well here.  The overall idea is that the runner has to be worried about a ton of different janky threats that can just wreck the game for them, and the deck runs enough of a variety that just assuming you know what to do and following a plan doesn't work.  Biotech helps that goal by mostly allowing you to threaten 2 net damage or a 4 advance score as long as you don't flip it (and in my testing most seem viable?).

Breakdown:

**ID**-

It's important to note that both brewery and greenhouse work with this deck, and maybe even the tank in the right matchup.  The trick is making the right guess on which one to run based on the suspected matchup.  It's something I'm still personally learning, but half the trick is making sure you don't flip anything too early unless it wins you the game or gives you a tremendous tempo swing.

**Agenda**-

*Future Perfect:* 

Still a great card that's obnoxious to steal.

*Medical Breakthrough:*

You will at some point get something stolen, and ideally its the first one of these. The ability for the last one to be a 2 for 2 is awesome, and the 3/2 helps as well.

*Fetal/MKII:*

i'm putting these together because they're both tech calls and designed to surprise the runner.  Fetal being NAPD light (ultra light...) helps a ton, but the 2 net damage can lead to kills they weren't expecting (t1 run, faceplant cortex, access fetal has won me games).  MKII is a scary powerful effect that you can score never advance score with your ID if needed, and is the only 4/2 I could think of that was worth flipping the ID and taking away the threat of 2 net any turn.

*House/Philotic/Future is now:*

This deck needs to be able to pretend to shell game for some matchups, and I went for the spread again to keep the runner on their toes.  Phil is obviously good and can end games, future is now lets you find important tech cards with all the 1 of's in the deck, and house of knives is obnoxious as hell to the runner should you score it.  Generally I'm happy to see any of them, and never think ""wow I wish I ran 2 of X"".

**Asset**-

*Pavilion/Team Sponsor:*

Tech cards, but important in that they cost a ton to trash and are obnoxious if played more than once.  I sometimes just see these as ""click: runner spends a click and 4/5"", and other times they're the center of a very oppressive strategy.

*Ronin:*

An awkward as hell 1 of and maybe should be dropped, but the way peoples play style changes when they see the ronin is noteworthy.  Granted I don't have more, but it still scares the hell out of them.  Alternatively they'll sit at 2 cards at the end of turn to avoid the Brewery, ignore a mushin, and then you ronin for the win.

*Launch/Pad:*

Econ that at least costs them something to trash.  Pad is expensive as hell to deal with while launch nets them a loss if you get to rez it for even 1 turn.  Recursion on launch can make you a nice amount of cash as well.

*Cerebral/Snare:*

Standard combo.  Snare is snare.  Not much to say here.

*Jackson:*

Is jackson.  Should probably run all 3, but I wanted space to test a few things.

**Upgrade**-

*Nisei/Batty:*

Fairly standard.  Nisei to help lock out a server and batty to force fire something nasty as hell.  There's a good variety of evil subs to use, and it can especially screw AI reliant runners.  Also firing and archangel to bounce a sharazad or a Off Campus Apartment can win games.  Oh and you've got shenanigans like they face check a cortex, then you batty the cortex.

*Corporate Troubleshooter:*

Still not sure on this guy.  Might replace him with something else or just a cyberdex, but the idea is that some games wind up very tight for the runner credit wise (Yes i know medical fundraiser), and he can ensure a fire right when you need it for relatively little by screwing up the break math just enough to force a faceplant into something really nasty.  The main targets being angel, assassin (which can then fire both subs), or in the right matchups cortex.  Further it's an ""until the end of the turn"" effect so it can just lock someone out to ensure a score when you really need it.

**Operations**-

*Mushin/Interns:*

Together because there's nothing really new here.  Mushin is mushin and interns is just so damn flexible. Lets you recur something they hate with a passion or just drop a 5th ice for free.

*Medical Research Fundraiser:*

I think this card is amazing and everything the deck needs.  ""But you give the runner money"" doesn't really matter when the whole point of the deck is to mostly get them to faceplant into something they weren't expecting/ready for, and to do that you NEED money. Hedge is too slow with the 4 upfront cost, and I'm very happy to go from two credits, to click for cred, install, medical and then rez a tollbooth in their face next turn or watch them spend the money installing and run into a swordsman or snare.  It keeps your snares alive, it keeps your assassin ready to go, it makes sure that when they access your ambush you can always fire it, and it does all of this faster than hedge fun.   

As for the runner having money, you do need to time these right.  I will almost never fundraiser first turn unless i've got a tollbooth/assassin ready to go, but if the runners got 20 credits, and you've got 3 because they've done well and trashed all your econ, then suddenly who the hell cares if they've got 3 more?  It's WAY more important that you can rez your lotus field/swordsman and fire that batty this turn.

**ICE**-

*Bako/Icewall:*

I SUCK with bako and never remember to use the ability or know when to, and the icewalls are there mostly for cheap ETR so I can rush stuff out as well.  Might drop one or two ice walls (maybe all of them if someone has a better way to spend the influence).

*Archangel:*

God this is nasty.  Trace 6 to bounce any one thing the runner has installed can straight up wreck their tempo.  Some runners don't give a damn but others just lose the game off this.

*Crick/Lotus/Tollbooth:*

All fairly standard for obvious reasons.  Booth is a great rez off a fundraiser.

*Assassin/Cortex Lock/Swordsman:*

Just terrible evil awful cards to facecheck at the wrong time, and all are great options for a batty fire, while assassin remains taxing even in the late game.  

**Things I'd like to fit in**-

It's not a hate deck without crisium gird.  I'm considering taking out an icewall for it and actually learning how to use the hitsu.  Further I may want one pad or launch to become a sundew or two.  It's easier for them to trash, but also much harder for the runner to continue to ignore, and a great way to bait runs in the mid game.


So yes, there's my pile of unmitigated tremendous jank that sorta kinda works.  I'd love some suggestions/ideas."
41vx6s,6,2016-01-20,For Hire,zestrells,NetworkingJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetworkingJobs/comments/41vx6s/for_hire/,"Hello Reddit,

I'm a junior in college studying Computer Engineering. I worked as a SWE intern at a large eCommerce company last summer, and for next summer, I have 2 PM Internship offers from which I needed some help deciding. 

Company A: Large well-known , reputed SF company (If Google/FB are 10/10 companies, this is probably a 9/10)

* Spoke with manager and lead engineer - clicked very well with both
* Better pay, both internship and full time
* I'm more passionate about this company
* Downside: I'd be a PM on this backend Infrastructure engineering team, although recruiter told me if I did well he could help me explore PM full time roles on core product side

Company B: Another B2B, known in industry  (probably 7 or 8 out of 10)

* Pro: I get to choose what I want to work on and they match me to a team based on those interests (Analytics, Business Intelligence, Mobile. Etc.)
* Less pay, both Internship and FT
* I'm less passionate about the company

I'm stuck because one company offers a good product/project to work on for the summer, but the other (A) is a place I'd be enthusiastic/passionate working, although I'd be working on a backend infrastructure team for the summer and then try to switch to core product team for FT. Thoughts or some insight into this situation would be appreciated!

41w31i,92,2016-01-20,I have no idea where to go from here,catsarethenewblack,JUSTNOMIL,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/41w31i/i_have_no_idea_where_to_go_from_here/,"I am having severe issues with my MIL and FIL. These issues are nothing new but they are now amplified by the birth of my son. See my post history for the backstory. Summary is that they suck. 

I have a newborn on my hands so excuse the formatting/grammar. I promise I'm not an idiot. i just need advice and do not have time to re-read this large piece if text at the moment. I am using bullet points because it quicker. 

1. They have complained since before the baby was born about not seeing the baby. I left them alone with him for three hours while I cleaning the house. Every time I walked by they were playing on their phone. 

2. I use Amazon Prime Now for diapers, shampoo, detergent, etc because it is easier than packing up the baby. When my brother in law comments on how cool that is (they are from small town), MIL makes a back ass comment about how a normal person could not use this service because they are not home all day just waiting for a package. I am on maternity leave bitch.

3.We are in the process of selling our house. On the Sunday of their visit, we are prepping for an open house. I have boxed up half of my closet to make it appear larger. I am dragging a 40 pound box across the floor. My FIL offers to hold the baby so I can carry the box upstairs. Of course I replied, ""why don't you carry the 40 pound box for your daughter in law that just had major abdomen surgery. 

4. Again about the open house, FIL would not shut the fuck up about us not locking every closet in our home during the open house to protect our belongings. Who the fuck would place an offer on a home without seeing the closets? FIL considers himself an expert on open houses because he flipped one house that has been on the market for 8 months. Still no offers. 

5. MIL approaches my husband and I to say ""{husband} can I take the baby in the bathroom with me?"". Clearly speaking to him and not me. I ask why and how. She wants to put my bobby lounger pillow on the bathroom floor while she using the bathroom. Fuck no, my child will never see your smell cunt. She complained to my husband about me saying no to this just yesterday. 

6. I ask my FIL is move his car so that my husband can park his truck in his spot so that he can load valuables into it for the open house. FIL insist that he has to shower first. Just to move his car to the front of the house. I told him that was ridiculous and I will just move it for him. He then spends 20 mins getting dressed and even called my husband to help him find his beanie. It was probably 40 degrees out. God forbid his hot head get cold on the 20 foot walk from the curb. 

7. MIL would not stop commenting on his feeding schedule. She would not give him to me to feed him when I asked. I had to physically take him from her. Apparently I feed him too much and it takes him too long to feed. 

8. I had to ask MIL to leave the room when I was changing his diaper. I am weird about body autonomy. I do not believe that everyone should see him naked until he can speak for himself. I understand that I am weird and need therapy.But if I don't trust someone they will not see my child's penis. End of story. My husband explained that to him. They need to respect it. 

8. If my son spit up they would holler for me to come wipe his face when the burp cloth was right there. 

9. MIL and FIL both are under the impression that when our home sells, the buyers keeps our furniture and belongings. Seriously. They kept asking if they should take home ""their furniture"" that they gave us so that the new owner doesn't keep it. We must have explained the buying process ten times but they kept bringing it up. To the point where I asked them to go get a uhaul to take all of ""their' stuff back with them. Of course they decline. 

9. MIL walks around with my husband to tell him what furniture we should throw out when we move. 

10. MIL is obsessed with baby having features of her side of the baby. When I explain the DHA square about eye color and say that he will probably have brown eyes (like me), she says that his eyes look blue-grey. So do every other baby's eyes. She is also disappointed that my child doesn't have two toenails on his baby toes. Apparently its a family trait. I am assuming the trait was picked up from fucking their cousins. (apologizes to those with two nails on one toe)

10. I give my husband two new belts for christmas. He needed them and I thought it would be funny to get him a typically dad gift. MIL and FIL both laugh and make comments about how they probably don't fit him. They even ask what size they were to see if FIL should take them home with him in case they didn't fit my husband. 

11. MIL asked multiple times about day care knowing that I am going to be a stay at home mom. 

12. MIL says that when my husband was born she would not have been able to make it without the help of her own MIL. She goes into a long story about how helpful she was and how she wouldn't trade it for the world. I agree with her and say that I would not have been able to make it without the help of my sister. I go into detail about how she cleaned, cooked, drove me when my husband couldn't. She never asked to hold the baby so that I could do house work. She never gave advice. I even said she was the perfect person to stay with us and I am forever grateful of her. MIL rolls her eyes and walks away as I am smiling. 

13. MIL is upset that she cannot bring my mother with her for this visit. Her mother is older and did not get vaccinated. Our rules were that only  people who had the flu and tdap shots could visit. But she brought it up all weekend. 

14. MIL brings a huge box of my husband's baby things for us to store. Remember we are moving... In this box is my husbands baptism outfit. She points this out to us multiple times. We are not baptizing our child and she knows this.

15. To keep the baby on his schedule, everyone goes to dinner without me and I come meet them after he has eaten. As I sit down, MIL and FIL are giving my husband a talk about how he is only successful because of the people who helped him. They paid for his college. His grandfather's friend helped him get an he internship. Never mind that my husband has the personality of a politician. He has never made an enemy. He is successful in his career because he knows how to network and work with people. He has earned his career on his own and does not owe anyone shit. Why cant they just be proud of their son?

THIS IS THE BIG EVENT OF THE WEEKEND VISIT:

We are eating lunch on Sunday. My husband and his parents get into a argument at the restaurant over my pets. My husband ask them to stop giving us advice unless we ask for it. MIL storms off and attempts to kiss out baby as she is leaving. My husband pushes her away from our child. FIL follows her out. We hug brother in law and apologize to him. My husband and I continue to eat lunch with our child. It was the hardest thing in the world to do because it was on the verge of tears the whole time. My husband is the strongest person I know. So seeing him like that breaks my heart. 

Since then, my husband has made multiple attempts to mend their relationship through phone calls. One day he came home from work and FIL had verbally bashed me to my husband. Mainly about my debt and me becoming a stay at home mom. He also bashed my family and how I am not close to them. My husband hung up on him when he accused me of brainwashing him.

The conversations with MIL are not much different. Again with the brainwashing. How I am a terrible person for breastfeeding or not telling her take a shit in front of our son. Again with the stay at home mom comments and how we are living outside of our means. My husband brings in over 200k a year and saves most of it. I think we are good. She again questioned if he loved me just as she did when we eloped. Said that she does not consider us married. She said that she has raised my husband for 28 years and I am the reason that he is being so disrespectful. 

Now this is where I need the advice:

I do not want to keep my child from his grandparents but I cannot  forgive and forget at this point. They have bashed me and my family in every way possible. They have ruined my husbands time with our newborn by making everything about them and their feelings. The problem is that they never bashed me to me. Everything is through my husband and he stood up for me. But my husband thinks that I cannot have that conversation with them because it makes him look like a tattle tail. He also does not seem to think that MIL storming off during lunch is a big deal. I do not want to ever allow her to act like that in front of our child. Thankfully he is not old enough to remember it now, but what is going to stop her when he is older? Her trying to kiss him goodbye in my opinion is her putting my child in the middle of an argument and that is never okay. If you are going to storm off like a child, you lose the right to say goodbye to my son. 

Another problem is that my husband is so wishy-washy about them. One day he will come home saying that we are never seeing them again and that I should block their numbers. Then the following day, he will ask when we can go visit them. It hard to stand as a united family if I cannot follow what his feelings are. 

I know that I will get alot of comments about me having a ""husband problem"" and I agree that I do. We have been to therapy before and I agree that it will be beneficial. But my husband does not want to go. I am considering attending on my own this time because I am the least forgiving person ever. 

When I am forced to visit them, I asked to stay in a hotel. Husband disagreed. I just feel like it is going to be like in high school or sorority life when you know someone was talking shit about you but you are forced to play nice. 

I do not like using the word hate but I know that these people hate me and I do not know where to go from here.  I think they are selfish, disgusting human beings. 

Please tell me what to do."

I graduated with an English degree in 2008 and I've been working in various marketing communications departments ever since. I started with a six-month internship with a documentary film director and have spent the past seven years creating web content for a number of different companies.

The problem is, I don't want to be in marketing, and never really did. I'm a very mission-driven person and enjoy doing work for a cause. I'm a skilled writer and editor with portfolio samples to back that up, and I enjoy editorial work way more than marketing and brand strategy. 

I like to craft the words that drive the strategy for a cause-driven institution, not plan the strategy for some corporation's bottom line.

My two main challenges are that I'd like to leave marketing and do journalism and editorial work instead, and I want to do something with *purpose*. I'm about to turn 30 and realized that I've spent my entire life creating for other people and creating nothing for myself or the causes I'm passionate about.

And I don't know how to turn my passion for writing and making a social impact into money. The kinds of organizations I want to do communication work for either aren't hiring or don't want to pay for the work. And my portfolio shows that I'm a great marketing communicator, but has no evidence that I can be a journalist.

I feel stuck and ineffective in my creative career and don't really know where to go from here, or even where I necessarily *want* to go.

**TL;DR:** I'm having a career crisis and need guidance in how to move from marketing into journalism when my portfolio only shows my marketing skills."

41wpl7,11,2016-01-20,PhD student looking at bio-processing of cobalt from iron and manganese oxide minerals - desperate for internships/work experience with a mining company.,Swahliman,mining,https://www.reddit.com/r/mining/comments/41wpl7/phd_student_looking_at_bioprocessing_of_cobalt/,"I'll start this by saying I fucking love rocks. I love rocks and minerals. They fascinate me. I don't want to do anything else other than work a job where I can use all my geological knowledge in a real-world context and make some money out of it.

Currently I'm doing a PhD that basically consists of using certain strains of bacteria to reduce cobalt out of minerals or turn them into nano-materials that can be used in technology. I started back in September but it has been a hard and tiring journey getting to this point.

I graduated from my undergraduate course with a 1st class degree from the University of Manchester in July 2013. My degree is an MEarthSc, it's a weird kind of undergraduate master's degree that consists of a BSc with a research year tacked on the end. After graduating I saved up and went to Oz right at the end of the Boom (late 2013 to early 2014) and didn't get any luck finding work out there. Came back for mate's wedding feeling utterly dejected, probably should have gone back as I still had months on my visa but didn't. Instead I thought I'll just try and get some relevant work experience so I applied for every slightly geo-related job I could find. Geotech, environmental etc etc. Nada. Ended up working in a pub in Edinburgh. It was shit. I started work late, finished work late. Over the winter the manager decided we only needed one person to run the place in the weekday evenings (Sun-Thurs) and I was the sap who ended up working alone every evening.

Let me tell you that during the Edinburgh hospitality industry's dead period (Mid-Oct to March) the weirdos come out to drink. Not just the weirdos but the scary bastards too. And the young uns who've bought a bid of MDMA and think it'd be cool to go the pub. It's a bad mix. And it got scary at times. The highlight was getting nutted in the face by a 6'4"" giant old shithead on crutches. Yessir that was a grand day.

Being sick of that sort of guff I decided to hedge my bets and flew out to Toronto and went to the Prospectors' and Developers' Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in March of 2015 to network and basically ask for work. It was nerve-wracking and cost me a lot of money and was a fruitless trip. I got mixed reactions, some people were dismissive and didn't have the time of day for me, some laughed in my face, others however were really nice and tried to be helpful and gave me good advice (though unfortunately nothing groundbreaking nor really anything I hadn't already thought of). Thought I was onto something with one Rare Earth Mining company from Australia but hit a dead end. The CEO was dead impressed that I'd gone out to the convention on my own to look for work but after I was introduced to the Head-Geo it fell a bit flat, whatever rapport I has built with the boss was not transferred down to his Head Geologist. 

A lot of people there told me that if I wanted a job in mining that I should wait five to ten years and then try again, which while true was not what I wanted to hear.

Came back to the UK and just as when I had got back from Oz I applied for every Geotechnical/Environmental job I could find. Brick walls, every last one of them. I spent three months out of work where not even random ass jobs would get back to me. Ended up calling up my old manager from the pub and asking for my job back. So I was back to serving pints to tourists, having to clean puke out of urinals and telling groups of coked-up LAAAAAAADS that they could calm down or fuck off.

During this time me and mate started going out camping and gold panning in Perthshire. He watches all those shows like Ice Cold Gold etc and was getting well into it so he asked me for my geological expertise and we headed out. Started doing a bit of research about this one area and one evening of googling searching threw up this old paper about Au-Ag mineralisation from the late 80's written by one of my old profs from UoM. I started emailing the Professor who seemed really happy that I was getting out to one of his old stomping grounds and seemed keen to share info on some other areas of mineralisation though he kept schtum about where the gold was.

Knowing that I was probably not gonna hit paydirt I reviewed my options. I couldn't afford to do a MSc, looked at Camborne obviously but the 11500 quid price tag for a few letters after my name and the extortionate price of living down south basically wrote that off. Was at my wits' end when a mate doing a Nuclear Engineering (Geomicrobiology related) PhD at UoM told me about some new PhDs coming online for applications. Turned out that Prof I'd been emailing about the gold panning was a supervisor for one of them so I applied for both and ended getting accepted onto the one with my old Prof as my boss.

I know this has turned into something of a soliloquy, did not mean to do a big life story shit all over reddit, but I thought some context would be useful. 

I'm 4.5 months in and I've got a shit tonne of work to do but I want to be proactive about taking the next step and getting in with some mining companies with internships or work experience.

*Can anyone tell me which companies are good at providing internships or mine-site work experience? The UK's mining industry is virtually non-existent (thanks Maggie) so I'd be looking at going abroad, anywhere abroad, even the DRC, which is a major Co-producer and also producer of horrific violence, would be fair game to me.

*Similarly does anyone know which companies specialise in mining of laterites or sea-floor Mn-crusts/nodules? (My project is based around these deposits).

*Again; who knows which companies are championing the ideas of bio-processing e.g. bio-leaching or other methods?

Also: any advice would be welcomed.

Thanks if you read this whole thing. Thanks doubly if you provide some decent info.

TL;DR. Spent ages trying to find my way into the mining industry. Been unsuccessful, doing a PhD now. Want to find internships to get me well-prepared for once I've finished (in 2.5 years time).

41wyvw,3,2016-01-20,Sith Hierarchy,Darth_Neauar,SithOrder,https://www.reddit.com/r/SithOrder/comments/41wyvw/sith_hierarchy/,"A recent post by Lord Anguish has caused some discussion to spin off, about a Sith hierarchy and how it would be handled. In the comments of that post i mentioned that i would like to elaborate further on how such a hierarchy might be handled, that is the purpose of this post.

[Lord Anguish's earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SithOrder/comments/407o8h/a_new_brotherhood/)

My exact words from the aforementioned post were as follows:

&gt;Instead of letting everyone run around aimlessly we need to establish a power ladder in which only the strongest and most cunning among us can climb. As a way of not only unifying our goals, but also making sure that the weakest among us have little to no influence on the order as a whole.

A good comparison to this would be a power ladder that was set up in much the same way as a ""bottle neck"" where the strong rise up past the brim of the bottle and the weak are pushed down to the bottom, doomed to mediocrity until they gain the strength to pull themselves up.

Darth Zorn brought up the idea that the Sith could never follow a proper hierarchy because of the constant in-fighting and squabbling over power and position, to which i replied by comparing how an ideal Sith hierarchy would work to Adam Smith's ""Invisible hand"" theory in economics: 

&gt;Each Sith, working towards his/her own benefit would in-tern benefit the order as a whole by strentghing themselves, and thus the order, and pushing those not strong enough to keep up down to the bottom, much like real-world economics, where Smith's invisible hand theory is based. In addition, those smart enough learn to gain power will do so by ""playing the game"" and thus working towards the common goals of the order. Atleast until their ready to rise up and seize power.

Now that i have explained the background for this idea, i will elaborate on my thoughts of how a proper Sith hierarchy would function. I suggest taking inspiration from the ""Sith Empire"" of the ""Old Republic era"" of Star Wars Legends: (although not in the sense of apprentices killing masters to take their place) The order would be governed by a ""Dark Council"" consisting of a specified number of Dark Lords, who would each be in-charge of a specific area of the order, called the ""Spheres of Influence"" (e.g. The Sphere of Ancient Knowledge, The Sphere of Biotic Science, The Sphere of Imperial Intelligence, etc). And under these dark council members would be their apprentices, their apprentices apprentices, and etc. whenever a member of the dark council leaves their position, for whatever reason, the strongest of their apprentices will rise up to take their place, another possibility could be having the dark council elect it's own members. As far as how someone would go about being chosen to join the dark council, i would suggest making posts, commenting, being active, and getting your name out there by becoming a well-known and respected member of the order. A topic that could be of some debate is whether or not we should have a single leader, or if this dark council would be able to rule together. A possible solution to this would be to have the theoretical dark council members elect one of their own to have a final say on council decisions, and to prevent power struggles and in-fighting this role could be passed around between the members of the dark council after a certain period of time has expired, or it could simply be given to the strongest among them, to keep until someone stronger comes along to replace him or her.
 
 
These are my ideas for how a functioning Sith hierarchy would work, feel free to voice your own ideas in the comments. I look forward to some discussion on this topic in the future.

41x3vv,3,2016-01-20,"My [25M] apathetic, alcoholic, bulimic, friend [24M] is spiraling out of control and starting to do cocaine. What can I do?",Eelmara,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41x3vv/my_25m_apathetic_alcoholic_bulimic_friend_24m_is/,"First off, I didn't know where to post this question so if this is not in the right place, I apologize. 

I have a friend (let's call him 'Mike'), that I have known since middle school and he was always a smart and witty kid. We had the same interests in games, sports, etc. However, once we began college, and couldn't spend as much time together, I started noticing behavior that was becoming destructive to his personal health and life. 

Mike is a tall (6'3""-6'4"") guy and was never fat. However, after he came back from a teaching internship in South Korea, he became obsessed with body image and his wardrobe. In the beginning, our mutual friends thought it was just a phase, since Seoul is known to be very fashion-forward and the Korean culture places a unhealthy emphasis on physical appearance. It started off with buying clothes that was flashy but it turned into him regularly skipping meals to lose weight. Then it turned into full-fledged bulimia. Something which he admits he still struggles with this day.

By his sophomore year, he had dropped out of school completely and even tried to go back again a year later only to dropout a second and final time. 

Now, his parents have moved back to Korea, leaving him alone here. They still pay for his rent and give him some allowance to eat but we all know he spends it only on clothes, tattoos, cigarettes, and alcohol. 

Since I have graduated college, most of our friends and I have moved away so we had limited opportunity to reach out to him outside of texting/calling. However, whenever I do get a chance to hang out with him, he just looks worse and worse. He just talks about how drunk he always gets, how much money he is wasting, and how little food he gets to eat. He once literally ate nothing but Haribo gummy bears for a week straight. 

One of the points where I actually reached out to him was when he suffered from a vitamin deficiency from his drinking and eating disorder. He said he was thinking about going to rehab but when I last checked up on him, he hasn't checked himself in. As a friend, every part of me wants to drag him there but I know that rehab is something he needs to go to on his own will.

The final straw for me happened not too long ago when I received a snapchat from him, showing that he is going to try cocaine for the first time. He then sent a series of snaps through the night documenting his experience and it very much seemed that he enjoyed it. He even texted one of our mutual friends to try it with him next time.

So /r/relationships, I come to you now for advice on what to do now. On one hand I understand addiction and these kinds of problems need to be tackled by the person themselves but on the other hand, it hurts so much just to do nothing and watch him destroy himself.

I think I should mention that whenever I try and intervene or talk to him about this stuff, he always admits he has a a huge problem and needs to change. I just believe his biggest problem is his apathy.



   
**TL;DR**: My aimless, financially irresponsible, alcoholic, bulimic friend now started doing cocaine. Our mutual friends and I are getting really worried and don't know how to confront him or if we even should. What should we do?"

41x5cw,5,2016-01-20,My Career and it's Dreams are Dead,TI_8000,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/41x5cw/my_career_and_its_dreams_are_dead/,"- I’m going to preface this by saying that I am clinically depressed/bi-polar and have anxiety. I’ve been dealing with it my entire life and have been seeing professionals for the past ten years. So this isn’t a “I’m having a bad day and am sad” post. This is a “chronic depression is ruining all aspects of my life. Here is one example” post. I think at this point my career as I know it is dead. The details are long, so skip to the bottom for the abstract if you want.

- The details: I went to college and got a business degree. I applied for internships but the only one I got was at a small local business, one office and I did nothing but answer a phone at the front desk and not get paid. I got a shit job out of college making $35k at a struggling company in 2007. I later found out that everyone else they wanted to hire turned them down so I pretty much their last option. I was there for 29 months and did the same thing every day, no raise, no promotion, learned almost nothing. I basically typed numbers into a computer and worked with equally unmotivated employees who rotated in and out. When it came time for layoffs, I was one of the first to go. Unemployed and depressed for over two years, March ‘10 to May ’12. Tried but couldn’t get work. Moved in with parents and got unemployment. One day I got a call asking if I wanted to interview for a job. I interview and got the job starting in May ‘12. It’s still pretty low level but I can move out of my folks and get back on track. This company did business with a silicon valley startup which has become a “unicorn”. The startup (at the time, not anymore) asked if I would be interested in working for them. I thought, “why not”, it sounds like a good opportunity. They offer me the job and I moved across the country to San Francisco. This was my break. Ground level at a unicorn of a startup where I would be able to establish myself and make significantly more money (even with cost of living adjusted). Well, I crashed and burned. I couldn’t handle the pressure and melted down. In five months, I was fired. I had given up so much to make this move and failed. Move back in with parents, get back on unemployment, and start looking for work again. In an entire year I get one in-person interview w/ no offer (not even a rejection email, just silence). Again, out of the blue, a company calls asking if I am looking for work. I take a one year, work from home contract with this company. The project I work on is a disaster. Most weeks I just sent emails asking what was going on. No direction, people quit left and right and new bodies are rotated in. I learn nothing and after a year am back to being unemployed, living at home, and on unemployment for the third time. That was back in September '15 and I’ve been looking for a job since July ’15. I apply and apply, try to do all the right things but have only managed one face-to-face interview. Every interview asks me why I’ve been unemployed for repeated and lengthy periods of time and why my stays at certain jobs are so brief. I don’t know what to really say to help my position, I cover it up as much as possible and even lie. It’s clear I’m damaged goods to recruiters and HR. 

- The abstract: Chronic unemployment mixed with depression is a compounding problem and I think I’ve reached the point where only a desperate company would hire me. I’m 32 and realistically, my options are only getting worse and the idea of my career advancing beyond a low level grunt are slim. My depression and anxiety has led to some career fuck ups. Employers can see through me. In the end, my screw ups and mental problems have led me to a point where it seems no matter what I do I am seen as undesirable for the roles I want. I can’t even get entry level jobs. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve regressed so much that I’ll probably have to give up on my dream of being even slightly successful in the corporate world. I’ve started looking for retail jobs, working in restaurants, and manual labor. I’m so embarrassed and feel like a failure. In a way, I kinda am."

How do I tactfully handle the situation and get her to change her mind?,Whinnie,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/41xgpv/i_21_f_feel_like_my_landlord_5060s_f_is_imposing/,"I live in the basement apartment of an old couple's house. I started living here two weeks ago and am expected to stay until April, since my internship is in the city. The place is nice and cozy and a bit far from the subway station but it's also really cheap, and the landlord and her husband keep to themselves and have pretty much allowed me to do whatever I want within reason ... until today.

Some background: my boyfriend (also 21M) and I also started going long distance this month, since I started my internship in the city but he's still in our university town studying. We've been together for almost a year and a half now, but my parents don't know (they just think we're friends) and I don't plan on telling them for a long time. The plan was for him to come visit me on some weekends (when he isn't busy studying or he hasn't gone back home or I haven't gone back home) and come in on Friday and leave on Sunday. Sounds like a reasonable plan, right?

Out of respect for my landlord, I brought this point up on my first night there by asking if she had some sort of ""overnight policy"", and then explaining that I was hoping my boyfriend could stay over for 3-4 nights a month. I promised that I would make sure he would follow all of the house rules and that he was quiet, and that I would take responsibility for anything wrong that he did since he was my guest, etc. At first she said, ""Well, I guess one month a night is fine,"" but she was very uncomfortable with the idea and said that it was because my parents don't know about my relationship with him (she has firsthand seen how insanely overprotective my parents are when they were helping me move in) and she didn't want to be ""an accomplice"" of mine if they found out while he was staying here, because then she would have to get involved. She also mentioned that another person had been interested in renting out the place (there are two rooms, the other one is unoccupied) but that she had turned him down because he had asked about letting friends stay over some nights or something. Then she asked if my parents knew him and I responded, ""Yeah, because we've lived together before so they know we're friends,"" so she said, ""Okay, so we know what to say if they see him here. We'll just tell him he's a friend visiting"" and she seemed more at ease. But she closed off the conversation ambiguously by saying, ""I'll talk to my husband and see what he says.""

That brings us to today. I left my landlord a note this morning saying something along the lines of, ""Hi, [landlord]! Just wanted to let you know that my boyfriend is visiting this weekend. He'll be staying Friday and Saturday night and leaving on Sunday. Let me know if you have a problem with this!"" I was notifying her, not asking for permission. When I came back from work I came back to this note:

&gt;Hi, Whinnie,

&gt;Thanks for letting us know.
&gt;I think we talked about one night stay for your boyfriend. That would be fine.

&gt;Thank you,
&gt;[landlord]

To clarify, I am *not* looking for legal advice (and I live in Canada so your laws may not apply here anyway). I have done my own research and realized that what she is doing is illegal, and this request of hers is unreasonable. I don't share a kitchen or a bathroom with my landlords; my room is in the basement while theirs is on the main floor so they would hardly be affected by any visitors' presence. There's also no clause or term in the lease (which is not in paper because it's month-to-month) or in her sheet of housekeeping rules by the kitchen about having people stay over in my room.

One last relevant thing: I'm pretty sure my landlord takes everything a bit too personally. When I first told her I wanted to rent out her place I mentioned that my parents were concerned about the fact that I could only lock my bedroom door when I was in the room, and not when I went out to work. She responded by pointing out that she couldn't lock any of the rooms in her home upstairs and that ""it is a matter of trust. Obviously it is not there on the part of your parents,"" before closing off the email with, ""I want to wish you good luck in life and have faith in the humankind."" After that I had to call her and tell her I still wanted the room while clarifying that it wasn't her my parents didn't trust, it was the other tenant, etc.

**EDIT: Updated some stuff because I discovered that what my landlord is asking of me is illegal and she has no right to say who I have as a guest or how long they can stay for. She wants to talk to me tonight. At this point I'm more interested in communication strategies and tips. How can I stay firm yet polite and make it clear that I have a right to this and it isn't personal?**

*TL;DR: Boyfriend's coming to visit this weekend, staying for two nights. Landlord's telling me he can only stay for one. That's illegal. How can I best frame my argument in a way that tells her I'm firm and sticking to my rights, while still keeping whatever peace we have left?*"

I currently am in a job that pays $38,800/year, and next year I'll have a job that pays $50-$60K. Unfortunately it is in a field I've gotten slightly tired of, and I am willing to give it a year to see how I fit in with it.

My overall emotions are as follows:
-Don't know who I am-interests, hobbies, etc.
-Life sucked out of me
-my fiancée, my friends make me happy.
-I need to be around people, but on the other hand, I shut down
-my parents relationship, dads lack of work over the last 10-15 years terrifies me
-not good guidance/mentor ship over that time.
-I stress myself out by comparing myself to others who I view as more successful than me.
-I feel I lack identity, happiness overall.
-I feel I lack skills, knowledge needed to succeed.
-My self confidence low right now.
-I don't know where I'm going, which direction

I am a Sophomore in college and I got a summer internship where after taxes I will have around 13 grand. I will spend 3 of those for equipment and investing in myself as I am going into hardcore web development. Will spend some into getting tutorials. Buying computer hardware.

What do I do? How can I invest this?

&gt;How old are you?

20 (When I make the money) in the summer. 19, right now.

&gt;Are you employed/making income? How much?

No income afterwards. But I don't need any. Parents are paying for my college and living until I am done with my education.

&gt;What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)

I can risk all of that $10,000. I don't have to worry about paying bills or anything else.

&gt;What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)

No I don't. I'm at rock bottom in terms of holdings and experience.

&gt;Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)

Nope.

&gt;What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

I don't for the next 2 years.

&gt;Any big debts?

Nope.

&gt;Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Nothing.

&gt;Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!

Asked my parents too. They invest and are pretty good at it. Here for multiple opinions."

I currently use an Ideapad Y580 as my daily driver, because when I was going in to University I thought I wanted something that had a fast processor and GPU, and I was mostly right, but it is becoming cumbersome and it is starting to wear. I don't game on my laptop much anymore, so the 6lbs of weight and the big power brick were becoming a bit unnecessary. Then my friend started an internship at an engineering firm and showed me the old T410 they assigned him, and I fell in love. No idea why. The bug bit me, though, and I had to have one. I settled on the 420s because it seemed like the best balance of price, weight, and features. I consider USB 3.0 a necessity, and would rather have something lighter, so it kind of fell into place perfectly. 

I managed to score my 420s on ebay for $100 + shipping! Granted, with no HD or OS, which is fine because I plan on putting a nice SSD in it anyways. The model I snagged has the better i5-2540M and 8gbs of ram. 

Anyone else use a 420s? Is it still a relevant machine for 2016? I'm really just using it to run light VMs and take notes on. 

Also, did I get ripped off? It seems like a good price for one, but I don't know the real going rates. "

421mz7,8,2016-01-21,Help me [20M] see this situation from a parent's perspective,parentingthrowaway5,AskParents,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskParents/comments/421mz7/help_me_20m_see_this_situation_from_a_parents/,"I spent two years after high school as a cadet at a service academy. After coming to the realization that a job in the military wasn't for me, I resigned in July 2015 before I would sign a contract which would obligate me to finish my time at the academy and serve 5 years active duty plus 3 in the reserves.

After coming home, I quickly picked up a job at a bakery to keep me occupied. Not long after, I earned a software development internship at HP. It was a paid, fulltime job at $23/hr. It was set to expire a couple weeks ago but my manager was pleased with my performance and rehired me as a contractor at $40/hr. After receiving this promotion, I began to seriously think about moving out and living on my own until I go back to school, which would be in August or September, depending on where I end up going (I submitted transfer applications to various University of California and California State University campuses).

When I told my parents of this plan, they got *very* upset. They had slightly different opinions on it.

My dad took a financial stance. He thinks it is a flat-out waste of money. The rent for the place I found would be $1740 plus $67 flat for utilities. He says I should be saving the money from my job to pay for food and other things in college (they're prepared to pay my tuition and room &amp; board), as well as have a financial cushion for the period between graduating college and finding a job.

He definitely makes a strong point, but I don't feel like he's thinking about the big picture. I live simply and don't have many wants, so there's no reason I shouldn't be able to live within my pay and have a decent amount leftover each month. I already have ~$9,000 saved from my internship. Plus there's future sources of income from whatever jobs I take up during college, especially during breaks. I'll be moving close to work and will even have the choice of taking public transit to work everyday. So it's not like I'll be pissing away 100% of my income, not even close. I understand he's concerned about my financial independence in the future but to me, it's not about dollars and cents. I want something new in my life. I want the experience of living alone. If anything, this would teach me some very valuable things about budgeting and life in general.

My mom, however, took a more emotional stance. She called my decision selfish. She said it's hurtful to them. They provide me with food and other resources to live a very comfortable life, and the fact that I want to leave that all makes me ungrateful. I assured her over and over that this is nothing personal against them. She kept asking me ""is it really that terrible to live with us?"" I gave her an honest answer and said again it's nothing against you guys but I still feel like I'm being treated like a high schooler. Every time I leave the house, they make me tell them who I'm going to hang out with and when I'll be home. I can't have friends over because they always try to be in our business. They come in my room every couple hours to ask me what's up. I realize that they love me and they're just trying to connect with me but again, this would all be fine if I was a teenager. I think that by now, they would have let up a bit.

I'm a fairly introverted person, so working with people for 8hrs a day drains my energy. When I come home, I just want to be alone and I don't get that currently. I even told my parents about it and they claimed they would let up but they haven't. And it's not like I blame them for it either, I'm their kid.

So yeah, if I could get some opinions on this from other parents, especially ones with kids my age, it would help my decision. Because right now, I just don't understand how parents could be so upset about their adult son wanting to move out. It could be that I'm the youngest of 3 and they just don't want to see their last kid go yet? I just don't know. But I've long been dreaming about the days of living on my own, and it's finally become feasible, so this means a lot to me."
421pl0,8,2016-01-21,"I [26F] broke up with my BF[27M] because I felt like I was playing second fiddle, but I'm still in love with him.",sitting_on_a_dream,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/421pl0/i_26f_broke_up_with_my_bf27m_because_i_felt_like/,"First of all, I apologize for the long wall of text. 

Background: I had been in a loving, fulfilling relationship with my boyfriend ""Brian"" for nearly 3 years. Of course we've had our share of ups and downs, but for the most part it was the best relationship I've ever been in. We rarely fought, we were supportive of the other's goals and we could be silly and goof off for hours, yet be comfortably quiet in each other's presence. That is, until the last few months.


Throughout our relationship Brian has had a female best friend. I have no problems with opposite gender friends as I have a few of my own, but there were always little signs, hints or moments where I felt like she was a little bit more. This became evident after Brian and I had to do long distance for 7 months while I worked abroad for an internship. The whole time I heard how much time they spent together, how flirty they were with each other and it came to light that their relationship wasn't always completely platonic. Brian used to have a huge crush on her for over a year, even into the beginning of our own relationship. Needless to say, we had a few fights when I got back but managed to worked things out. A few months later, I accidentally read some texts between the two that were more than flirty in nature, and more along the lines of ""I love you, I miss you, I was thinking about you last night ;)"" and ""You're my number one priority"" etc. Even then, I did not break it off with him. Instead I tried to get him to help me work on our relationship together, while I started going to counselling for my insecurities and jealousy issues. I asked him to make the effort for the two of us to get to know each other so that I could be less jealous and more understanding of their relationship dynamic if everything really was as he said - that he wasn't interested in her at all. Needless to say, he did not make the effort and spiraled more and more into depression. Brian has a lot of things going on in his life that cause him stress, such as his job situation, roommate situation, not going to school and lack of money. I tried my best to be supportive, but I think he also started comparing our two situations;  I have a university degree, I followed my dream of working abroad, I now have a great job that I love in an economy that is filled with layoffs and unemployment. 




I broke things off with Brian because I could see how my attempts to work on our relationship were causing him more stress. He seemed miserable all the time, especially when we hung out. We stopped being able to communicate effectively, we started having issues arise where none were previously.  I started to get depressed because I felt like there was nothing I could do anymore to make him happy. He agreed that he found it difficult to work on making me happy when he couldn't even make himself happy and that he probably needed the space to figure out his life. It was hard, we both still love each other, but I thought this was the best solution for both of us. The past two weeks post breakup were incredibly hard for me, I felt like I lost one of my best friends and I missed the closeness and comfort of having someone to hold at night and love. 




Apparently, it has not been the same for him. According to others, he seems much happier and makes less snide comments when hanging around other people. He has been spending all of his time with the other girl even to the point where other people are suspicious of their relationship. I've heard from someone in their friend circle that its obvious how he gives her priority treatment and there is an element of closeness and sexual tension between them. The female friend herself was even heard saying how she feels like ""she is Brian's Pipe dream/dream girl"". I once asked Brian why he and his friend never got together and his was response was ""we were never single at the same time"". Well, now they both are and it seems pretty apparent to me that this was the conclusion I so desperately tried to ignore. 




I know I should have followed Reddit's advice to break-up several months ago, but I really just wanted everyone (including my own gut feeling) to be wrong. I kept making excuses for his behavior and minimized my own feelings for so long that it just became part of our relationship. Now I'm just so hurt, angry and confused that I don't know what to do anymore. I go through each day in a daze that I don't know how to get out of. I know I have no one to blame but myself, but knowing that doesn't help me get over the way I feel. How do you get over trusting and loving someone for so long and then have your worst fears so easily confirmed? Am I overreacting to the whole situation? How can I stop loving him and move on with my life? It doesn't help that our friend groups are somewhat merged, so we get invited to the same birthday parties. I've tried to avoid what I can but I can't miss my own close friend's celebrations. This also makes it difficult to bring up how I feel to certain friends because of how involved they are. 



---   
**tl;dr**: I felt like I was playing second fiddle in my own relationship. Broke up, found out it was kind of true. Don't know how to deal with my emotions or where to go from here. Worried I might be overreacting and making it more difficult for myself. "

She's finally (Age)..... your mother says beneath a moan as she pinches her nipples watching her husband..your daddy shove his thick cock deep into the new intern from his office, he grabs a handful of her hair, pulling her hair and head back...her mouth gapes as her tight little cunt inhales his massive cock thrusts in and out of her...  


I'd love to do a rp where your mother likes watching your father fuck younger, hotter, sexier women...especially young things half his age...the ultimate prize she mentions would be his baby girl on her bday....  You would play the daughter, mother or both..

421una,0,2016-01-21,Was told to be more aggressive at work-- now I could lose my job for being too aggressive,OfficeTroublemaker,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/421una/was_told_to_be_more_aggressive_at_work_now_i/,"Hi 2x!

I am young (22) woman working in the tech industry. I worked my way up from lowly intern to a leadership role in marketing in less than 2 years with no prior industry experience and no degree. This is partly because I am dedicated as hell and work 16+ hours per day, and also because many of my superiors left the company and were not replaced, so I assumed their tasks (with little to no pay increase) I'm generally considered friendly and creative, and always good to ask a favor of or bounce ideas off of. 

I love my job. It is very fun and fulfilling and the income has changed my life. Prior to this job, I was nearly homeless and tensions were high between my family and I. My SO and I were barely making it, renting a disgusting and small bedroom for $500/month and going to community college on federal aid while skimping on food to make ends meet and balancing any min wage jobs we could find.

Now I have my own small apartment that I adore. My car broke down and I actually paid to have it fixed!! We occasionally can go to a restaurant that isn't Denny's?! I got to buy Christmas presents for my SO and family!! I help my little brother pay for driving expenses, and I help my sick mom with her bills here and there, and I even supported my SO while he went through a low-stress semester of college. Life is great!!

BUT

When my last boss stepped down, leaving me the only person left to run the team, I knew exactly where to step in to fill in the gaps and keep the company going. I had been pretty well-trained in the months prior. Upper management immediately showed concern that I was ""not aggressive enough"" and (from what I now know) started looking for someone to replace him almost immediately by reaching out to staff members who had left the same role months or years ago, rather than offering me the job.

It was briefly in discussion for another leader within the company to step forward and assume the role, then abandoned because this person is extremely volatile and difficult to work with and my boss urged them not to let this person take the reigns. As soon as this person realized I was filling in for the interim, they started openly badmouthing me to their team because I am ""too young"" and ""not aggressive enough"". Then this person started dragging me into subversive one on one meetings under the guise of ""learning the trade"" or ""teamwork"" to give me orders... and then insult my career and strategy when I didn't immediately comply or used data to show why it was not a smart move. After 2 weeks of mind-numbing hostility and intrusion coming from this person, I confided in some close coworkers what was happening and they in turn took it straight to upper management as a concern for my welfare, in the hopes that it would prevent our hostile coworker from continuing to move up in the company / be considered for management roles.

In the world's most wonderful backfire, upper management had a meeting with me and accused me of stepping on toes. I did my best to diplomatically explain that maybe there was a misunderstanding of my role or tasks and that's why this person and I were seemingly attempting to do the same job, despite their title being very unrelated and them having no prior training or time spent on my team. So their response-- which was really not the one that made any sense, was to create a chart showing who was who's boss. It showed the bully equal to me, but in separate categories. Which was... honestly not at all the problem. I didn't need to know who to report to-- I needed to know which tasks to do and why I was being attacked for doing the ones outlined to me by my prior boss and that I had been handling as part of my job for months. The bully was given a token penalty for being aggressive (probation), I got a small raise and title change, they got a much larger raise and title change.

Fast forward a month later: Management has brought in a replacement for me / my boss. It is a previous worker who left the company and has, in their words ""more experience"". In fact, she has 6 months more experience than me, and the last time she was in her role, she was notorious for being a very awful boss. When the decision to bring her back was voiced to me, I immediately objected on the grounds that her business practices are unsustainable and awful. Which, shocker, is STILL true. Apparently this was actually **TOO aggressive** and management labeled me as stubborn and unwilling to accept change in the company and being powerhungry. None of which are true~! I had a great working relationship with all 4 of my past bosses-- this returning one included. I just see that her practices were awful now that I have the training to recognize it.

And for the final kicker: The returning boss and bully have hit it off and are great pals, because returning boss makes bully feel threatened, so bully sucks up and boss pats them on the head and makes them feel very important. Upper management let gossip slip that I am a stubborn troublemaker and difficult to work with, but everyone in the company short of bully actually loves working with me, including returning boss. 

I have been getting silent treatment from management since boss's return, and I am no longer invited to major strategic meetings nor management one on ones. I am still performing many of the tasks my ex-boss did, but all credit goes to new boss. 

I feel as though my days here are numbered, and despite applying for dozens of jobs, my prospects are very limited because I've been out of college long enough to not qualify for internships, can't afford to go back to college, don't have a lot of industry experience, and never got a degree. Any words of advice? Is there a way to regain favor with my bosses? This is doubtful as they play favorites with the leading women of the company.


**TL;DR
Was in shaky position to get a job for not being aggressive, was harassed by an important company leader because I seemed like an easy target, then put under scrutiny by management. Tried to be assertive when they made a terrible choice and pissed them off, so am getting silent treatment for being too aggressive. No idea how to proceed.**"

422db0,0,2016-01-21,"Software developers/engineers, what's the market like for new grads?",Socomstar,Denver,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/422db0/software_developersengineers_whats_the_market/,"I'm going to graduate next year and Denver is on the top of my list. 

**Experience:**

I go to a large state school in the northeast and I major in Computer Engineering. My degree and experience is focused towards software. My GPA is 3.78.

I will have 3 software engineering internships by the time I graduate, plus 2 years prior experience in software project management (I started going back to school when I was 25). 

Side work/projects includes running a small startup that made a little money with a couple large clients and then failed due to crucial team members moving on to new interests, running a local tech oriented entrepreneurship conference in my area with over 100 attendees (also built out the website/registration/scheduler app for the event), and a couple other small things. 

My experience lies in Java/Spring, AngularJS/GulpJS/JavaScript, ASP.NET Web API/C#, some C++ for academic purposes, and a little bit of Ruby on Rails/Cucumber testing.

**I was wondering** what the opportunities in Denver would be like for someone like me. I've seen the salary range on glassdoor but it's a pretty large spread. What should someone with my experience level expect? Also, how do you all feel about the cost of living to salary ratio of the area? Are companies in the area generally open to applicants looking to relocate?

I work at a big firm for 1 year now. I was assigned 2 new interns to take under my wing for the first month of their employment, answer all their questions, guide them through the work, etc...  So they after 1 month they in theory should be independent.



They started 2 weeks ago, and on the first day I took them both out to lunch. They started drilling me on all sorts of questions about manager personalities, who is hard to work for, lying about time per project, eating time, shifting time, etc... All sorts of things I could answer, but I gave super vague answers to because I didn't know if I could trust them. Last thing I needed was one of them saying I said a manager was messy and demanding. 


Fast forward and I've been helping them both out for 8+ hours a day, but mostly the female one (one male one female). We shoot the shit a lot when I'm helping her and talk about our lives, hobbies, etc...  The other guy eh not so much. He pretty much gets it, doesn't ask questions and doesn't initiate any sort of ""how was your weekend"" or anything.



Well 2 days ago I saw the female intern got back a ton of changes from a manager. So I said hey lets get some lunch. So we did and I told her don't worry about the changes everyone gets them, but no one will admit to it and its okay to make mistakes. That how I was sure I was never going to get an offer and when I did I felt like my 90 days was going to be my last day. That its normal to feel stupid, because there is such a high learning curve and the managers forget what it was like to be in this spot. And that I would help her the best I could. Then I started answering some of those questions she had that I didn't feel comfortable answering before. But she pretty much had figured it all out anyway. So we ate, talked some more about life and that was it.



Ever since then its been weird as fuck. Barely asks me questions anymore and when I do go to her, its strictly business. 


I'm not sure whats going on here. I assume she thinks I'm hitting on her or something. But I know she has a BF and I have 0 desire in her. I mean we even joke about how this one dude at the work is already obsessed with her and how she is dreading when he comes back from vacation. 


Am I giving her more attention than the dude? Ya. I mean I feel more bad for her because he seems to get it more. I have no doubt in my mind she will sink if no one helps her. I sank and the only reason I'm employed is because a manager dove down and taught me. Is it weird I didn't ask the dude to lunch too? Idk I still don't feel like I can 100% trust the guy with answers that are walking a fine line on the rules. 


What's the best course of action here? I still have to teach both of them. Should I try focusing more on him? Act 100% the same? Pull back? I mean call me crazy, but I'm finding it hard to answer these limited questions from her anymore when its like ""tell me the answer then GTFO"". And that's kinda why I don't help the guy as much as I could either. Its weird to go over, answer questions and then told to leave like I'm some sort of calling boy. Everyone else I work with its like how it should be we help eachother out and then we shoot the shit about sports, girls, family, etc...  Then repeat 2 hours later. 
   
**tl;dr**: I think I creeped out intern I'm suppose to be teaching."

*First a little background about me*: I'm Caucasian, 5'9'' , 168 lbs, 26 y/o, lifting for the last 7 months. Last couple of years I started focusing on my career, I worked in a hotel as a intern manager in my hometown and continued doing the same but now all over the world.  I'm successful with women but they are not my main concern atm.
I've been in 2 countries so far and now am doing my last 6 months of internship in China in **5** star hotel. 
My office is located in Front Office behind reception desk and as in most of the hotels, staff at reception and FO is 90% female. I am one out of two man working there. And if some of you don't know, Chinese girls are crazy about foreigners, especially if you are white and I'm pretty white (I am Anemic but slowly but surely fixing it)
My job is basically to learn everything about hotel and its functions so I spend a lot of time with other managers and sometimes helping other departments if it's really busy. I love doing room inspections and guest relation and collecting guest complaints and similar work.
Lately because of New Year and upcoming Chinese New Year hotel occupancy is pretty low as most of Chinese guests go back home to spend time with family and honor the tradition so I didn't have much to do. Everything I was suppose to do I did it in less then 3-4 hours. Still I had 4 more hours left so most of that time I would spend reading some e-books in my office  or starting a conversation with staff ( Concierge, Reception, Bellboys etc.) so they can  improve their English or at least learn some basics and of course for me to learn some Chinese.

Everything was  fine until recently, we got new director.
He seamed 'ok"" at first even thou we didn't have much contact, even now it seams to me like he is avoiding me. His office is right next to mine and I keep my door open all the time so when ever he passes he can see me doing whatever I was doing.
Few days ago I was told I would be doing cross training at F&amp;B department or more precisely our main restaurant. I was told I would have to observe staff and help with foreigner guests as 99% of staff at this hotel doesn't speak or understand English.
Next morning I went a little early there so I can observer how they do their stuff. Oh boy what happened next is hilarious. I had new uniform. I had to replace my suit and tie for cook's uniform. Apparently I was suppose to help real cooks in breakfast time by flipping eggs and making omelette (with chopsticks... ) live in front of guests and after breakfast was done I will have to change back and head back to my real work.

**Wait, what?!**

I spoke with **Assistant Manager**, he didn't know anything . Talked with **HR**, nope nothing. Spoke with **GM** directly and he said it's only temporarily and I don't really have to do anything just show-face and let the other cooks do the work and maybe try to learn something and actually do something. 
Wait, you want me a guy who is intern manager without any skills in cooking what so ever to go there and make food for guests in front of them and then after he's done , change back and head to lobby and interact with guests?!? 
After this all managers started avoiding me, I talked with **F&amp;B** manager and he told me we can talk after one week because atm we have VIP guest (American, hotel partner) and he doesn't want him to know or make a scene or something like that (didn't really understand his chinglish).
Well okay...
Today was my first day as **a cook and a manager**.
Breakfast time, stood there and tried not to get in the way of real cooks. Saw some smiles from guests who knew me from before, smiled back. Breakfast finished, head back and switched uniforms, stood in lobby helped few guests with rooms issues, saw few guests from Breakfast time, they looked at me, smiled, smiled back.
Went back to my office and talked with a girl from reception.
**What she told me blew my mind**. Apparently new director thinks am not working enough and that I have a lot of free time during work hours and that it was his idea for me to be a ""cook"". She also told that she thinks he is **jealous** of me because **all girls** at FO and Reception are **crazy** about **me**. Another girl from FO overheard that  so she enters my office and **confirms it**.
**Now, I know exactly what am going to do but I might not be thinking straight right now so I want to hear your opinion on this.**
**Sidenote**: *I'm still and intern and I have two months left until I get my cover letter. Of course it might be cover letter for ""cook"" as the person who is suppose to write that letter is my new director*

Edit 1:*I'm an intern and I don't get monthly salary, I actually spend money on rent, food and travel expenses*.

Edit 2:*I have aesthetic physique. I am working on my body since high school. Never really been a fan of gym, powerlifting or body building until recently, when I moved to China where you can't go out without protective mask because of  air pollution* .

*That's when I changed my mind and started lifting, almost 7 months ago.*"
4251ja,29,2016-01-22,"Opie &amp; Anthony: The Satellite Years Overview. [audio-supported, beginner's guide, or for all fans]",braunheiser,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/4251ja/opie_anthony_the_satellite_years_overview/,"**2004** 

In August, 2004, at the time the Infinity contract expired, the pair signed with XM Satellite Radio and started broadcasting their show again on October 4th of the same year. Jim Norton, Steve C, and Ben Sparks continued working with O&amp;A at XM, and it was there that E-Rock was first brought on as a producer. Also, several interns (Than, Danny, Travis, Derek, and later Sam) impressed O&amp;A so much that they became full-time members of the show staff.

At first, the duo were only available on a premium channel because of XM's initial concern at hiring the controversial pair, but listener ship was high enough that in April, 2005 the show was allowed to be a part of the regular subscription service. On XM Satellite Radio, O&amp;A were no longer bound by FCC regulations regarding language and content; thus, O&amp;A were able to get away with a lot more than they could on terrestrial radio.

**2005**

Although O&amp;A matured a bit since their 'NEW days, they still managed to generate controversy. One show, commonly referred to as the ""show we can't talk about"", nearly got them fired mere weeks after starting on XM. Their Assault on the Media competition, where O&amp;A fans (nicknamed the Pests) were asked to disrupt live news broadcasts, led to a news reporter getting injured. An altercation Opie had with an intern named Noah also got them in trouble. Still, the show began to rebuild its audience, and eventually their former company, Infinity (now known as CBS Radio), was looking to bring them back.

**2006**

In 2006, Howard Stern abandoned terrestrial radio in order to broadcast his show on XM competitor Sirius. This left a void that needed to be filled at the stations Howard used to broadcast from. Some of these stations replaced Howard with David Lee Roth, a move that proved to be a disaster ratings-wise. CBS Radio had to do something, so they brought back O&amp;A to try to save their company. As of April 26, 2006, O&amp;A were officially back on terrestrial radio. In a deal with both CBS and XM, the show was now airing nationwide on both formats from 6-9 AM ET, and then exclusively on XM from 9 AM-12 PM ET. O&amp;A have said that this is the deal Howard should have made.

**2007**

In 2007, XM and Sirius announced that they were planning a merger of both companies. At the time, there was much speculation on what would happen to The Opie and Anthony Show. Their former boss Mel Karmazin became the CEO of Sirius and was expected to take over the reins of the combined company. Since Howard was still broadcasting his show on the platform, and his friendship with Mel was still intact, it was believed that O&amp;A would not have a place at the merged company, or would be silenced like they were during the WNEW days. In May of that year, the duo ended up getting suspended from XM for 30 days because of comments made by a guest named Homeless Charlie. It was believed that fears over those comments affecting the merger led to this action, as O&amp;A have done (and said) much worse without incident. Following the suspension, Pests began dropping their XM subscriptions in droves and smashing their radios. When O&amp;A returned to XM in June, they credited the Pests with helping them keep their jobs.

Despite the victory, O&amp;A and the Pests were not confident of the show's future.

**2008**:

The merger eventually became finalized in 2008 (with the combined company now known as Sirius XM), and O&amp;A's biggest supporter at XM, Eric Logan, left the company. O&amp;A's XM contract was set to expire at the end of September of that year, but fortunately it was renewed, and as of September 30, their show became available on Sirius, on channel Sirius 197. As of April, 2009, O&amp;A began broadcasting from Sirius' studios in New York. Though still treated like redheaded stepchildren (what else is new?), their future at Sirius XM remained secure. Their situation on terrestrial radio, however, was not so fortunate. Because of constant fears over controversial content, the terrestrial portion of their show was often hampered by ridiculous censorship by their bosses. O&amp;A also dealt with being dropped by key terrestrial affiliates.

**2009**

March 2009, their flagship station K-Rock went through a format change, dropping O&amp;A in the process and thereby taking them off any remaining affiliates. While O&amp;A no longer have to worry about censorship to an extent, it is a blow to not have the exposure that free terrestrial radio provides as opposed to a pay service like Sirius XM.

Recently, the fate of O&amp;A was up in the air. Contract negotiations with Sirius XM hit a setback - with O&amp;A's contract expiring at the beginning of October, 2010 O&amp;A still hadn't come close to a deal as time was running out. Eventually they both managed to sign a two-year contract, even though they have said they are not happy with it (Opie actually didn't sign until the morning of October 1). Also, O&amp;A lost longtime producer Steve C, whose position was eliminated by the company.

425gus,27,2016-01-22,Girlfriend[F22] puts new friends first and ignores me[M24],NotMrSpicolisTime,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/425gus/girlfriendf22_puts_new_friends_first_and_ignores/,"**Incoming: Wall of Text** 

I'm coming here asking for help because honestly I'm lost, I feel like shit, and I need help/advice/anything really. It's too early here for anyone else to be awake to talk to, and I feel like every minute that goes by makes me feel worse. 

I've been with my girlfriend, ""Ana"", for just over 2 years. For about 20 of these 25 months, we've always been in contact with each other; we talk every day and we always say goodnight to each other when we go to sleep (don't live together). This amount of communication was at her request after she told me she didn't feel like I cared as much as she did, so we agreed to bump up the amount of talking with each other- she'll text me good morning when she wakes up, we'll talk throughout the day, then we'll call/text goodnight/let the other know we made it home safe. I'm ok with this, in fact I've grown to really appreciate how much we talk, and I've kept up my end flawlessly. But lately (and during some occasions before) she hasn't. 

Ana has been interning this week at an important national convention this week in her future industry that happened to be in our city this year. She told me a few days before it started that she wouldn't be able to have conversations with me throughout the day like we normally do, which I understood- it's hard to talk or text when you're not allowed to be on your phone because you're a lowly intern kept busy and have to keep up appearances- and that her days would be from 0600 to 1700-1800 in the evening. So they were working her hard, and I was excited for her because it was a great chance for her to get to network and see what that life is about as well as see a couple B &amp; C list celebrities. So I knew I wouldn't be able to talk to her until she was dismissed/went home, and I was fine with that. Relevant: this conference ended early in the afternoon yesterday (Thursday) and they were dismissed at 4, which I know because there's a public schedule online and she told me. However, I feel like I've been completely ignored this entire time for reasons I'll explain. 

Sending a text saying ""hi, just wanted to let you know how things were going"" or replying to ""hi, hope everything is going well"" or ""how has your day been?"" takes all of a minute, correct? Yes, because even on my busy days I still find time in a minute or so of downtime to talk/respond to her. I received no such consideration from her. Sunday, when I got back in town, I sent her a message letting her know I was coming home and I missed her. We spoke for a bit after she was dismissed and decided I'd spend the night at her's since she'd also have to wake up early anyway. We did this and all was well. She tells me she's making new friends over there and is really enjoying it. Great news. 

**Monday** rolls around and the problems start. I give her a shoot about mid-morning hoping she has a good day and learns a lot; it goes unanswered as expected until she gets home, at which point she briefly tells me how her morning started, and then says she's gotta pack a bag and go to sleep early (9pm) because Tuesday call time is earlier, and she's packing a bag to stay overnight in the hotel room 2 other interns were assigned to (many were from other cities). She told me they're 2 other females, and so far I have no reason not to believe her. It's almost 7pm, and that's the last I hear from her. 

**Tuesday** comes, she texts me in the morning that I'm welcome to stop by her place and spend time with our cat since she hasn't lately. I also text her around midday asking how she is because I figured she could reply quickly whenever she got her lunch break; she didn't. She tells me she's done for the day at 4pm, and that she's going to a scheduled VIP party with her new friends that night; it lasts from 6-8pm per the schedule. That's the last I hear from her that day; i find out later that she and the roommates went back to the room immediately, went to the party an hour late (7pm), stayed until 7:45, then ""went searching to see if the hotel had a hot tub."" Said they gave up at 8:30 and went back to the room. She didn't go to sleep until at least 11 (per the text timestamp) but tells me she went to sleep ""probably around 10."" 

**Wednesday** comes, I wake up to a text from late Tuesday night saying ""just checking in, party's over."" She actually does talk to me a bit during her lunch break that day, tells me some cool things they're doing. Of course, in completely lost because I've been in the dark this whole time. I tell her I'd really like to talk to her after she's done working so she can tell me about all the stuff she's been doing and so I can actually hear her voice and have a conversation. She finally called me an hour after she said she would, and she tells me the timeline of the past few days, and that she's sorry she had literally no time to text me (right after saying that she just called her mom and has been keeping in touch with her throughout the days). She senses I'm upset, asks what's wrong, and I start to explain that I've been feeling neglected and that it's kinda ridiculous that she can apparently keep her mom updated no problem, but can't find 1 minute in the day to say ""hey things are going great"" and that she's had plenty of time after work/events each day to be able to talk to me, yet she hasn't. She's had literally *hours* of personal time each day after working, enough time to post to Facebook, send snapchats to everyone else, be ""so tired from boredom"" (her words"", keep in touch with her mom daily, and go to parties &amp; hang out with her new friends- friends who, of course, can be seen in the background of her posts texting on their phones. This is *after* she told me that she didn't want to text me when she was with them and couldn't call me from the hotel room because they were there and she wanted to spend that time with them. That fucking hurt. I was already uneasy from the lack of communication, but that made it even worse. *Of course*, she gets mad at me for daring to say that I'm upset about all this, then tells me she's going back to the room and hangs up on me. 

About an hour later she says she doesn't want to talk to me because she doesn't want to be in a negative state of mind, and doesn't want to feel guilty over something she had no control over (*uh, what?*). I say she has plenty of personal time to keep in touch with me and that I heard more from her during her final exams, during which she *actually* had no personal time from studying so much. She says this is more stressful, and she's currently waiting on food delivery to eat and be with her new friends. Yeah, eating with friends is super fucking stressful... She says that if I were with friends, she'd leave me alone, even though we both know that's a blatant lie and I tell her that; I always text/respond and call even when I'm with friends- she doesn't, and I didn't realize this until now. She agrees and basically tells me ""ok but this is different, I don't wanna waste time here."" Radio silence until the next day. 

**Thursday.** I get snapchats from her periodically, which is nice, until I realize that I only got them because she sent them to everyone. So Thursday she didn't speak all day until she told me they got dismissed at 4, and that she'd be staying late and going out with her friends. That's the last I've heard from her. This was the last day of the internship; she has nothing else to be doing now. 

I've now gone almost 6 days playing second fiddle to her in favor of literally everyone else she knows. Honestly, I feel cornered because, if she actually does talk to me today, I don't know if I'll want to talk. Frankly, I don't even know if I want to be with her anymore. She's put the rest of the world ahead of me this week, and I'm getting the feeling that she's either lying to me about who she's been with and what she's been doing, or (more likely) just doesn't care that much anymore. 


Some bullet points to clarify my position: 

-her account of events at night doesn't add up, chronologically or logistically 

-she's unable to talk to me or text me ANYWHERE in the hotel, even in the room. Is it embarrassing to talk to me in front of your ""new friends""? Is there someone there you don't want to know about me? 

-she's able to text her mom all day/anytime and call HER with no problem, but not me 

-no mention of roommates: gender, how many, who's where, etc until right before she slept over 

-it's more stressful than finals? I guess that's why she's having a great time with her new friends having dinner in their hotel room 

-she's placing getting to know people she'll never see again over a few minutes of talking with me. I'm glad all the 'nonstop fun &amp; conversation' she was having with her new friends was more important than acknowledging my existence (I only saw her in her snapchats. I saw no one near her and others around her were on their phones texting. Because somehow, *her texting me* is SO FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE that she dares not do it around others. Makes me feel great.) 

-I'm able to text and even talk on the phone with her even when I'm with my friends. I was texting her during the one hour I had all year to see my friend who's stationed in Alaska and was visiting. I respond to her when I'm with friends. I've left friends to go home when she's been mad at me because I end up feeling like shit. I even left a friend early once after a huge argument between us just to try to make her feel better even though we both knew she was wrong and completely at fault for that argument. But even when she's with friends/others, she doesn't even respond half the time to me unless that person/people make her upset and she starts ~~venting~~ bitching to me while with them. 




**tl;dr** My girlfriend has been purposely choosing to give all of her free time to the world and none to me, and makes no effort to do so even though I always have. She's ignored me in favor of people she's only known for 5 days and doesn't understand why I'm upset. 


**Addendum:** I don't want to hear excuses for her saying she must just be stressed out. She's been having a blast and has made plenty of time for everyone else over me. If you love someone, you FIND time for them, even if it's brief. An no, I'm not controlling or always asking her where she is/what she's doing. I give her more time &amp; opportunities to be with her friends than she does to me, and usually she chooses to be with me or at least see me before or after her friends. All I ask is that when we're doing things apart we keep in touch with each other (which was her suggestion over a year ago); I've kept my end, she rarely keeps hers. 

I'll try my best to answer any questions/fill in details on request. I'm on mobile with shitty signal and on a less-than-stellar Reddit app, apologies if I don't get to every message or respond late. If you made it this far, and if you comment your thoughts, thank you for giving me some of your time. I apologize also for any mistakes/lack of clarity. I tried to be as detailed as possible so there wouldn't have to be any edits to confuse people. 


**Edit:** she just texted me that she's now going home, and she had stayed the night again because they were out so late. News to me since there was no mention of staying *yet another nigh*. In fact, I wonder how she's stayed that many nights if she supposedly only brought clothes for 1 day originally and hasn't been home since Monday. Ugh, everything that happens makes me feel worse than before. 

**Edit 2:** I ask all of you who are saying that I need to just let her be to take a moment and reverse the genders in this scenario; it's an issue we see come up frequently in this sub, and when made by a female, the consensus is usually to find a better man who values you and your time and puts effort into the relationship. Now I ask why I am being told to do the exact opposite. Is that not hypocritical? Is that not a double standard? That is what I am most upset about, that I cannot be treated equally to a woman here given the same scenario. "
425vuh,154,2016-01-22,"I ""broke"" my Nstepmom's heart with a picture. [Rant/Vent]",daughterofNparents,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/425vuh/i_broke_my_nstepmoms_heart_with_a_picture_rantvent/,"I've been lurking on this sub for months, but finally decided to post partially as a way for me to keep track of things that happen so I won't forget later on. This is my first reddit post ever, so please bear with me.

My parents separated when I was 11, and the resulting custody battle was nothing short of horrific. There were times that I hated staying with my Ndad (no food in the house, he was always sleeping or at work), and there were other times that I liked his house since there was very little supervision so I could basically do whatever I wanted. Not that I ever did anything bad, mostly because I have always been kind of obsessed with being ""good."" For a long time I wanted to work for the FBI so I did not drink, do drugs, or anything else illegal or seriously immoral.

As the custody battle got worse my dad started to involve me more in discussions about it. I was 14 at the time and he decided I was ""old enough to decide for [myself]."" Around this time he also invited a woman he met online to come live with us. The first time I ever met my stepmom was when she moved into our house. I was upset but dealt with it quietly.

My dad started telling me about all these horrible things my mom was doing or saying in the custody battle. He told me that she was spying on me and using anything I said about what happened at his house against him. He said she wanted to take my little brother and I away from him so that he would have to pay more child support to her.

He, stepmom, and my Nstepsister started having me write letters to my mom, threatening to cut her and her family out of my life unless she ""dropped the lawsuit"" (which doesn't even make sense, since my dad filed the lawsuit to begin with). I was devastated that my mom didn't care about me anymore other than to use me to get more money out of my dad, so per my dad and stepmom's urging I started refusing to go to her house. They even made me download files from her computer to bring to them to use in the lawsuit (although they couldn't actually legally use them).

Dad and stepmom would fly into complete rages at the slightest provocation, so every decision I made from when I was 13-18 was to avoid letting their anger fall on me. But they always need to be fighting someone in their lives and I was often their target. There are so many instances I could point to, but I'll talk about what happened two days ago.

I finally started to repair my relationship with my mom a couple years ago after I discovered that basically everything my dad and stepmom had been saying about her for the previous four years were lies. I couldn't let my dad and stepmom know that I was in contact with her again because I knew it would anger them even though they have said before that ""it's ok if [I] want a relationship with her again."" Yeah, right.

I was about to go to a meeting for one of the clubs I run at my university when I started to get a string of texts from my dad (which always indicates he in angry). Apparently my stepgrandma had seen a picture of me with my mom from October on Facebook and had reported it to my dad and stepmom (who then flew into a rage). He told me he was taking away my car (and therefore my only transportation to get to school the next day) and that he was rescinding his offer to help get me an internship for the summer (even though I didn't want his help and I have already had it covered; my school is paying for me to do research abroad!). When I got home later that night, stepmom found me in the kitchen and started going into hysterics. Apparently I ""broke [her] heart"" by being in that picture with my mom and that the picture was all apart of an elaborate campaign to make her and my dad look bad. She said that I was being a horrible person for talking to my mom because she ""stole"" my dad away from his first wife and child (nope, dad was just a cheater, isn't that his fault?), and that she wondered how my half-brother would feel to see me with my mom again (brother wouldn't care and he's NC with dad and stepmom anyway). Then she started crying more hysterically as it became obvious that I really didn't care about what she was saying at all and wasn't acknowledging her. Cue more ranting before she choked out a final ""You broke my heart!"" before dramatically leaving the room.

All I did was take a picture with my mom. God I hate them.

TL,DR: Crazy Ndad and Nstepmom fly into a hysterical rage when they find a picture of me and my mom on social media. Crazy Nstepmom considers herself my real mom. I hate them both."
425xh5,93,2016-01-22,Me [21 F] with my boyfriend of 2.5 years [23 M] gave me an ultimatum regarding a job offer,ultimatumthrowaway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/425xh5/me_21_f_with_my_boyfriend_of_25_years_23_m_gave/,"Hello reddit. I am in need of some advice over a conflict with my boyfriend that is causing me to make a major life decision. There are a lot of factors and I hope this isn't too confusing or long. 

Boyfriend and I have been dating for about 2.5 years now. We met my freshman year of college and he has been my best friend and boyfriend since then. He is my main support system and I can't imagine my life without him. Like any couple, we have had ups and downs but we are currently at a great spot and moving forward in our relationship, or so I thought.


The main issue I am having is that a few days ago he gave me an ultimatum regarding me considering taking an internship across the country. Some background: We are both engineering students, so obviously we both care about our career, otherwise we wouldn't have picked such an intensive program. He just graduated and currently has a job working full time making GREAT money. He loves his job and does not plan to leave anytime soon. He still lives in my college town. An important detail, this summer he considered applying to a graduate program that would cause us to be long distance for the next four years or so. I told him I supported him either way, would rather him close by, but to not make any decision based on me. I said that I planned to continue our relationship even if he left. I told him it had to be for other reasons because I did NOT want him to use it against me or resent me in the future. 


The problem arouse a few days ago, when we were talking about me seeking my last college internship before graduation. I had interviewed already with a company (he knew this but hadn't said anything about it) and I am waiting for a response. The conversation came up about how if I accept this job I will move across the country for 3 months and we will be long distance. This situation isn't new to us because last summer I also worked across the country for another company. We saw each other 3 days per month on visits. We did long distance, we both agreed it sucked, and that we would rather not do it again. 


Not long after it got brought up, he gave me an ultimatum, either stay in college town this summer or we break up. Meaning, I have to turn down this job offer and stay in college town, hoping I can find a job, or he is leaving me. He says his reasons are for not wanting to do long distance again and wanting me here for us to move in together (moving in together this summer is previously planned). He brought up how his main reason for giving up his grad program was to be here with me, which I think is unfair to use against me. 


This makes me feel like he doesn't support me and that as soon as it gets tough in the future he is going to leave. It makes me mad that I have to give up career opportunities because he doesn't want long distance for 3 months. I am not sure if I am being selfish here but I don't think I need to give up this opportunity. I plan on living here after college and finding a job in this town, even though none of these engineering companies are that exciting to me. I am giving up my prime living location after college for him and his job, but he won't do long distance for 3 months. I have no issue with living here after college, because it is what is best for us as a couple, and I have no big reason against staying here. I feel this says a lot about our relationship.  His side is that I should be willing to give up a 3 month job to stay here. He told me I didn't even need to get a job because he will support me and provide me with money over the summer, but I do not want him supporting me. He thinks my resume is impressive enough without another internship but I disagree. 


We get nowhere when we discuss this and it is starting to kill me. I feel like being in this relationship is going to be a huge deciding factor in my future. I really love our relationship and if I didn't think we had a future together, then I would just take the job and tell him to leave, but I really see this working out long term. I have never met someone so similar to me. We are such a great fit and he is everything I've wanted. We are supposed to be moving in together in May, but I don't know how I feel knowing he won't support me. I know he doesn't want me to leave because he wants to spend time together and not move into our place and me not be there for 3 months. I feel like he is coming from a good place but it comes off to me as unsupportive and controlling. I really really love this person, Reddit, and I don't want to give up him or an internship opportunity. 

To make matters worse, my dream company is phone interviewing me in a hour and if I get offered that job, I am not sure I can turn it down. 
   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend gave me an ultimatum. Stay home or get a job near home for the summer or we break up over having to do long distance. "
4260uu,5,2016-01-22,"M22 and M26 relationship crumbles, with so many questions left over",misnomer1,askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/4260uu/m22_and_m26_relationship_crumbles_with_so_many/,"I have really enjoyed seeing the advice you guys give, and now in my time of need, I am seeking a bit of advice or comfort of my own.  
  
I currently live in DC for an internship. I've been here since mid-November. Before I left, a guy in my group therapy back home said he was from DC and could put me in contact with someone who lives here that could show me around and introduce me to the city - totally platonic.  
When that meeting finally did happen, it ended up lasting all day: we shared a meal and drinks, and I was invited to a Friendsgiving and I put my arm around him and kissed him. It was wonderful.  
We kept spending time time together, making meals, going out to dinner, hanging out at home, and even spending the night at each other's house.  
Sex happened on a very drunk evening (not my ideal way to first do it, but it happened...) and both of us felt very sexually compatible.  
  
I could begin to see that expressing emotions was very difficult for him. He would hold my hand, hold me in bed, kiss me, but to verbally express how he was feeling was so difficult - and I understood and wanted to be there for him to make it a bit easier.  
We took a trip to a nearby city and stayed overnight in an Air BNB - one of those mini-relationship tests, and there was a fight over a comment that was made that made me feel uncomfortable. It seemed that he was unable to see it from my perspective, making the conversation very difficult to have. We were eventually able to smooth it over by agreeing to disagree.  
A few more fights happened - essentially issues of what is being said vs body language, and how those sometimes run contrary. Not atypical in a new relationship, it's uncharted waters, a new person, new chemistry, but it did freak him out a little. He told me that working through issues in the way we were doing it was brand new to him, and I think maybe a little scary.  
The other night we went out to dinner on his day off - lovely evening, wine, dinner, more drinks. But I know that alcohol for us can be a big trigger for arguments - it makes both of us more verbally aggressive, so it was sitting in the back of my mind. Conversation turned towards what I'm going to do while he is in Bolivia for two weeks: essentially what I normally do, Netflix, cooking, maybe time with friends, but not a whole lot. It came out that he just wanted to double check with me to see if I was hoping to open our relationship (something that came up when I went home for winter break). He has always said no to an open relationship (as do I, because it is way too soon in a relationship for that), but it seemed like he was interested now.  
We moved to a bar a few streets down and the conversation moved on. Upon leaving the bar, it seemed to go sour. We get on the conversation of showing affection (something we have previously discussed; he told me he doesn't understand my type of affection, e.g. Cuddling, talking about feelings, etc. because he has always associated intimacy with sex). I told him that I don't believe that material possessions are needed in order to show someone how you feel. Just being there with a person can be enough. He argued that if money isn't being spent on him, he won't feel like it's quality time. I was so hurt by that comment, and asked how he felt about times when we just stayed at home at watched TV and were in each other's presence; he essentially said that wasn't enough. I asked how he felt this evening went (with a $150 bill) and he said he felt it went really well.  
Outside of the bar, he kept bringing up wanting to go dancing, but there was nowhere in the city to go dancing, because no one would be there (recent snowfall). He was also still talking about how he needs money spent on him because he didn't have money for a long time and now he does, and I am telling him that I don't have money to spend on him; all I have is my time.  
I am sort of leading the way home because he is taking his sweet time and also beginning to bring skeletons out - I start to feel unsure if this is what would happen if he was sober, or if this is alcohol making the situation worse. At his doorstep, he tells me he's unsure about ""this"" (the relationship), and I ask him to clarify, what about ""this""? He mentioned his trip to Bolivia, and his one week after that of being here, and then another one week trip after that. I had no issues with these trips and understood we would be apart, but for some reason it was being brought up as an issue. He then said that he was so put off by the idea of ""just one penis, just one asshole,"" and I plainly asked ""Are you saying you want to fuck other people?"" He sort of avoided that question, but his facial affect told me yes. He brought up how he was feeling really annoyed with me lately, and I agree with him on this point but I also know that it happens in relationships, especially when you spend a lot of time around each other. He tells me that he feels like he is not good enough for me. Of course, I tell him that there is no other way for me to show or tell him than to just be with him, to spend my time with him. He mentioned being unsure how he feels, saying that he isn't sure if he wanted a relationship this whole time, or just a companion, just someone to be there. I mention that he was the one that was so adamant about putting a label on his, having us monogamous, introducing us as a couple to all of his friends, and I asked if that was all true, if that was all genuine - and he says he isn't sure anymore.  
So at this point, I'm confused and hurt and, frankly, pissed as hell. How is it that someone could spend all of this time, showing ther form of affection, taking you out, telling you that you aren't like the other guy in the city, that you're a catch, that you're beautiful....and then turn around and smack you with this?  
But the icing on the cake of my overwhelming emotions was this -- I asked him how he felt about me, and he said that he didn't have any emotions towards me, he felt nothing. He said that he felt so emotionally independent in his life that he didn't think he needed a relationship - I made a comment in my head along the lines of ""yes, that is very good that you are emotionally independent, that means you are ready for a relationship!""  
He tried a few times to go into his house and close the conversation with ""I'm gonna go inside"" and I felt so helpless - how can you just end a relationship like that? I was desperate to keep the conversation going, to salvage what was a crumbling evening and relationship. I wanted him to understand my hurt, I wanted him to see that what we were beginning to work on, this relationship, is worth the work and the effort. But he didn't want to hear or see what I was showing him.
  
My questions for myself the whole next day were:  
-What, of all that he said, was genuine? What was a partial truth, to sort of mask the whole truth (ya'll know what I mean, when you leave little bits out to keep from hurting the other person)?  
-How much of this was alcohol speaking? I believe that there was some truth to what he said - I feel like the anxiety and the fear he was probably feeling was real.  
-Is this the close of a relationship? There was no closure last night, there was no goodbye, it just...ended.  
-Why am I fighting for this to work out? If someone is going to treat me like this, why do I still want to keep him in my life? I care about him so much, but where do I draw the line?  
  
He sent a text yesterday afternoon:  
""I'm sorry I said everything in that manner yesterday night.""  
Me: ""I sort of understand where you were coming from. But I felt like there was no closure or reasoning.""  
Him: ""Yeah I'm feeling the same way too. I can text you when I get out tonight.""  
  
We then rescheduled to meet sometime today. I'm horribly anxious, I almost don't want to hear what I think will be said. I'm scared of the reality, instead of accepting it.  
I believe he has every right to discard a relationship and go fuck other guys - it's his life to live. But it seems like he has no understanding of how that hurts me. And maybe that's not how he feels  - maybe that's sort of a cover up for more complex emotions and feelings.  
  
I feel entirely overwhelmed and consumed in this ""bath"" of emotions and it hurts and I care so much about him and making this work.  
  
Any thoughts at all, big or small, are welcome."
4264fe,8,2016-01-22,"My (26 M) younger sister (24 F) is spiraling out of control. Attempted suicide, financial ruin, and complete disregard for the family. I could really use some help and advice.",CostantlyLost,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4264fe/my_26_m_younger_sister_24_f_is_spiraling_out_of/,"First of all, sorry about the length, this problem has been going on for the past few years and is starting to look really bleak. I come from a single parent family supported by my awesome mom (my abusive dad is in jail and hasn't been part of the picture for the past 11 years). I'm the eldest (26yo), with a younger sister (24 yo), and two younger brothers (22yo and 14yo). My sister has been in a downward spiral ever since graduating college a few years ago. She went to a huge division 1 football school down south (we're from the northeast). She lived the sorority life and my mom did her best to pay for her tuition, housing, and moving costs. My mom however is 60 and works herself to death to support my youngest brother who just started private, catholic high school. I told her that it wasn't financially responsible to send him there, but she wanted him to have the same experience the rest of the family had (my mom is super catholic and believes that the schools are really good for us). Anyway, my sister graduated college and started her master's degree with another division 1 school down south. She was going for her nutritionist masters and got an amazing internship working with the football teams athletic trainers. However, she had been seeing this older guy who lived in the northeast (right next door to my moms house). The guy (whose a real POS), breaks up with her and my sister is crushed. So crushed she quits her internship and decides to come home. She breaks her lease, $1600/mo which my mom was primarily paying for, and comes home. Unsurprisingly, the apartment's landlord sues my mom and the court starts garnishing her wages. I should mention we lost our house in a fire a few years prior to all this so my mom is in an apartment at the moment, on top of paying the mortgage/taxes on the house (there's a whole other legal problem with regards to that story). So now my mom is stretched thin and her credit is demolished. Between my brother going to private school, the wage garnishment, the mortgage/taxes and now having to take care of my sister, she is hemorrhaging money. Meanwhile, my sister is inconsolable. Since moving back home, her and the ex-boyfriend and her are on-again, off-again. Essentially he is just having her come over at night. Then after a week he'll break up with her again. Then the next weekend he'll call her up and the whole cycle will start over again. Being repeatably used like this is killing my sister's mental health. She goes into these deep depressions, including trying to take a bunch a sleeping pills (thankfully my mom has caught her doing this, but now she has to take time off from work to make sure she doesn't go through with killing herself). I'm so mad at this ex-boyfriend. He's a real low-life but this is basically my sisters first real long-term boyfriend and she isn't seeing things clearly. The love for this horrendous person is blinding her.
She is now taking online classes for her masters and works as a waitress, but spends all her money on Starbucks, hair treatments, a dog which she has no right to have, and renewing her lease on her car. None of it goes back to my mom. While my sister is out buying new clothes and bar-hoping, my mom is quite literally killing herself. She was diagnosed with Lupus a couple years ago and the past years of stress is putting her in deteriorating health. A month ago, her doctor made her spend the night in the hospital recently due to new medical problems (ie. heart problems) as well. I told my mom that she needs to get my sister out of the house since she isn't contributing or even saving any of her money. But my mom doesn't ""want to ruin the relationship with her only daughter"". My mom is also terrified that if my sister is thrown-out, that she'll actually kill herself. My sister, on the other hand, is either too delusional to see what she is doing or simply doesn't care. On her days off she sits on the couch and does nothing. She throws her dishes in the sink, piles laundry near the washer and dryer, and refuses to lend her car to my mom. I don't know what to do. I don't want to see my sister kill herself, but I don't want to see my mom die trying to save an ungrateful 24yo. What can I do? What would you do? 

tl;dr: my sister is out of control, my mom is dying from the stress, and I feel absolutely hopeless. What should I do?"

426u1h,21,2016-01-22,"Champion Update: Vel'Koz, the Eye of the Void by Rito BongCrank 420.",BongCrank420,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/426u1h/champion_update_velkoz_the_eye_of_the_void_by/,"Hello summoners, Rito BongCrank420 here to deliver you the first peek at Rito Games update to Vel'Koz, the Eye of the Void. Normally we have Pwyff or Scarizard writing this, but since the release of Fallout 4, they have been a little hard to track down. So, management here at Rito Games has placed me, BongCrank420, the greatest intern to ever live, in charge of delivering you our early access view for Vel'Koz, the Eye of the Void.

***Context***

Back when we began designing Vel'Koz in late 2013, we set out with one goal in mind: how can we design a champion, native to the void, that isn't centred around spikes and teeth and gobbling things up? We went through many different iterations of the concept before settling on the design for Vel'Koz. In place of spikes, he had tentacles. In place of the gibbering maw that is so fundamentally recognized in the monsters of the Void, he had one gigantic eyeball. Once the final design was set for him (or is Vel'Koz more of an *it*?), everything clicked. Vel'Koz was true the the legacy of the champions that came before him. Kha'zix consumes to adapt his body, Cho'Gath consumes to increase his size to better facilitate eating even bigger things, and Kog'Maw consumes for well, the sake of consuming! What Vel'Koz hungered for was *knowledge*. We felt this filled a niche thematically in the champion ecosystem we've been developing over the years, but unfortunately we failed to translate this hunger for knowledge into a design that suits something of Vel'Koz' background on the Fields of Justice. So without further adieu, here are our our proposed changes for the big eyeball in the sky.

***Abilities***

**Passive: Organic Deconstruction**

Unchanged. While the community regularly harps at us about three hit passives, there is a reason that they are becoming more prevalent. Three hit passives are good way of opening up interaction on the battlefield between players. Vel'koz will want to proc Organic Deconstruction as much as possible to maximize his damage output, and in doing so, might expose himself (itself?) to retaliation. We feel that this is a good way of encouraging trading in all stages of the game, and so will increase the number of fun interactions between the player and their adversaries.

**Q: Plasma Fission**

Unchanged: One of Vel'Koz' two signature abilities, Plasma Fission is an interesting ability that provides moments of fun interaction for the player. Good Vel'Koz players will be able to find ways to maneuver the projectile around the enemy minion line, which provides a level of depth beyond simply spamming abilities in the hopes of driving your opponent back to base.

**W: Gathered Knowledge (formerly Void Rift)**

Background: This spell is the main focus of the Vel'Koz rework, and for good reason. Player interaction with this ability is nothing more than lining it up on the incoming minion wave, and then releasing it for easy clearing. Beyond that, the only use for the spell is using it in concert with the others to apply your passive. This turned Vel'Koz from being a creature that hunted adversaries to gain knowledge, to one that Barphed (get it?) purple energy waves at minions to clear them quickly. As we already have a champion filling the space of laser-styled wave clear (looking at you, Xerath!), we knew that this needed to change, and that this ability is the biggest part of that. So, we've changed Void Rift into an ability more true to the player fantasy of Vel'Koz: Gathered Knowledge.

**NEW! Active:** Vel'Koz fires out a fairly slow-moving, straight line skillshot that detonates at the target determined by the player. The damage inflicted on the way to the target is fairly low,and will only apply one stack of Organic Deconstruction, but when it reaches its detonation point (or max range, whatever comes first) a larger burst of damage will be applied in an area, and will apply Gathered Knowledge's passive.

**NEW! Passive** *Context:* This passive is integral to how the new Vel'Koz functions, and has extreme synergy with his ultimate. We felt that while Vel'Koz was sent to Runeterra to gather knowledge about its native inhabitants, that isn't expressed anywhere within ~~his~~ its skill set. So, we've reworked Void Rift into Gathered Knowledge. The basic premise of Gathered Knowledge is when an enemy champion is tagged with Gathered Knowledge, he gains a stack of it, *but only for that one champion hit.* The stacks accumulated onto the hit champions translate into bonuses in damage from his ultimate. We're not sure on the specific numbers just yet, but we'll make sure to inform you, our lovely community once we decide further. Overall the gist is that the more Vel'Koz studies an enemy champion, the greater his ability will be to inflict pain onto them. While a champion that Vel'Koz has not studied will barely be able to notice a difference in damage from the current, enemies that Vel'Koz has studied extensively might be nearly instantly vaporized if Vel'Koz gets a good Ultimate off.

**E: Tectonic Disruption**

Unchanged, except that the skill no longer travels through the air before opening up a rift in the ground. This ability is remaining as the main kiting tool that the squishy and relatively slow Vel'Koz has at his disposal, and it felt kind of silly to us that some random weaboo's Windwall could stop an inter-dimensional rift from opening up.

**R: Lifeform Disintegration Ray**

Largely unchanged, except that now it has synergy with the passive portion of Gathered Knowledge. We feel that this change will help move Vel'Koz away from a dumb wave-clearing laser tentacle monster, and more into a knowledgeable, champion-clearing tentacle monster.

***Conclusion***

And thats it for the Vel'Koz early-access change log, brought to you by Rito BongCrank 420. As this is still early days, make sure to voice your comments and criticisms down in the comments below (and we know you have them, you bastards), as well as make sure to subscribe to the Rito Games Youtube Channel, as well as following us on Twitter. When the mage update goes live this summer, we hope you'll have as much fun playing Vel'Koz as we've had ~~butchering his kit~~ designing him! I'm sure that with some practice landing those W's, you'll be screaming **TENTAKILL** in no time!

*I'd like to take this moment to please tell me what you think of my idea for this champion, and to thank you for reading this far. It was a ton of fun writing this bit, and I hope you enjoyed. Toodles!*

427g1a,0,2016-01-22,Financial issue my last year of college,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/427g1a/financial_issue_my_last_year_of_college/,"Hey guys. I'm a senior in college that is graduating in July. I am on the quarter system. I need to pay $5000 for spring quarter and $2500 for summer session so I can graduate. I have already signed an offer for $90k/month as a software developer and I start in August so money will not be an issue when I graduate. Money is however an issue right now.

My parents were supporting me by paying for college but recently my dad lost his job and they will no longer be able to support me. I need to pay for spring and summer quarter myself. I also will need to pay for my own housing myself from now on (up till August when my lease ends). My rent is $900/month. I remotely intern for a software company right now and I get $1400/month after tax. I can afford to pay for my own rent, but paying for college will be a problem. I think I can easily live on $500/month after paying rent since I am already quite frugal as it is.

I was wondering, is there anyway I can take a loan out anywhere right now and pay it back in September? I know I have passed the FAFSA deadline, but I am willing to get a private loan. I went to BoA and they said they do not do private loans. I need to find a way to pay for college because I obviously need to graduate.

I'd love some recommendations. Thanks!"

I'm really not bothered by this, but I AM interested to how the App could go about doing this.  Could someone with some tech know-how explain in terms a layperson like me would understand?

I saw another redditor commenting that the App was likely using rekognition api.  How is it that software like this can reliably identify fitties, is it by measuring symmetry, checking the ratios of facial features?  It seems really interesting to me how a programmer might go about 'teaching' a computer to recognise beauty, which is often said to be in the eye of the (human) beholder.

Thanks in advance for any replies, and apologies if I'm a moron and they just have fistfuls of human interns sifting through profiles and stamping them Hot or Not!"
427ufu,0,2016-01-22,College student with well-paying internship. Should I start a Roth IRA or put the money towards tuition?,NotAstraZeneca,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/427ufu/college_student_with_wellpaying_internship_should/,"I'm currently a junior in college and I have a great internship that I've been at for a few months. My parents help with tuition (they cover several thousand dollars per year), I pay several thousand myself, and the rest is covered by financial aid (scholarships, grants, loans (none are private)).

My question is should I increase my contribution to tuition to lessen total debt or should I invest the extra money I'm receiving from my internship into a Roth IRA?

Something to consider: I'm studying computer science so I won't have a problem getting a job out of school and it will pay well enough for me to pay off my loans within 10 years (probably earlier)."

What would you ask if you were a hiring personnel looking for a new Senior BI Developer to come on board?

What are you looking for in a Sr BI Developer? What needs to stand out for you to choose them?

I ask because I will be involved in my first interview process with my Project Manager looking for a Sr BI Developer. I'm still an intern so my PM wants me to see what it is like on the other end of the spectrum, and also to improve myself.

We are in the healthcare industry having a traditional DM and DW. We have many front end programs including EPIC for EMR records that some would connect to your OLTP SQL Server. Our ETL process includes a prestaging and staging DB, using SSIS for our core ETL process. Use SSRS for reporting needs and SSAS for analysis.

I wanted to ask: do you guys feel like data science is rewarding and intertwined with data science? If I were to have a job, I'd love to have the two married to each other and be able to do both. I wouldn't mind working on new computer architecture in the context of, say, machine learning as well as the algorithms. I'm still mostly undecided, though.

As for what I mean by ""engineering,"" I mean the traditional large-scale companies with Lockheed Martin and Boeing and such. I'm not so sure where I fit in, but my interests are data science and differential expression, static program analysis, design of computer languages and archtitecture, artificial intelligence, and educational theory."

(X-post r/legaladvice),Edmund-Dantes,labor,https://www.reddit.com/r/labor/comments/4289oi/you_guys_wanted_to_revamp_this_sub_right_well/,"Working in HR this story kills me and makes me want to throttle the owner. Anyone know of any legal defenses? Below is the cross post. 


First of, I apologize for grammar and sentence structure, it has never been my strong suit....
Location: North Carolina, USA
Some background info... Graduated college in August 2015 with Bachelors in IT and have my Sec+ cert. From December 2014-June 2015 I served as an IT Intern for a nearby National Park. Could not find a job in my city from June - September, and already wanting to move away, moved to a more bustling city a few states away. Desperate to find a job ,with hardly an IT experience, I finally landed a job at a family owned manufacturing company acting as the only IT support for about 10 workstations and users.
Recently, my boss (owner of company) told me how employee production was down, yet everyone's hours were the same, and that he would like me to install keyloggers on a few machines and also capture Internet history. That it was to be kept between him and I (typical right).
I was initially taken back since I have not been in this scenario before but then quickly realized that it is actually a common practice for businesses to monitor the productivity of their employees.
He asked me to research different methods and that the point of this was not a ""gotcha"" type deal, but instead to ""audit"" employee productivity. So I went to research the different software out there. While doing so, I remembered about Acceptable Use Policies and how they are good policies to have in general but are also a good deterrent to misuse of company equipment. So I plan to tell boss about implementing an AUP and include that the employees may be monitored (I am a firm believer in letting people know they are being monitored) so they will for sure not misuse equipment.
The next day, I tell my boss my opinion is to implement a AUP to send to all employees and then implement monitoring in stages (low monitoring - internet history, medium - internet history/bulk up content filter, and high (spectorsoft 360 shit)) or something like that. And then begin monitoring employees after AUP is in place.
Boss gets on the defensive stance and states that he has known people longer than I have and that his tactic is to not threaten people, that he should just have to tell people not to do something and if they do it they get the ban-hammer. Goes on to say that if they are wasting time, they are stealing from him since hes paying them to do a job and he deserves to know if an employee is writing an email to his attorney or checking his/her bank online (weird examples for him to bring up right?)
I state that content filters can be put in place to block any unproductive sites ( I checked firewall earlier and only social media sites were blocked). He states they already are and that he wants a keylogger to know just exactly what they are up to.
Now I am on a timeline to find a proper solution and to hide this from all employees and HR! If there was a employee productivity issue, shouldn't he be consulting HR first and then to IT if the problem couldn't be fixed? If checking a bank account online was such an issue, shouldn't a content filter be put in place so they can't go there? I'm concerned about unnecessarily obtaining personal banking information.
This whole situation seems very unethical to me, and there may be an ulterior motive at play. I need this job reference so of course I must comply, but is there anything I can do or just be controlled like a puppet?
Thanks!
... I have not been able to find any information online clearly stating whether or not it is legal to do so in my state. Could I be fired for telling HR about this? (BTW, HR dept only consists of one person and we do not have a legal dept)"
428k5q,1,2016-01-22,Responding to a potential employer that asks what salary you want,OneEyedCheshire,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/428k5q/responding_to_a_potential_employer_that_asks_what/,"Hey all. My roommate is working on switching jobs. She is currently in construction, but wants to get back into architecture via an architect intern position (she already has a grad degree but has not taken all the architecture tests). She has interest from a small company (3 employees), which would put her back onto the path of becoming an architect. After the second round interview, the employer emailed asking what salary she was looking for. Completely unsure how to respond.

Some details:

-in South Carolina, so not in a high cost of living area like NYC

-Median national salary for position is $50k a year

-She currently makes $46k a year, but has less future opportunity in her job (and she is unhappy in her current job)

-Unknown what benefits future employer would offer


How do you even go about approaching a response to this? I think she would ultimately be happy making the same as she does now, since the career opportunity adds tremendous value (and she is generally unhappy in current position). I suggested quoting a range, (say 45-55k/yr)  qualifying that the salary she would be comfortable with would be dependent upon what benefits are offered. But I've also seen people suggest you should never be the first to throw out a number.

Any thoughts are appreciated! I'll be helping her think this thru this weekend, and just looking for a little external feedback"
4290bx,1,2016-01-22,Professionality in Appearance in a PI Job,AmateurPrivInv,privinv,https://www.reddit.com/r/privinv/comments/4290bx/professionality_in_appearance_in_a_pi_job/,"Hey y'all, I was wondering if I could pick your brains about what level of ""professional appearance"" is, in your experience, required for a PI job. I'm asking because I have twelve piercings, all ears and facial, as well as a colored, rather ""trendy"" hairstyle. I'm guessing if this isn't accepted anywhere, it'd be at the larger multi-state investigation firms, so would I have better luck looking at boutique PI firms in my area?

Just some background on me, I'm 19 and still a full time student, so the kind of job I'm looking for is entry level at best, intern / ""gopher"" if that's what I can find. At this point I'm working mostly for the experience, as I really want to get into this field and so far have only done amateur stuff looking into people's backgrounds for various, unpaid reasons.

I would like to see another game, like NV, before fallout 5. I'd love to a) see what more can be done with this engine, and b) get another story in the West. Here's my head cannon fantasy of what they could do:

Setting: Oregon, Northern Willamette Valley. Have the map stretch from Portland/Maybe Vancouver, WA in the north down to Salem, maybe Eugene if they wanna be real ambitious. 

Now I know Oregon isn't as big a name as DC, Boston, or Vegas but I think as a setting it has alot to offer. 

A large metropolis in the North. 

Numerous towns and cities to act as population centers spread out through out the wilderness

plenty of wilderness and undeveloped land to explore.

Deep history to build off of. How fun would it be to have Lewis and Clark or Oregon Trail themed quests and settlements. If they could somehow take the settlement building system and incorporate a Oregon Trail-esqu aspect to it that'd be amazing. 

Plenty of lore about ferocious creatures in the wild. Angry mutated owls or some mutated sasquatch. (How cool would that be?!)

Proximity to the NCR

Could bring back the casino system. I mean one of the most visited place in Oregon is Spirit Mountain Casino. Having the Confederafted Tribe of the Grand Ronde as a power in the region would be pretty cool now that I think of it.

And the list goes on. 

Plot:

The plot could focus around a similar geopolitical struggle to New Vegas's. The NCR has traditionally been the power in the region. The Northern most states of New Arroyo and Klamath include parts of the State of Oregon and are thus geographically close to the Willamette Valley. This proximity has created close ties between the NCR and the valley region. 

However, since the events of New Vegas the NCR has become far more isolationist. (I'm going to assume the currier sides with the NCR in the end of NV). Despite its success in the war with Ceasers legion, the NCR has found itself strained. The annexation of New Vegas has not go smoothly, the government's resources remain tight after having to finance a long war, and the economy has since faltered. All that has resulted in an NCR population that is far more reticent to get involved in areas beyond its boarders.

Meanwhile, a pseudo-facist power has risen out of the remains of the Seattle-Vancouver Megalopolis. It's government does not center around a central figure as much as a leading party. (Think post-Stalin Soviet Union). It is a very militarist and expansionist state and has done much to improve the lives of those in the former Megalopolis to the north of the Columbia. 

In the Willamette Valley there is no single power so much as an assortment of closely tied city states. The region has benefited from a number of natural and geographical advantages. First, the region was not so hard hit during the Great War. Aside from Portland, it lacked a major economic, political, or military target to focus on. Second, after the formation of the NCR the region benefited from economic ties with the republic. Third, its vast wilderness (preserved as national and state parks before the Great War) have given the people an abundance of natural resources, which became even more valuable as the NCR's economy expanded. Finally, the region was also relatively less dependant on fossil and nuclear fuels before the Great War. In the 1930's great hydroelectric damns were built to power the region, many of which remain and provide electricity to the larger population centers. 

These multiple benefits however, have become somewhat of a liability in recent years. As the NCR's economy has faltered so too has its demand for raw materials. This intern has lead to a severe downturn in the region, which itself has caused unrest and instability. Meanwhile the military power to the north eyes the region for its vast resources and many damns. It has been hesitant this far to act too aggressively less it incur the wrath of the NCR. But now, as the NCR becomes more isolationist, things are beginning to change. 

The city states in the valley, once largely unified, are beginning to fracture and become more hostile towards one another. These divisions are being further pushed by agents from the north that have begun spreading unrest and distrust among the people. Bands of political extremists who associate with the ideology of the northern power have popped up across the region. The situation is tinder box, waiting to be lit. 

This is the situation your character would walk into. I'm not sure what the best back story for your character would be. Maybe another vault dweller, maybe a former raider from the east, maybe you start as an agent from the north. Or, you come in on a new post-war Oregon Trail caravan. A lot of cool options. 

From wherever you start you could have a lot of options as to where to go. Work with the power from the north to create a casus belli for war in the valley, work with NCR opposition to try to get the republic to act to push the northerners back, pick a city state that you like the most and work with them to dominate the region independent of the other powers, form your own raider band and make yourself a power in the region, maybe something else entirely. Meanwhile you'll fight sasquatchs, lead your own post-apocalypse band of Oregon pioneers, find out what happened to the BOS in the area, explore the wilds, find isolated vaults, manage settlements, and so on. 

What do y'all think? What would you wanna see?"

It was my second time cleaning the daycare myself since training. It wasn't the one on one time with dogs that I really desired, but it was a start. 

One perk though was you. I had met you the first day. You had an amazing smile, and I couldn't help but think a dirty thought as you went around busily, trying to finish up before you went home for the day. You had a great build, and were beyond kind. I admired the way you handled the dogs, kind and stern. I had always loved dogs, and had a little guy of my own. A lab named Sinatra I had adopted a month or two before. Dogs were one of my passions, and seeing your passion for them as well only strengthened my irrational attraction to you.  

I had started working at the doggy daycare since I moved back to my parents' hometown. Working as an intern at a local place so I can graduate college, and trying to find another job to put gas in my car. So, doggy daycare it was. 

As I finish pushing all the water towards the drain, I realize I forgot to start the washer for the dog blankets, and quickly turn around, running right into you. 

Your hand grazes my breasts, my nipple perking up at the touch of someone. It's a weird feeling, being turned on and embarrassed at the same time. 

""I'm I--- so sorry."" I gush. 
My cheeks flowing red. I had hoped we would get a chance to chat, but I didn't plan on making a fool of myself. 


My name is Kait. I have several tattoos, a buzzcut (brunette), DD breasts, and am very curvy, plump, and short at about 5'2"". I have a nice firm ass, and large maeve glasses. 

I am into spanking, biting, pinching, leaving marks, being tied up, being called naughty, 'good girl, dirty, &amp; am also into very passionate, dramatic or intense dialogue if you are into that. If not, that's fine too.

429dp3,3,2016-01-22,The Cost of LiquidSky vs. Having Your Own Gaming PC,Earthatic,LiquidSky,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiquidSky/comments/429dp3/the_cost_of_liquidsky_vs_having_your_own_gaming_pc/,"In the spirit of weighing the pros and cons of cloud gaming, let's do some simple math to see what kind of users will benefit from using LiquidSky. I'm not going to do a comparison with consoles because, while they're obviously cheaper, PCs are not consoles!

Let's start with the costs involved when running LiquidSky.

End-user: 

- A fast internet connection with a high/unlimited bandwidth cap
- A potato PC or Android Device
- Electricity
- ~$0.25/hr per LS session (this is what we'll be focusing on)
- Software licenses for applications and Sky Storage costs

Company costs:

- Server hosting
- Server equipment 
- ISP(s) that give insane download/upload speeds
- Employee salaries/development costs + coffee for the interns 
- Reserved funds to replace broken and outdated equipment
- Unknown costs associated with licensing, partnerships, patents, and so forth

Cloud gaming is very expensive and a huge undertaking for any company that attempts to provide it. No question. The whole point, however, is that it's supposed to be a cheaper, more mobile medium for gaming. This is difficult to achieve since, for the service provider, there is way more to it than just buying a bunch of gaming PCs. 

For someone to buy their own gaming PC, you can spend about $800 for a decent rig that would greatly outperform the current LS Medium plan and would allow you to play new releases for at least 4-5 years without any problems. You'd have hundreds of gigs to store your own applications and would have access to your machine 24/7; you wouldn't have to deal with input latency and compressed video, either, and you can always sell your machine later.

Given the announced pay-as-you-go pricing model, what is the price of LiquidSky? Depends on how much you use it and what plan you have. These estimates do not include Sky Storage:

2 hours a day = ~$15(.xx) a month, ~$182/yr 

5 hours a day = ~$38 a month, ~$456/yr

7 hours a day = ~$53 a month, ~$638/yr

Keep in mind, the pricing is not set in stone and is subject to change. In the future, users will be given more options. 

If you want storage for your files and games so that you don't have to download them every time you start a new session, you'll be paying more. According to Ian, it will cost roughly double what Amazon charges for their cloud storage.

As it stands, the service is better suited for casual gamers who don't want to invest in an expensive gaming rig, but it's also good for those who want to be able to play their games while they're away from home. For them, it will be a cheap and convenient way to play games. For those who invest a lot of time into their hobby, it won't be ideal. While LS may eventually offer an unlimited monthly plan for hardcore gamers, they'll effectively be operating at a loss by doing so, since they would need the casual users to offset the amount of money they'd be losing. I don't know about you, but that doesn't sit well with me.

429e86,1,2016-01-22,I don't know what to do/ how to feel,picc4life,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/429e86/i_dont_know_what_to_do_how_to_feel/,"I actually hadn't seen anything like this before until my fiance linking me to this page. It's the first time I ever saw that there were others like me, and now maybe I can ask advice from you all:

This story starts when I was a kid. For the most part, my parents were wonderful parents while I was growing up. As a child I had pretty severe ADHD which caused me to get beat up a lot, but my mom always rushed to my rescue. Things were great. The first time anything weird happened was when I was 9 and she was pregnant with my brother. While she was on bed rest she had me cleaning the bathroom, my room, the living room, basically anything I could reach. At first I thought nothing of it, but after the cleaning of my room and bathroom continued after her pregnancy and increased in intensity I was really weirded out and stressed by it. She started comparing me to others, saying everyone cleans as much as I do, I'm just ungrateful and spoiled. As I got older things got worse. She started saying terrible things to me like ""When I was passing out during my PTSD attack you danced around me like a little demon child, laughing ( I was 5 at the time, maybe 4 so I had no idea what was happening). Because of your ADHD I had heart palpitations and I never felt good."" My dad started making it clear that he was a misogynistt around this time, treating and referring to my sister and I as property essentially. When my sister and I asked about an allowance we were told ""You're part of this family, you should be cleaning out of the kindness of your heart, not for money."" mind you my brother is 12 currently, cleans nothing, and gets payed $20 a week for taking out the trash. My dad and mom treat him like the golden child, while we were limited in what we could receive as a child, he gets whatever he wants and more. He doesn't have to do chores, he can play whatever games he wants ( i wasn't allowed to play anything till 18) and they don't really care what he does. When we tell him to put his plate away my dad says ""that's women's work."" He's also been tested as an off the charts genius, but is so lazy that he has my mom do his homework. He's currently failing his advanced classes, but that's okay because he's way smarter than us. If we say anything against him, we're giving him bad memories and being cruel to our brother. He knows this and frequently takes advantage of it too. When I graduated high school I got a cheep $500 laptop that was already broken. My brother just got a gaming laptop and said ""How's it feel knowing I got a better laptop than you and I'm 12?"" I told my parents and they said he's just being a boy. During my middle/high school years I developed depression due to all the horrible things my parents would say. ""Why can't you do better in school. We give up on you, you're no good, you're ungrateful, you're a liar."" I ended up getting sexually and verbally abused by a couple boyfriends. It got so bad I tried to kill myself, but I was too scared to tell my parents. When I finally did my mom said "" How could you ever be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! You're crazy, literally. I've never heard anything so stupid. We had a reason to be depressed, we were so much worse off than you"" I was so alone. I had everything they didn't so I couldn't be depressed.  The screaming got worse, she started comparing me to everyone and everything, I got straight A's, but this kid in her college class was homeschooled and taking college classes. I went to NASA for an internship, but others were doing better. ""It's because of you we're in debt. It's because of you that we spent half our paycheck renting a house. You don't deserve this stuff."" I took out money to pay for me and my sister to do things because we were a ""financial burden"" on my parents. Because of us they have no savings and they were always poor. It's our fault they're in debt. Things got worse when I met my fiance. His dad is in the military and they got stationed in Europe the month after we started dating. (he stayed in the US for college) After a couple years he asked if I could meet his family. That was a no-go. How dare he ever ask something so stupid. I belonged to them, he couldn't take me anywhere unless we were married, and his parents had no reason to get to know me. My mom yelled at him for an hour in our basement about what a jerk he was. Bless his heart, he still stayed. Fast-forward to thanksgiving my first year in college. I tried to surprise them for thanksgiving but a snowstorm him and we had to stop halfway through our drive at his grandparents house for fear of dying in the mountains of PA. My parents screamed at me on the phone about how it was his plan all along to whisk me away without their permission and I was a terrible daughter. fast forward again and he's graduating college. I'm not allowed to go anywhere without my parents. I chose to go since I was far enough away from home to get away with it, and since we were engaged I felt his parents needed to know who I was. They screamed and shouted about how ""he has no balls! How could he try and take you without our permission!"" They made my life hell. They sent me all my medical bills and cut me off for two months. I sent them a 9 - page letter detailing what's happened and what they were doing to me. My mom ripped it up (according to my sister) and said that it was all lies and I needed to learn that I needed them. Eventually my guilt tore me up and after a call with my mom saying that I was messed up and needed help, I was convinced to go home. I pay for all my own bills, I pay for my entire school with the help of my fiance who took out a loan to support me. Somehow I still feel like they control me. When I'm home I'm not allowed to go anywhere, even if they're at work. I have to sit in the house. Friends aren't family therefore I shouldn't have to see them. I talk about trouble I'm having with friends and my parents tell me that ""the only friends you'll ever actually keep are your family. That should be the center, you don't need other people. Blood is everything."" My sister went to her boyfriend's for an hour and my dad cursed her out saying his family was s**t, and nothing to him. I feel suffocated. I'm 21, I should be able to live my life but I can't/ We tried suggesting a party with friends for New Years and they yelled about how we shouldn't even dream of spending a holiday without our parents. it's disgusting and unheard of. My aunts and uncles then jumped on board saying that they've never spent a holiday away from their parents and forced their spouses to give up those rights for them. I feel trapped, suffocated, but I can't leave. I'm so scared of what my dad would do to my mom if I left that I can't cut myself off from them out of fear and love for her. They've messed me up so bad, I'm so scared, and I'm so depressed/lost half the time but I can't cut them off. I'm lucky of how supportive my fiance has been with trying to help me through all of this. I wish I could get counseling but I need to commission and go active in the military before I can, otherwise they'll suspend my scholarship for college ( which is $50K a year) , and I won't be able to finish. I'm so torn up about all of this. On one had I hate how they've abused me and treated me, but on the other I still love them somehow and can't imagine cutting them out of my life, even though this isn't even the half of what they've done to me.  I NEVER want to be like them, and I won't be when I have kids ( or let them influence my kids in anyway) but I can't cut them off, even though they have no qualms with doing it to me apparently. 
I just really don't know what to do anymore quite honestly..."

It has been five months since I have completed my undergrad, and I am slowly watching my life transition to that of a live-at-home unemployed college grad; a fate that I desperately hoped to avoid.  Since I already spend too much of my seemingly endless time on reddit, I decided, for better or worse, to seek the advice of this community (I'm sure all of you have brilliant input!).  First, a little about myself;

I graduated in August of 2015 from a well-known private university in Central Texas with a B.S. in geology.  I did fairly well in school (3.57 overall GPA, 3.90 in-major GPA) and had the opportunity to do my own research under the advisement of one of my professors, which ultimately resulted in a thesis with pending publication.  While I was in school, I made my best attempts to network (which I must admit were probably lousy by anyone else's standards) and volunteer for some service organizations.  My most defining characteristic is my love for the outdoors.  I am by far the happiest when I am outside hiking, backpacking, running, kayaking, climbing, you name it, I've done it and loved it.  I also love listening to and composing music. I play classical piano and acoustic guitar (however these pursuits are STRICTLY hobbies. I have no desire to pursue any type of musical career, mainly because I lack the talent and ambition, secondarily because I want to have something left in my life I can always rely on for leisure).  Lastly, I have always loved to write.  I doubt that I am any good at it, but it has always been therapeutic in a way to express my thoughts in a way besides speaking, even if no one reads them!

I knew that I wanted to be a geologist since I was a very young child.  Like many kids, I collected every rock I could get my hands on. However, I never stopped... What began as an early childhood interest grew into an obsession.  I spent many of my free hours reading, researching, and digging in the mud, desperate to learn more and more about geology.  During my last two years of high-school, I decided that I wanted to turn this passion into a career. Prior to declaring geology as my major, I researched the job prospects that a geology major could expect.  As is likely the case with almost every career path, there is never and end to the multitude of sources promising a life of adventure, excitement, and of course, wealth.  Lured mostly by the promise of a huge starting salary with ample bonuses, I decided that pursuing a career in petroleum geology would be my most lucrative choice.  However, during my four years of undergrad, I discovered many other career paths besides the O&amp;G route, including engineering geology and hydrology.  As I learned more and more about each sub-discipline, I began to question whether or not my original career goal was the best fit for me.  

Fast forward to today. Y'all can probably take a guess how I feel now about working in oil and gas...  With the recent nosedive in oil prices, tens of thousands of O&amp;G workers are facing layoffs, and entry-level jobs are practically unobtainable.  I have applied to nearly 150 job postings in the environmental, mining, O&amp;G, and engineering fields, and have yet to even get a single interview.  As of now, I have a potential internship with the US Geological Survey that I got through being nominated by a professor, but I am not too hopeful due to the extremely competitive nature of the program. As a back-up plan, I have also applied for roughly 25 positions as an interpretive park ranger with the US National Park Service.  Hopefully I'll be hearing back from some of them soon.

Although I have came up with a few potential distractions to keep me busy for this year, I have faced no other choice than to entertain the though of reconsiders my career goals entirely, which is where I hope for y'all to offer up your tidbits of wisdom and advice.  I know it is a lot to ask, and that we are all humble internet strangers, but would any of you be willing to share your experiences in how you found your way if you have faced (and hopefully overcame) similar circumstances?  If there is one thing that I am certain of, it is that I am not the only young adult ever to face a career identity-crisis upon graduating.

I look forward to conversing with everyone who wants to talk, advise, criticize, encourage, praise, and insult me!  There are likely a lot of details I left out that may be useful to whatever poor soul actually 1.) reads this far and 2.) decides to waste their time talking with me (although if you got this far, I have already succeeded in wasting your time), so if there is anything else you'd like to know about me besides my SSN and bank account info, please ask away!"

I don't know anything about this stuff. So here are my questions
1) best way to get as much support for this intern as I can  (i.e does anyone know if neo4j or OrientDB provide support in their enterprise editions?) We do have an IT dept that might be able to provide some support as well. (I obviously want the intern to learn from this position).

2)What is the best application/platform to use for this situation? (The type of graph database that I want that is to be built by an intern) 

3)What kind of background/minimum coursework should I be looking for? 

I am trying to make the situation so that the potential intern has as guidance as possible and can learn from someone experienced given my situation

I've just completed a 3-session co-op at a large aerospace company, and have applied for nearly every NASA internship I believe I would qualify for on OSSI. I've also applied for MARTI. My main question is this: If I don't happen to get a full-time job with NASA after graduation, what should I do to better my odds for future employment with NASA? Should I try getting a job at another federal agency, or get a job with a NASA contractor?

Any additional advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Received an internship in the state I am studying in for 14 weeks in 2015. I received my W-2 and I filed my taxes yesterday. I am living in the state I am studying in (as the W-2 has my address that I am living at). However, when applying for the internship I used my parent's (or my old address) to use as a permanent address for mailing reasons. When I got my signingbonus/relocation money of $1500, I saw that ORIGINAL_STATE taxes were being taken away. i said no thx and got my address changed with HR but still had to pay those taxes for that money.


NOW:


A few days ago I got the big W-2 saying I made ~16k and taxed ~2.3k federally. However, today I just got another W-2 from the same company saying I made 1.5k and was taxed federally 375 dollars and STATE_TAX was $145.


So, what do I do now?

THank you so much."

Last semester I failed a class, which has ruined my GPA. The Big 4 firm I am interning at is not yet aware of this. My GPA was around 3.6 and now it is around 2.9. I want to receive an offer for full-time employment so, so, so, so badly. Is there any hope? The class i failed was an accounting class.
If I perform perfectly on the job and form strong relationships with others on my team will they overlook ONE bad grade and give me an offer? Perhaps the offer could be contingent on improving my GPA dramatically (straight As for the rest of school until I graduate)?
Any advice on how to maximize my chances of getting an offer besides being a great intern?
I am so incredibly depressed about this whole situation."
42cmnj,9,2016-01-23,Advice from current ortho residents/attendings?,iwtbaos17,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/42cmnj/advice_from_current_ortho_residentsattendings/,"Current M3, and at the risk of receiving 90% sarcastic responses, hoping to get some insight from any current ortho residents or attendings about pursuing residency.

My approach to M4 AIs: bust ass, get in early (with or before the interns) and stay late, be efficient/humble/helpful/incognito about the tasks you complete, be eager to learn but not annoying, be on point with all things related (new labs, imaging, trends etc..) to your patients and cases, get in the OR before the case and meet the staff/pull gloves/help prep then stay after to transfer to PACU/help with scripts/orders/transport, make the residents look good 

""CV"" info:
- 2nd quartile rank after M1/M2 (but barely, we're talking like #47 if scaled to 100 students)

- Step 1: 248 (to be honest, still a bit worried I didn't get 250s.  I know a 248 doesn't screen me out, but average certainly doesn't give me any Step 1 score advantage)

- Step 2 target: 260+

- M3 thus far: final grades above 90 on each rotation (no ""F/P/HP/Ho"" at our school) with awesome eval comments and strong relationships with attendings and course directors in each so far.  Expecting class rank to get a good boost, but I assume it's out of the question to climb up enough and quick enough for senior AOA

- Research: publication (3rd auth) with highly respected surgeon in his subspecialty (sports); upcoming publication with another surgeon (likely, and hoping, to be in JBJS), smaller administration project done with one of the deans, hopefully a 3rd ortho publication but not certain if another project will line up

- a couple small volunteer things from M1 and M2, nothing mind-blowing

- I expect to have really strong LORs from some attendings at my home program who are well known in their subspecialties.  I have really great relationships with them and they know me to be an extremely hard worker while remaining (more or less) easy going and easy to get along with

- Other: work hx/hobbies to include various ""working"" jobs (golf club maintenance, boat/auto detailing, furniture moving, wood working/furniture restoration etc...), I like short walks on the beach, I have a chocolate lab named Henry, my wife and I have a 1yr old son who enjoys putting his face in snow


My home PD told me not to worry, I'll ""get plenty of interviews and match"" but I'm of course always concerned about it.  I'm not shooting for a high numbers program (HSS, Harvard etc...), I'll be looking for a program where operative load is high (I want to be a damn good surgeon when I graduate, not a pretty good one with 100 pubs), the residents are family and the camaraderie is rock solid, and the attendings are phenomenal surgeons who are passionate about turning the residents into the same.

So my question is, other than doing well on clinicals/step 2/locking down research and LORs/using AIs to show programs that I'm someone they want, what can/should I do to increase my chances of matching (preferably at a top 3 pick)?  (side note: do I need to concerned about only having ~2 volunteer experiences during med school?)  Are there any pearls of wisdom to pass along? Anything I didn't touch on in this write up that would be important to know/do?

Thanks in advance and pardon any typos, I'm post call

42cokh,3,2016-01-23,Conflicting feelings about my [19M] former relationship with my first serious ex [19F],TeamMagmaGrunt,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42cokh/conflicting_feelings_about_my_19m_former/,"This happened a little bit ago, but it's still impacting me today so I figured I'd come to you guys for help.

So from August 2014 to March 2015, I was in a relationship with a girl, we'll call her Marie. And for the majority of that relationship, I was the happiest I'd ever been.

Going into Feb 2015, she started to distance herself from me. Started making excuses as to why she couldn't meet up for dates, messaged/texted me less and less (we lived ~40 minutes from each other so only really got to physically see each other once a week), and eventually went on a five week streak of cancelling out on our dates. These were to the tune of ""I got too stressed after TV shopping"" and ""I got called into work again on this specific day of the week that we keep scheduling our dates, and no you can't visit me at my part time job because I don't want to mix personal with professional.""

So, her fifth week of cancelling on me, after we haven't seen each other for more than a month (it's the middle of March by now), I decide to let her know how I was feeling about not getting to see her. She then blames ME for getting mad about it in the first place (because God forbid that I should want to actually see my girlfriend, right?) when she's been ""stressed,"" even though I was the one going through high school full-time (she's dropped out of her first year of college by now), working 35-40 hours a week while working on a promotion, and also being the one making the full attempts to see her when she's been blowing me off.

So she cuts me off completely, and five days go by with me not having any contact with her whatsoever. I have to make the drive out to her house just to make sure she was still alive, and it's only there that I find out about her schooling situation.

That was on a Tuesday (St. Patrick's Day, if I recall correctly), and we made amends for that weekend, since we were already going out of town for a convention together. 

At this point, I've already decided on breaking up with her if the behavior continued. Which, after the convention, it does. Cuts off all contact with me again for no apparent reason.

So the Sunday after that weekend, I break up with her via voicemail. I went to her house to do it in person, but she wasn't home that afternoon, and I wasn't about to waste any more gas or time to someone that couldn't even bother to see or talk to me.

So, that was the end of that.

I didn't have enough time to feel sad about it at the time - I got that promotion at work the day after, and from there left for my trip to New York. Even after that, I was doing really, really well with her no longer in my life. I found a new girlfriend that May, I had landed my dream internship that summer which led to national publication, and overall the summer after that breakup was easily the best of my life.

August comes around, and I'm getting to leave for my first year of college. I broke up with my new girlfriend on mutual terms, and left for school (about two hours from where I live) towards the end of that month. The semester starts off pretty well, but then something started to...change, I guess.

I think it started toward the end of September, but I was starting to have thoughts about my older gf, Marie, again. Not ""thoughts"" as in I wanted to date her again, because I swore to myself that I wouldn't go back to dating her if it came to it, but with the way things ended I felt like I never had any closure. I remember emailing her at one point just to say hi, seeing if she wanted to maintain a friendship, but she chose not to respond so I left it at that.

Come October and November, I find out things about both her and the relationship via Reddit, since we knew each other's usernames. The whole gist of what I found out was that she never really felt anything for me in the time that we were together and that she had lied about some crucial things during that time. She also said that she would've broken up with me far before I did, but didn't because I was ""a decent friend.""

During what I thought was the most happiest time of my life with her, she was essentially leading me on for that whole time. It had never meant anything to her.

And now, even two months after I'd found out all that, I still feel...broken, I guess? The only way I can describe it is that my entire inner structure of trust, love, companionship, etc. have forever been shattered by her deceit. I'm in another relationship, and have been since around Thanksgiving of 2015, and it's the same as the one with Marie was in the sense that we have the same things and interests in common, but it's sooooo much harder for me to even feel anything. I'm practically scared of having sex or even having any kind of intimacy with my current gf because I'm afraid that it won't mean anything, like how all of that with Marie never really meant anything in the long run.

I feel like I'm shutting out my current girlfriend, which I absolutely don't want to do. I'm finding more solace in being alone than I am in being with anyone, including my gf, but I don't want to look at it that way. I want to get excited about having someone new to care for in my life, but I just...can't.

And at the same time, I still think almost daily about Marie. I know how terribly she acted when it came to the whole relationship, but I feel like with how things went I still want to just...talk to her, I guess? I'm not sure. I don't know why I'm still thinking about her every day, wondering where she's at or what she's doing or feeling, or if she still thinks about me. I can't reach out to her again but at the same time I think the one thing I want more than anything is to just talk to her about what happened. Even after finding out about what she did fueled a depression that I'm still fighting today, she's still there.

I guess the whole reason I'm ranting to /r/relationships is because I don't know how to decipher what I'm feeling toward Marie or toward my current gf or toward me. I just feel broken as a person because of what she did, and I'm so scared that I can't ever feel anything for anyone like I did for her because of that.

TLDR: Ex never really cared about my relationship with her, lied about some really important things, and it's left me broken and scared about feeling what I used to feel for her toward anyone else."

**The intern:** You start an internship at an advertising agency, you were somewhat concerned that they cared more about your looks than your resume during the interview, on your first day, you realise that all of the staff except the lead executives and the partners, are young attractive females. What could be happening behind the closed doors of the executive’s offices?

**The collector:** I'm a wealthy man who is part of an exclusive club of gentlemen, which procure themselves young girls to use and abuse from human trafficking rings all around the world. They compare and admire each others ""grabs"" and sometimes even trade or share them at their private parties.

**The good ol’ days:** The scene is set in the 1950s, you used to be my Catholic schoolgirl neighbor that I turned into my full-time / live-in slave as soon as you started going to college, I also married you to cover up for our lifestyle, I enjoy degrading you in front of others, making fun of you at the company functions and belittle you in front of my coworkers while you smile and nod.

I also take you out at night into the city, to share you in private parties or with whoever wants to have a go with you, Even homeless men. You do it unwillingly and even cry sometimes, but still obey because you know it pleases me.

**In mom’s arms:** I'm a good boy who has recently discovered that his little pecker gets really hard and hurts a little when he sees mommy without wearing a bra. He loves his mommy dearly, and he knows that she works really hard to support since his dad went to heaven years ago.

I had just gotten my first cell phone and have been taking pictures of everything, especially pictures of mom, when we are having breakfast early in the morning and she's not wearing a bra, so her nipples poke through her t-shirt.

I have been having to wash my pecker real good to make it soft again, specially after breakfast with mom. I've noticed that when I rub it back and forth after a while it starts feeling good, and I feel shiver before my wiener spits something creamy and warm.

**The predator:** We live in a post-apocalyptic world, I am a hunter, what do I hunt? You may ask. Well the answer is simple, people, more specifically women, well if you want me to be more specific, young girls, the younger the better. They are wildings from the last remnants of civilization. I catch them and keep them in my pens, using nano technology to alter their aging and maturation processes, they then become emotionally and intellectually immature sex slaves for me to breed and to groom in order to sell, or keep them for my personal use. So don't wander alone at night girl, or you may never return to your tribe. Once they've served their purpose, I either give them away or kill them in any twisted way that I can think off at that moment.

**The loving father:** I'm a single dad who loves you unconditionally, but gets very lonely at nights and is seeing you bloom into a beautiful, sexy and charming  lady. You would need to fill in the blanks by yourself.

This is going to be long, so I apologize in advance. I guess i'll set the scene by introducing myself. No names or truly identifying information, obviously. So I am currently less than 2 months away from turning 21 years old. I'm a junior in an elite school in the northeastern US, majoring in Engineering. My grades have always been lackluster, but never bad enough to get kicked out of school. Recently I was diagnosed with depression and have been seeing a therapist to help me get through it. I once spent three weeks during school in my room, not eating unless absolutely necessary, and even then, getting it delivered to my door for me. I felt empty, but luckily for me I had a caring girlfriend whose very existence made life worth living. A key part of my depression is my severe inner critic. I am never proud of anything, things only happen because I'm given everything, or pitied. I hate myself, and I don't see any way of that getting better. So, seems like a typical engineering student at this point, bad grades, depression, the usual. Well disappointing my parents has always been something I've been afraid of, as they've given me so much, and I feel like I don't deserve it. I wish I could give everything I had handed to me in my life to someone else who could use it better. I landed an internship at a very prestigious company solely because I have a close family member who is in the C-suite of said company. I'm going to start to ramble at this point because it's getting long and I didn't outline a structure for this post or anything. Anyway, so throughout all of this, I had my girlfriend of 3 and a half years. She inspired me, she made me want to better myself because I always imagined us together forever. Yeah, I was young and naive, and I still am. We did everything together, I took her on cruises, she drives my old car, I applied her to the university she is attending, I bought her gifts and treated her like the princess she was. I would drive legitimately 12 hours (3 hours each way twice a weekend) a weekend to see her as often as I could during school. And during my internship I would drive another 3 hours to see her as often as I could. I loved her more than myself, and probably always will. So anyway, the reason I'm posting this post today is because it is the one month anniversary of her and I breaking up. It turns out she lost the flame we once had while I was depressed. I don't blame her, I did nothing all day and just wanted to sit with her. She cheated on me while at school, and now I'm even more depressed. I feel like I can't trust anyone, and I've been seriously considering suicide every single day for the past month. It's reached a point where I'm actually scared of what may happen. I don't want to die, but I want to be dead. So, cheating ex-girlfriend who I still love, horrible grades, depressing life and school. So now I guess i'll talk about my parents. I know they care about me, but I still feel so alone. I've never felt true loneliness like this. I know there are people around me that care to some extent, but I feel nothing inside. My mom recently yelled at me while I was up at 6am trying to stop thinking about my ex by playing games.I have insomnia because all I think about as I lay in bed is her touching some random kid and it makes me sick. She (my mother) told me that she doesn't believe anything I say anymore, and that I probably do this every day at school and she would stop paying for me to attend if my grades didn't get better. To be honest, I don't play as many games at school as I used to. I just sat and did nothing. So yeah, now my mother doesn't trust me, is angry at me, and is threatening to cut my schooling. I have no ambition anymore, everything I wanted to do to better myself was purely to make my girlfriend happy. I knew she'd like a man with a career, and a thinner body. But now that she's gone, I want nothing. I have no real friends, 2/3 of my roommates mutter under their breath about me, and the third is like a golden retriever. He's so nice but he's derpy and isn't there for me emotionally when I need him. So basically, I'm all alone. My depression is getting worse, as all I talk about at therapy is my ex. My grades are bad, my funding may be cut, my parents don't trust me. And every day I sit thinking about how much I wish I could just die. I want to feel nothing, not empty. I know things can get better, I know I may find someone else, but it's strange. I don't want to. What I felt I KNOW was true love, and it wasn't reciprocated, fine. All I wish is that I had the chance to work on things with my ex. Even on the day I found out she was cheating it was all hearts and smiles and making plans for the future. My life just ended so abruptly. My relationships died, the shred of respect I had for myself disappeared. I don't know what I missed, but I guess the TL;DR (which I'll put at the top) is that I have depression, suicidal thoughts, i'm all alone with no ambition, I've been given everything my whole life and feel undeserving, I have nothing to be proud of, no friends, my parents don't trust anything I say, and the only thing that made my life worth living is gone. I've never been on this subreddit so maybe this is all a little to deep or personal, and if it is, I apologize. Feel free to ask any questions, I don't mind talking anymore."

I am 17 years old and have stuttered almost my whole life. My dad stuttered when he was younger and said that he doesn't know how or when it disappeared since he never took speech therapy, but his stutter is now non-existant and hasn't stuttered since. When I was younger, I just assumed that my stutter would disappear the way by dad's did, but as I am getting older I feel like its not the case.

I am in a dual enrollment college program where I take full time classes in college although I am technically in high school. I have already successfully completed almost 2 years of college as a Computer Science major and expect to graduate in 2018 with a Bachelors in Computer Science by the age of 19 (sounds crazy right!). I am looking for an internship over the summer to get some job experience, but I have a stutter. Whenever I speak, my face tenses up and I block on every 3-5 words for a second or two and I feel like it could get in the way of me finding a job in the future. 

I want to know how much this effects interview process and what bosses/recruiters care about when it comes to the technology field. I am becoming self conscious of the way I talk because I feel like I wont be able to make it in the job field and I am scared of never being able to find a job because of this.

I genuinely want to know how big of a deal this is and how professionals deal with these kinds of things. I am scared for the interview process because as you know I have to speak and I want to be able to share what I know and ultimately get the job, but if I stutter and they don't see me as a good candidate, they will just hire somebody else.

I should combat this. Am I screwed, or do I have a chance. Any tips that you can provide would be greatly appreciated. "

Excuse my english.  I have been lurking this subreddit for several months and don't know how to format this post. I really hope /r/jailbreak is not the majority of the jailbreaking community. This is my opinion and i felt the need to say something, people here are very much toxic and so much feel entitle to everything. 

Stock Ios are suppose to more stable than jailbreaking, i like to compare this to overclocking a cpu, stock cpu meant to just work in general while overclocking it maximizing performance/capacity but risking it to just fried. I am no expert at this but common sense tell me the idevice will crashs every so often when multiple of tweaks are installed or causing the unstability.

I took couple of CS classes, coding was very hard and definitely not for me and it was some basic stuff. From basic coding, everyone of us have slightly different coding approach to reach to the same end, i can imagine with more complex coding how the differences between the approaches from the developers of each tweaks. No developers  want to have an opensource of their current projects, which may have different coding.maybe causing the incompatibilty

Each addition of ios version are being fund in billions of dollars in Apple pocket to create their ""stable"" version. Each version create even more complex version than the previous. While on the other hand the jailbreaker groups and developers have a small amount of funding compare to apple to do their works. Again I am no expert but common sense tell me the one with more funding have the more advantage. Expecting, or rather entitle, to have jailbreak ASAP from jailbreaking group or individual hard works without funding them is quite obnoxious to me personally. They themselves can decide to share or not and have no responsibilities to share to much of a bunch that are not appreciate to their effort. Sure Taig/Pangu/PP are being paid by the chinese but unless one,himself/herself, are funding  these developers, s/he should have no say. 

Jailbreaking are for the communities by the developers effort and good will. In turn the communities need to have the encouragement and positive reinforcement feedback to the developers. Ios 9 jailbreaking may need to be like in io6 day where collective efforts are needed from both the individuals and the groups. I'm surprised that these individuals even try develope anything with how toxic this subreddit is.  I do not know the full story but TweakWiz come to mind. When you intern for some companies/offices, don't you want some even a little compensation? He make tweaks to improve himself as a coder, but no one can beta test it like more popular developer or even Apple themselves. Otherwise he would be paid much better and not have to deal with the negativeness for his long hours of hard works and crush his confidence as a coder. Their first release will obviously always have issues. I feel like those that could share their knowledge to this community have already been chased away. Talk about being negative, i don't want to be one but if this continues we may not have the next jailbreak.

One last thought in my system, not really on topic, I have own many idevices over the years, people should have not constantly updating their device past the next ios version. Past the 2-3 ios version the temporary boost of speed may feel faster and temptation of hype , and confirmation bias maybe, but with older hardware it will get slower to the point where u want to upgrade and that is apple strategy. With that one can not downgrade normally, upgrading should taken more serious thought if you want to keep the jailbreak or wait for the next. 

Sorry for my rambling, had a bad day, but i feel a bit better now that the some of the frustration is out. Again this is my opinion and i may be wrong with all my points. I myself just bought a iphone 6s 9.1 and waiting patiently for good news of jailbreak and appreciate what all the developers have done so far that i can not do.

Edit:
Seem no one read my full post, it was too long i guess. I meant this post for the prosperity for the future of jailbreak. People are complaining about lucas and talking shit about other developers while they have no responsibilities to do anything for this communities. So what if lucas can jailbreak and bragging about it, if he have the skill then he can advertise himself so, so other can hire him and pay him for his work instead of giving away something for free."
42dpcw,5,2016-01-23,Help me please,doglova258113,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/42dpcw/help_me_please/,"I am an extremely unattractive female, and it's ruining my life.

In elementary in middle school, I was blissfully unaware of my intrinsic facial hideousness. I knew I didn't look great, but I thought if I cleaned up and wore makeup, I could be beautiful just like my classmates. 

In high school I become aware of my unattractive face which makeup couldn't fix. Everyone preferentially wanted to be friends with the pretty girls in my grade; they were included in everything, they were invited to lots of parties and never shunned as a social outcast, they had all the fun, and boys would do anything for these girls. They actually COMPLAINED about all the attention they got. 

I made 0 friends because I was absolutely hideous, but I didn't care, because I found something else on which to base my self-esteem. I thought I was smart and ambitious. I thought that later, my hard work would pay off, and people would want to be my friend. I could live a comfortable lifestyle in the big city, go on fancy vacations, and I could use my intelligence to contribute back to my community. If it turned out that looks did matter as an adult, I could get plastic surgery. It almost seemed that my dreams had materialized when I earned a perfect score on the SAT, graduated as the salutatorian, and was the only student in my grade to get accepted to an ivy league school.

However, in college, things quickly spiraled downward. My first semester freshman year, I did relatively well. I never went to a single college party, I worked 16+ hours a day even on weekends, and made several friends in my major. Most of my friends were male, since I am studying computer science, but at the time I didn't see this as a problem. 

Second semester, things went downhill fast. Classes got much harder, since now everyone knew college was harder than high school and no one can breeze through classes without studying. One of my male friends misinterpreted my friendly actions and thought I had a crush on him, even though I absolutely did not and would never dare to flirt with a male because I am painfully cognizant of how irreversibly unattractive I am. Nevertheless, he took this opportunity to start a rumor within my relatively small major about how I am a female sexual predator. Since he was popular, everyone believed him, and I lost all my friends. Even girls didn't want to be friends with me anymore. I attend a large college, but even outside my major, I couldn't make friends because friend groups had already formed and in addition to being repulsive I had nothing to offer. Since most of our assignments were group based, and I had no friends in addition to classes being harder, my grades dropped dramatically second semester freshman year, even though I was still working 16+ hour days 7 days a week. 

For the first time, I realized that I actually wasn't smart at all; the only reason I ever did better than anyone else was because I worked longer and had no distractions. I have no social life due to my genetic misfortune and my parents were rich, so they were able to provide me with the materials and environment to succeed. I reached a new low and felt completely worthless. 

In a glimmer of hope, my freshman summer, I had an internship at a prestigious consulting firm. I was placed in a project with one other girl, who happened to be extremely beautiful. However, she wasn't very smart; the only reason she had this internship was because her dad was a partner in the company. Even though I worked harder than her and objectively did more than her, in this male dominated firm, everyone was somehow only interested in her and what she did, and as a result she was able to take credit for most of my work while watching netflix all day. Everyone either ignored me or treated me as an antagonistic nuisance. At the end, she was given a much higher performance rating, and offered a full time opportunity. Even though I used my comp-sci background set up a system which saved the company over $500,000 dollars, she took credit and I was not even offered a re-internship opportunity. 

By that point, I was convinced I could never be happy, or succeed, because of my irreversibly awful looks. I spiraled into depression and tried to OD on medications. However, I failed and woke up later covered in vomit with a massive headache. I also tried to strangle myself, but it was long and painful and I was too weak.


Right now, I am a junior in college. I have 0 friends and nobody ever talks to me. I still work 16+ hours a day because it's what I've always done but it never pays off. At this point, I have no ambitions. Over the holidays and summers, I try to pre-study for my classes and read all my textbooks before the semester starts, since I have given up on applying for internships/summer jobs, but I still can't do well because I'm just not very smart. I have accepted my predicament as a loser, that life is not fair, and have lost touch with reality.

I would end it now if I could. Even after extensive research on suicide techniques, I still can't. I'm too scared if I OD, I may end up with irreversible brain damage. I'm too scared to try to buy a firearm. I'm not strong enough to manually end my life. So yeah. The only joy in my life came from doing well in school. Now that the joy is gone, I have nothing to live for and nothing to offer anyone.

I'm sorry that was so long and wrought with egregious grammar and syntactical mistakes. I wrote it fast. It's ok if no one replies. I just needed to vent my frustration. And I'm sorry I just made it longer."
42e5b1,30,2016-01-23,The toughest thing I do.,FriendlyMD,Residency,https://www.reddit.com/r/Residency/comments/42e5b1/the_toughest_thing_i_do/,"Caring for someone who has given up on caring for herself. This is not because she has a bad vice that she can't lay down like gluttony, smoking or substance abuse. She is this way because her mother gave up on her the moment she was born. She was born with HIV and quickly developed AIDS in a time when prevention is possible and perinatal transmission of HIV can be almost entirely prevented. And now at the age of 20, she is dying. She has grown up surrounded by a community that is mistrustful and associates her disease with promiscuity and risky behavior. Not the reality of the tragedy of her condition. The fact remains that she should be given more support, not isolated and shunned. She is terrified those closest to her will find out and betray her like her mother. She cannot even rely on her family to love her unconditionally. Imagine growing up like that where your mother shuns you and your community finds you vile and infected.

Enter me, an intern of internal medicine, halfway through my first and toughest year. I can feel the pull of the jaded, I could just easily write her off as just another Severe Sepsis ICU patient admitted for aggressive life-saving measures and downgrade her when my job is done. But my soul cries out for her, she needs help - I know this, but I don't know how to reach her. She is too far gone and I need to go home. Talking with her more and more I realize just how hopeless it is. When I read the chart the evidence is damning - she is dying and there is nothing we can do to save her. She has multi-drug resistant AIDS with a CD4 count of zero and a viral load in the millions. She says she wants to live, but she also says she has nothing to live for. And honestly, when I imagine what it’s like to be her, I know I would feel the same way. The saddest thing is I have already taken care of her once this year on the wards. Now I meet her again in the ICU sicker than ever before, the prognosis grim. I want to help her, but treating her disease isn’t the way. We need to treat her community, our society, and her mother. She did not choose this, but she is becoming a martyr of a silenced and isolated caste of untouchables.

We as a society have permitted this by treating AIDS and HIV as taboo. We must do better. We have to.

So I will treat her and I will hopefully turn her around and bring her infection under control until the next time. But knowing how emotionally shattered she is – how awful it is to be living her life. I know that by treating her and making her “better”. I send her back to the anguish and cruelty of her brief life, the only one she has ever known.

42eray,3,2016-01-24,Is it too late to get a summer internship?,currygod,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/42eray/is_it_too_late_to_get_a_summer_internship/,"Hi, junior chemE here finishing up his undergrad. I didn't have very much luck getting an internship last semester and I'm not sure if much hiring is done in our industry during the spring.

I have a 3.1 GPA at a top 5 chemE program and only 4 months of past internship experience at small medical firm based in my hometown (pharma process optimization), so you can imagine that my resume doesn't exactly stand-out. I've been applying online, through my university portal, and exhausting my network connections all year looking for another internship for this summer, but it just hasn't happened yet even though I've gotten some interviews. It's really discouraging seeing everybody around me getting offers and I'm starting to panic.

So, my questions are: 
-when is it too late to get a chemE internship? Are all the good ones gone?
-what's the best way to find companies that are hiring student interns? What's your opinion of university job portals and sites like Indeed.com?
-any tips on how to increase my chances of getting an interview?

Also, I'm paranoid that something in my resume or cover letter is off-putting and hurting my chances. Where can I go to get feedback on my resume?"
42ftyz,11,2016-01-24,I live in poverty and there is no way out of this.,aintnothintodos,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/42ftyz/i_live_in_poverty_and_there_is_no_way_out_of_this/,"I've tried posting on SW before on other accounts, never on here, I don't think my depression can be helped at all but perhaps writing will dispel some of the thoughts nagging me right now. I live in a european country (supposedly a developed one, though it's in a very sorry state despite a lot of major EU policies being decided here), in a single parent household with my two twin brothers and me. My mom is on disability checks because of fibromyalgia. My brothers are doing great in vocational school (horticulturist) despite the harshness of life. I'm a 23 year old college drop out with no income, no will, skills or intention to better myself.

I went to college on grants back in 2012 but around the middle of the year I started going to class less and sleeping in and smoking weed more. I felt awful going to class as I lost interest in a lot of what I was studying for, to the point where I can't even remember why I went in the first place. I was afraid of the other students as well and every time I was absent that feeling of anxiety kept growing. As this went on my weed use ramped up just so I could forget the position I was in. Come the end of the year I made the decision to go back home to my mother and brothers so I could perhaps find work that would bring in money to help out the household; my mom was (and is) out of work due to her fibromyalgia as well as crumbling under debt since she'd taken out a few loans with the intention to pay them back with her job, which she couldn't do.

I went home and started job hunting but didn't put my heart in it and the more I applied and received either no attention or in the best cases, an automated negative reply, the more I faltered. I lost my interest in languages, which could have turned into a passion if I'd not let it go to rust. I lost what sliver of self worth I had because of the constant rejection of job hunting. I kept my friends but felt and still feel like I'm failing them because I'm a shitty person and they think otherwise. You get the picture.

Earlier this year (well, in 2015), I decided I'd try to get out of this 3 year slump. I enrolled in night classes to start working with computers, and things were going alright before classes actually started. With the unemployment benefits I'd saved up over 2 years I managed to buy the tuition for those classes (I think I may have been eligible for grants but administration/bureaucracy and dealing with the application process as well as being examined by the administrative workers fills me with more anxiety than I know how to deal with), I also managed to build my own computer with the rest of that money both because it's the main and only thing I interact with every day but also as a project to help me with upcoming classes. Thanks to a friend who worked in a small company nearby I also got a paid internship for 26hrs/week (+ 12hours of night classes for a 38hour total) that was regulated by the school I was to do my classes at. Things were starting to look up.

I didn't last 2 months at the paid internship thing. My boss had me working 44 hours a week (8-5) on top of the mandatory 12 hours of class a week, half of which I could not attend because of the schedule of public transportation. I didn't mind at first because I was just happy to be employed somewhere but after the first 3 weeks, I realized I was gonna fail my classes because of lack of attendance, so I tried to negotioate the hours with my boss but he wouldn't reduce my schedule claiming that I had a lot to catch up on (being 23 and never having done anything, I kinda agree) to be up to speed with the standards he expected for this kind of work. I approached him again and he shed 1 hour off of the days I had class and said he wouldn't go any lower. I should have taken this to the schoolboard, or the ""union"", or anyone else, but I was distraught and helpless and made an attempt on my life the last weekend I worked there before quitting. Afterwards, I should have had more time for class, but I didn't follow through and quit as well after suffering anxiety attacks systematically as I approached the school.

That leaves me here. I'm still heavily depressed and have been waiting for four months for an appointment with a therapist. I've dropped out of night classes and I'm too afraid to go out of my house. I have no income as the days of mooching off unemployment benefits are over since I was kicked out of the system. We have no money as the poverty has always been present in my life ever since I'm out of high school, and the debt we're in makes it hard to even persist. We have no food left for the months and are expecting a parental alimony that will not come. I'm a piece of shit. I don't know why I wrote all this. I wanted to put it out there. We heat ourselves with recuperated firewood but our stove is seemingly clogged/broken and our power saw just gave out. I don't know man. I can't go on. I don't wanna.

42g2sz,7,2016-01-24,1 months weed free! My story and things I've learned.,TrapMezziah,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/42g2sz/1_months_weed_free_my_story_and_things_ive_learned/,"Long post, TLDR at the bottom.

Background:
I'm a 19 yo who was a steady smoker since I was 15. I first smoked when I was 14 and slowly it took over my life. All my interests were based around weed and so was my social circle. When I moved out to my own place and got a job, weed was more available than ever and I really abused it. I trained, I went to classes, I worked half time, and in the beginning I used weed as a daily reward after a productive day. Of course that didn't last long and it slowly became the only thing I was interested in doing.. and the highs got worse. Overthinking, anxiety, procrastination, feelings of guilt and doubt. I knew I was numbign myself, I knew I was holding myself back... But from what?

I tried quitting 3 times. I went weed-free before for a couple months, but that was back when I had a different life. This time it was harder since all of my close friends including my roomie smoked. They always made it easy to get back in that comfort zone... After I spent 5 days in Amsterdam with some of my friends, rolling around on my hotel bed stoned as fuck I realized this is where it has to end. I was chasing something that was never there. I always wanted to get higher, thinking the next joint would satisfy me. But no substance or object could fill that hole I had in myself. I decided it's time I start focusing and start improving myself to reach my goals.

The most important thing is to realize that weed is not the issue. It is only a result of the way YOU are. Your fears, insecurities, traumas and all other negative experiences you are yet to face within yourself manifest in bad habits. Unless you accept this, quitting will always be temporary. I had to meditate for weeks on end to get to know myself better and find out why I do the things I do. We are all damaged people, that's why we have addictions. I went on a spiritual journey in order to change and be able to be 100% honest and good to myself. After my realization in Amsterdam and a few mushroom trips (psychedelics knock down walls within you) it became clear to me... I had to put in effort to actually recover from my traumas. We all have to nurture our body and soul to keep them in an ideal state, that's bottom line. Quitting weed is actually only a minor part of my journey in self-development.

At the moment I'm doing my internship in Spain and couldn't be happier. The change of environment helps a lot! I still have negative thoughts and old patterns in my behaviour I'd like to change... But I'm over all a very positive and social person. I CANNOT overstress how important habits are. You will never succeed IN ANYTHING MAJOR unless you master the power of habits. In order to do that, you need to look within and stop chasing external pleasures. I suggest meditation, yoga, exercise, reading, good company (real friends who don't use you), and of course being good to yourself. Be aware of your thoughts, why they come to you and how they can benefit you. Learn how to be present and unleash the power of unconditional happiness. Learning how to control your thoughts and actually use your mind, instead of it using you, is very difficult and probably a life-long journey. But every step of that journey is an amazing experience. 

I recommend the book ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle to everyone who is willing to change and achieve real happiness. Also Eliott Hulse's videos motivated me and taught me a lot about self improvement.

TL;DR: Weed is not the problem, it's your way of coping with issues you have not faced within yourself. Find the tools ideal for you and get to work, it's the way to not only quit but become a better person. "
42gk4d,261,2016-01-24,Mourning the loss of R5s? Ever wanted to play in your own LCS? Come compete with us at CompeteLeague – Announcing our new site!,Mindmesser,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/42gk4d/mourning_the_loss_of_r5s_ever_wanted_to_play_in/,"
Hi, I’m Liam, the director of [CompeteLeague](https://lol.competeleague.com/). We’ve been around the League of Legends scene for almost three years now, completing several tournaments and doing our best to improve and give a professional experience to a wide variety of players. 

**tl;dr**

If you’re interested in competing or being involved in a weekly broadcasted LoL league, we’re hosting 3 month leagues for Bronze &amp; Silver, Gold &amp; Platinum, Diamond &amp; Up that are open to all. We're operating in NA and EUW, more info below. Qualifiers for the broadcasted leagues are starting in 2 weeks, and teams that don't qualify will still be able to play in our non-broadcasted leagues. Check out our [Website](https://lol.competeleague.com/) and our subreddit [r/CompeteLeague](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompeteLeague/). 

**About CompeteLeague** 

CompeteLeague launched 3 years ago as a small venture for League of Legends competition with the goal of bringing a competitive scene to gamers of every level. We had only 1 league featuring 8 teams. We had 4 casters and only about 10 people on staff. Needless to say, it was very hard to run, and quickly we learned to be more prepared and to plan out our structure. Following our first successful season we had a chance to broaden our staff and host 3 leagues at the same time, featuring a total of 24 teams. Our staff had grown to over 30 people for North American League of Legends. We tracked player’s stats, helped them on game day, and answered many, many questions. It required long hours of work, and it paid off. It was a very fun and successful season. Recently we’ve taken several months off to improve our service across the board and create a much improved environment for the players, we’re now expanding from only featuring League of Legends in North America to EUW LoL, and will be looking to do our first game expansion to CS:GO next year. 

**What We Need**

We need you! As a player, as a viewer, as a eSport enthusiast, as a volunteer, we're back and looking to fully develop our community and work well within the LoL one. Our site is ready for signups and teams registering for competition, and our qualifiers will be in the next few weeks to set up our first season with our new format. Our stream will be beginning with it and we'll want anyone interested to come watch and cheer for our teams. We're also always looking for interested community members who would like to get involved in an eSports setting, we have several roles that are open (casters, organisers, writers etc.), and plenty to offer for our volunteers (more information below). We've spent about a year on creating this website – however we're not a big organisation and haven't had the manpower or time to do comprehensive testing. As such please report any bugs that you find on our site to the thread in our subreddit

**Scheduling**

What we plan to do is offer a competitive scene for players of lower skill brackets in matchmaking. Currently our brackets for LoL will be as follows:

Bronze &amp; Silver | Gold &amp; Platinum | Diamond &amp; Up
-------------|----------------|----------
Mondays | Tuesdays | Wednesdays
5-10 PM GMT/EST | 5-10 PM GMT/EST | 5-10 PM GMT/EST

**Format**

Every team that signs up will be able to play, whether it’s before the season, or in the middle of the season. Our leagues will feature Premier Leagues and Open Leagues. 
The Premier League will have 10 locked in teams playing twice each week for eight weeks, and will be streamed and casted on our [twitch channel](http://twitch.tv/CompeteLeague). Each team will play every other team twice in a round robin format, and league position will be determined by win/loss ratio. Here is an example of a week’s schedule for a Premier League.

Time | B | R | Streamed?
:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------
5 PM |Team1| Team2 | Yes
5 PM |Team3 |Team4 | No (1)
5 PM |Team5 |Team6|  No (2) 
6 PM |Team7 |Team8 |Yes
6 PM |Team9 |Team10 | No (1) 
6 PM| Team3 |Team2 | No (2) 
7 PM| Team1| Team4 | Yes 
7 PM| Team5 |Team10 | No (1) 
8 PM |Team6| Team8 | Yes 
8 PM| Team7 |Team9| No (1)

Our Open Leagues also run for 8 weeks, parallel to the Premier Leagues, and will have each team playing 2 weekly games. Teams will be able to join up for an open league and have their first match in between 7 and 13 days. League position is determined by points, each win earning a team 3 points, each loss earning a team 1 point, and missing a game resulting in -1 point. At the end of both our Premier League and our Open league, we host playoff/promotion tournaments to determine the league's outright winners happen over the space of 5 weeks. If you want more information on our leagues/format, we have an excellent set of (clickable!) infographics on our [leagues page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/leagues/format) on our site.

**Pricing**

Totally free: we've no interest in charging you money. Our primary revenue stream is going to be sponsorship, if you're curious about that there's more information about it on our site. 

**Qualifying**

For teams signing up for the first season, there will be a qualifier tournament for each Premier League, the top 10 teams will move into the Premier League, while all other teams will participate in the Open League. After this tournament all new sign up teams will be entered into the Open Leagues and have to qualify for Premier Leagues through promotion. Yearly (or every 3 seasons) there will be a hard reset where we host a new qualifying tournament and refresh all our teams into appropriate leagues. 

**Smurfing policy**

We have two years of experience with similarly formatted leagues and have several developed ways to detect smurfing. We won’t be disclosing all of our methods of detecting smurfs, but we comb through each individual’s profile very thoroughly to make sure their entry into our leagues is genuine, and we’ve proven to be very effective in our other leagues. Finding smurfs in our leagues always results in immediate expulsion. If you want the full details on what we do to deal with smurfing it's available on our site's [FAQ Page](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq).

**Prizes**

Each tournament will be prized, we're working with Riot to provide RP/skins appropriate to such a long format of competition, and, though we have nothing to promise as of yet, we're also open to sponsor provided prizing. 

**Casting/Stream details**

Each premier league will have 4 games casted each week, and teams will have an equal amount of casted games throughout the season. We will have a professional broadcast for each Premier League each week, and during the stream we’ll be looking to do audience giveaways, whether they be for skins/steam games/RP/anything else. When we have it set up properly, throughout the streams you’ll be able to enter the raffle (opening at random times during the games).

**Joining/working with CompeteLeague**

As mentioned previously, we’re looking to bring in new volunteers to help us prepare and run our seasons. You might ask if these positions aren’t paid then what do we offer? We look to give people experience in roles/jobs that they’d like to do, whether that be for heading into eSports (a notable past example of ours being Dominic ‘Sata’ Roemer who now casts for Riot in the Chinese LPL) or more traditional work (an example being a graphic designer of ours Andrew Phiz, who now interns with a graphic/web design company). We’re happy to recommend and help build up portfolios for dedicated members. You can apply for positions from your account page when you sign up (you needn't be a player to apply!) The different positions we have for volunteers are:

- Streamer

A position as the streaming host for one of our leagues. Entails working closely with admins and casters, streaming for 4 to 5 hours one night a week, spectating and catching the key moments of our games. Solid internet connection required, second monitor/second device to communicate with while broadcasting highly preferred. 

- Shoutcaster

A position as a caster for one of our leagues. Entails casting at least 2 games a week, working closely with admins, streamers, and fellow casters. Game knowledge and fluidity of speech highly preferred. It’s a fairly sought after position, so it’s likely that we’ll hold tryouts for casters depending on how many applications we receive. 

- Assistant

A position as a general busybody. Can entail covering for several other roles, and generally involved working closely with an Admin to share responsibility and keep contact between staff open at most times. Also a good position to apply for when unsure about what you’d prefer to do with CompeteLeague, as it gives the opportunity to perform and observe multiple positions.

- Graphic Designer

A position doing graphical work. Entails any number of graphics works, be that infographics, site backgrounds, stream overlays, achievement icons, article images, or anything else. There’s always graphic work to be done. A good design program preferred, past experience is helpful but not necessary, we have graphic work for many different levels of skill.

- Video Editor

A position producing video content for our social medias and our site. This is a creative position, and can range from highlight montages, to informational videos, to promotional videos, to any other content. Video editing software required, past experience/somewhat of a video portfolio preferred.

- Web Developer

A position helping expand and develop features for our website. We have a small dedicated team of developers working on our site, this position would entail becoming part of that group and helping share out the workload. Some experience/developing education preferred. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, or PHP required. Knowledge of AngularJS and/or NodeJS will stand you in very good stead. 

- Organizer

A position as the first line of contact between our players and CompeteLeague staff. Entails learning and understanding our rules and organisation, helping teams with common issues, setting up and moderating games, working closely with Admins, Assistants, and the playerbase. 

- Writer (currently not-listed)

CompeteLeague is also going to be expanding into hosting articles covering our leagues, eSports, and further topics. The article submission system that we’re looking to build and set up is still a while away from being completed however, so this position is not currently listed. However - Soon^™.

**What Makes us Different?**

Experience. We’ve been doing this for years now, and we’ve seen organizations with similar goals come and go. We always reach out to orgs, offer to help with advice, cross promotions, and share casters, but many are not prepared for a task of this proportion. We’ve had a long time to prepare our site and our staff for this upcoming season. Hopefully you can be a part of either helping the site, or playing in one of our leagues!

That being said, I only have good things to say about one particular operation that's shown up recently, while we've been remaking our site/everything this year, doing something similar to us: [r/HP5v5](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseparty5v5/) I like these guys a lot, they operate on weekends (for any of you who want something like this but aren't up for our Monday – Wednesday evenings timing). 

**FAQ**

Well first of all there's a FAQ available on our [site](https://lol.competeleague.com/#/contact/faq) which you can check out, but here's some common ones.

*What is the difference between the Open Leagues and the Premier Leagues?*

Well, our Premier Leagues are the more exclusive league of the two. Games from this league will be streamed and casted, and teams are set from the first week (barring removal from the league). In the Open League, any number of teams can join at any point in the system and be playing within a week, and the top teams will have a chance to move up to Premier the following season, depending on their rank and status in the league. If a Premier League team is removed for any reason, the top Open League team will be promoted and participate in the Premier League. The Open League is a slightly lesser experience, but one of the most requested features by viewers of our past leagues, where we only had premier leagues and teams that found us at the wrong times couldn’t sign up or play.

*What if my team needs to reschedule?*

The website has requesting reschedules as a feature when you’re a team in our leagues. You will be able to request a reschedule via your account page, however, the request must be 48 hours before the match is scheduled AND the other team must accept the reschedule request. While we know emergencies happen, your team is responsible for showing up to the games on time. To help with unexpected situations/problems we advise including substitutes on your team’s roster. When a request is scheduled the teams involved must organise an appropriate time to play, relay information to staff, and play the match within the coming week.

*What if I don’t have a team and I want to play?*

There’s a feature for free agents on the site. When you sign up solo you’re placed on a public free agents list, where teams and other players will be able to see you and add you on LoL from the site and send invites to their team. All users have a profile page where they can list their preferred means of contact (email/skype/summoner name etc.) We also have a thread over at r/competeleague for players looking to find teams! 

*What happens if I rank up during the season?*

We have always celebrated improvement and will continue to do so. You may continue to compete in the league you are in with the team you are on, however, if you’re dropped from the active roster you CANNOT rejoin that specific league. You are encouraged and welcome to join the league that is fitting of your new ELO.

*Can I play on more than one team?*

For one game? No. There are no exceptions to this rule, however if you would like you can participate in different teams for multiple games with CompeteLeague, such as if you wanted to participate in both a LoL tournament, and a CS:GO tournament (Our CS:GO site is in development, likely to be released and operational in 2016).

*I have a not frequently asked question.*

Ask away, I and any other members of our staff around will be hopping around the comment section to answer anything that we can. That being said, this is our alpha season with this new LoL format, while we have a lot of information, we might not be decided on something. We’ll let you know if we’re still undecided about a question you have. 

**Clarity edit:** This is for EUW and NA - you can change the region to NA by clicking it on the nav bar on the site.

**Edit 2:** This has been awesome - we've had over 500 people register with the website so far, I look forward to playing/working with all of you! Thanks for the support - I've been answering your questions for 9 hours straight now though so I'm gonna get some sleep. Here are a few more of the common questions you guys have had so hopefully my absence won't be missed too much:

- *How/Where do I apply for X position?*

Our application form on our website has been temporarily hidden, so in the meantime the correct way to apply for a position is to answer the questions in this google document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EOLbwkt_T0uvIzGegPyBnto3Pa1HZ9ikbIV74cY-VYc/edit?usp=sharing And email the answers to admins@competeleague.com

- *My rune page check failed, help?*

Few things to double check - first make sure that you actually save the rune page name, and that when you copy the number over you don't have a space in the name you save. If that doesn't work, try logging out going to the homepage and hitting Shift + F5, then logging in and registering again. If that doesn't work then you should fill out a bug report in this thread in our subreddit: https://redd.it/42g3ug

- *I have a different bug (error message/position list is wrong/other)* 

You should fill out a bug report in this thread in our subreddit: https://redd.it/42g3ug

*any further issues you can email us about at admins@competeleague.com or me personally at mindmesser@competeleague.com and we'll get back to you in the next few days. Goodnight!*"
42gwlu,4,2016-01-24,I [23 M] probably screwed everything up with a great girl [21 F] and it sucks.,TicketForSadTrain,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42gwlu/i_23_m_probably_screwed_everything_up_with_a/,"Just an up front declaration: I have no idea what advice, if any, I'm looking for. It's entirely possible I just want to vent to strangers. I'm out of sorts and haven't slept well in several days, so I apologize if this has no discernible direction. 

So, this girl who I will call Jen in this story. We met a few years ago at uni in a social thing that lasted a semester, in my senior year and her freshman year. There wasn't a whole lot of interaction afterwards aside from Facebook birthday posts and the occasional like of each other's stuff, until last year around spring break she posted that she needed a ride to the airport some morning. I messaged her and we figured out I totally could, then after that interaction we started really talking. Over the next few months we went out and saw movies, I gave her some lessons on how to drive since she was about to test for her license, sometimes just random flirty conversations on Snapchat and the like.

The problem, I think (this could just be excuse-making. if it sounds like that, please, blast me), begins with the fact that I've had some pretty awful relationships, and the only time I wasn't the more invested individual was a relationship that we were both in a pretty shitty spot to be dating anyone that lasted 2 months. That was several years ago and I had basically forgotten what it feels like to have someone be into me and how to respond to that, so when it started happening with Jen, I kinda freaked out. I re-evaluated what she meant to me for days at a time and, against all logic, decided she was just someone I liked watching movies with. Even though we always cuddled during the movies and I'd walk her to her door and hug her good night afterwards. Typing this makes me want to punch that version of me in the face, Christ, what an idiot, right?

Sometime after classes were done for the summer, I texted her to see what she was up to and she was at a friend's place, drinking. She asked if I could pick her up and take her home, so I said sure, picked her up, took her home. I asked if she needed anything else and she said I could get her some water while she went to the bathroom, which I did. Then she invited me into her bedroom. Neat! I'm super awkward, so we just sat on her bed for a bit while talking. She said she should sleep, I made to wish her good night, then she asked if I wanted to stay in her bed. Being that I am all kinds of horny, tired, and lazy at this moment, I said yes. We really just kept on talking until she popped the smoothest line I've ever heard: ""I'm curious how good you are at kissing.""

Were this some kind of movie or sitcom, the proper response would be to answer with action rather than words. I can't grunt as well as Di Caprio, so this was not a movie. I started by saying ""You should know that I'm not very good at dating"", intending to clarify that this was probably a one-time thing and she shouldn't expect a relationship from this. Past-Me would have a face of pulp if I could get to that guy. We came to an agreeable set of terms, and then we were making out until 10 in the morning and it was fantastic. She went to shower, I went to go home, and that was that. A couple weeks later, she went home to China for the summer, and I thought that chapter was pretty much over. Past-Me really needs a curbstomp.

While she's away, I continually reevaluate this situation and come to more conclusions than I can count. I can never see her again, I have to tell her I can never see her again, I have to tell her I have feelings for her, I have to tell her I feel like I can never see her again, and so on. I have no idea what I'm doing, which is even more difficult to believe by the fact she made a few Instagram posts that were inside jokes directed at me *and I liked them!* Despite this, I was not convinced I had romantic feelings for her or that I even could. Aside from my toilings, the summer is mostly uneventful.

She gets back shortly before classes start for fall, and I still haven't come to any conclusions, so I don't start any interactions. At some point early in the semester she replaced her phone and made a FB post about it, so I texted her with a generic ""Hey this is __!"" and that was the first we talked since we kissed. A few weeks later I ask if we can watch a movie, and since The Intern wasn't playing at a time we could work with, we cuddle on my couch and watch Blues Brothers. After the movie and she wants to get home, she kisses me. My confusion reaches a new height, and then began to fade as I started to understand that I wouldn't have done all this (arranging that movie night was a pain for various reasons) if I didn't really like her.

We hang out a few times after that, and from what I can tell, it pretty much was dating. I wanted it to be dating. But we never talked about it. Even worse, because we never talked about it, and I didn't want to pull a Mosby and say anything too committal too soon, a couple times I started to make a dumb joke that, if I weren't a proper fool, would have me as the punchline, but since that would imply too much, I'd shift it to some generic non-person. Classically known as, ""The Worst."" This anxiety came up a couple other times, like when I called her four or five times freaking out about us being in an undefined relationship status. Thankfully she was in the shower and that gave me time to chill the hell out.

As the semester went on and she got busier with classes and other things, hanging out grew less frequent, and by the time I was sure I wanted to have the ""are we definitely dating because that would be awesome"" conversation, she was always occupied with other things. To be clear, I don't see this as an issue. The last time I got to see her that semester she mentioned she had a lot of homework, so I made some teriyaki chicken and surprised her at her apartment door so she could not have to worry about dinner. She thought it was really sweet even though she doesn't usually like surprises, but I didn't bring the topic of Us up then because I figured she wouldn't want to discuss it with her other stuff on her mind. I would later attempt to surprise her a couple more times (once breakfast, another cheesecake, both rejected) because I'm an idiot. Then the semester was over, I was still texting her good morning/good night messages every day, but she was going home for winter break. This time I got WeChat so I could message her while she was away, which was difficult because of time zones, but I don't think it had any particular effect on the trajectory of our relationship.

Winter break comes and goes, and the day she flies back into the States I go buy a half-dozen flowers and leave them at her door. She really liked that, and I thought that was great. Then I tried to surprise her with cheesecake, which went less well. Still texting her on the daily, but haven't been able to arrange anything - until last week, when I ask if she wants to get dinner at this place I've wanted to try on Friday. She says yeah, I make the reservation, dinner goes...well, she didn't enjoy it very much, but due to the food. It seems fine to me, and on the way back I'm basically mentally preparing myself for the conversation of what we are. We're both rather quiet, so I don't think the lack of conversation in the car was strange to either of us. I pull into her lot, she goes to get out, and I tell her I have something to ask her, and ask about our relationship.

She agreed that things with us were weird, we talked about a few things, then she asked me what I wanted in our relationship. I said ""I wouldn't mind trying"", because again, I didn't want to say anything too strong. She also asked why I like her and, as I am awful at feelings when I'm on the spot, I simply said ""It's just one of those things I know."" We talked a little bit more about things that ultimately don't matter right now, before she said she should go and I walked her to her door. We hugged, said good night, and that's currently the last time I've seen her.

After I got home I went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror as I realized I can't let that be the actual answer to these things. So I went to WeChat and sent an enormous message of the things I like about her, along with the first time I noticed all of them - her laugh, her particular style of photography, a number of other things. That was still Friday night. Yesterday had no response. Then, as I was being driven up a literal cliff in a really bizarre dream at around 5 AM this morning, she responded, and I awoke to it. It was long. It basically said that she liked me a lot initially, but little things I'd done sent messages. Some of them were slightly misunderstood, which is still my fault, but most of them? I can't deny that I was pretty shitty. She said she's done trying and doesn't want to be someone who ""stayed in America for a guy and didn't marry him"" because us breaking up would have way bigger consequences for her than for me.

And she's right. The way I've expressed things hasn't been very indicative of someone who wants to be in it for the long haul, and I was okay with expressing things like that because I didn't want to scare her off. But now here we are and I just feel like a putz.

I did respond immediately, and tried to clarify my reasons and intents for being so non-committal, but I'm afraid the damage is done. I asked if she would be willing to meet me and talk about it again, whether it be for closure or for reconciliation, but I can't say I'm too optimistic. And I can't say I don't deserve it.

So here I am. I'd appreciate any advice on anything. Obviously I need to communicate better in the future, to myself as well as prospective romantic partners, and not be afraid to put out there that I'm looking for a serious relationship. But suggestions on anything pertinent, I'd appreciate.
   
**tl;dr**: I was confused about my feelings and didn't admit to myself I was really into a girl, then when I tried to define the relationship I basically made shit up and now I think we're done here."
42hbv2,18,2016-01-24,Unsure what to do financially with this next trip... I'm the only one paying for tickets,ARapForYourThoughts,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/42hbv2/unsure_what_to_do_financially_with_this_next_trip/,"
I just wanted to preface by saying I love my boyfriend. He's a sweetheart, a wonderful guy, accepting and sweet. He's amazing! I do enjoy my relationship and appreciate him! I'd really like some constructive advice, though, as I'm unsure how to handle this situation.

First of all, he's an engineering major and doing very well in school. I'm proud of him! He goes to school full time, and works hard. I'll also be going back to school soon as a full time student (online) but I just started a new, better paying job, so held off for a month. I've held a FT job and school before, so it's nothing new to me. My SO doesn't work, though he used to occasionally tutor.

My SO and I are hoping to move in together by summer of next year. This would require me saving money and uprooting to relocate closer to him, almost 2k miles away. When we first discussed doing this in October, my SO promised he would start looking into PT work to help out with, not just moving costs, but costs for his visits inbetween,

In Dec, he visited with money he got for Christmas/his parents bought him a ticket here. We split things almost equally, and it was fine. He still, however, had not looked for a job. I don't generally mind. I do send him money occasionally (he never asks) - but I've sent him close to 150 just for misc stuff like food on campus. I've spent 200 on presents since Oct. Again. That's all fine. I don't mind doing these things for him, because who doesn't enjoy being spoiled? He does what he can in return! :)

It's January, and he still hasn't found a job, but not for lack of not having any calls.. But lack of looking. He's been promising me since Oct that he'll look for something, but it never happens. I redid his resume, I helped him look for tutoring jobs he could do, or even internships, and I feel like he promises he'll do something and then refuses to follow through.

This last Friday he put in his first two applications for tutoring. I was SO proud of him for finally doing that! He promised this Saturday he would do the test (they both require one) before or after he does homework. He did neither. I asked him today, and he said he would only do one of the tests.

He's supposed to visit for Spring Break (his birthday is during then), and then spend all summer here. This is taking a good chunk of my paycheck. He'll likely get $200 for his birthday and help out best he can, but just the ticket for the week is $300, then $100 for gas and a hotel to even get him from the city he'll fly in to... Then $$ for food and his birthday present. But it's only a week, and I don't know if I'll be wasting the money. 7 weeks later I'd be flying him out once more to live here for 3 months. He said he would look for a job whilst he lived here, but, I don't really believe him after all the times he's said that before.

I'm putting away 80% of my money into savings to afford the plane flight and to support him whilst he's here, and despite his promises to look for work to help out, he's not doing it... It's starting to get a bit frustrating. :/ I'm not mad or resentful, and I hope I don't come across as such. He IS a FT student with a STEM based major, but even him working VERY PT like he planned would really help with some costs.

I guess I'm just looking for some serious, constructive advice. I don't know if I should just tell him I can't afford the March trip, and save that money for the summer (when I'm a bit better off financially?) or what?

Thank you ♥"

Looking for companies in the loop/River North/ West Town that would be interested in having extra hands on a project while allowing me to grow and learn in an active way. Looking for this summer, but other seasons are fair game as well. Any tips or resources for these positions is greatly appreciated.

Some questions-
Where are optimal places to look for these positions? Many do not seem to be posted on the general job-search websites.

Am I seeking an internship too early on? Should I be waiting for next summer when I am closer to finishing my degree, especially since I have full time work already?

What projects do hiring companies want to see for entry level or interns? I have a GitHub but it's mainly been used for very basic Android projects out of a book. Most other projects originated from school (free time is very limited). 

What helps a good intern / entry level candidate stand out?

42iqqx,2,2016-01-24,"Me [21 F] with my ___ [52F] mother; I can't tell if I'm being emotionally manipulated, or if she's justified. Help me figure this out?",crystalvision3455,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42iqqx/me_21_f_with_my_52f_mother_i_cant_tell_if_im/,"PLEASE, PLEASE READ GUYS.

I don't even know where to start. Let me give you some background information first.

I'm from a middle-class/lower-middle class family. Both my parents are working class and never went to college. My brother and I both attend private, 4 year colleges, and are helped a lot by financial aid. My brother is helped more than me though (he did better in school than me -- was a straight A student, whereas I got A's and B's). I pay roughly 18,000/yr. I can usually pay a little of that (I'm required to pay $3500 upfront each semester), but I couldn't this semester because I have no money right now. Last semester, I was able to pay $3500 of the bill because I worked two jobs during the summer and saved up. Other than that, everything is covered by loans. 

So, this semester, I had to take out a private loan to cover the $3500. I work during the semester (10-15 hrs/wk at the library), but didn't make nearly enough last semester to even come close to paying that. 

My parents help me out financially as much as they can (which is not a lot, but I don't blame or resent them for that). Let me tell you about my mother now. 

My mother has always, always, always, as long as I could remember, been a very uptight person. Ever since I got a boyfriend during my first semester of college, things have gotten A LOT worse. I never had had a bf before, and it was all new to me. We had sex after 4 months of dating. She needed to know EVERYTHING. She tracked my phone bill to see how much we were texting, she would call him and leave him messages on his phone asking where I was when I didn't respond to her texts. She hooked up a landline in my dorm room, and when she suspected I was at my bf's dorm, she would call the landline to confirm her suspicion when I didn't pick up. Then she proceeded to call me a slut and disgusting for having sex with him, and condemned me for wanting to get on birth control.

My bf eventually broke up with me, and then came all the ""I told you so!"" ""See?!? He wasn't right for you; you should always listen to your mother. Motherly instincts!!!"" Etc. etc. Anyway.

She also has always felt as though I'm not ""taking advantage of the college experience"". I have a 3.6 GPA, I work 10-15 hours a week, I have an internship for a chapter at my school, and last semester I also tutored at a nearby school. I applied for a writing internship this semester that hopefully I'll get too. But ALWAYYYYYS she says how I could be doing all of this at a state school, and that I ""don't belong at that school."" I already have a low as fuck self-esteem already, and hearing her say that I should be attending community college stings (not that anything is wrong with community college -- she just says it in a way that implies that there is). I get that I'm not some overachieving, extremely impressive student, (i.e. my brother), but I think I'm doing okay? 

Fast-forward to the most recent problem. After I moved in this semester, my mom came to visit me and bring me a few more things. Classes hadn't started yet, and a few hours before she came, a few friends and I were smoking weed in the dorm room next to mine. When she came, she smelled it. She didn't say anything, but I could tell by her face. She barely talked to me the next day (she usually calls everyday), so I knew something was up and that she was going to explode on me pretty soon.

She calls me to ""talk about the details of the loan"" (by the way -- the loans are brought up every day of my life. I can't go a day without being reminded of all the money I owe. I know it's important. But everyday? Why?), but then starts to freak out on me about how I'm such a disappointment of a daughter, and that I sicken her, etc. etc. Horrible phone call. Then she sends me a string of texts. 

""Not sure why you want to live a lie.""
(me: How am I living a lie?)
""Only you know. I won't worry about the loans since you're not."" 
""Continue to play your games. I am concerned of our financial situation. You are immature and think it's all fun and games. It is going to be too late when you realize how much you screwed up.""
""I am cancelling the loan. Done playing games.""
(I don't respond)
""Hello""
""Wtf""
""We are not playing your games we have tried to help you and you keep screwing off so if that's what you need to do, go for it.""
""I will call and cancel loan and your phone now. Good luck. Maybe [my friend whose on welfare] can help you get on welfare - you'll need it! Or maybe your new boyfriend who you won't tell us about.""
""And glad you stocked up on birth control on dad's insurance because you will be removed from that soon as well."" 

Anyway, I didn't hear from her for the rest of hte night. Then at 2am, she sends me these texts:

""We know you are not at school right now.""
""Loan is cancelled.""
""Have fun! :)""
""You make us so proud.""

I was at school; asleep in my dorm actually. She thought I was out partying somewhere. I woke up to those texts and 3 missed calls from her and got such anxiety from it. That's what sucks -- it makes me so stressed. 

Then she texts me at 7am:

""You hooked up with a bunch of idiots that smoke weed and drink and find yourself some mysterious bf that you won't tell us about but expect us to be there for you financially and then shit on us""
""I am not the one with the problem I actually care and love you too much and cannot stand by while you do this""
""I think you should look into taking time off, paying your loans, and maybe mature some""
""You are such a liar""

Then I asked her to give me some space and leave me alone. She sent this string of texts:

""Believe me this sucks and I don't enjoy it at all. I was awake until 230 this morning wondering where the fuck you are and if you're going to be fucking dead. I wish I could be a parent like all of your cool friends and not give a fuck.""
""You know I wish I didn't love you like I do because that would feel so much easier to not care""

The following morning, she called me at 6:45 am (Sunday morning) and called me a scumbag maggot that sucks off her parents and throws them under the bus. She said I don't belong in college, I should be in community college and working full time at the supermarket (which is where I work in the summers, along with another job).

Also, when she found condoms in my drawer last semester, it initiated a looooong rampage of her calling me a slut, a whore, saying how I disgust her and that she can't believe her daughter is a whore. Sending me links to articles ""when you should have sex with a man"" and even fucking memes ""Be Princess Diana --- not a Kardashian"" wtf? Lol. 

About the real me: I don't drink. I'll smoke weed on the weekends with my friends and bf, but the stress of loans and shit is making me wanna smoke it a lot more tbh. I have a bf of 4 months that she won't fucking find out about -- don't want another episode of her calling him ugly, unworthy, etc., and calling his cell and asking where I am (also -- she called my ex's dad to make sure he was aware that we were having sex) like she did with my ex. 

Another thing that bothers me is that she always compares me to other girls. She'll talk about her friends' daughters -- how they all have their heads on straight and live in reality, unlike me. They're ""moral"" and ""nice"" girls, unlike me. I'm just an attention-seeker, and she's embarrassed of me. And then she says how all my friends who she deems as ""nice and moral"" probably make fun of me behind my back. And she hates the friends I've made at school (why?!?! No idea! They're awesome people. Not heavy drinkers or smokers, like she thinks). She says I befriend ""desperate, ugly, fat, pathetic"" people, and doesn't understand why I surround myself with that. 

It's so confusing though. Because she'll do things like bake me brownies, bring me snacks to my dorm, calls me everyday (idk -- i think that shows how much she cares about me), and helps me find a private loan with a low interest rate. She'd be there in a second -- dropping everything -- if I needed her. So this whole thing is so confusing.

I love her so much, but I resent her so much at the same time. 

My dad says that she's a cruel psycho who expects everyone to be perfect, and when they're not, she belittles them in order to make herself feel better. That she's just like her mother. That he feels like he's stuck with her for the rest of his life, and that he feels trapped. She berates my little brother too, and he has said that she makes him feel like he wants to kill himself when he gets super angry from her. I know he doesn't fully mean it, but he's only 15. Isn't that a huge red flag?

But then when she's being nice to him, he all of the sudden sides with her and says I'm lazy and could be doing much better at school, and shouldn't be getting B's. Like what dad?!?! He also told me how he's waiting for my little brother to graduate high school, and then he's moving out and finding an apartment to live in or something. Like ok dad... didn't really want to know that. 

THE WORST PART IS IS THAT I FEEL LIKE SHE'S RIGHT. That I fucking suck and am a fucking bad kid. Like why aren't I awesome, why isn't she proud of me? Why aren't I doing great things that she can be proud of? What the fuck? You know?? I'm in no way a perfect little angel -- I've even called her a bitch to her face, and sometimes I ignore her completely. But it's like, am I reallllllly that bad? 

Help me reddit. Don't even know what I'm asking.

I don't even know where to start. Let me give you some background information first.

I'm from a middle-class/lower-middle class family. Both my parents are working class and never went to college. My brother and I both attend private, 4 year colleges, and are helped a lot by financial aid. My brother is helped more than me though (he did better in school than me -- was a straight A student, whereas I got A's and B's). I pay roughly 18,000/yr. I can usually pay a little of that (I'm required to pay $3500 upfront each semester), but I couldn't this semester because I have no money right now. Last semester, I was able to pay $3500 of the bill because I worked two jobs during the summer and saved up. Other than that, everything is covered by loans.

So, this semester, I had to take out a private loan to cover the $3500. I work during the semester (10-15 hrs/wk at the library), but didn't make nearly enough last semester to even come close to paying that.

42ja0l,4,2016-01-24,So many things!,OdysseyEclipse,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/42ja0l/so_many_things/,"It seems like this month has been crazy. This isn't a rant so much as a list... There's good and bad and so much it's overwhelming. It's just been pent up at this point and I need it out and on paper so to speak.

The bad
I may be losing my job soon, as well as insurance due to the company going under/being absorbed. Either way, there is 0 protection for pay, leave, or other aspects of my job. My degree is essentially worthless due to lack of professional experience in the technical aspects, which makes it hard to even get interviews. Hubs is in school and his coverage sucks. His ""job"" is a startup that has him as a contractor, so no coverage there either... He may be leaving for most of the rest of my pregnancy for an internship. Cue fear of him not making it back for the birth. And I have a house remodel that has gone from long term to very short.

The good
Little one does not seem to have his daddy's heart defect, and I will get to see the specialist (and baby) again at 32 weeks. I feel like I'm definitely showing now. I'm certain I finally felt  a few kicks from little George. I have anterior placenta, so it's been a big deal waiting. Hubs has made a few vocalizations about excitement, emotional attachment which is hard for him. We managed to get into a birth class just in case Hubs' internship doesn't bring him back in time for one. My hospital is baby friendly, which is super awesome news! I cleaned the bassinet from my infancy, so other than a mattress, we have clothes, diapers, and a bed for the little one's first few months. And finally, we have a kitchen floor again! Just have to get cabinets and paint done before the big bathroom remodel and I can nest properly.

Overall, I can't complain too much, but even with all the good stuff, the bad stuff still scares me. I know we will make it, I just don't know how yet. I'm sure a few of you lovelies can relate to that aspect, huh? Thank you guys for just being a safe place. Even just coming to read your stories is a help."
42jkok,3,2016-01-24,[23F] left out by co workers,thrwawayfrienddrama,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42jkok/23f_left_out_by_co_workers/,"Backstory-- After college, I decided to take an internship fairly far away from where the rest of my friends work.  There are about 8 interns in the company, and I live with the only two male ones [22m &amp; 25m].

Since graduation, I have basically only hung out with my roommates... the other interns have shown little interest in me. Recently, I have noticed all they (my roommates) do is talk crap about all of the other interns and how they think they are so much better than them.  This slowly started to rub me the wrong way...  However, all the other interns strive to be my roommates best friends.  When I have attempted to hang out with the other interns, I invite them over and they always seem to ditch me to go hang out with my roommates instead.  

The final straw was the other night, I went to bed before my roommates got home and was reading with the lights off when I heard them through the wall talking crap about me... since then, I haven't tried to hang out with them any more (I'm still nice/professional at work...but I mainly just hang out in my room when I'm at home now)...but I feel now they are trying to go have big get-togethers with the other interns (this never happened before) and taking pictures and posting them everywhere (I'm assuming to make sure I see them) and I feel like if they started talking crap about me, everyone would believe them just because they want to be accepted.  My one roommate is very similar to Regina George-- very attractive and charming and able to get his way with anyone.  Am I wrong to stop trying to be these people's friends?  Or should I suck it up and continue to follow the group?

I'm very hurt by what they said about me, and I feel like they are probably dramatizing it to everyone to make me look bad.
Part of me just wishes everyone knew what my roommates say about them behind their backs...Sorry, I'm just rambling now...

**tl;dr**: Should I continue to hang out with people that are mean to each other behind their backs?  Am I in the wrong to just continue to hang out by myself and be a little lonely for the next 6 months?"

Howdy! I'm a 24 year old divorcee in Dallas, TX. No kids (although he really pushed me for them). Got baptized in the church when I was 18, went online to one of those dumb mormon dating websites, and met my ex. I was 19 when I married him in the temple. Putting my many problems with TSCC aside, my ex was extremely abusive and it got physical towards the very end of our marriage. I was extremely unhappy. Shortly before my divorce process, I started a new internship a year ago (right before I graduated college) and made a very close friend who could tell that things were not right in my life. my already weak faith crumbled within a matter of days. I took my garments off, drink coffee, and accepted an invite out to happy hour for my first drink. My ex tried to Bring me back in, saying that he would change and that being in TSCC together was the only way. But I just couldn't do it. That's when the divorce process began. I got divorced at 23 and haven't looked back. 

So what's your story, r/exmormon? Who are you? Are you married? Do you have kids? How old are you? Did you grow up in TSCC? Where do you live?

I was eating about 2000 calories a day without exercise. Now, on a good day I can do 1200 calories with 2 hours of cardio. 1500 and no workout on a bad day. Lots of veg, lots of water!

After day 6 of this, I am now typing this in bed with a 103 degree fever. I'm wondering if suddenly going to the gym and being on a strict diet has anything to do with it or I just happened to get sick right when I started my diet. It seems unlikely that its related, but I don't get sick like this very often. Once every 3 years, if even. If it really is the former, I'd love to hear how to avoid this again. Being ill sucks."

I'm really just at a loss right now. 

A little background on me - I've always struggled with body images, but nothing super crazy. I'm 5'4 and currently somewhere around 130 pounds. I have always been a ""normal"" weight and never really made concerted efforts to lose weight until recently. I went through a pretty significant and difficult breakup in May 2015, which started my issues with food that now seem to consume my entire life. The breakup really fucked with my self esteem and body image - my ex had implied that he didn't find me attractive anymore and would make not so subtle remarks about my weight/workout habits (I know, he sucks). Soon after the breakup, I started a consulting internship where I was traveling and eating out a TON. I started purging which I think was a combination of the crazy schedule/eating out and the post-breakup self hatred and poor body image. By August, I was purging about once a day (sometimes more, sometimes less) and was on a crazy restrict/binge/purge cycle. My throat hurt, my heart hurt, and I have that stupid scab/now scar on my knuckle from biting down on my fist while throwing up. It was really emotionally draining and I ended up breaking down and telling my mom and my brother. I didn't think I had an eating disorder, but knew that what I was doing was not okay and I wanted to get it under control before things got worse. Luckily, my family was supportive and I started therapy in August. 

During therapy, I pretty much stopped the binges and started becoming more obsessed with losing weight. I started eating 1200 or less calories per day and lost around 15 pounds before Thanksgiving (I had gained weight from the bulimic behaviors, so losing the weight still kept me in a healthy range). I was still purging if I ate a ""large"" meal because I hated the feeling of being too full. My parents came to visit me for a long weekend and became really worried about my weight and eating habits. I really did want to just eat normally and stop obsessing over everything so much, so I promised myself that I would be normal over the holidays. I went home for 3 weeks over Christmas and allowed myself to try to eat like I would have in the past. This ended up triggering binges and I started purging again. 

Now it's been a month into the new year and I am still no farther than where I was back in August when I first sought help. I am OBSESSED with everything food-related. I count every single thing that goes into my body (even vitamins and gum) and weigh myself every day. I vowed to get better in 2016, so I find myself going back and forth from the intuitive eating mindset to disordered eating daily. One day, I will try to not let it get to me and the next, I feel like I fucked up by eating too much and am back on the restricting wagon. I'm not even really binging but I think that I have screwed my metabolism a little bit, so that eating a full day of calories (around 1700) feels like way too much and I know that path is not going to get me to weight loss. I never really successfully restrict - it's more of the intense anxiety, guilt, and shame that I have around myself and food. Last week, my therapist referred me to intensive outpatient treatment and i have my initial assessment in a week. My issue is that I feel so guilty and dumb about this. I feel like my ED is a joke/not even existent. I feel like I just have no self-control and am just another one of the million girls trying and failing at a diet/weight loss plan. That's not an ED, is it? I am a very normal weight with a 23 BMI. It's hard to legitimize whatever this is and to justify intensive OP treatment. I feel guilty and pathetic when I know that there are people struggling so much harder. I feel like I am just someone trying to have an ED, but failing. But I don't fucking want that. I just want to go back to normal. I want a day where I can just enjoy my food without feeling the intense amount of shame and guilt that comes after. I have wasted so much of my time and energy on this and I feel like I'm at my breaking point. But I feel like if I tell anyone about what I'm going through, they will laugh and think I'm a joke. To everyone around me, I am a normal weight 20 something who seems to eat plenty of food with no issues about it. I basically feel like my ED is not good enough for treatment. Has anyone else gone through this type of situation - being a normal weight and in treatment? Also, how do I even start recovery when weight loss is a primary goal of mine - do I have to drop that mindset entirely until I am ""better""? What is ""better""? I don't know how to reconcile my need to get better and normal again with my guilt around feeling like my ED is not legitimate. Any insight, advice, shared experiences would be so helpful. I feel like I'm breaking down and I just don't really know where to go from here.

TL;DR ED behaviors began 7 months ago, now referred to intensive OP treatment and am feeling guilty and stupid because of my normal weight status "
42jwsw,0,2016-01-25,"Student, 22, low income and still mostly dependent on my parents. Applied for my first credit card ever and got denied for having no credit history.",disrighthereismy,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/42jwsw/student_22_low_income_and_still_mostly_dependent/,"I'm a student and am paid hourly as a part time intern... not a lot of income. I live in an apartment off campus where my parents pay the rent. I work like 15 or so hours each week and I'm paid by the hour. It's stable (and they've already told me that they're hiring me when I graduate), but it's not like I have a strong income. 

I want my first card so that I have credit to get an apartment when I graduate and move back to my hometown. As mentioned, I will have a job at that point and will be salaried. For now? I'm definitely living the student lifestyle. I wish I didn't need a credit card- I *only* want to use this for small and normal purchases like gas. I have no plans of taking advantage of it and going crazy. My plan is to pay it off before I even get the bill so that I know I have nothing to worry about. Is that possible, by the way? Paying it off asap?

My parents have great credit, but I really don't want to be authorized users on their cards. My mom said she spoke with someone at Capital One and they suggested that I apply for either a student card or a secured card. I applied for the secured card and got denied like as soon as I submitted the application. I mean immediate. Waited two days to get the explanation email and it said that my credit check showed that I had ""missing or no credit history.""

Why, yes. Because I've never had a card before.

Should I try the student card? Does my small income coupled with my lack of credit history mean that I'm at a loss? 

Thank you!"

I've heard from alot of family friends working in private equity that Uni really does matter when you get to the top end jobs in finance and whatnot. Obviously a stellar GPA with internships and extra-curricular activities is a necessity and goes without saying. However, based on prestige alone and university reputation, How would you rank the business faculties (commerce) at UNSW, UniSyd and UniMelb successively? These are my current options for university.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a masters degree in CS with moderate experience coding but am far from ready to step into a **developer** job. While I'm confident I can get my skills to wherever they need to be, I'm not confident that a development job is right for me. The same goes for **business analyst** and **data analyst** roles as well. I am looking for someone who works in one of these areas to be a kind of intern for, allowing me to build my skills and observe the day-to-day nature of your job.

&amp;nbsp;

Though I'm flexible on most terms of the arrangement, I would like to work face-to-face. In my experience, it's just so much nicer for training. I'm a bit of a nomad at the moment; currently in Hamburg but happy to come spend some time in [nearly] whatever major European city you call home.

&amp;nbsp;

Compensation would depend on the nature of the work you can offer me. It could be very part-time to nearly full-time as suits us both. Here us some example exchanges I've dreamt up. I'm excited to hear what you have in mind as well!

- A traditional short-term (2 months?) paid internship. Or perhaps unpaid or underpaid if you can help me with housing.

- You assign me manageable tasks from your larger projects, actual work could be done independently. If you find you are getting more value than the effort it takes to manage me, then pay me a reasonable hourly rate.

- A sort of tandem partnership? ENGLISH PRACTICE for you. We work physically together but on separate things, you doing your normal thing and me practicing programming. You let me observe your work and take the time to explain what you're working on occasionally. Allow me ask you for help at times. I can also edit any English text you have to put out during that time.

&amp;nbsp;

Obviously I'm very flexible on terms, including dates etc. So please get in touch if you think there could be a fit! I can share my CV upon request.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward to hearing from you!"

I have been learning japanese for almost a year now. I believe myself to be around upper n3, lower n2 right now and will be taking a jlpt test for n1 or n2 before i plan to go to japan .

Is this viable? i havent consulted the international coordinator of my university yet and would like some input from some more experienced people. Do not mince words please, if its stupid tell me its stupid etc.The internship is around 2 months, starting in September.

I am still working through the documentation and such so bear with me :)

We will be pushing these out to 90ish stores over the next few months. Each store will have 1 mx64 and 1 mr32. I would like to make a template for both of these. I was able to make the template for the mx64 without issues. But when I go to Create Network and try to add Combined Hardware, it does not allow me to use the template I made.

My thought was to scrap the idea of using a template and just keep cloning networks as I go but, that is probably a bad idea because if we go to push out an update to something, we will manually have to do it to each device. Has anyone ran into the issue or have any suggestions."
42n3b1,8,2016-01-25,Feeling like a terrible person.,HelloIAmNoodle,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/42n3b1/feeling_like_a_terrible_person/,"Hi everyone.

Today I'm talking about my grandfather. Who usually just passively enables my mom and grandmother's narcissism without actively being mean or manipulative to me.

Except for today. 

I haven't spoken to my grandparents in about 4 weeks (didn't spend xmas with them bc they constantly berate and belittle me and tell me to get over my ""petty grudge"" against my mother and rekindle a relationship with her). I've been trying to put some distance between us because they are financially and emotionally manipulative, and treat me like I owe them for taking care of me when I constantly express my gratitude and have never once asked them to help me. If I'd known their financial aid came at the price of my self-worth, I would've denied it. Also I live 10 minutes away from them.

Today I call my grandfather after a missed call yesterday (was busy working on a group project). 

""You've really hurt me Noodle.""
""I'm really sorry, I've been super busy with work and school.""
""I understand that you're busy, but you need to make sure to contact me.""
""I'm sorry, I'll do better about keeping up with you.""
""Well, you ignored my call yesterday and it quite frankly pissed me off.""
""I'm really sorry, I was working on a group project and thought it wasn't urgent because there wasn't a voicemail.""
""Well, it seems like you're purposely not making an effort to talk to us. You used to talk to us more often so its very hurtful.""
""I'm sorry, I'll do better. I never intended to be hurtful, I have just been busy.""
""It may not have been your intention but it really hurt me and makes me feel lonely.""
""Okay, I'm sorry, I'll do better. How are you? How have you been?""
""Things are fine.""
""... That's good, then. I, uh, started my new internship today.""
""You have a problem.""
""What?""
""Well me and your grandmother are leaving friday to go see your mother and aunt for the weekend and you need to pick up your new insurance card because you'll likely get into an accident and if we're gone you're shit out of luck.""
((I've never been in an accident or gotten a ticket in my life))
""Okay, I will pick it up today after work. How is (his dog) doing?""
""Fine.""
""Okay... (My pet) is doing well too, arthritis isnt bothering her much this winter.""
""That's nice. In the future, be more mindful of talking to us.""
""Okay.""
""I'll talk to you later, bye""
""Bye""

... That felt really wrong to me. He kept going even after I apologized and said I'd try harder. He didn't even want to actually talk to me. He's never treated me like this before. I feel like an absolute terrible piece of shit.

And the worst part is I feel like I deserve it. Because yeah he's right I haven't been calling him often. They aren't my parents so we aren't THAT close but they like to try to control the shit out of me by making me feel incredibly guilty for not doing what they want. I should've called more and now I feel like an asshole. I keep telling myself that their comfort shouldn't come before my school and work and mental health but how can I dismiss them when they tell me how much I hurt them? I can't dismiss them bc that's what mom did to me when I said she hurt me and I can't be like her.

Now I'm absolutely terrified to go pick up the insurance card bc they're going to make me feel utterly worthless and I already hate myself. Im too weak to stand up to them but also too weak to take a verbal beating. I feel trapped.

I feel like I'm being oversensitive. I feel crazy. I feel like my mom for being upset that I was told I was hurting someone.

Sorry for the text novel haha."

42n5o8,25,2016-01-25,Two idiots spend a night at a beach.,seasare2,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/42n5o8/two_idiots_spend_a_night_at_a_beach/,"This happened last June. I was on a summer internship in a coastal city. For context, English isn't my first language and this city isn't in the US.



I was 20 then, and was and still am a very anxious female. This city was very new to me. Even though it is a huge tourist destination, that was a first time visit for me. My boyfriend at the time, a fellow university student was also on the same internship as me. He was a local resident though. Lets call him Grey. Us being technically, on a summer break, were quite excited about the prospect of the various beaches and coastal night-life.



After a few weeks though, the usual routine got monotonous, as it usually does. So, being the bright eyed idiots that we were, we decided to sneak to a beach after closing time and spend the night there, camping out and doing couple-y stuff. Keep in mind most of the public beaches there were considered very dangerous at night not only because of the high tide, but also because of the high crime rate and the homeless and drug problems that cities that huge usually have. Another factor being the absence of patrolling forces in the after hours. Grey, the dummkopf that he is, later said that he knew of the crime rates but since being a sheltered upper class kid had no actual notion of it. And me? Well lets just say that I have anxiety without cause, so I have learnt to mostly ignore the little pinpricks, and tread where the more knowledgeable amongst us lead. So we decide on the date and place. A very off the route, secluded beach. It doesn't attract many tourists, as only locals know about its existence.



So we ride to the beach on Grey's motorcycle, get our supplies out and easily sneak into the beach. Now like I said, this beach was way off the route, it was nearly 20 kms in the outer of the city. And it was located such that it was a few kms in through thick forest growth from the 'unofficial parking space'. But we were undettered and in a romantic mood so we head right in. The first few hours there were honestly the best time I've ever spent with Grey. We were drinking beer, playing music with the volume on high, running around, splashing in the water, mind you keeping care to stay close to the beach. Just generally enjoying ourselves.



By 3 a.m. we were worn out, and were sitting and snuggling, talking quietly, and just making out. Then suddenly out of nowhere I see a figure approaching our stretch of sand, it was an almost-full-moon night. As it draws closer, I grow more and more stiff. Finally it reaches our stretch and passes us by. It was a tall and burly middle-aged man who looked to be down on his luck. He was staring right at me as he passed us. I was instantly feeling vulnerable and asked Grey to skidaddle. But being the hormone driven red blooded male he was, he insisted on staying, and convinced me that the guy was just a night time stroller. After all, many people like beaches at night,right?



So we continue with our snogging and snuggling, when a few minutes later guess what happens? That same man comes from the opposite direction and passes us again. This time though we didn't notice his ascent as we were rather busy, until he was right next to our stretch. He was smiling the whole time. I was way beyond spooked now and wanted an out asap. But Grey rationalized that maybe the guy was just heading back. In any case, we had to stay put, because Grey felt that he was too intoxicated to ride. He said to give him an hour or so to mellow out a little more. We checked our phones and they, as is expected of them in a horror/needy situation, were drained of battery. Following Murphy's Law to the tee. I was very stiff and tense by then, and stewing internally. I was only then realizing what a stupid idea it was to come out so late to such a foreign place. With nobody except maybe a wanna be rapist/serial killer around.



So we are again left alone, and just to be on the safe side I decided to acquaint myself with the largest stick/driftwood I can found. Which I did. Grey laughed at my attempts to arm ourselves and wasted no time in telling me that if that man really wanted to get at us, that measly peace of wood would do nothing to stop him. I decided right then, that Grey was an overconfident dumbass. So I sit down again. By this time another 20 or so minutes have gone by and Grey wanted to resume where we left off, but the mood was ruined for me. And honestly I was just waiting for Grey to regain his senses so we can get the fuck out of there. By the time another 20-25 minutes pass without any sightings of the man I have sufficiently calmed down and Grey was also feeling back to normal, not that he was ever really worried. Read as: Grey, a fucking overconfident idiot.



An hour or so has passed and I am begining to feel sleepy. I forgot to mention but we were reclinig against a sand dune kind-of thing which stretched on for miles on either directions. So in order to leave we would have to climb it up. It wasn't that high, maybe mid thigh length. And then continue towards the forest area which steadily grows thick. The underbush/forest itself wasn't that long just a few yards really. So Grey is almost asleep with half of him on top of me, when suddenly I hear a voice from behind us. It was this weird combination of a moan and a hiss. I jerk back to look at what it was. And horror of all horrors it's source was a kneeling figure a few yards away from us. It was the same man. With the moon shining on him, I can clearly see that he was bare bottomed and was pleasuring himself.



I think I went numb with shock, maybe letting a soft gasp escape, but Grey was jumping up and pulling me up too. Suddenly the man got up too, and I vividly remember him stepping out of his pants, as cool as a cucumber and calmly walking towards us. I might have screamed at that point. Grey scrambled to pick up the stick that I had previously found and started brandishing it wildly and shouting at the man to back off. The man stopped and stared and smiled at us, all the while touching himself. We scrambled up the dune and started running back cutting a wide path around the man. As we reached the trees I was constantly looking back and saw him start to walk-run towards us. I screamed so loud that I rattled Grey who was pulling me along. We then flat out sprinted towards the parking space. Upon reaching it we saw that the bike was lying down on the ground, like someone had pushed at it. I thought I might pass out with the stress. But Grey kept a cool head and calmly pulled the bike upright and turned it on. It was working still. I hopped on behind him and we peeled out of there.


We were very quite the whole route to the inner part of the city, with me constantly looking back. Expecting to see the man running pell mell towards us, but fortunately nothing and no one was following us. By the time we reach the inner city and stop at a little crowded place, considering the time, to take a breather, I was exhausted. As I was wearing a skirt with no pockets, Grey was carrying my mobile in his jacket which he later realised he had dropped while we were running. We were both unwilling to go back and look for it so that was another instance of Murphy's Law in action. But come morning we did all that was necessary, blocked my previous sim cards and Grey got me a new phone. We didn't contact the police as it was quite apparent that we were in the wrong. Technically trespassing when it was expressly advised against. Also because we had no information to give to them. So that was the night I learned that it was okay to be a little anxious and lost my poor little mobile phone.



So the creepy dude at the beach, lets not meet ever again."

42o6av,1,2016-01-25,Couple Random Questions,wordslikeknives,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/42o6av/couple_random_questions/,"First question: Let's say you are applying for summer internships. If you are a student during that fall when you are applying and during the interview, but you graduate the following spring BEFORE the summer internship starts, would you be disqualified?

Second question: If I don't get an internship, what is the best time of year to apply for a regular job? As far as my qualifications, I plan on having 2-3 exams passed, over a 3.2 GPA (hopefully 3.3-3.4), a couple extracurricular clubs, some charity work, part-time jobs, basic knowledge of excel, SQL, and programming, and if I don't get an actuary internship, I hope to get an internship related to finance for some experience (I might have a connection)."
42oaq3,11,2016-01-25,"I'm withdrawing from my SSRI on accident and feel (mostly) great, but I have a ton of concerns. Can I get some input on how to talk to my therapist/psychiatrist (two different people, will see therapist Tuesday but won't see psychiatrist for months) and what questions to ask them/myself?",SylveoPlath,SRSWomen,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRSWomen/comments/42oaq3/im_withdrawing_from_my_ssri_on_accident_and_feel/,"Yes, I'm going to speak to a counselor about this. Tomorrow, in fact, is my next therapy session. I won't have a session with my psychiatrist for a few months, however, so I wanted some feedback on my thoughts and some suggestions on how to address this issue with my therapist/psychiatrist.

First of all, my primary disorder is recurrent major depressive disorder, compounded by an anxiety disorder and anorexia (in recovery.) I've been on a few antidepressants and have always taken Abilify with them. Off the top of my head, I remember Lexapro, Celexa, and one or two generics I can't remember the name of. Right now, I'm on 30mg of Paxil with a non-narcotic anxiety pill. However, I'm supposed to be transitioning to Zoloft, but I'm behind on my medication, which is why I'm here rambling.

I think missing last night's dose makes this my fourth or fifth day off medication; I usually get brain fog as soon as two days after missing doses concurrently, but this is different. I'm energetic, motivated, deliberate, feeling emotions, hungry... all things I struggle to feel when I'm taking my Paxil. In the past, my psychiatrist's response has been to up my dose, but now I'm wondering if we're taking the wrong route.

Complicating this, however, is the fact that I suffer heavily from derealization, a six-week-long bout of which pushed me into medication in the first place. The *only* thing that keeps the derealization at bay is either antidepressants or Abilify, I don't know which, because I've never been on one without the other. I've found that it doesn't matter much *which* antidepressant I'm on, so maybe it's the Abilify, but I think that all of the antidepressants I've tried have been SSRIs so it could be that it's the SSRI doing god's work. I don't fucking know.

So I'm feeling good, but it could also be situational. I'm caught up on homework, have an internship lined up, felt confident about and did really well on a test, am doing amazing work for a service learning project for my Native Studies minor, etc. So it may have nothing to do with my withdrawal and everything to do with my environment. I'm terrified to try going even longer without my antidepressant, however, because the derealization is sneaking back -- and I'm nauseous and have a fever, which have both been documented as side effects of Paxil withdrawal.

I don't know what the absolute, everloving fuck to do. I could try going without it and deal with the derealization, or go ahead and switch to Zoloft and see if it makes me feel as good as being unmedicated, or stay on Paxil and deal with the numbness and loss of motivation. I could try the Abilify without the Paxil, or the Paxil without the Abilify. There are an endless number of variations on what I can do, though, so maybe someone has a better idea than me that I can run by my therapist and talk about with my psychiatrist.

No, I'm not going to do anything without talking to my psychiatrist first. I'm definitely going to take my pills tonight and I'll check back in tomorrow and see if I'm still feeling good about everything then.

I want the best of both worlds -- no derealization, but energy and motivation and hunger and actual emotions. What should I think about? What should I ask about?

TIA."
42ocdz,2,2016-01-25,24M4F- Daddy's tired of his plaything [public humiliation],DennisIsBastardMan,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/42ocdz/24m4f_daddys_tired_of_his_plaything_public/,"You were all done up the way that you knew I liked you to be. Your long flowing blonde hair was painstakingly curled slightly for me. You spent three hours in front of the mirror doing your makeup exactly how I preferred; not too much, but just enough so that I could call you daddy's little whore. You wore that tight red dress that I bought you a month ago, the one that gripped your little round ass so tight and gave me a perfect eyeful of cleavage. Slutty but sexy. And underneath it you wore your sexiest lacy black bra and matching tiny thong. You were my plaything and you knew it.

We'd been doing this for a while now; the gorgeous young college intern who'd do anything to get ahead and the young upstart boss who was handed everything by his father. And ironically, while I was given my power from my father, you crave this job so much because of yours. You grew up wanting to work where daddy works, didn't you? This was your dream job. You've worked so hard for years to be able to even get an internship at the company and now that you're here you would do anything to land an actual full-time position. 

That's how we started. It was innocent enough at first. Some light flirting here and there. Your hand would brush against my leg, a light touch on the shoulder, any chance you could find to innocently bend over to give me a peek. You started this. This was your decision and it is your fault. You wanted this.

Now we've been meeting in secret for months and we've done just about everything I can think of with you. You've loved every second of it. You convince yourself that you're doing it to get ahead, but I know there's a dirty filthy whore lurking behind every one of your innocent smiles. This is your escape. 

But you're not my first pretty young play thing and you won't be my last. I'm bored and I want to use you up one last time in spectacular fashion.

You don't know that yet. All you know is that I've sent you home midday to get ready for another of our ""regular meetings"" in my office just after closing. You're to wear your hair the way I like it. You're to wear the clothes that I like. You're to do your makeup as I like it. And you're to be the eager slut I like you to be. When you meet me is when the fun will begin.

____________________________________________________

I'd like someone to RP as a submissive office intern to the young boss. This RP will be about public humiliation and shaming when you're surprised to be taken to a party with all of your coworkers instead and used and abused there. A big component of the RP will be psychological (definitely dubcon) with your job being threatened and verbal and physical humiliation. I will be RP'ing as the boss but also a narrator for the other people's involvement. If you're interested in RP'ing others' actions towards you too, that would be okay.

I have a full list of kinks here https://i.imgur.com/LCljEQA.png and would like to hear what kinks and limits you have if you are interested since it's a pretty wide open RP.

I'm looking for responses of a few paragraphs or so, either back and forth throughout the night or over the course of a few days- whatever works best for you. Can't wait to hear from you!

I made the mistake of confiding in him. I didn't want him to think of me as asocial because I spend a lot of time in my room, so I told him about my problems. He seemed accepting at first.

Then, last week, I overheard him gossiping. He said I had a screw loose and how he had been trying to get me out more (he didn't). I started having a panic attack and put my hands over my ears, trying not to hear anything more of this conversation about me. 

The next day, he acted like nothing had happened and asked me to share my food in this overly sweet voice. He was looking down on me. I was so furious, but acted as normal as possible.

Today, I was making small-talk with him in the kitchen. He had been sick recently and I asked him if he had gotten better, noting how many people got sick this month and that I was lucky not to have gotten sick as well. He responded: ""of course you wouldn't get sick! You are challenging yourself to leave the house as little as possible.""

My hands were shaking after that encounter. A few days ago, I started applying for internships and because of that, it seems like all my past failures are coming  back to me. Nonetheless, I have been trying to convince myself that I *am* worth employing, that I am not a complete loser hopeless of recovery.

Well thanks dude, I feel so much better about myself. Here I thought I was making progress. I know my faults, I know I should behave more like a normal citizen. 

I feel like you are actually bad for me. You say you want to help me, but you are only openly showing how little respect you have for me."

Let me elaborate. I'm currently an MIS &amp; CS major at a good school and have the option of choosing either a consulting internship or a software development internship over the summer. 

The two are very very different. Consultants at the companies I'm looking at often travel on average 4-5 days out of the week and have very little chance of having a good family life. The perks.. 75k+ starting guaranteed once I graduate next Spring.

On the flip side, I could take the soft dev internship and potentially work on building an LTR. Truth be told I've tried the hookup game and I'm not a fan of the risk. The risk of STDs, the risk of pregnancy with a girl I don't know. I'd prefer to have a stable relationship going forward. 

Currently, I'm taking some pretty tough comp sci / mat coursework and I've slipped on the lifting. However, I've replaced the lifting with consistent sex lol. I've got a consistent fwb situation going on that doesn't seem like it's going to end soon. I don't want to LTR this girl, but she's sweet and we're in a good agreement.  Both of us agreed that we won't have sex with other people. 

I don't really know what I'm asking at this point. Just advice on how to move forward in a good manner from people who are in a later stage of life. I have a lot of good problems, but I still need advice in making the right decision.

Thanks.

42poel,0,2016-01-25,Looking for advice/help on establishing a marathon training schedule.,EternalSlothman,running,https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/42poel/looking_for_advicehelp_on_establishing_a_marathon/,"I apologize first and foremost if I start bouncing around all over the place with this thread. I have been running for a few years now and after several half marathons I have decided to move up to a full. The problem I am having is making time to run with school and an internship. Up until this point I have been putting in 40 miles a week and I am afraid that I can't maintain that now with how busy I am getting. 

What my schedule currently looks like:

Mon - Class 9:40AM - 11:10AM;  Work 12:00PM - 5:00PM : Class 6:00- 9:00PM

Tues - Work 9AM- 5PM: Class 6-9PM

Wed - Class 9:40AM - 3:30 PM

Thurs- Class 2:40PM - 5:40PM

Frid - Work 9AM -5PM

I am off on the weekends for now (I am a film student and might get work during then).

My Wed, Thurs and Fri look better, but I guess some things I wanted to know is: Should I try to run outside when its dark? Should I try to squeeze my runs in the morning before work/class (I typically do 6-7 miles)? Should I shift around the amounts I do? Should I put what I can't do during the week into my long run? Should I still try to maintain 40 miles per week? I also have access to a gym with treadmills. I am also usually up until around 11/12PM because I am editing for school.

Sorry for all the info, but I have had a really hard time trying to work this out."

42pw3f,14,2016-01-25,Should I move to the US?,WhatAmIDoingHereDude,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/42pw3f/should_i_move_to_the_us/,"Hello. Where do I start?

I live in Mexico, and I am 21 years old. I've always had big ambitions, ambitions that have been hindered by my own poor choices and emotional weakness.

I am currently studying Medicine in my country, but recently got the opportunity to study Software Engineering in San Francisco, with an internship period and possibly a job afterwards.

I like programming, and I used to hate Medicine, until this last semester. I found out I was actually decently good at it: without putting much effort in, I can get good grades, amongst the highest in my class. Of course I need to put all of my efforts towards whatever I do, and that is something I'm trying to improve.

My grandfather was an American citizen, and so I just recently filed a petition for a green card, which in theory should get approved, so thanks to him, and my father, who is also an American citizen (who actually has never lived in the states), it is possible for me to move to the US. He is also a source of inspiration; he was a very cool guy: studied at Stanford, worked on his own, was a pilot in the army and met a lot of interesting people in France and England.

So, yes, in part I want to attempt to be a great guy, like my father and like my grandfather. Perhaps ""great"" is not the best word for me, maybe just ""the best version of myself"". My dilemma lies in what I do next.

Here are, pretty much, my three possible choices:

**1)** Stay in Mexico, study Medicine. The least adventurous of the three. The advantages are that I remain close to my parents, remain comfortable in a culture that I already know and I study Medicine, which I ended up liking last semester.

**2)** Move to the US to study Software Engineering. It is a nice university with nice connections to the industry, I pretty much won't be paying for anything. If I do well, I could probably, optimistically, end up with a nice job in San Francisco or somewhere else. Programming is really fun, and I feel I have some kind of natural abiltiy for it, but my biggest fear is that I end up, eventually, feeling that I'm not doing something meaningful in any way. 

**3)** Move to the US. Join a college. Probably a community college for two years and then transfer. Provided that I do well, I think I would apply to medical school. In the most ambitious of plans, apply to an MD/PhD program.

Now, I know I'm not so young anymore. I know that studying Medicine, or any other carreer in the US can be very expensive, but I don't care that much about not having much money for some extended amount of time. If I choose Software Engineering, who knows? It could be fun, perhaps I can also live a fulfilling life that way. It's just that sometimes I feel very empathetic towards others and think of how awesome it is to study science and make others feel better with that knowledge. Plus, the prospect of acquiring deep knowledge (through a PhD, for instance) is extremely exciting to me. Staying in Mexico would mean remaining in my comfort zone, which I guess isn't bad at all; there's most likely a noticeable difference in quality of education and in amount of money I could earn in the US, compared to here, but the biggest advantage of not moving to the US would be that I'd remain close to my parents, which are getting old. And I really love them.

What decision would you make?

Thank you.

42qv9a,5,2016-01-26,Bug Testing Servers For A Reason,DarthVaderMadHouse,runescape,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/42qv9a/bug_testing_servers_for_a_reason/,"With the release of invention its left quite a few people disappointed, I myself love the idea and concept of the skill but it seems unfinished.
I do know that this was the plan to release the skill and slowly add to it as player feedback rolls in but i honestly think this whole process was done wrong.
I currently work as an intern at a software company where i am one of the bug testers. 

We normally find bugs in any situation but its easier for us to push an update out for our clients for them to then do there routine with the system.
As people will be using the software differently its alot easier to find bugs and process results with the help of the customer.

On Runescape there are Beta servers for big releases such as EOC or other general content, where was inventor? 
Honestly i see where Jagex is coming from with this one by keeping the skill as secretive as possible for a big surprise however in my personal opinion this is completely backwards. Not only for finding bugs but getting the balancing just right!
Inventor should of been released on the beta servers months ago for player feedback rather than waiting until the full release to then gather player feedback.

I hope that in the future more updates are pushed onto the Beta server just to keep Runescape balanced and to give the players what they want!"

I'm a sophomore in computer science and I'm looking at either IT or Software Development. Probably IT. I love building computers/putting together hardware. It's been ""They're all hiring in January/February! Apply to as many places as you can! At least ten a day! If you don't get one/don't try hard enough you're paying me $300 a month!""

I'm not ready for an internship at all. I've done a semester of C++/OOP and I've never done personal code projects. I've made a website before and I'm really good with fixing people's computers, but I don't know anything about networks/printers/actual coding stuff. I'd love to have a job in my field/internship/$15 an hour, but I don't think I'm ready. I think the experience would look great on my resume for a for-colllege-credit internship that I'm going to try for next summer. I've applied to ~40 places and I got one interview (it went alright but they didn't seem very interested). I have a decent resume, but the fact is that I just don't have a lot of experience. I'm a little bit ahead of my classmates, but still not as good as a junior - year student, which is going to be my competition. 

So why not just pay rent? $300 is dirt cheap for rent! Right? 

I make ~$500 net income a month, and I also have to pay car insurance and I always put at least half of my paycheck in savings. (I have ~$5000 in my savings account) I did buy my own car, if that matters. It feels good to own it. 

So sure, I would honestly love an internship but I just don't think I'm going to be ready enough to do any employers any good. I don't feel very good about my abilities and I've told them that and that's pretty much why I'm not going for a for-credit internship. I just don't feel very good about anything today. I'm not *angry*, but it's a lot to think about. 

TL;DR: I'm not very confident in my abilities being that I'm going for an internship a year before anyone else would. "

My roommate and I have been friends since freshman year of college. We decided to live together off-campus our senior year. He found out last year that he had enough credits to graduate early so he technically graduated in December. 

He promised me that he'd find an internship for the spring semester so he'd continue to live with me (the rent is too high for one person). December has come and gone, and he graduated. His parents live about an hour away in the next state, so he was home with them all winter break but came back here around the time school started for me.

I'm in a very intense major (health-related) so I'm always busy. Classes 5 days a week, lots of night classes, and I'm part of a demanding club on campus. I was doing HW when my roomie moved back in. He informed me that he did not find an internship for the semester because he ""waited too long"" to find one, so none were available anymore. But he had a game plan; sit around for 5 months and do nothing!

He told me he was so excited to ""relax"" and just ""hang out and get drunk"" with all of our friends. I was surprised about this; in the field he wants to go into, most of the internships are paid so I assumed that's how he'd be paying the rent. He told me his parents are basically covering him $800 bucks a month + utilities for sitting on his ass for almost half a year.

Okay, cool. Not my family, not going to judge. I assumed he'd be getting some sort of retail job in the meantime since 5 months is a long time to just sit and do nothing. He said nope, he was focusing on ""living it up"" while he still could. 

This entails him sitting on the couch watching cartoons all day. I left for classes at 10 am, came back at 8 pm, and he hadn't moved all day. He doesn't shower for days because he has nowhere to go. Because of all of his free time, he experiments with cooking, but doesn't clean the dishes or the stove. He's never in his own room, it's like he's set up camp in the living room because he has his pillow, his blanket, his laptop, everything out there. He eats out there too. And sleeps. Literally never leaves the room, which means I can't watch TV ever (and it's my TV). 

He was disappointed to learn that most of us have pretty full-time schedules so we weren't available to hang out 24/7, so he invites his old frat brothers over who have senioritis and ditch class already. I came home last week (a Wednesday night) to see him and four other guys completely wasted at my table. It was 7:30 pm. They'd been drinking since 3.

I talked to him about last week when I started to see a pattern forming. I suddenly realized that my dad wasn't being a jerk when I was younger and used to sit around wasting time: it's *really* aggravating to put in so much work every day, especially around the apartment (I'm the only one that cleans), go to work/school, and come back and see he's messed everything up and has no ambition. I do feel like I'm turning into my father and that's the really weird part. 

I told him that if he was going to chill in the apartment for months, then whatever, but he has to be respectful of me. He can't just invite people over or have a party during the weeknights with asking me, he needs to clean up after himself, and he needs to be aware that just because he's chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, the rest of us have school or jobs to go to every day. Some of our friends even have a part-time job or internship along with school.

After we talked, he said ""okay sorry"" and promised he'd be better. I asked him to take the trash out yesterday because I was late to class and he was on the couch. He said yes. I came back home and what do you know? The trash was still there. Taken out of the can, put in the kitchen and a new trash bag was already filled up with snacks, pizza boxes and beer cans. To top it all off, there was water covering the floor of the kitchen, and soap. I asked him what the hell happened (he was on the couch, as usual) and he said he put dishwashing soap in the dishwasher. But, he added, ""I did the dishes!"" 

He sat on the couch **ALL DAY** while a puddle of water sat covering the entire kitchen floor. And what was worse, while I was cleaning it, the trash bag he left there spilled out all over the puddle. It looked like an actual dump in the kitchen.

I've had enough. I can't kick him out because he'll have to pay two month's full rent if he breaks the lease and he won't do that, and I can't afford to live here on my own. I've tried talking to him, but I think his habits are so ingrained in him that he can't help himself. It takes everything in me to not turn into a mom and yell at him for not having a job or being lazy, but I'm not his parent. I'm his roommate, and I shouldn't be cleaning up after him like a mom. This is taking toll on me already and the semestr has barely started.

What do I do?

**TLDR**: roomie graduated early, told me he'd get a job but now wants to sit around and party/do nothing for 5 months. He's wrecking the apartment, never leaves, and I can't afford to live here alone

42s222,1,2016-01-26,"28 [T4M] RP: ""The Campaign Trail - My journey in Becoming a Senator's Wife",redsiren1,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/42s222/28_t4m_rp_the_campaign_trail_my_journey_in/,"#**~Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort~**

My name is Alex Fordham. Two weeks ago I was just another college senior at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. For as long as I could remember, I’ve been starry-eyed for DC and the federal government. Other boys idolized football players and movie stars, but for me it was always politicians. I had posters of both JFK and Reagan in my room. For Halloween I'd usually dress as Abe Lincoln or FDR. And now that I’m here in Washington, I’m ready to get involved with the glitz and glamour of government.

So I decided to get an internship on Capitol Hill, and for me there was really only one choice: Senator John Martell. Charismatic and charming. He'd always given me the impression of a guy who knew how to roll up his sleeves, wield his power, and get the job done. And he revels in it. He was my hero, and I couldn’t imagine working for anyone else. So when I was hired as his newest intern I was ecstatic.

Little did I know that all was not what it seemed in DC. Despite my idealistic visions, Congress was not full of people fighting tooth and nail for what they believe in; it was a club for the rich and powerful who care only about amusing themselves and remaining rich and powerful. Interns were usually hired as potential mistress material, or sometimes as future trophy wives, which was why they’re normally ultra-feminine, young blonde girls (like my girlfriend Madison, just hired as an intern for Senator Richard Dinsmoore).

I soon found out that the Martell Brain Trust had more ambitious plans for me ... 

#**Senator John Martell To Toss Hat Into the Ring For Next Presidential Campaign**

That was the press clipping attached to the manilla folder that one of the Senator's personal assistants handed me. Inside the folder was page after page of the personal life for a [Jessica Marie McCarthy] (http://i.imgur.com/mCyKVkk.jpg). Attached were a [few] (http://i.imgur.com/87DZRpI.jpg) [photos] (http://i.imgur.com/EiwtPJg.jpg) which looked digitally rendered. It had everything, right down to her height, weight and what middle school she went to.

""*I don't understand,*"" I said. ""*Who is this woman? And why is it important that I familiarize myself with her?*""

""Because,"" said the PA. ""*We would like you to assume her identity. You match all the credential we are looking for. You're a ghost. No one in the general public knows who Alex Fordham is. Just like no one knows who Jessica McCarthy is ... yet. We have meticulously built up a fictional life and backstory for Ms. McCarthy. The Senator is about to run for president and we have strategized that what better way for the Senator to find his way into the hearts and minds of the people than a good old fashioned love story.*""

I could feel my heart sinking into my stomach. ""*You're -- you're joking, right?*"" I said.

""If you do this,"" the PA replied. ""*Become Jessica. You will never have to worry about anything again. All your debts paid. Student loans paid. Your parents will keep their house in Vermont. It's important that you fully commit to this for it to work.*""

""*I don't know the first thing about -- about being a woman.*""

He smiled. ""*We will help with that. We have resources at our disposal for that as well. Our goal is to have the courting process and romance play out before the media's very eyes. America's sweethearts if there ever was one. Now, take the weekend to think about it and let me know by Monday. Trust me, Alex. This is the opportunity of a lifetime.*""

&gt; Hi everyone,

&gt; Thanks for taking the time to read. One of my favorite fantasies is to be emasculated, molded, and utterly transformed by an older man - to begin as a shy, impressionable young man and to end as his totally devoted, slightly submissive, ultra-feminine girlfriend or wife. That's what I'm looking to explore here. I think the best stories are the ones done in good taste and with the right degree of realism. Strong dialog and good characters are important. **If you're an intelligent, sophisticated writer,** please say hello. I'm looking for my Senator to be dominant, but with a subtle kindness and gentleness.

&gt; I look forward to hearing from you!"

42sdi2,1,2016-01-26,Need Career Advice,jobadvice_2938,torontoJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/torontoJobs/comments/42sdi2/need_career_advice/,"I will be graduating from Ryerson in the spring from the Business IT Management program. I’ve got a 3.1 GPA at the moment, and only a few classes this semester. Working part time at the university. So most of my free time is used job searching.

As graduation is approaching, I am getting more and more stressed out about looking for a job. I have almost no professional experience, no co-op, no internships. I have gone to a few networking events but I can’t say they have helped much. Only type of professional experience I have would be the job I’ve currently got, I do a bit of excel and perform social media analysis, albeit using a developed tool that’s required to do so (so no coding).

I have a huge passion for the IT industry and technology in general which is why I went to the program. But I’ve realized I am kind of lost. I don’t know what I should be applying for. I would like to be a data analyst, but only have SQL experience from my third year to show for it. At this point, I am really just looking to get any IT based job I can get.

The program I am in is flawed as it is much too general. They give us a lot of business classes (finance, accounting, economics) but also a lot of tech-based classes (like database management, SQL, decision analysis using excel, ERP framework).

I would appreciate any advice, especially if you working the IT/business sector. Is it too early to start applying, since I don’t have my degree yet?

I'm a recent grad of a coding bootcamp and have been developing in Objective-C and Swift for the last 3 months. Recently, I've started volunteering with a non-profit app that turns ad revenue into donations that assist homeless outreach programs. 

 Despite having a cool project and interesting background (medical research) I've found it's difficult to find internships or Jr. dev roles, as most companies are (understandably) looking for more experience. 

Would any of you lovely folks care to share advice/recommendations for a budding dev? I've already gotten my hands on cracking the coding interview and have started learning some comp sci/big-O notation stuff, but what would help me stand out beyond my peers? 

Many thanks! "
42tdj5,2,2016-01-26,Futa4F - High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/42tdj5/futa4f_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- ~~*The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?~~ **TEMPORARILY RETIRED due to oversaturation.**

- ~~*The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.~~ **TEMPORARILY RETIRED due to oversaturation.**

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either. **HIGH PRIORITY. Sending me a teacher profile will almost guarantee a response.**

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

---

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm trying something different today: I’ll be playing a bitchy, mean 18 year-old futadomme with more than a few destructive habits.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, dubious consent, impregnation (one-night stands only), cumplay, sweat, spanking, facesitting, modification (piercings, tattoos, etc.), humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, ageplay (18+ only), blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon,*

42tpp7,35,2016-01-26,I [20m] feel like the failure of my family and it's hard not to compare myself to my superstar sister [26f]. I also need help letting go of the past.,goingbackeast,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42tpp7/i_20m_feel_like_the_failure_of_my_family_and_its/,"I want to make it clear that I love my sister and I don't resent her for her success. I am very close to her, and we are each other's best friends. I don't wish she has less, and she has earned everything she has gotten. I just feel like a failure in comparison. She has never rubbed it in, and I don't want her to feel ostracized or pushed away. I just want advice managing my own feelings so I can do the best with my situation and not hurt my relationship. This is a throwaway account.

My mother was a very successful career women whose professional life was cut short by a horrific car accident. After this her desire to succeed was transformed into pushing her kids. I should say I love(d) my mother very much, and felt bad for her. I accepted these pressures, but have become terrified of letting people down and not meeting expectations. My mother has always pushed my sister and I to excel, hard. My sister in a lot of ways was the perfect child, and her only rebellions were to read romance novels that our parents disapproved of (we come from a very conservative, Catholic family). Fast forward, she went to an ivy equivalent school and graduated from a master's program thats ranked #1 in the nation with a magna cum laud. She is now working and making 180k/year after interning across the globe, working in public/private sectors, even getting a job with top secret security clearance. While I eventually went to the same school (on my own merits, my academic difficulties really only began later).

Growing up I had a lot of trouble with my parents. We had an disabled uncle who moved in when I was in 6th grade because he needed full time care because he had a back tumor, a brain tumor/cyst, and thyroid cancer. My grandmother who has lived with my family my entire life. My uncle was a hoarder, and when he moved in was paying $3,000/month in storage and his apartment was completely filled. He required a huge amount of medical attention which my mother provided. When he moved in basically all of his stuff came with him. My grandma also accumulated stuff because of its attachment to her late husband. Our house became disgusting and I wasn't allowed to have friends over after the 7th grade. I was always taught to never tell anyone about my home situation because it was embarrassing. I don't think I told anyone till the 11th or 12th grade. I remember two occasions when my mom and I fought over something and my mother threatened to kill herself. 

This is only relevant because it is still an issue at home. My parents have been married for 30 years and really resent each other. My mother longs for someone who is emotionally supportive and loves her, and my dad just wants a clean house, a peaceful life, and does not desire a close relationship with his partner. I also think he's gay, but this is a huge tangent, albeit supported by substantial evidence. I know the last time my parents had sex was at the time of my conception, some 21 years ago. My mom mentioned this to my sister, who passed it along to me. They will never get a divorce because they are both very Catholic and don't believe in it, but also because the financial situation is such that my family wouldn't have enough money to support their lifestyle anymore. In essence, my parents are miserable together and I would like them to be happy. It hurts when I'm home and I know there is no love between them- most of the time it varies between condescension, bitterness, and resentment. They fight a lot, too.

After several years fighting his illness my uncle passed away my senior year hs and my grandmother died my sophomore year of college. After this my mother increasingly relied on me for her emotional support, as my father is very emotionally distant. She would continually complain about my dad. My mom was pretty depressed, having lost her family and not having anyone. I felt even more responsible for my mother's happiness.

In the middle of all this I started dating a wonderful girl, called Girl, and I fell in love. She is absolutely amazing. I can almost feel happiness radiate from her and I admire how she handles difficulties. She is an incredibly resilient, kind, good person. For a lot of reasons, namely religion, my mom really disapproved. She told me to be a ""good boy"", and that ""God was watching,"" ""not to do anything sinful."" I remember she smelled me once and made an accusation. At the onset of our relationship I was very Catholic, and ended up being consumed by the guilt of sleeping with my gf and believed I was going to hell. I began breaking down mentally. I started lying about where I was going, and I began to believe my parents were searching for me on the roads. I remember asking my gf to hide while on the passenger side lest my parents see her. I would ask to be dropped off at my friends house so he could drive me home. I think they began picking up on my evasiveness and further questioned my about who I was with and what I was doing. My guilt kept getting worse. My mother eventually confronted me about sleeping with my girlfriend and I acknowledged that I was. The sheer disappointment I felt from my mother was enormous. I knew she thought I was going to hell, and I sort of did too. I went out that night to my friends house and got blackout drunk. I had a semi-open relationship with my gf at that time, which made it easy for things to start with a girl who had previously come on to me before. I was able to justify the two bases, so to speak, as they were within the bounds of our open relationship. The girl semi-initiated the third, and I cheated. This went on for a minute or two. I came to the realization that I cheated on my girlfriend, stopped, and went to sleep. I went home the next morning, and told my girlfriend I needed to meet her in person to talk with her. 

That day I told her I had cheated on her, giving her the details and apologizing. I semi rationalized my behavior and deflected a little bit, talking about my family issues and hoarding. I realize this was manipulative to switch topics, but I genuinely felt like I was drowning. I was having an existential crisis and I didn't know who else to talk to. I hadn't told anyone about the hoarding, let alone my parents relationship, or my Catholic guilt. I broke up with my girlfriend based on the rationale I no longer deserved her, and also probably saving me from the anguish of being broken up with.

The guilt became overwhelming. I thought of myself as a bad person (I still do, in a lot of ways) who had let everyone I care about down. My faith in God had been diminishing, and I either thought I would go to hell, or my parents would die, having lead unfulfilling lives. In the absence of God, I felt that we are each the author of our own morality and code, and I had failed myself by not being a person I would want to be. It is not an exaggeration to say I was suicidal at this time. I was about to hang myself when I thought of my body swinging in my hallway and the effect it would have on those around me. I had a moment of clarity and realized the impulsiveness of my actions, and I knew if I were to kill myself my mother would likely commit suicide as well. I know it would devastate my friends. I wrote a note and committed to waiting a few days to let the feelings subside, as well as allowing me to pick a method that would allow for an open casket but also involve several steps of preparation, which would force me to pause and reflect on my course of action. Essentially this strategy worked. Whenever I would go to get the things needed, the drive over there would make me think about my actions. Eventually my suicidal ideation subsided. This all happened about 2 years ago. I am currently taking anti-depressants, but I stopped seeing my therapist after about a year because he belittled my problems and quote ""thought it was likely I occasionally suffered from mild depression."" I felt like I was wasting his time and it made me feel like I shouldn't have problems. 

Fast forward 2 years; from the outside my life looks great, now. I go to a top 20 university, I'm handsome, I'm a vice president of my fraternity. My girlfriend and I got back together (long story). Everyone expects so much from me. But I feel like everything is going to shit (except my relationship). My grades are bad and no one knows, not my family, my friends, no one. I'm rocking a 3.0 and didn't finish my finals last semester. I lost a prestigious extracurricular because I stopped responding to my emails. I'm an RA and at risk of not being rehired. I feel like I have no prospects for internships or work. Everyone at my school is so accomplished and I feel so behind. I struggle to get out of bed in the mornings, even to shower. Yesterday I didn't get out of bed till 5pm. I look at my sister and think; this is what my life could have been if I hadn't let it get fucked up along the way. My family is beginning to revise their expectations downwards for me and that feels shitty. Rather than taking the pressure off, at this point I just feel like I have disappointed them again. I wish they would leave me alone. There are little minor things in my life that are frustrating as hell but I've already written too much. I wish they would've taken the pressure off of me before it got to this point. I wish my parents didn't raise me with a religion that made me hate myself for acting on my sexuality. I wish my parents would love each other. My sister recently lost her virginity (at 26!!) because she was raised the same way I was and finally decided it was time. I don't care about that, except to be happy she's happy, but she told my mom and my mom didn't care AT ALL that she slept with someone. I'm happy that my sister didn't have to deal with the guilt, but its so hypocritical! The amount of guilt she pushed on me for what I did fucked up my life. But at the same time I feel like I need to own my own emotions and life choices. It's easier to just let it all be someone else's fault. I'm in the middle of recruiting season right now and my friends are all getting jobs at hedge funds, investment banks, and consulting firms (we're juniors) and I know I won't even get an interview.

42tu5b,6,2016-01-26,Job advice about entry-level positions in Japan,[deleted],japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/42tu5b/job_advice_about_entrylevel_positions_in_japan/,"After searching in older posts here and months for job hunting online, I decided it is time to drop a question here, just in case there is any advice.

**TL;DR: Just-graduated (but skilled) computer engineer struggling to find entry-level positions in Tokyo.**

I'm a 25 years old just-graduated computer engineer with strong skills in networking, Linux system administration and several months of working experience as intern in a very famous Internet-company and a research lab in of an ISP in Japan. While I was a student, I've spent nearly 2 years in Japan coming and going for holiday, an internship and study exchange program. I've been a daily reader of /r/japan for a long time. I have basic/conversational level of Japanese.

I'm looking for a job as network engineer / system engineer / software engineer in Tokyo/Kanagawa area. My ideal job would be in an ISP/Internet company. I've tried to use my connections in Japan but I didn't found any position. I've then started by looking on job postings of foreign companies (hp, cisco, google, amazon, bloomberg, etc ...) but I'm really struggling to find a position matching my skills/interests and not requiring 2+ years of working experience (which I don't have). Having read ""Blue Eyed Salaryman"" (posted here a long ago), as well as many comments on reddit, I'm trying to avoid big Japanese corporations (Hitachi, Mitsubishi, NTT, ...), both because nearly all of them have screening in Japanese and also because I know that there is a very little chance that I will manage to do something really related to what I like. 
I sent my CV to Rakuten, probably the only alternative at the moment, waiting for a reply.

I could find ways for getting a VISA (ex: language school, marrying my japanese girlfriend, ...), but I think that would not really change the problem of finding a job. Given that I have no interest in teaching English/other languages or doing different jobs/studying, and that I want to move there ASAP, what is your advice?

Thanks! 
P.S: Of course PM me for CV

EDIT: Thanks for the replies and private messages! "

42u7xq,10,2016-01-26,"No matter what, I can't convince myself that I'm happy",unconstrained1,TrueOffMyChest,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/42u7xq/no_matter_what_i_cant_convince_myself_that_im/,"To many people, I seem like a successful person. However, I honestly don't see it in myself.. I'll try to explain. (I don't want to come across as a braggart, but i need to provide some background info) I'm a sophomore with a 3.7 GPA in Electrical and Computer Engineering,  I've had a few internships already, I'm currently working with NASA as a mentor for high schoolers interested in engineering, I have a decent amount of friends, but I just feel so empty. I always end up comparing myself to other people, thinking ""Why can't I be as social as them?"" Or ""how can they handle 19 credit semesters while saving multiple third world countries, working part time jobs, and still somehow have time to party?"" I look at others and think that I'm some weird freak who, no matter what, will never measure up. I'm a female virgin, which just seems so..weird, I feel? Yet I don't even know if I want to have sex. I hear my friends talking about it, and I feel a mix of disgust with a fear of missing out. I don't even know how to explain it.

 I feel like the college environment just isn't for me. I've always had a degree of anxiety in my life, having been diagnosed with Asperger's at age 12. I grew up with only a few friends up until high school, where it seems I suddenly came out of my shell and started talking to people with much more ease. Granted, I still have social anxiety that seems to have gotten worse in college, but not nearly to the degree of awkwardness as before. I feel like freshman year of college was rock bottom for me. I started gaining a lot of weight because I simply stopped exercising out of laziness and naivety. The friend group that I made in the beginning of the semester quickly imploded due to people either transferring schools, getting into fights, etc. I started smoking a LOT of weed, where I would even show up to class high. I ended up dropping two classes second semester because I was too stupid to see the results of my actions. My social anxiety got worse with the weed to the point where I would experience major sensory overload just going to campus center, etc. I would hate myself for how much money I was spending, but I would try to justify it by the internship money. Over the summer, I got my shit together, lost a lot of weight, and cut back my smoking to only night time. Now, I'm trying to limit my usage to only once or twice a week, but the cravings are unbearable. I have met new people, but I still don't feel satisfied with how my life is going. No matter what, I just feel listless, spacey and stupid. I feel like I don't even deserve to be where I am today because I feel like a fucking loser. Granted, things could be a LOT worse. I just don't know why I feel the way I do, when people always tell me how ""great"" I'm doing. If only they knew the internal struggles... Literally, I just want to pack all my shit and take a plane somewhere far far away...okay, I think my rant is done. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense; I'll try to be more descriptive. Thank you so much for reading these ramblings.. I have just felt pretty off today and needed a way to get it out without annoying my friends."

42uavk,19,2016-01-26,I win third place!! Woo! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;,JustDiscoveredSex,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/42uavk/i_win_third_place_woo_sarcasm/,"Well. It’s been an enlightening week. Most recent conversation with my beloved spouse...

I told him about the new library in town, that it was nice, etc. He actually had an inkling to see it, since he has no idea what it's like. We drove up and looked at it. (It’s actually way cool. From the fireplace in the periodicals room to the silent study rooms.) 

Afterwards we went to dinner. ""Last year you never would have gone to the library,"" I commented. That was more like what he would have done in years past. He agreed, said he was ""trying to change."" Said he knows he burned a bridge. I'm curious as to what bridge he thinks he's burned, so I ask. He says the one where ""you don't have to keep looking your shoulder, waiting for the other shoe to drop."" This seems odd and perhaps he's not really understanding me. So I ask for more clarification. 

He says that last year, when I warned him that he was ""sleepwalking into a divorce,"" it made him think. 

""This wasn't a sit-down-and-stare-at-the-wall kind of thing, this was a lot of thinking over the next several months,"" he says. ""What you basically did was ask me to evaluate how much I want you in my life. Because one answer might be, 'You're thinking maybe you want a divorce...eh, that's fine.' So the main question was how do I feel about that? And the answer is that I definitely don't want you out of my life, you're very important to me. 

The next question is HOW important? What am I willing to do, or to give up? And there are some things that I'm not willing to give up. Like financials. If you were to say that I couldn't work any overtime and you demanded that I was home every night so that I could spend time with you, I wouldn't be okay with that. It would impact my ability to move forward in my job and make money. 

My games are the same way. If you said, ""That's it, I'm done, I don't want you to play any more games, I want you to spend all your time on me,"" that wouldn't work for me, either. That's what my problem has been for a long time, that you wanted me to give up the things that make me who I am. 

And so on that list, financials and my games, you're the next, very close, high-ranking thing in my life. I don't...I very much don't LIKE the idea of being alone. Of coming home to a cold, empty house. Of having no one to eat dinner with. No one to talk to."" 

And this relates to burning bridges how? Because all this introspection leads him to the conclusion that he wants me around, that he's been in ""selfish mode"" for ""the last few years,"" and I'm right...he wouldn't have gone to the library because he'd ""have had better things to do, wanted more time to myself."" And that's what he wants to change, to not be quite so selfish. 

So. I’m in third place behind video games. I’m not sure how to react, because it’s been OBVIOUS, like, forever.  (There's no other conclusion to draw when he spends at minimum five hours a night on gaming for the last 18 years.) So no surprise, it’s just a little shocking to have him say aloud that he’s rather divorce than give up his gaming habit. And it explains why he hasn’t come to bed at the same time as me for...the whole marriage? This bothers me A LOT. It was what I considered one of the biggest, most major perks of marriage, to go to bed with a warm body and fall asleep while cuddling. That happened for about 3 months, and pretty much never afterward, he’d rather stay up until 3 a.m. playing his various games. 

So. No idea what to actually DO or SAY or THINK at the moment. In reaction to his statements, I pretty much just nodded.

But I don't take it as a good sign. And certainly I will use it to inform my decisions from this point forward. 

UPDATE: 
Nothing happening on this front, but quick backstory for those saying ""Hey, compromise."" Because, yeah, obviously. 

Back when this really became a huge issue, it was around 12-14 years ago. He used to be on his games 10-15 hours a day by the time I was ready to leave. That would have put me as a single mom with a newborn and a toddler, all because my spouse was too taken with video games. Marriage counseling ensued, and as part of the deal, I had to sign a physical piece of paper guaranteeing him five hours of uninterrupted game time every day, without comment or complaint. In return, I was supposed to get two date nights a week and couple of breakfasts together every week. That gradually morphed into no breakfasts but the date nights stayed. These days the date nights start at 10-11 p.m. and consist of sitting on the couch and watching one episode of something like News Night or House of Cards. Then if he’s nice, he’ll put me to bed and then go back downstairs and play games some more. This week there have been no date nights, because he ""doesn't have time."" 

His games really aren't the core of the issue, as I see it. They're a symptom. The real issue is his tendency to attempt to escape. So the major transgressions/red flags IMO are as follows: 

In college, year 2 of dating, I take an internship far away. He falls off the map. Whereas during the first summer I got love letters nearly every day, this summer I got zero. He barely was in contact with me at all. I went so far as to call his parents to make sure he wasn't killed in some tragic accident and no one let me know. He was essentially fucking around with friends too much to be bothered. (And, as it comes out 20 years later, doing a lot of questionable things with a couple of girls who claimed to be my friends, but I'll not go into that.) 

We marry. He loses his job. Instead of looking for a job, he jumps online to play games. Ties up the phone for 12 hours a day. I'm the one who got him a job, because I was the one submitting resumes for him via the career office. 

Kid 1 comes along and he immerses himself in work, gets into an emotional affair with a co-worker. He's gone all the time, but ""it's for work,"" so it's totally legit. 

During pregnancy with Kid 2 he discovers EQ and the shit really hits the fan. Spends 10-15 hours a day on the game, completely shuts out wife and child, I feel like a single parent. There's the marriage counseling. 

Now he suffers trouble with ED, and he ONCE AGAIN withdraws, increases his gaming time, this time he gets downright mean and crude with me because he's trying very hard to avoid a sexual situation in which he might fail. 

See the pattern? When there's something difficult, he runs away. I go away on an internship, he runs into his friends (and kinda FWBs). He loses a job, uses gaming to escape the unpleasant reality. Kids are difficult and stressful...he runs away into his job and gaming. His dick breaks...he runs away into gaming. 

When is the next time he's going to run away? When we're in the oncologist's office? See what I mean? "
42uepm,66,2016-01-26,Harvey Pollack Story,TheRealEBurns,nba,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/42uepm/harvey_pollack_story/,"I was an intern at the Wells Fargo Center in 2014 and one of my tasks was to fix Harvey Pollack's computer...  At the time, Harvey was a legend, known for his amazing stat work and the only employee of the NBA to still be employed from the beginning of the NBA in 1946-47. 

Sadly, Harvey passed on in June of 2015 at the age of 93, but my conversations with him in the summer of 2014 has stuck with me, and will stick with me for the rest of my life. 

He made jokes about how he outlasted every commissioner in league history and even joked about how he would surpass Silver... he is the world-record holder for most new t-shirts ever worn in a lifetime, and was just one of the coolest guys you could ever meet. 

For those who do not know Harvey, he was a statistician, journalist and publicist for the Philadelphia Warriors and then ultimately the 76ers when the Warriors moved west.  So of course, during our conversation I had to ask Harvey who he thought the best player of all-time was, and instantly he said -- Wilt Chamberlain. 

He proceeded to tell stories of how dominant Wilt was... claiming how Wilt was legit a man amongst boys, and you could see the smile in his face as he told stories of game after game watching Wilt... so I, of course, asked if he was there for when Wilt scored 100... and he told me not only was he there... but he was the lone human who could verify that Wilt actually scored 100, as he was the man who kept the stats for that game... he then pointed to the infamous picture of Wilt holding the ""100"" sign that he had on his wall and said I'm the reason that photo was taken...  I'm the one who wrote the 100 on the paper and said you need to take this picture. 

Before the convo, I had no idea Harvey was the man responsible for that picture I had seen hundreds of times... After that moment, I  called Harvey the ""living legend"", each time I saw him... and he always laughed at it... and always would offer to buy me lunch (to which, I sadly never got the chance to take him up on the offer) 

But I swear, he always would have computer problems just to talk to me (especially since he never used his computer), and  the more I talked to him the more I found out about his incredible legacy... Harvey told me about he got the NBA to acknowledge blocked shots, was the first person to separate rebounds into offensive, and defensive, was the first person to coin the term ""triple-double"" and was a key figure in helping get 3 seconds in the lane and goaltending added to the rulebook. 

Harvey told stories from watching Dr. J face Bird to watching Barkley and Iverson play night in and night out, but when I brought up Jordan, he went right to Lebron James.  He said sitting courtside and watching Lebron and even Kobe to an extent made him realize how old he truly was lol, as he couldn't believe humanity had progressed to that level of athleticism in his lifetime... 

He didn't talk much about Jordan as he felt the world had already talked enough about him, but I truly felt when I was speaking to Harvey, I was speaking to a person who had as great of a view of NBA history as anyone ever could. 

I felt like sharing this, as Harvey had popped into my head today and I figured you guys might enjoy hearing some of the tidbits I got from some of the coolest conversations I've ever had.  Harvey hopefully one day will find a spot in the Basketball Hall of Fame...  May he Rest In Peace,  and despite only meeting him a few times, he truly left an impact on my life.  "
42uf99,2,2016-01-26,Foreign high school student doing an internship at a top Silicon Valley startup.,whyaminotamerican,immigration,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/42uf99/foreign_high_school_student_doing_an_internship/,"Hey guys,

So I'm an Australian high school student (living in Singapore) who's been programming for around 5 years now. I have a few apps on the App Store (one pretty successful) and have done various freelancing work and internships in my country etc.

I recently did and passed a technical interview at a top startup in Silicon Valley (Palo Alto) for a role as an iOS developer intern. This company has received over 60 million in funding from top VCs such as Andreessen Horowitz, and others like Google Ventures and Snoop Dog (funny enough).

I've been looking into visa options, but since I'm a high school student I have to rule out J-1 Internship and J-1 Summer Work Travel. The only option left is J-1 Traineeship; the traineeship eligibility states you must EITHER have a degree at a foreign university (which I don't) OR have at least 5 years of work experience (which I, interestingly enough, do and can prove). 

The startup is going to talk to lawyers and look into it, but I would like to get a gist of what I can do here. I'm going to study in the US in a couple years, but this internship would be an amazing opportunity for me.

Can anyone here confirm if it would be possible for me (of 17 years of age) to obtain a work visa in the US?

Thanks,

42uxja,1,2016-01-26,How can/should I pay off CC and vehicle my last year of college,Throwaway987523,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/42uxja/how_canshould_i_pay_off_cc_and_vehicle_my_last/,"I finally have $1,000 in my savings account and I plan on keeping it there (and hopefully adding to it).

I owe about $9,000 on my credit card...high interest rate (17%!!!)
I owe $1,600 on my car payment. (Car is a 2006, bought it in 2010. Runs great!....knock on wood).


Other expenses include: Phone bill, car insurance, monthly rent. This comes out to about $800/month (not including food/entertainment, etc.)


I would like to pay all of these off by the time I graduate in August (two semesters left). I make $2,500 / month but am really bad managing my money. I am used to living paycheck to paycheck but not have a decent income while I am in college (paid internship that I only do while in college...not during summer).


What is the best way of paying off my debt? Anyway to get a lower interest rate on my CC? I called my bank and asked but they said it could only be done through them if I put a hold on my card. "
42v1sh,1,2016-01-26,"Me [23M ] with my GF [23 F] 2 years, I snooped. Should I tell her?",stupidtrustissues,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42v1sh/me_23m_with_my_gf_23_f_2_years_i_snooped_should_i/,"Recently, I found out that I had been offered a paid internship in another country. I was only told any of this in late December, including that I would have to move away by the beginning of February. Despite her being very sad, she agreed that it was the best thing for me to do.

Myself and my gf have been going relatively fine up to this point. Any sort of issue has been well dealt with and the relationship is healthy for the most part, in my opinion. One thing I will say is that she needs a lot of reassurance and attention, and that I can find this somewhat grating. So, with this in mind, I saw her messaging a guy when we were with her family at dinner after going to a show in the theatre. I didn't recognize the name, which I found odd as she keeps me well updated with everyone she knows or is doing. I tried to push it out of my mind, but being the little weirdo that I am, I searched for him on facebook to try and establish a connection. The friends that she shared with him were odd, she wasn't close to any of them and I couldn't work out what sort of context she would know this guy. 

So my mind starts racing (he's pretty good-looking), and I'm imagining her cheating on me while I'm away. I'm thinking of how upset she was when she found out I was away, of how she may need male attention (this is completely unfounded and idiotic, I'm realizing now), and that this guy may be flirted with or that, my stupid mind is suggesting, they're already beginning to progress something more serious already. 

I talk about it with my therapist which was incredibly beneficial and he talked me down. He asked me if I truly believed it, I asserted that trust in a relationship was extremely important, and I thought I successfully quashed those intrusive thoughts.

Cut to tonight, a couple of weeks later. She stayed in my house last night, we went out and got drunk and stoned with some of my friends. She went home early enough as she has work. I came home and opened up my laptop and found her facebook still logged in. I'm not proud to say but I scrolled down quickly (in a misguided attempt not to intrude on her privacy of her other conversations) to find his and see what was happening.

She had messaged him a week previous to the theatre to say that she had heard he was ill and that she was delighted he seemed to be returning to college soon. Even now, dots are beginning to join and I think the guy may have had a fucking stroke. I feel like a moron and go and look at ol' reliable /r/relationships to see what I should do next.

I begin to read the other threads about people snooping and discovering whole other second relationships that their significant others are having and I panic and flick through her messages on facebook while utterly hating myself. I didn't go into any of her conversations but I just looked at who she was talking to (our fucking friends) and what she was saying (normal bullshit). 

I feel so stupid and that I've betrayed her. Should I tell her what I did? I suppose that there is a benefit of her knowing that I'm an insecure creep. 

tl;dr: I felt stupidly insecure about seeing her message a guy I didn't know so I snooped. There was nothing and I feel like I betrayed her and don't know what to do. "
42v9do,7,2016-01-26,Zipperer/Colburn/Lenk cover up theory.,MsMinxster,MakingaMurderer,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/42v9do/zipperercolburnlenk_cover_up_theory/,"(I posted on another Zipperer link which is no longer searchable.) After reading the transcripts, George or the grandson were at the top of my list of possible suspects. My theory:

**Oct 31st**

• Teresa went to the Zipperers' last and likely got by shot for trespassing. Whether it was George or his grandson J or J's cousin D (George and grandson have history of anger issues documented in their arrest records), it was an accident. But Grandson-J had just been arrested 3 days prior, so they panicked, dumped poor Teresa's body in the back of the RAV4, drove somewhere on their property to bury her, and attempted to abandon the car at Avery's (with one of them following behind in their own car) because Teresa may have mentioned just coming from there or because Avery's was often where people tried to ditch cars after a crime (see unsolved Ricky Hockstetler hit and run in Manitowoc County 1999) 

• Too many customers were still milling around the salvage yard, so GeorgeZ and Co. left Avery’s (RAV4 spotted by propane truck driver). They abandoned the RAV4 somewhere between their home and Avery’s.

**Nov 3rd**

• When she’s reported missing and Steven Avery is tangentially linked, The Lenk Colburn Injustice league is convinced he’s their man and set the wheels of corruption in motion. Colburn is sent to Steven’s, and as an aside, several attempts are made to interview GZ—2 phone calls by deputies and finally Dederer is sent in person (who calls dispatch to check if George had a criminal history bc his behavior is so suspicious). 

• Colburn was supposed to meet w/ the Zipperers’ as well, but finds the RAV4 on his way there from Averys’. He calls in the plates on his cell (not realizing that police line is recorded—per Lenk’s testimony). Colburn then calls Lenk to let him know he found the car--they can nail Steven (the one guy who can derail Colburn’s run for sheriff before it begins) and end the $36M lawsuit. But by this time, word is getting around that GZ is acting suspicious. Lenk advises Colburn to keep the discovery of the RAV4 quiet until they can come up w/ a plan and not to file a report on his interview w/ Avery (you know, like last time, when they kept Steven in prison for a crime he didn’t commit).

**Nov 4th**

•  Lenk heads to Avery’s for some reconnaissance and takes Remiker along to make it look legit. According to his and Remiker’s testimony, he drives all around the salvage lot “not sure where he’s going” (checking out the spot Colburn recommended they hide the car—remember, Colburn had been to Averys’ many times in the past as a customer). 

• While they interview Steven—inside his trailer—oblivious Remiker (who later tells Wiegert the Zipperers were Teresa's last appointment and not Steven) does most of the chatting. Remiker recognizes there is no obvious blood/violence evidence in the bedroom (and later mentions to Lenk that they are barking up the wrong tree) while Lenk checks out the best possibilities to plant evidence. They also learn most of the Averys are heading to Crivitz for the weekend. 

• Meanwhile, on his day off, Colburn heads over to Zipperers’ to get the full story and learns TH’s death was an accident. Either Lenk/Kusche (possible family relation)/Vogel make the deal--if the Zipperers disclose the location of the body, Manitowoc’s finest conspirators will make sure they aren’t charged w/ TH’s death. Deal done, but unfortunately, the Zipperers disposed of TH’s Car keys. 

• The Lenk Injustice League know they can’t just plant TH’s body on Steven’s property because it is likely covered w/ GZ’s DNA. The smelter at Sheriff Hermann's salvage yard is the perfect solution. (Anonymous letter states a body was burned in the smelter on Friday at 3am. The letter was sent to Green Bay—NOT Manitowoc or Calumet since it was Manitowoc sheriff’s smelter). 

• Ryan and Mike are given a head’s up that car has been found, but a citizen needs to find it. Among Teresa's personal belongings retrieved on Wiegert's Nov 3rd visit is the spare key--which he passes onto Lenk at this point. 

**Nov 5th**

• Early am—RAV4 driven onto Avery lot (any sooner and one of the Avery’s or a customer might have discovered it), plates stashed in random car (to cover up Colburn’s dumb ass call--because if Stevan had gone to the trouble of removing them, why didn't he burn the damn things?), and Pam ""Led-by-God"" Strum is given the go ahead. 

• One of the Lenk Braintrust, having realized that lack of Steven’s DNA sank them last time, swipes the blood vial Sat morning and hands it off to Lenk. During the trial, Buting reiterated many times the tarp covering RAV4 had plenty of room for someone to enter on the passenger side (to, you know, plant blood/DNA evidence inside the car). 

• At some point—either late that night or on Sunday, bones removed from smelter and placed on Steven’s property. Lenk and the Corruption League’s clumsiness/stupidity is revealed as they plant ridiculously obvious evidence during the course of the investigation to “put TH in Steven’s trailor” at any cost. (“Look, there’s a key here.” MONTHS later—“Thought I’d take on the tasks of an intern and bring you Calumet officers some donuts. Hey look, Remiker just found a bullet w/ Teresa’s DNA on it.” Slow clap for you Lenk.)

Hello everyone,

My last semester looks like this:

Audit: A

Accounting Information Systems: B

Business Law I: B+

Operations Management (Excel-based class): A

Statistics: C+

This leaves me with a GPA of 3.4 for last fall, bringing my cumulative GPA to 3.557. Blaw, Audit and AIS are difficult classes at my college for what its worth. 

Is this C+ likely to lead to my offer being rescinded? Am I freaking out over nothing? I'd appreciate any opinions. Thank you! "

I am a youngster just about to complete my college degree in Sport Management. My dream is to become a play-by-play broadcaster in minor league baseball. I am from St. Louis and went to school in Columbia, Mo. 

I am searching for an internship in minor league baseball, and in discussing that with a fellow redditor, he mentioned in passing that I should check out his local team in Chattanooga. 

I actually already had interest in Chattanooga and Tennessee in general, because I love the area and know there are many teams there. 

The fellow redditor then tossed out the idea that I could come here to /r/Chattanooga to see if anyone had any contacts in the organization. I figured I'd give it a shot.

If nothing else, I'd love to hear any stories any of you folks might have about the Lookouts baseball team. 

I appreciate you all, and would be forever grateful for any responses. 

Thanks guys!"
42vppj,7,2016-01-26,[Discussion] Coping with Rejection,onajourneynow,GetMotivated,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/42vppj/discussion_coping_with_rejection/,"I'm an introvert, so naturally having to go out there and to speak with people and to face rejection head on is TERRIFYING. I feel queasy to my stomach, I am trying to come up with any other excuse to not do it, but it's come down to this. I can't run away from the fear of rejection anymore. 

One of my final assignments for school requires me to go out there and to speak with business owners and to gain their perspective on how they have been successful/non-successful. I feel nauseous just thinking about having to drive around, seeking out the businesses, and having to introduce myself and to speak with them. What's crazier, I am also planning to drop off my resumes as I want to get an internship for the summer (6 weeks). 

I'm probably going to throw up tomorrow morning, but I don't care anymore. I'll vomit as much as possible, drink my coffee, splash my face with ice cold water, and do it anyway. My knee is fucked up for the past week, but I'll just pop an ibuprofen and tough it out.

I'm sick and tired of being afraid of rejection. I have been rejected so many times, and now I just don't give a fuck anymore. There comes a point when you just don't care and you go out there and do it. Don't fear this bullshit anymore. Whoever rejects you, fuck it, move on, and try again!"

My major GPA is around a 3.4 and cumulative GPA is 3.6.  

I know a 3.6 cumulative GPA is still relatively high but I just did so bad this semester (and getting C+ in an accounting class) that I'm terrified the firm will rescind the offer.  I just sent in transcripts today so I'm just completely preoccupied right now.  Anyone have experience with this? "
42w5td,19,2016-01-27,"[FR] Reaching NY Resolution Goals, One Step at a Time (Long)",motecizuma,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/42w5td/fr_reaching_ny_resolution_goals_one_step_at_a/,"**About Me:**

&amp;nbsp;

I’m 20, and stand at 5’11’’ with a (slightly less than) skinny-fat body. Blonde hair, green eyes. Not anti-social but I don’t come out of my dorm room a ton during the week. I’d say I’m so-so attractive, had 1 brief meaningless relationship in high school, and never done the deed. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Date Party**

&amp;nbsp;

I’m sitting in my room in the on-campus apartment I share with 4 other roommates and friends (all guys).  Two of my roommates have girlfriends who are in the same sorority, which is having a date party that evening (a small dance at a restaurant in town). One of my other roommates chimed up and asks them if they know if there was a sorority girl who needed a date to the party, as he wanted to go out that night. A short time later, a friend of ours (who happens to be in the same sorority) said she’ll go to the party with my roommate.

&amp;nbsp;

One of my New Year’s Resolutions was to have me stop avoiding social situations and to take every opportunity I could to get out of my room more. Feeling envious that my roommate was going out and I’d be left alone to play video games on a Friday night, I chimed in that I was interested in going to the date party too, and the girls said they would try and find one for me. Just as they’re about to leave, a sorority girl messages them and says she needs a date, so I ended up getting to go. At this point, I’m nervous at what I’m getting myself into, as date parties were a very new experience for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

Our entourage pre-gamed for the party at one of my roommate’s girlfriend’s apartments, so that we’d be pretty buzzed once we got to the sorority house. When we arrived at the house, I was introduced to my date: short, blond, athletic, and about an 7.5-8. I was thrilled because I kept my expectations low thinking I’d end up with a bad or unattractive date, but in that brief moment I thought she was pretty cute. I introduced myself with a small handshake, and we started with some introductory small talk while we meandered our way with the group into an adjacent apartment. There, we pre-gamed more as she handed me a few shots to share with her. 

&amp;nbsp;

My first **glimpse of success** in getting her interested in me happened purely by chance. I had pulled out my phone (for the first time, as using it while talking to her is inappropriate) to check the time, and my phone background is a simple blue background with the letters 12, for Tom Brady of the New England Patriots. As luck would have it, she’s a HUGE New England sports fan. Using this to my advantage, our quiet conversations turned into elated dialogue, as we talked about the team, how we became fans, and the game on Sunday. 

&amp;nbsp;

The date party itself was ok. It was just a DJ with some speakers in a small restaurant, with everyone grinding pretty much. I haven’t had much experience with grinding, but could hold my own; I asked her to “show me how it’s done” in a confident, sort-of inviting manner. Through the dance I would move my hands around and bring her close, and she responded to that. Towards the end of the party she had her hands in mine, interlocked specifically (**glimpse of success two #2 - responded to kino positively**). When the party ended, we separated briefly to grab our jackets and such, but when we met up again in order to walk to the busses parked a little away, I decided to take another opportunity to make some kino. I asked her with my hand held up, “ It’s a far walk to get to the bus from here, can you hold this for me?” She loved it, and initiated a interlocked handhold walk to the bus (**glimpse of success #3**).

&amp;nbsp;

We get back to the sorority, and it’s pouring rain. She didn’t want to go back to our apartment (where the group of roommates, girlfriends, and I were going), so I said I would walk her back to her apartment. Pouring rain all the way to her apartment, we never broke that interlocked hand-holding, even when running across a major street to get to her apartment. Standing on her doorstep, she gladly gives me her number and I am able to finish with a K-close (**BOO-YAH**). The walk home in the rain, I felt like I was in a dream. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Aftermath:**

&amp;nbsp;

Texted her the next day, had just basic texting conversation through the night, and I learned she was in my politics class. Didn’t have a chance to sit next to her in lecture on Monday night, but we did study for our politics midterm after class. We didn’t really do much studying, it was a lot of conversation about each other: basically getting to know the person better and learning about them. I made sure to make a lot of jokes and keep things light-hearted, and she had some positive responses to them. She would look at me and twirl her hair a lot (which I have heard is a good sign), and she had a lot of good, genuine laughs. I haven’t spoken or texted her today, as I was busy studying, but I will be texting her tomorrow. I haven’t set up a date yet (as this will be new for me), but I want to do it soon. 

&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, I find we have a lot of common interests, but some different ones as well which I hope will not be too bad. **Overall, I am extremely proud of how I did over the weekend even if it wasn’t perfect on my part. I initiated good kino, found great common topics to talk about, and was able to recognize her body language for signs of interest and responsiveness.** That being said, I still have some internal doubts. My being is dividing in two: on one side, there is the ballsy, fake-it-till-you-make-it confident self that allowed me to impress this girl to the best I could. On the other hand, I’ve got some low self-esteem: she is this attractive triathlete who already has a job + internship for her major. Me on the other hand, school has been difficult these past couple of semesters, as my ADD and habits almost brought me to the brink of disqualification. I had to quit my activities and sports so I could try and focus on school work. I used to swim competitively, so she suggested that I join her team. Only problem is that I haven’t worked out in ages. I came this far, but I really don’t want to blow this rare opportunity.

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR: Made progress towards a New Years Resolution. Had a lot of fun on a blind date with a sorority girl. Sometimes it is better to be lucky than good. Initiated some kino and good conversation, and received positive responses. Got a # and K-Close. Proud of myself and did things well, but still some things I need to work on.**"

42xwsd,4,2016-01-27,Am I being delusional?,newacc4throw,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/42xwsd/am_i_being_delusional/,"RANT ALERT:

Not sure what to do anymore, I started my internship at a small firm, roughly 30 people this winter for tax. In the beginning, I was told I would be doing ""business"" returns, which is the main reason why I took this internship. I had done mainly personal for high-net-worth individuals and I was bored of it.

In the beginning, I completed training for business returns after two weeks. They later come up to me and tell me I would only be doing personal returns now. Kinda pissed me off because I took this opportunity over one very close to my house (which was mainly personal returns), I drive 2 hours to get to this firm at the moment, 3 today since it snowed. Anyways, I suck it up because I need the money and I am a religious man, so i tell myself ""deus vult"" when ever shit happens like this and tell myself to stop being a lil bitch.

So, things go along, the firm said I would be working on audit engagements at their office 2 days out of the week, mostly comps/reviews, which is the office 5 minutes from my house. they tell me that it is no longer an option for me. this is another reason why i took this internship over the other one, i would get some audit exposure.. which is where i really want to be. again, deus vult, and i need the money. no big deal.

few weeks go by, i remember, i never formally signed my contract, i personally signed it, but the partner was supposed to sign it, and notary as well on my first week. anyways, no big deal, i asked HR about it, they made some excuses. ya know, deus vult, i'll ask in a few days, no big deal. so i asked again, turns out the only HR person is out on leave, he won't be back to end of busy season. so i was like, no big deal, deus vult, we don't need him here to sign it? right guys? ""oh we don't know where he placed it."" no big deal, deus vult, i'll go print a new copy. ""we need that exact copy,"" 

then..............

i remembered something, they moved my start date around before 
but i didn't think much of it. but then i did a quick calculation on excel, my contract was moved from 90 days to 89? I guess i can't collect unemployment......state laws say i can collect in an internship but need to hit 90 days. then i remembered another thing.. they switched my payroll in contract from w-2 to 1099 misc, even though that's sketchy AF, but again, i accepted because i would be doing assurance &amp; BUSINESS tax. i think 1099-misc for an intern is sketchy af anyways even if may be legal.. not a tax pro, so wouldn't know. anyways no big deal, still waiting on that contract, deus vult...

so, just cruising along now.. i keep asking for work &amp; about that contract, no response, nothing. I asked the other intern what tax form they use for their wages, they told me they're getting a W-2... hmm WTF. The other intern is working on business returns as well, no big deal, deus vult. I asked about their contract, signed and completed.

Anyways, I tell myself, hey, they're paying you.. don't complain, be thankful you live in america where internships pay more than jobs outside this country.. soo i gather myself and try to stay optimistic af. problem is, I have nothing to work, I've been asking for work from anyone in the office, you know, just a quick message on the messenger system.. if they don't respond, i go to their office to see if they're busy and ask in person if they're not. most say... oh not really.. i'll let you know when i do. 

Mean while, the other intern is complaining how they have all these people offering them work and they're slammed with assignments.. I'm like oh really? this must be a fucking joke. no big deal, deus vult. so i ask the intern, who offered you work? they tell me, so i message that manager up like hey wut up bro, heard you thrownin' assignments around, kinda bored here, need some work (not literally). anyways no response.. yea typical, ignores me.. message says ""read"", but you know, remain optimistic, maybe he is on the phone w/client 

or..

maybe, i'm a ghost. maybe i died on my way to work this morning because of the fucking shit storm of ice and snow i had to get through to get here (just to be treated like shit) and i haven't realized it yet that i am on my way to hell and this is just a dream.
anyways, no big deal, stay optimistic.


 lone and behold, 20 minutes later.. i see the manager walking towards our office......finally, alas' some work. Comes in, i smile, say good morning, how was your drive, etc. you know, just some small talk. anyways, after that's over with, he turns to the other intern.. ""Hey, I have some work for you! their response, ""oh I already have enough at the moment"" then he responds, ""oh no worries, let me know if you need anything!""


at this point.. i don't know what to do.. it's been a week of no work assigned to me, the work that was assigned to me was filing/printing, when i ask for work, i get the run around, no contract signed.. i don't have anything else lined up but really want to leave.... but part of me is dying inside and i don't need to suffer for this.. this is getting ridiculous, am i being delusional for wanting to leave? it seems like I am blatantly being pushed around... all this... for what?

edit: other intern has no prior internship.. and virtually is new to taxes, just thought i would include that.."
42yasa,3,2016-01-27,I [19F] want to start dating for the first time ever,fallingmoons,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/42yasa/i_19f_want_to_start_dating_for_the_first_time_ever/,"I'm a girl in my second year of college and have never dated before. I want to start dating soon, but I don't know where to start! 

I honestly don't know where to start looking. Since I place much importance on education and my career path, I think that I would get along best with a guy that does the same. However, I cannot really find any that do so, and that I would be able to talk with and get along well with, and with whom I can see myself in a relationship. 

I have gone to a few frat parties to meet more students, but they all seem to be more interested in their social life at college. The student organizations I have joined are small and mostly made up of girls. I have some study groups for my classes, but we don't really talk much besides classwork and internship opportunities. I also don't think that I would suit anyone in my study groups. This talking mostly about classes and careers extends to most of my ""social"" life. Even during most weekends, I and most of my friends don't go out, so it would be hard to meet guys that way.

I don't really have anyone that I am interested in, and even if I did, I'm would probably be too shy and awkward to ask him out. However, if he approaches me, that would likely be an entirely different story, as I have a history of falling for guys after finding out that they like me, even if they have never found out. As for the friends that I have at college, unlike those before college, I don't think that they will help me much by telling me who is interested in me, and I am not about to ask them for (potentially nonexistent) gossip.

And even though I have received reports of guys liking me through out elementary, middle, and high school, not one has acted. This leads me to think that maybe there is something wrong with me. (Sure, I'm pretty sassy, but I don't do that for a serious matter.) Why else would they act that way? Although I know that some number of people don't attract others because they see themselves as ugly, I can assure you that am not ashamed of who I am. 

Since I have not had any relationship experience, I am extremely awkward when strangers approach me in the street to talk to me, even if I am still unsure of their intentions. (Since the strangers are always guys, never girls, I am assuming that they don't simply want to be friends.) There have been several times where a guy walked up beside me and started talking to me, but I always freak out and make an excuse to go into the next building. In fact, the first time it happened, I interrupted him (I think he was going to ask me to coffee or something along those lines), thanked him for his complement, told him to have a good day, and sped walked into the next building. I spent the next few days alternating between beating myself up for it and thinking that I did the right thing.

So, now that I have finished ranting, what are some things that I could do to put myself out there? 

Edit: Ok, now I get that I have to talk to guys more, but the question is, how? I really have nothing to talk about with the guys that do go out partying in my college (which is what I meant by their being more interested in their social life; that is, they only spend around 5 hours a week on classes and don't score well), which is about 45min away from the city and whose students are known for studying all the time. So, talking about school is basically small talk. (Sorry, should have been more clear) 

I also do go out and am involved with some non-academic clubs (art, community service, leadership development, student government), but these don't seem to hold much interest to many people. I would join more, but I fear I'll be stretching myself a little thin. 

**TL;DR: What can a college girl (who has never dated before) do to help her get a boyfriend?**

42ycj7,5,2016-01-27,[US-Taxes] I think I did my 2014 returns wrong based on my 2015 tax return.,Bagrant1,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/42ycj7/ustaxes_i_think_i_did_my_2014_returns_wrong_based/,"Hello, I am a full time student who also works full time as an intern. I live on my own, and provide for myself. Last year was my first time filing a tax return. This year I filed and my tuition break/reimbursement this year got me a lot more than my total return last year, even though my situation is virtually the same. This makes me think I filed my 2014 taxes wrong, and that I shorted myself a lot of money. Is there a way I can fix this, or refile to try to get the rest of my 2014?


My total 2014 tax return was about 1600.
My 2015 tuition alone tax break/return was 2500.

My tuition was the same both years (give or take a couple hundred dollars) at around 18k. My income was actually a little less in 2014. 

Any help or insight would be appreciated. I used TurboTax for both returns. "
42ysup,1,2016-01-27,How many internships do I need?,rektg,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/42ysup/how_many_internships_do_i_need/,"Hey everyone! I had a question regarding internships, I currently have two done at the moment. One was just being basically a staff accountant at an organization. I was there for four months before I jumped ships. The second was at a small public accounting firm doing mainly tax work with some small business items here and there. I was there for 7 months. Left on a good note. 

At the moment I will be graduating in June with my 150, I am interested in going to a top 10 firm for audit. I plan to network my way in while completing the CPA. 

Right now I am doing an internship at another small firm doing some audit/tax work, mainly tax. To be honest, I am not really enjoying the people here. I am debating whether I should leave, I am quite overwhelmed with the work and I did not receive any formal training. The software is completely new to me and they are aware of this. They are treating me like shit and constantly yelling at me. I have been sucking it up for the most part. 

I am thinking the audit experience from the internship (if I do get any) will be beneficial for me when looking to go to a larger firm. 

As a result, I should just stick it out... on the other side of the coin, I could quit and possibly be studying for the CPA exam right now and take it in Spring/Summer which could be my focus instead. I could also be focusing more on networking for that position. I know 2 internships is nothing to brag about.. but is this internship really necessary to put myself through given my situation? 

Just wanted some opinions/feedback, thank you!"

42zjzi,1,2016-01-27,Having a hard time finding a better job while working; considering quitting and living off my rainy day fund.,bsboulot,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/42zjzi/having_a_hard_time_finding_a_better_job_while/,"Hello PF,

My wife and I are in our early 30s and expecting our first child this september. We own half of our 500k house. We have another 250k liquid and 450k in retirement. We have no debts other than our mortgage.

I work a low paying job for a nonprofit (45k gross) and do some consulting with 1-2 clients on the side to make ends meet (20-25k gross). Patching together these jobs puts me at 70k but requires a lot of mental overhead. My wife has one job in the public sector making 58k. Let's call household income 125k.

We moved to a new city about 14 months ago (for reference, it requries about 62k salary to pay median rent here). We are expecting our first child in early September. I still work in our previous town 100 miles away, driving down two days/week and spending the night with my parents, away from my wife.

I've been trying to switch from the IT industry to the creative/design industry - I'm bored out of my skull at my current job and feel totally unfulfilled. I don't have a strong background in the creative arena (was chasing a grad degree when the recession happened; IT was a backup) and finding a new job has been slow. Part of the problem is that I'm trying to keep lots of balls in the air with my 2-3 existing jobs. It leaves little time for me to concentrate on building a portfolio of work, chasing the right opportunities, network with the right people, etc. The other part of the problem is me - I'm so drained from my jobs and a health issue I'm fighting that I've been half-assing my job search when I _do_ have the time.

My boss at my primary (45k) job recently asked that I start spending 3 days/week in the office (or resign). I'm not sure what to do. I hate spending time away from my wife, especially while she's pregnant and going through morning sickness/light headedness etc. I also may be wearing out my welcome with my parents.

Option 1 is to quit and just rely on my consulting income (20-25k). This doesn't seem like it's worth two days of travel per week. My primary client is still paying me the hourly rate I set 2.5 years ago, and I've been meaning to raise it 25%. This would make my yearly pay from them about 30k.

Option 2 is to live off savings and focus exclusively on getting a job. I feel like what I've been doing hasn't been working, and maybe I need to devote all my time and efforts to make my professional life what I want it to be. The downside is living off my wife's salary (or no salary if I'm still unemployed when she takes 3 months maternity leave). We obviously have a savings buffer, but touching that money is not something I'm eager to do.

Option 3 is to suck it up and spend 3 days/week out of town at my job. I've automated most of it (I'm a systems administrator) and can probably carve out some more spare time at my desk to use for working on my portfolio and job search. I wouldn't lose any income, and if I raise my rates on my client, I may make a little more money.

Option 4 is to bring in an unpaid intern to cover my third day for me and roll him into my job when I finally quit. My boss might be amenable to this. The downside is that the intern might see how much I've automated in my job and report to management, making me look lazy.

At the risk of sounding like Kirsten Dunst in the second season of Fargo, I feel like I can't self acutalize until I can focus exclusively on my goals and making them happen. I've also been reading _Essentialism_ by Greg McKeown (http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-The-Disciplined-Pursuit-Less/dp/0804137382), a book precisely about this - untangling what's unnecessary so you can focus on what is. I feel like I'm busy but not productive towards what I want my life to be, like I'm totally overextended and making no progress towards what's important. This has been going on too long.

**TLDR: Quit my dead-end job, double down on my career transition and dip into the rainy day fund or put more time into my dead-end job and try to fill in the job search at the same time?**"

So I have a copy of CS6 on my computer that I use. However, because of my internship I have been able to install some of the CC versions of programs. My boss's account works across two computers and he needed me to edit some video specifically in CC.

Anyway, the Adobe Update Application tells me that I can update my CS6 apps. If I preform these updates, will I still be able to use my CS6 apps if I have to remove the creative cloud suite sometime in the future? Or will the CS6 apps be tied to my boss's account like the CC versions currently are? I don't want to update for bug fixes then be stuck without any way to use the Adobe suite at all."
42zrku,13,2016-01-27,Ginger and her Auto-Immune Disease called GME/MUE,MISTRESSshake,corgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/corgi/comments/42zrku/ginger_and_her_autoimmune_disease_called_gmemue/,"So I started talking about this in the comments section of Elizabeth the pup that passed away and felt that that area should be for her and her family and not Ginger's story. That said, I received several PM's and a couple of comments about what she has so I figured a post of its own was best. 


Not too long ago I had posted here about my fear that Ginger had OCD as she was constantly chewing her feet. All four of them had been chewed raw and at the recommendation of our vet (please don't start another discussion about her advice) we were told to reprimand her to stop, use a bitter apple spray (that Ginger just chewed right through) and encourage her to do the things she liked like fetch, walks and swimming. Everyone here seemed to think that this was a food allergy, but it looks like this was the first sign that something was wrong. 


We had Ginger back in the vet on Monday January 11, because I was becoming more concerned about the foot chewing and what I could only describe as her being depressed.  She wanted nothing to do with us or her favorite toys and games. My husband had her in the pool (we live in Florida) on Sunday and we could tell that she loved the pool but was doing it more for him than herself and she wasn't swimming as quickly as she used too. We also noticed after her swimming adventures she had a bit of a limp in her back leg. We could never perfectly narrow it down to which leg because let's be honest they are so low to the ground and hop like bunnies when they run. Vet felt that she probably had a back injury since her legs were moveable and she was able to grab them pretty rough without Ginger whining or flinching. We were sent home with Prednisone and told to keep an eye on her. 


On Wednesday the 13th my husband had walked her and brought her back inside to make a work call. He walked past her about an hour later to having a full on seizure; convulsions, foaming mouth, non-reactive pupils, he described it as exactly what you see in on TV. Our neighbor had them both in the car and at the vet in about 20 minutes her seizing never stopped.  The vet gave her a dose of Diazepam and the seizing stopped but as soon as the half life of the drug came around she would start again, he doubled her dose and that kept her still for about 20-30 minutes max. They stayed open for us treating her as they went until an overnight Vet ER opened at 6:00pm. They loaded her with one last double dose of diazepam and sent us on our way, with all of her records, blood results and treatments they did. They also referred us to a neurologist where I was able to get an appointment the next day. 


The overnight clinic had her on a Phenobarbital overnight and stayed open late for us so that she could be on the meds as long as possible so that we could make the hour journey to the specialist. Within about 20 minutes of her being off the pheno drip she started to seize. It's a scary thing to watch as all you can do is talk to her and tell her she is a good girl. The seizures post meds were less violent and quite mild in comparison but they were still crushing to watch her go through. 


When we arrived at the clinic there was a nurse up at he front desk by chance and when she say my husband carrying in a seizing dog she ran out snatched up Ginger had me put the envelope of her records in her mouth and rushed her to the back without even asking if we had an appointment or had been there before. I had a lot of confidence in this place at that point. I had ore registered Ginger the night before on their website and everyone was stellar at expediting all of her info through. We met with two neurologists and neurology intern once they had stabilized Ginger enough to talk to us about what was happening. 


The lead neurologist explained that due to her age (6 years old) that it was an 80% chance of a tumor, 10% chance she had a stroke and 10% chance she had a rare autoimmune disease. I am 9 months pregnant and they had us convinced we had at most a year left with her. She is the reason my husband and I are together (he got her and met me the same night Ginger-the-icebreaker). We basically told them whatever it cost and whatever needs to be done we need to know what we can do for her. 


First she had an ultrasound of her stomach to check for tumors, blockages and a possible toxin origin.  US came back clear, so they knocked her out for an MRI of her brain, that came back with no tumors or growths but the left side of her brain and spinal cord were both so swollen that there was no spinal fluid circulating around. They said the only real way to know if it was an auto-immune disease would be to give her a spinal tap but because of how swollen her spinal cord was doing one would kill her instantly. We asked what would happen if we treated for GME/MUE and she didn't have it, they basically said the prednisone would take down the swelling either way and we would just be out the cost of the chemo if she didn't need it. 


We started treatment immediately. They gave her a loading dose of chemo and steroids to basically destroy her immune system and the steroids to bring down the swelling.  At this point the specialist told us she had an 60% chance of surviving the night and that we should try and come in before they close up for the night.  What we walked into that night was awful to see. Ginger could no longer stand on her own or control her bladder. She had a urinary catheter, a port in her arm, tubes in her nose, her tongue was hanging out and she couldn't open her eyes for more than a few seconds. She had no idea where she was or what was going on and because I'm pregnant I couldn't kiss her. I was made to wear a robe and two pairs of gloves, I couldn't get very close to her and all I wanted to do was scoop her up and love her. We left Thursday with broken hearts and the worst feeling in our stomach's every time our phones rang we were convinced it was them telling us what happened. 


Friday morning came and the vet called us within minutes of walking in. She told us that Ginger pulled through the night and was making improvements. While she still did not have much muscle control she was able to lift her head and ate food when hand fed, she had to be shown where her water was.  She still could not walk on her own and her vision was definitely sub-par but all in all they were happy with her improvements. We went to see her at about 9am.  She was like Stevie Wonder when we walked in, her head was just rolling around and they had placed a cone on her to prevent her from hitting the walls of her cage as well as to protect her ports from being drooled on or chewed out if she could find them.  She had basically no control of herself and had no idea that we had walked into the room, I know for a fact she could not see us or determine who was who since we were both the same height when peering into her cage. When we started to talk she knew it was us, she could not stabilize her head enough to look at us but she was definitely trying to follow our voices. I felt that we were taxing her out and told my husband as hard as it is we should go because she was really straining to move her body and head to come towards us. We left and cried our eyes out and tried to see the silver lining but honestly it's just so hard. We were again told her chance of surviving the night isn't super high but no news is good news from us. 


Saturday morning was the biggest improvement we had seen by far. The head spins had stopped and she was able to stand if someone helped her up.  She was weak but improving and her vets were so happy with what they saw.  She still couldn't see but they were able determine she wasn't blind, they assumed that her ocular nerves were just extremely swollen and it was effecting her ability to focus but if they put a hand near her face she blinked or if they reached in she would follow there arm the direction it went but she couldn't find their hand. We visited again and I put my hair into her cone and I could see here rubbing her face around in it she was all but eating it off my head, I could hear her nose breathing at a mile a minute to get my smell. It was the first day that I realized she knew for real that we were there and specifically for her. We stayed as long as we could and left when they asked us to. They told us that she would be finishing her loading dose that night and we would be able to take her home on Monday (they didn't have office staff on Sunday's).


Sunday morning we were given an update and told Monday was definitely okay for us to pick her up.  She had her catheter removed and was able to walk to pee but was carried back into the clinic since she didn't have the energy to walk. She was still having very minor seizures (a Parkinson's like head bob or ""Catching Flies"") but they weren't concerned since they stopped immediately upon treatment and wouldn't happen again.


We picked her up at noon on Monday and she was walking on her own. She had a tough time figuring out who was who in the room but she clearly knew that the two of us were mom and dad and she was not letting us leave without her. We took her home with a bag full of meds and a page and a half worth of instructions for what to do with her and how to give her what medications and when. Monday night she had another seizure before her PM dose of meds were administered and we took her back to the ER vet and took all her stuff with us.  They had us give her the meds and monitored her with us, her head bobbing didn't stop so they told us to give her another 1/4 of a pill and watch her closely if anything changed for the worse bring her in immediately. She stopped and slept most of the night, we did not any jingle of her harness or serious shift in weight we were running to check her. 


Tuesday was a little better, the meds make her drink an obscene amount of water so she needs to pee like every 20 minutes she had one more minor seizure (catching flies) but we just watched her and decided to wait it out. 


Since Tuesday she has slowly improved daily, from wanting to play, to regaining some more of her eyesight, she is slowly and surely improving a bit. She is still tired out quickly, is weak on her legs, but has been completely seizure free for 6 days and that is the most amazing thing we could ask for.  She has stopped chewing her feet and is slowly becoming more of the dog she was before all of this started. I would not describe her as depressed anymore and rather just tired and weak. We still have a hell of a way to go, she will be having chemo every 3 weeks and will be on Phenobarbital and Prednisone for just about the rest of her life (they hope to taper down the doses but she will always be on something). We don't know how much time she will have left doing these kinds of treatments but any amount of time is better than none.

42zrrv,5,2016-01-27,Advice about sexual harassment at work,HappyMealwExtraHappy,AskFeminists,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/42zrrv/advice_about_sexual_harassment_at_work/,"Hello everyone.  A friend of mine has been co-op-ing at a software company, and she's been doing really well.  So well that she is in the process of being offered a full time position.  Her position would be under the operations manager (male), and it is here where the problem lies.  He was speaking to her the other day about the position, and ended up saying something along the lines of ""it would be difficult being your boss because I'm attracted to you"".  This caused her some distress, and she started questioning his motives for the offer as well as her qualifications.  

It really saddened me that such a great opportunity was tarnished by this situation.  She and I even talked about her simply leaving this company at the end of the internship and trying to find a job somewhere else.  She is well accepted by her peers and has been told by others that she'd be a good fit, so I'm sure that she is qualified for the role.  
  
I guess I just wanted to hear how others might have dealt with similar situations.  Did it cause career damage?  Did HR help with resolving it?  Were you able to stay at the company after the incident?"

You sell your gaming keyboards, mice, and gamepads. You laud the amount of features they have, but do nothing with them.  I browse this reddit sub thread just looking for a game that may take advantage of some of your ""features"".  
   I have seen countless posts asking if any game supports Arx, or the G910, G410; Nothing,nada, zero, zip, zilch is apparently the number of games that take advantage of it. Why the hell don't you put something out?  How many keyboards would you sell if you partnered with a big name developer to create a simple profile? 

As an example fallout 4, it would be great to have lighting effects for the G910. 

-If your out of ammo or low the reload key flashes.
-If if the pipboy is open, the keys do something special.
-Health bars / rad bars / companion health..
-etc.. etc..

But what do we get? Breathing lights... the WASD keys are red. WOW(sarcasm)!!!

If you want to get developers interested in what your devices can
do.  Give them an example!!!  Consoles sell controllers that are themed.  I'm not a guy who wants a keyboard wrapped in a theme but I would definitely look twice at something like in combination with a big title and a ""dynamic"" profile would keep that keyboards abilities in the back of my head.

I know you gave us the SDKs to develop all these things but we cannot access some of these developers output to make these type of profiles.

ARX. Okay i understand that this is not a direct profit type of thing for you,  but it decidedly is a form of direct interactive advertisement for your brand.   We see pictures of what it can do and we have nifty little system monitor, but that's all.

 How about (as an example ) an Elite:Dangerous applet.

- You could go crazy with it. you could control combat systems.
- Interact with the station.
- peruse system maps.. 
- ect. ect.

You are having a contest which is very cool. And if modders where aware of its capabilities they would probably jump on it.  You have given them no examples. I am sure there is a modders subreddit that you could let them know about this capability.

Hire 1 guy/girl to make these profiles. A grad out of college would be happy to have a job doing this. Hell use an intern, instead of having them bring you coffee and collating reports on the status of your G series peripherals.

You have excited a lot of people with the possibility of what your stuff can do. Prove it!

430lkk,3,2016-01-27,"I (20F) have a crush on my coworker (20M), and don't know how to tell if he's ok with me flirting with him.",cidonys,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/430lkk/i_20f_have_a_crush_on_my_coworker_20m_and_dont/,"I suck at flirting.  The last time I tried to seriously flirt with a guy, I ended up really freaking him out, because I didn't recognise that I was making him uncomfortable. 

I don't want to do that again. 

So to set the scene: 

I, 20F, and Sam, 20M, are both interns at a small company. We haven't really hung out alone, but we and a few of our friends (also interns) have lunch together and play foozball in the break room most days. To be completely honest, Sam's closer friends with one of my teammates (22M, Andy) than with me, but that hasn't stopped me from getting a crush on him. 

I've been trying to flirt with him, or at the very least show interest. I make sure to invite him to things with our friends (which I know isn't flirty but at least says ""I'm thinking of you""), I try to keep eye contact for a smidge longer than I would otherwise, and smiling when I do catch his eye. I don't always succeed, but I feel like I'm getting better at it. 

I just don't know for sure that he's receptive to it. It sometimes feels like I don't particularly register to him as anything beyond ""Andy's friend."" 

But other times, it seems like maybe he actually sees me as my own woman - I was leaving work with a few other people, and he quickly glanced around, met eyes with me, and didn't look away or stop smiling, even a couple seconds after I told him where we were going, at which point I got flustered and looked down embarrassed and forgot to look back while I was walking away. 

Or when we were on a team for foozball, joking back and forth about how poorly we were coordinating our moves, and he said ""That's *totally* how a relationship is supposed to work, isn't it /s"", and I just giggled instead of responding with the two-hours-later-obvious comeback of ""so this is a relationship now, huh?""

Or his foot bumping mine at our office game night, which in 90% certain was an accident, but he didn't apologise like I'd have thought he would if it was.

But all of those and all the rest I don't know if I'm just reading into it too much. He jokes around a lot, he's friendly, and maybe I'm just overthinking it. 

How can I tell if he's actually ok with my flirting? I want to escalate a bit, try breaking the touch barrier beyond high fives after a good goal and passing each other the ball, but I don't want to scare him off if he's not interested. 

Does it work to wait and see if he starts reciprocating? Do I need to just start going for it, watch if he seems to dislike my touching his arm/whatever, and go from there? Am I just completely hopeless?

Thanks, /r/relationships

TL;DR: I like a guy but suck at flirting. I don't know if he realises I'm trying to flirt, and the last time this happened, I really read the situation wrong and creeped the guy out. 

What are some ways to tell if he's ok with my flirting?"

Was thinking she could be from the age of 20-32 years old as his age can be more varied whether he is an older chubby IT worker that she has just started to work with, a worker of hers a few years younger than her, or even a intern or trainee.


Looking for her to be quite attractive and sociable as he would be more nerdy, possibly social awkward or even strange/pervy if you like.

Would like to do some build up with them interacting at work as maybe they chat at a social work event after work one day.


If you are interested shoot me a message and let me know which sort of guy as far as age range, looks, personality, and setup that would interest you."
430naf,0,2016-01-27,Should I [22/M] send this letter to my ex [22/F] and when,Athollian,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/430naf/should_i_22m_send_this_letter_to_my_ex_22f_and/,"A few weeks ago, me and my girlfriend of over a year broke up. 
The reason being I had just returned from a 6 month internship and the long distance had done damage to the relationship. Our break up was about as loving as a break up could be. We hugged, she kissed my forehead, we had no ill will to each other and I still don't. I took some time to evaluate how I really felt and I came to the conclusion that I was very much still in love with her. Talking to her friends, it also sounds like she is not over me, though she is trying to force herself

Anyway, I wrote this letter that I intend to send to her. What do you folks think of it? Also it's been 2 and a bit weeks since we broke up. Should I leave it a bit or just send it?

&gt;""Dear L, I was looking through my stuff at home and I found the letter you sent me before I left for Runcorn. I realised I never wrote back to you. I guess now is as good a time as ever. I hope this letter finds you well and gives you the context it gave me.
&gt;I won't lie, this time apart has not been fun. I've spent a lot of time trying to work out what had happened to us to get to this point. However, it has given me time to reflect on our time together. I have come to the realisation that I did not put my all into our relationship when I was away. I was so focused on surviving Runcorn, I didn't truly see how hard it was for you. Sure, I paid money to get on a train to come home; but I wasn't taking ownership of our relationship, leaving most of it up to you. I understand how hard that must have been and it hurts to know I may have been the cause of your sadness. I'm so sorry for putting you through that.
&gt;When we broke up, I'll admit I was gutted. I was upset and irrational and didn't have any answers for you. I still remember those questions. Did I love you or just being in a relationship? How could I fix it? I really screwed up there. Now some time has passed and I have come to my conclusions, albeit a little late. I have realised I do still love you and only you. I wouldn't change a thing about you and want all the best for you. I love your drive and your determination to be friends with everyone. I love how clever and sophisticated you are but still crack amazing jokes. I love your personality (and you're really hot too). If you want to go away for 6 months, I would support your decision fully, as I know you would be doing something you love.
&gt;When it comes to fixing us, I realise that it can't be fixed so easily. I don't want a broken relationship with you. I want to build a new one with you. When we were together, you brought out the best in me. My confidence is better, I'm more sociable, more health conscious. I am now a better person because of my time with you. I'd like to thank you for that. I like to think I brought out the best in you too. I felt so comfortable around you and I think you were with me too. I loved being there for you when times got tough and spending time together doing fun things, whether it was exploring Sicily or just what was on Netflix.
&gt;I know this letter may not help my case but I have to try or I'll never know if I had a shot. I do not expect a response, I just want you to consider all the good times we had together. Even when it hurt, it was mainly because we loved each other. I miss seeing you smile and going all mushy when you see a cute dog. I miss giving your foot rubs and our in-jokes. I miss the great sex (and it was great) and cuddles. I admit I even miss the bath bombs and when you're non-stop tickling. I know it wouldn't be easy but great things never are. And we were great together.
&gt;Whatever your decision, I hope you do what makes you happy. That's all I ever wanted for you.
&gt;Best wishes, J
&gt;p.s. I finally bet your crossy road score. High score is 374. Balls in your court, Keen Bean [nickname]. Good luck""


btw. Our friend groups are so heavily interlinked that if I were to try and block her out of my head, I'd literally have to leave uni to succeed so just going cold turkey is off the table."
430o80,1,2016-01-27,Futa4F - Sarah Korhonen: A Monster Waiting To Happen,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/430o80/futa4f_sarah_korhonen_a_monster_waiting_to_happen/,"It is 8PM in the evening, and Sarah Korhonen is doing dishes. There is nothing particularly sinister about this act: Sarah has simply finished a plate of lasagna, and is cleaning up after having put away her leftovers. Nothing terribly unusual, although she ate the meal alone, which one could think of as being a little sad.

Sarah is not particularly unattractive. At the age of 39 - rapidly approaching 40 - her curves have filled out nicely, and only the odd wrinkle has started to show around her eyes. In four years’ time, she will have her first grey hair, but for now it is a dark shade of auburn that contrasts nicely with her pale blue eyes. Her skin - once again, largely bereft of wrinkles - is a delightful shade of light pink, a product of her Finnish ancestry. 

Genetics have also bestowed upon her a reasonably large pair of breasts, but - superficially speaking - her best features occur below the waist. Her ass is round, soft and full, and perfectly complemented by a pair of exceptionally wide hips; “child-birthing” hips, if you will. Indeed, it’s these two locations, along with her thick thighs, that almost all of her body fat settles, which is not to say that she’s *fat*, by any means. “Delightfully plump” might be more apt.

All of that said, it is unlikely that Ms. Korhonen will be putting those “child-birthing” hips to their titular application. This is for a short, but rather critical list of reasons. The first is that, for all intensive purposes, Sarah is not attracted to men. Indeed, Sarah has dedicated an unworldly amount of her time fantasizing about the various women in her life. Coworkers. Retail employees. Neighbours. Strangers. Even - and this in particular she would adamantly deny - some of her younger relatives. So, to phrase it with some degree of vulgarity: Sarah Korhonen has pussy on the brain.

The second reason is, well, rather anatomical. Sarah wasn’t born like most girls. For the most part, she developed like any other woman: she hit puberty at the proper time, her curves developed exceptionally, her voice became musical in tone, if somewhat husky in timbre. All in all, she appeared to be a perfectly normal middle-aged woman. The only exception was the presence of a 9-inch phallus in place of a clitoris and a pair of egg-sized testicles in place of ovaries.

Just how different would Ms Korhonen’s life have been had her parents been a touch more… *accepting* of her gender? As a child she learned that under no circumstance was her penis to be mentioned, within or outside of the house. There were no sleepovers for little Sarah, and in fact there would be no spending time with her friends *at all* outside of school hours. Instead, Sarah read books, listened to music and learned to cook.

Although she was allowed more freedom as she grew older and more “responsible”, Sarah lived in that repressive household until the age of twenty-four, when she went to college to obtain a degree in Business Management. Still, despite her escape, the damage was done. Anything approaching a romantic - or, God forbid, *sexual* - interaction would send waves of anxiety through the poor woman, sinking any and all potential relationships before they had a chance to set sail.

And now, at the age of thirty-nine - almost forty - Sarah Korhonen lives alone in a very nice, very *quaint* two-bedroom condominium in the suburbs. She uses the second bedroom as a home office.

That is not to say that her life has been completely chaste and sterile; Sarah’s sexuality has not been destroyed, it has merely been dormant. For one, she’s become an expert at both manual masturbation and the creation and use of improvised sex toys. More importantly, though, is that she has done far more depraved things than most people have dreamed of. Whips and chains, gags and plugs, ropes and corsets, boots and heels, leashes and collars, leather and latex… These are the things Ms. Korhonen thinks of when her hands dip beneath the sheets.

Still, solitary perversion is not her only area of expertise. Sarah has become quite good at cooking and baking. She has a recipe for chocolate-espresso macaroons that are to *die* for, and she’s the type of person who always brings some to share. Most people agree that she’s a bit of a sweetheart, a *total softie*, really, and now that she’s in middle management she does her best to keep everyone’s lives as stress-free as possible. Truly, she likes it when people are happy.

Which is where you come in. *Why is Sarah Korhonen single?*, you wonder. She’s attractive, kind-hearted, intelligent and friendly. Exactly the kind of person you’ve been looking for in a partner - or a fling.

What could possibly go wrong?

You’ll have your answer in a few months’ time, when you’re bound and gagged, whip marks criss-crossing your back while loud, *angry* grunts echo from behind you. There is an unbearably thick cock burrowed deep inside your pussy, threatening to shoot a hot, creamy wad of white semen directly against your cervix. This could happen at any time; SHE has been edging inside of you for *hours*. Of course, there’s no risk of pregnancy: birth control drugs have been slipped into your meals every day since you came to live here.

And besides, at this moment, pregnancy is the least of your worries. Right now, a rubber-clad *fist* - HER first - is pressing roughly against your lubricated anus. It’s not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won’t be the last.

When that time comes, perhaps Sarah will feel bad about what she’s done to you. After all, she’s not heartless by any means. But she’s spent far too many years holding back, and now that you’ve opened the floodgates, there’s no way in Hell she’ll let them close.

But right now, Sarah Korhonen is doing the dishes.

---

How do you know Ms. Korhonen?

- *The Intern*: You’re new to the company, and you quickly come to appreciate Sarah’s hands-on approach to employee management. She keeps you well-informed on what needs to be done and how to do it, keeps you in the loop on all pertinent information, and insists that if ever you need help or advice, her door is always open. After all, she was the new girl once, and you want to succeed. You know office romance is frowned upon by upper management, but asking her out on a date wouldn’t be *too* scandalous, after all she’s done to help you...

- *The Neighbor Girl*: Ms. Korhonen had been a fixture of the suburb for several years before your family arrived, and was the first to welcome you all to the neighbourhood - with a fantastic fruit arrangement and pastry tray in tow, of course. Soon enough, she and your mother were fast friends, and not long after that you began doing chores around the kindly-natured woman’s house. You certainly couldn’t complain: the pay was exceptional for the kind of menial labor involved, and you never felt so well-fed as you did heading home after a post-lawnmowing ‘snack’ with Sarah. Perhaps - no, almost certainly - because of the hormones running through your adolescent mind - you began to fantasize about the smoking-hot older woman, and soon you began to devise plans to seduce her...

- *The Waitress*: Honestly, you never thought you’d be working at the restaurant long enough to have a favorite customer, but when it came to Sarah, you always knew you would have a pleasant shift. For one, her tips were always exceptional - sometimes going as high as 50%! She would always give it a hand-wave: “Oh, where else am I going to spend it? Besides, you always do *such* a good job…”. Whenever it was a slow shift, you found yourself sitting across from her, chatting sometimes for hours between customers. Talking was always *easy* with her, and sometimes you got the impression that she was a bit lonely. What the hell, maybe it’s about time the two of you eat somewhere *else* for a change...

- *Someone Else:* Surprise me!

We have been trying to buy a house approx 225 grand, a great price for the area and state of the house.

I am getting financing through a VA loan, but it keeps having issues in underwriting. 

The problem is that we attempted this too early- I am just starting a new job, and am in a one month internship until the end of Feb, making significantly less than what I will make as a full time employee. The loan is based on this internship pay, and the underwriters do *not* like it.

My husband is self-employed, and I do not understand what the issue is with his income, because he makes significantly more than I do.

We have 3k in earnest money invested already, and the sellers have requested another 2-3k more **by tomorrow**, or they will not extend the contract again. 

Our original loan guy jerked us around for a month or so, always promising that the loan had been approved, only to cancel everything and request more information at the last second- I think we have had to cancel closing twice. We have gotten with a new loan guy, who seems much more competent, but am not sure if he's just better at bullshitting than the first guy.

We have 30k in savings that could go towards the house immediately.

What would you do?

We approached the sellers, and they do not want to rent for a month or two.

With pertinent information displayed onward to the question.

I am trying to decide on if the cost of living of SF state and East Bay are worthwhile for the education. I do wish to work for any of the big 4 in either auditing or financial consulting like creating and pitching cost effective solutions for operations troubles or changes to clients. After roughly 2-5 years I then want to re-evaluate where I am at and decide upon CMA CPA or MBA to further my career. However, I do not know how reasonable this plan is and whether or not the extra 10,000 or so a year in living expenses over the more rural and cheaper colleges is worth it.

So what do you think R/Accounting?
Is SF state worth the extra cost
Is East Bay even a viable college if i want a serious career in accounting and finance?
Would having to go to a college like Stanislaus or Fresno be that big of a hindrance to trying to get internship and an entry level at any of the big four?

My parents used to encourage me into becoming either a nurse or to join the military (my mother is a nurse and my father was a corpsman in the Navy).  During the first years of college, I entertained the idea of become a nurse.  I volunteered at hospitals and took intro courses.  I enjoyed the act of helping and talking to people, but the environment was just too depressing for me.  At the time, I didn’t even want to consider joining the military in any way.

While in college, I switched majors to digital media.  Growing up, I had more artistic tendencies and aspirations.  I used to love drawing a lot.  I would take an image (usually a cartoon or comic) and try to recreate it.  I‘m also a musician.  I’ve learned to play piano, guitar, and percussion (marching, drum set, mallets).  I was a heavily involved member of the school bands throughout high school and some college.  I figured getting a degree in digital media would be a perfect fit for me.  The problem is that this major doesn’t focus on any one concentration.  I took courses in web and graphic design, video and audio editing, and animation.

Shortly after graduating with my Bachelor’s, I went to an eight-month program at a recording arts school.  I decided to focus on audio and music production and thought that it was something I really wanted to do.  Became involved in a few internships and was devoted to what I was doing.

However, life happened and I had to move in with my girlfriend and her parents.  I worked under her stepfather as a maintenance worker, cleaning pools and fixing things for a string of condos.  I was also in the process of joining the military as a reservist.  After a couple of trips to MEPS, I was finally on my way to basic training.

After “A” School, I became an IT in the Navy reserves.  I would drill with my unit one weekend a month and two weeks a year.  For a while, I was looking into civilian IT jobs, but with no luck.  My wife and I thought about opening our own business one day.  I then decided to go to school again to earn my Master’s.

I graduated with a Master’s degree in entertainment business.  With my student loans coming up soon, I was frantically searching for a job.  Came across a job working at a music instrument store.  The job involved travelling to schools in the area and being the company representative for all repair, instrument, and rental needs.  The pay was decent and seemed like a desirable job.  I thought I would get summers off while still receiving salary and sounded like a really good gig, overall.  I was hired just in time for school loans to kick in.

Almost two years later, I am still at this job, but I am miserable and constantly stressed.  This job ended up being a lot more involved than I thought. I may get summers off (for the most part), but the busiest season happens right when school starts in the fall.  During rental season, I would travel to my schools during the day and hold rental meetings at night.  Filling out the paperwork and retrieving the instruments also took up a lot of time.  

The problems I’m having with this job is how high my expectations are and constantly taking work home with me.  I’m somehow supposed to visit and service over 80 schools and their various music directors (band, orchestra, guitar, chorus) between two counties.  There are some schools that are only visited on a bi-weekly schedule.   Before I came onboard, relations between directors and this position and company were fragile, as there was a high turnover rate.  I have successfully developed and revived working relationships with most of these schools.  However, talking and gaining the trust from directors was the easy part.  Because I’m on the road all day, it’s very difficult to do the other work expected of me without losing time.  There are also many events that we have to attend to stay on directors’ good side.

This job has become too stressful and I feel like I have burnt out.  I try really hard to do a good job in everything I do, but it has become increasingly difficult to stay motivated.  One good thing about this job is that I don’t always have someone constantly breathing down my neck; I’m just on my own.  But lately it seems like I only hear from my boss if I screw up.  I can feel the relationship slowly crumbling with a handful of directors.  Without going into too much detail, the expectations are simply too high for one person to handle efficiently.

I just want a job where I don’t have to worry about it when I’m at home.  I’m constantly stressing about work.  I always tell myself that I don’t care anymore, but in reality, I do.  Like I said, I always try to do the best of my abilities in everything I do.  I heard a saying recently that stress is caused by actually giving a fuck.  Throughout my time at this job, more and more responsibilities and expectations have been given to me with no raise in pay.  It’s concerning that there have been several people who quit/got fired before me.  My counterpart rep (different counties) quit less than a year ago.  Our affiliate manager quit during the summer.  My boss is a district manager for two different states, for both retail stores and ed reps.  Everyone is being spread out too thin!  I feel like these are all red flags.

I feel guilty for wanting to leave this position, especially since I have a family to take care of.  I get a company vehicle, phone, and tablet.  The company pays for business mileage.  The pay is somewhat decent (just not enough for what the job is).  Health insurance, 401K, employee discounts.  But the job just flat out sucks!  The amount of daily stress is just not worth it.  I am grateful to have a job in this economy, but I feel like I’m being moved somewhere else.

My dream job would be to work as a musician or in audio.  But because of my circumstances, it’s just not a viable option to pursue full-time. The thought of losing money and having to start over in another career field is extremely unsettling.  

Your advice is greatly appreciated.  I just feel so lost and am hoping to find some answers.

TL;DR – Want to discover my life’s calling.  Interests include: music and audio.  Current job is soul sucking and takes too much stress/time.  Looking for job that is fulfilling and can support my family. "

432jqp,0,2016-01-28,Foreigner guy looking for some weed.,Lawasticot,london,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/432jqp/foreigner_guy_looking_for_some_weed/,"Hi mates !

I am a 22 yo French guy actually in internship in London since 1 month, it's my first time in London and I really like your city even though the French food and the cost of living here is too high for me :p but whatever.
I have some parties in the next weeks with some friends and I would like to bring some green over there. Unfortunately they don't know where I can get some. Few weeks ago, I went to Wood Lane, thanks to a girl I met on Tinder, and after 3 long hours freezing my ass off and randomly walking through the neighbourhood, I managed to get some. 

I am actually looking for a ""safest"" spot or atleast a place where I could get some for sure and closer to Hammersmith/shepherd's bush (where I live)

Obviously since it's illegal over there, I don't expect many answers and this post is probably against this subreddit rules but only one good answer could make my day better :)

Cheers !"
432u3q,1,2016-01-28,"I'm in need of advice. My gf and I live abroad and she is becoming depressed. Im doing what I can to help. I'm reaching out to those who've experienced this for some words of wisdom. Women and Men, give me a hand!",PikturCinema,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/432u3q/im_in_need_of_advice_my_gf_and_i_live_abroad_and/,"

Hi TwoXChromosomes,

My gf has been struggling a lot with work and living abroad. We started out great and it now she's lost so much motivation in her day to day life. 
Some background. My GF (24) and I (25, M) are Americans living abroad in Asia. We met here, and have both been here for about a year. We've been dating exclusively since October, so things are pretty new for us. 
She was studying abroad here and actually finished her last credits here, so she's officially graduated. Now she is interning. She's trained as an architect, but her internship is more related to working with software doing things she won't really be doing as an architect. The company she's been working for has miscalculated and underpaid her what she's owed (which is tiny to begin with) 3 months in a row. Shes complained several times but the person doing payroll is completely incompetent when it comes to accounting). She's taken up tutoring and a few other side jobs and is making ends meet, but she is miserable. Also, her best friend here (who was interning with her) had to return to her home country, so she doesn't have any other friends here. 

She has struggled to finish her portfolio, but has finally completed it, so now she can start looking for work and make a salary she can live on. It's great to have made it to this point (she struggled to find the motivation), but she already had one job interview and hopefully more to come. 

Recently, she's also been facing a lot of the troubles you can eventually come to if you live abroad: she misses home and all the things that are familiar from home like the food, weather, and general way of life. That being said, we both know she wants to stay here. It's just that the little things here and there get under her skin so easily. 

On top of all of this, she's really annoyed by her landlord/roommate. He's not a bad guy, but he has an immense amount of free time and is always asking her to hang out. (He's gay, so he's not interested in her in anything besides friendship). 

Almost every time I've seen her this month, she starts crying about her work situation and the things that bother her about living here. (I went through a very similar situation a few months after I moved here from the states. It was culture shock, frustration, and just a longing for familiar things.) I've sat back and just listened, given her advice that worked for me like going to the gym, talking to my parents, and going home for a week or 2. They all played a big part in my recovery and adaptation. The one problem I didn't have is the financial one. I work for a big company that pays a decent, consistent salary. 

I just suggested the gym and being active today, but I mentioned going home to recalibrate before. 
She can't pay for the flight herself, so I've suggested asking her parents. She's fiercely independent, and refuses to ask them, even though they could afford it with no problem, and I am SURE they would want to if they could see how much their daughter is suffering every day (I don't think she's really opened up to them about how she really feels). 

Her and I are about to go on our first trip together as a couple this upcoming week. We're going to another country in Asia, where there will be sun and beaches (which we are desperately missing now), so I'm hoping to bring up her mood and shift her mindset away from those troubles temporarily. Note: she has to leave the country for visa purposes, so the company she's interning at is paying her part. 

I know that at the end of the day, this is something she needs to work through herself. Once she has a job where she feels like she is being paid fairly and doing something more in line with what she thinks she should be doing, things will get better. It's just hard to see her suffering so much. I do what I can to listen and comfort her, but she is in a perpetually bad mood. She hasn't wanted to have sex since all this began towards the end of December. 

All of this together has been difficult for me as well. We've had plenty of good times together, and I know that we can get there again, but I'm really feeling drained. I am there for her and will continue to give her what I can, but the constant negativity is hard to bear. 

So, women who have gone through something similar and men who have seen your partners struggle so hard, what advice do you have? I know this is something she needs to solve for herself, but what can I do to help her?"
433510,2,2016-01-28,What is a Good Alarm App?,Lily0323,mac,https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/433510/what_is_a_good_alarm_app/,"I have a particular need here. I'm an intern, and for work at the top of every hour I have to check some data to basically make sure everything is within an appropriate range. So for the rest of the hour I'm usually on my MacBook doing homework or something.

So I need an alarm app (actually or even a website would work) that:
1. Allows me to set multiple alarms (or one alarm to start at x:00 and repeat every hour)
2. Preferably has some sort of visual notification (laptop is muted)
3. Could let me save the alarms

All of these attributes would be awesome, but #1 is the only requirement."
4337i7,2,2016-01-28,"I'll admit I'm a bit of a mess, I'm not sure if I'm lazy or depressed",lilypushkin,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4337i7/ill_admit_im_a_bit_of_a_mess_im_not_sure_if_im/,"I dont really have anyone to talk to honestly, despite having a small group of nice friends. So unfortuntaly I though i would sent this out to the ether, telling my recent feelings and story briefly incase any of you have any input.... 

Here we go...

I used to be a motivated person, In college I was so inspired and enthusiastic about my work, I found it geniuinly exciitng and it was a pleasure to complete the work, even if at times it was incredibly stressfull. 
After graduating college I felt at a loss, I applied for a phd scolarship which I did not get and this added to my sense of disillusionment. I also failed to get any internships or jobs that I genuinly wanted. 
I got a job as a bus tour guide, which I had for a few months before I got let go. Getting let go wasnt the worst, as I was re applying for the scolarship, and also writing for an internet site. At this point in time I felt bad about not doing something that I wanted to do, but I was good at working for the day, writing job applications, writing for the interent site and staying busy. 
Before christmas the financial toll of not working began to become more obvious to me, luckily I got offered a job as a christmas temp in easons.9a book and stationary chain store) I enjoyed all the people I worked with, the actual duties in the job where not so bad, even if they were boring, and I was better at the work than I feared. However I had very few days off, and unfortunatly family commitments came up on the days off that I did have. I was exhausted from the early mornings and late evenings home. I felt like I was just working on adreniline, falling asleep on the bus home some evenings
I finished work on christmas eve, and spent the few days of christmas with my boyfriends family and my own family, this felt a bit like an obligation, I think I resented it somewhat, as I just wanted to be alone.
 In these days in my home county with my family I found myself sleeping very late, which is something that I had not really been in the habbit of for the previous 5 months or so, whether I was working or not. When I returned to my own home in dublin, I was glad to get away from my sometimes very stressful and problematic family but my sleeping late continued. I felt very tired all day. I decided that i probably needed a break and decided to not worry about it and to try enjoy some days off until my boyfriend returned to colelge
My boyfriends return to college signalled to me the point where I would get back into my usual routine, which was applying to jobs, writing, generally being as productive as I could as an unemployed person, however after about two weeks of this things started to go down hill. 
I remember feeling like a failure, being frustrated with my lot in life and circumstances. I got very defensive when I felt like my boyfriend or others put me down, and I resented people for this. I got very ‘moody’ perhaps withdrawing into myself. 
I longed for things to return to a point when I was happy,( ie college,) my second phd oppurtunity slipped further and further away despite being placed on a reserve list for funding. I felt I was losing a part of myself and noone understood.
I couldnt get out of bed in the mornings like I used to, sometimes I would wake up scared about what I would do with my day, I felt lathargic all the time, and my appetite decreased. Even mustering up the motivation to cook or eat breakfast was tough
I got very sad about life, scared almost at the expanse of disapointment that probably lay ahead for me. I even felt scared about commiting my life to my longterm boyfriend,whom I had never questioned my feelings for before. 
My motivations to find work have slipped away, I no longer have the energy to put in the effort required, or feel like I do not have the energy. 
I day dream a lot, mostly about a specific person that I had a crush on in college, but that I could not act upon, because of my boyfriend and because he was my supervisor, sometimes I am scared about how much I retreat into these fantasies. Today I made the decision to abondon them, however I still have strong emotional feeling towards that man, thinking about him makes me smile, knowing that I cannot be with him, is harder than I expected it to be, (I dont fall in love easily at all, so I’m surprised that I feel this way towards someone other than my boyfriend)
I feel a bit scared that I might be psychotic or that I have the potential to retreat from reality. I worry about how others percieve me, I worry that life is too long that I wont be happy, one night I prayed to gods that I do not beleive in (I’m an athiest) that I would not wake up in the morning. 
Today I am scared that I am depressed, or worse that I am just lazy that I am selfish 

I’m unsure what to do, what is a logical course of action, and how am I to feel happy again.any help/opionions appreciated"

433n1x,3,2016-01-28,Futa4F - Sarah Korhonen: A Monster Waiting to Happen,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/433n1x/futa4f_sarah_korhonen_a_monster_waiting_to_happen/,"It is 8PM in the evening, and Sarah Korhonen is doing dishes. There is nothing particularly sinister about this act: Sarah has simply finished a plate of lasagna, and is cleaning up after having put away her leftovers. Nothing terribly unusual, although she ate the meal alone, which one could think of as being a little sad.

Sarah is not particularly unattractive. At the age of 39 - rapidly approaching 40 - her curves have filled out nicely, and only the odd wrinkle has started to show around her eyes. In four years’ time, she will have her first grey hair, but for now it is a dark shade of auburn that contrasts nicely with her pale blue eyes. Her skin - once again, largely bereft of wrinkles - is a delightful shade of light pink, a product of her Finnish ancestry. 

Genetics have also bestowed upon her a reasonably large pair of breasts, but - superficially speaking - her best features occur below the waist. Her ass is round, soft and full, and perfectly complemented by a pair of exceptionally wide hips; “child-birthing” hips, if you will. Indeed, it’s these two locations, along with her thick thighs, that almost all of her body fat settles, which is not to say that she’s *fat*, by any means. “Delightfully plump” might be more apt.

All of that said, it is unlikely that Ms. Korhonen will be putting those “child-birthing” hips to their titular application. This is for a short, but rather critical list of reasons. The first is that, for all intensive purposes, Sarah is not attracted to men. Indeed, Sarah has dedicated an unworldly amount of her time fantasizing about the various women in her life. Coworkers. Retail employees. Neighbours. Strangers. Even - and this in particular she would adamantly deny - some of her younger relatives. So, to phrase it with some degree of vulgarity: Sarah Korhonen has pussy on the brain.

The second reason is, well, rather anatomical. Sarah wasn’t born like most girls. For the most part, she developed like any other woman: she hit puberty at the proper time, her curves developed exceptionally, her voice became musical in tone, if somewhat husky in timbre. All in all, she appeared to be a perfectly normal middle-aged woman. The only exception was the presence of a 9-inch phallus in place of a clitoris and a pair of egg-sized testicles in place of ovaries.

Just how different would Ms Korhonen’s life have been had her parents been a touch more… *accepting* of her gender? As a child she learned that under no circumstance was her penis to be mentioned, within or outside of the house. There were no sleepovers for little Sarah, and in fact there would be no spending time with her friends *at all* outside of school hours. Instead, Sarah read books, listened to music and learned to cook.

Although she was allowed more freedom as she grew older and more “responsible”, Sarah lived in that repressive household until the age of twenty-four, when she went to college to obtain a degree in Business Management. Still, despite her escape, the damage was done. Anything approaching a romantic - or, God forbid, *sexual* - interaction would send waves of anxiety through the poor woman, sinking any and all potential relationships before they had a chance to set sail.

And now, at the age of thirty-nine - almost forty - Sarah Korhonen lives alone in a very nice, very *quaint* two-bedroom condominium in the suburbs. She uses the second bedroom as a home office.

That is not to say that her life has been completely chaste and sterile; Sarah’s sexuality has not been destroyed, it has merely been dormant. For one, she’s become an expert at both manual masturbation and the creation and use of improvised sex toys. More importantly, though, is that she has done far more depraved things than most people have dreamed of. Whips and chains, gags and plugs, ropes and corsets, boots and heels, leashes and collars, leather and latex… These are the things Ms. Korhonen thinks of when her hands dip beneath the sheets.

Still, solitary perversion is not her only area of expertise. Sarah has become quite good at cooking and baking. She has a recipe for chocolate-espresso macaroons that are to *die* for, and she’s the type of person who always brings some to share. Most people agree that she’s a bit of a sweetheart, a *total softie*, really, and now that she’s in middle management she does her best to keep everyone’s lives as stress-free as possible. Truly, she likes it when people are happy.

Which is where you come in. *Why is Sarah Korhonen single?*, you wonder. She’s attractive, kind-hearted, intelligent and friendly. Exactly the kind of person you’ve been looking for in a partner - or a fling.

What could possibly go wrong?

You’ll have your answer in a few months’ time, when you’re bound and gagged, whip marks criss-crossing your back while loud, *angry* grunts echo from behind you. There is an unbearably thick cock burrowed deep inside your pussy, threatening to shoot a hot, creamy wad of white semen directly against your cervix. This could happen at any time; SHE has been edging inside of you for *hours*. Of course, there’s no risk of pregnancy: birth control drugs have been slipped into your meals every day since you came to live here.

And besides, at this moment, pregnancy is the least of your worries. Right now, a rubber-clad *fist* - HER first - is pressing roughly against your lubricated anus. It’s not the first time this has happened, and it certainly won’t be the last.

When that time comes, perhaps Sarah will feel bad about what she’s done to you. After all, she’s not heartless by any means. But she’s spent far too many years holding back, and now that you’ve opened the floodgates, there’s no way in Hell she’ll let them close.

But right now, Sarah Korhonen is doing the dishes.

---

How do you know Ms. Korhonen?

- *The Intern*: You’re new to the company, and you quickly come to appreciate Sarah’s hands-on approach to employee management. She keeps you well-informed on what needs to be done and how to do it, keeps you in the loop on all pertinent information, and insists that if ever you need help or advice, her door is always open. After all, she was the new girl once, and you want to succeed. You know office romance is frowned upon by upper management, but asking her out on a date wouldn’t be *too* scandalous, after all she’s done to help you...

- *The Neighbor Girl*: Ms. Korhonen had been a fixture of the suburb for several years before your family arrived, and was the first to welcome you all to the neighbourhood - with a fantastic fruit arrangement and pastry tray in tow, of course. Soon enough, she and your mother were fast friends, and not long after that you began doing chores around the kindly-natured woman’s house. You certainly couldn’t complain: the pay was exceptional for the kind of menial labor involved, and you never felt so well-fed as you did heading home after a post-lawnmowing ‘snack’ with Sarah. Perhaps - no, almost certainly - because of the hormones running through your adolescent mind - you began to fantasize about the smoking-hot older woman, and soon you began to devise plans to seduce her...

- *The Waitress*: Honestly, you never thought you’d be working at the restaurant long enough to have a favorite customer, but when it came to Sarah, you always knew you would have a pleasant shift. For one, her tips were always exceptional - sometimes going as high as 50%! She would always give it a hand-wave: “Oh, where else am I going to spend it? Besides, you always do *such* a good job…”. Whenever it was a slow shift, you found yourself sitting across from her, chatting sometimes for hours between customers. Talking was always *easy* with her, and sometimes you got the impression that she was a bit lonely. What the hell, maybe it’s about time the two of you eat somewhere *else* for a change...

- *Someone Else:* Surprise me!

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I’ll be playing a sweet, almost motherly middle-aged futa with one hell of a dark side just waiting to come out. I’d like for the story to start out very lovey-dovey and warm in tone, then gradually have things escalate to an almost nightmarish story of kink gone mad.*

*Despite the 3rd-person perspective of the prompt, I prefer doing the actual RP in 1st person.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, fisting, dubious consent, impregnation (late-game only), cumplay, sex toys, sweat, spanking, whipping, facesitting, humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

*I hope to hear back from you soon!*

I have around a year of internship experience but I wanted to know if it's feasible to find remote work doing MEAN at this point.  
433rp1,2,2016-01-28,I [M 22] started a stupid fight with my GF [20] and now she's having trouble believing/trusting certain things I say. Long post TLDR on bottom,TheeCock,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/433rp1/i_m_22_started_a_stupid_fight_with_my_gf_20_and/,"GF and I started dating about a year and a half ago through work. Immediately, we knew there was a future here. We've only gotten in a few fights that actually mattered, we have a great sex life, and we get along amazingly. Over the past couple months we've had in-depth conversations about marriage, kids, where we would live, etc. 

About 2 months ago, I accepted an tax accounting internship that is an hour drive from either of our places. We talked about how shitty it was going to be and how we'd never get to see each other, but that was about it.

Around Jan. 10th she started binge watching Doctor Who on Netflix because it's going to be leaving Netflix on Feb. 1st. Since then, any time I go over there, that's all we do. I started my internship in Jan. 18th, and the night before, I got pretty mad at her out of seemingly nowhere. It was a mess of emotions from my own nervousness regarding my internship to how I felt like she was more distant than usual. We went to bed upset.

Throughout the 18th - 24th, I was in a bad mood. I kept justifying in my head that she was at fault for me getting mad and her not wanting to do anything but watch Doctor Who was her way of distancing me. I brought it up a few times during the week, but it also ended fast. I couldn't get over it.

A couple of days ago, I finally got her to listen to what I had to say, but I ended up saying a few things that hurt her. Things like ""You don't care enough about this to actually talk to me"" and various statements about how she was distancing herself with Netflix and not caring to have sex anymore. Also, I said something along the lines of ""Just because someone says sorry doesn't me whatever happened won't happen again"", which is not what I meant to say. Immediately after I finished talking, something clicked and I realized how emotional and irrational I'd been for the past week and a half. Since then, everything I've done has been about apologizing and making it up to her. Bringing her food, giving her space of she wants it, not bringing up anything that might upset her, etc. She's
 continually said that she forgives me and that she loves me more than anything. However, last night she opened up a little and said that the main thing that was keeping her from completely getting over it is what I said about saying sorry. In her words, ""There's a little voice in the back of my head saying that you don't completely mean it and I don't know how to get rid of it."" We then talked about how neither of us is going anywhere and how much we love each other. 

She has had trust issues with her past boyfriends regarding sex, apologies, and other things. I've never lied to her and have always tried to be the most trustworthy BF. I'm afraid that she won't be able to get over this, as it's important to her. I know me getting upset was stupid and over completely nothing. Aside from what I've been doing, I have no idea how to help her or the situation. Advice?

TLDR: Because of a stupid, baseless fight that I started, GF has slight trust issue based on me being sincere when I apologize, and she doesn't know how to get over it. I don't know how to help her or the situation."
433zn4,2,2016-01-28,"Need to get something off my chest, talk to someone.",thatlazybum,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/433zn4/need_to_get_something_off_my_chest_talk_to_someone/,"Hey, first post ever on Reddit and I guess it has to deal with my anxiety and depression, go figure. 

For a long time, I always thought what I had was normal, that everyone thinks like this. But, after talking with some people, not many since I don't have many friends, started to realize that... no, these thoughts of suicide, these low self-confidence, this, what I view as, almost self-caused isolation isn't something that should be taken lightly. So, I went to therapy, found a therapist, just started, but right now, still beginning... and I thought things were getting better, but... I feel absolutely stressed, miserable today. 

Some background, I'm in college, I had a horrible high school experience that might've caused some of the problems I have today. And, right now, I'm still miserable in college. It's my second year, I don't have many friends, I don't participate in any campus events. I commute, so there's an actual hinderance there, but I can't get myself motivated to join, to make friends, to learn from a collaborative experience. To be specific, I'm a CS major who wants to go into development and programming, but I don't feel like I have any skills compared to any of my peers. There's an upcoming devfest, but... I don't want to go and I can't seem to convince myself that it's a good idea.

Today, I can't stop thinking about how it'll affect me in the future, that my lack of activities in college, that my lack of motivation to learn more will prevent me from getting a job or internship. I just feel like everyone around me is doing so well, while I'm just... being lonely, miserable, and not feeling any sense of enjoyment. I don't think this is what college should be like. No friends, no activities, almost no passion. I don't have much hope for the future; I try, but today I can't seem to get myself to believe that the future is worth looking forward to. I'm young, I know, just... hard.

Occasionally, I do think about what it'll be like to just end this, give up, kinda scary on most days, but today is one of those days where it feels like something that's a good decision to make. Which is scary and I will probably not feel the same way a day or two later. Had to get this out. It's poorly written and all, but... I just don't feel that happy today. Bit stressed as well."
4349ph,1,2016-01-28,HireVue Interview??,SaraMLuna,collegeinfogeek,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeinfogeek/comments/4349ph/hirevue_interview/,"I got an interview for an internship at Nordstrom.  The only thing is that the interview is through the computer where they record your answers and various managers can view your answers.  I tried a couple of preinterview questions and found that I tend to look away from the webcam. I know that this isn't the case for face to face interviews but somehow I can't bring myself to look at the webcam while I am answering the questions. 
Has anyone ever been interviewed this way? What are some tips you can give me to not feel as nervous/awkward during the interview?"
434aom,4,2016-01-28,Had an eight-person group interview yesterday. It went badly. I feel like garbage.,WildlifeAnalysis,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/434aom/had_an_eightperson_group_interview_yesterday_it/,"I’m a programming intern at a tech company. My boss recently told me that when my internship is over, I won’t be given a position on my current team because I’m not a good fit. That made me feel like shit. So I immediately started looking for job openings on other teams at the company. I managed to get an interview for a job that I thought would be much better for me. I really wanted the job. I even spent several hours studying and brushing up for the interview.

So I showed up to the interview yesterday, and it was a group interview. With the entire team. Eight fucking people. There was no friendliness, no chit-chat. They went around the room and drilled me with generic interview questions. It started off okay but it got worse and worse as it went on. I got no kind of verbal or visual feedback for anything I was saying. Everyone was stone-faced the entire time.

Eventually the stress really got to me. Then they asked me that shitty interview question “what is your biggest weakness.” I forgot to think of an answer to that one beforehand. I froze up and couldn’t think of what to say. I said I was sorry and that I was really overwhelmed. The boss said that we could take a break if I wanted. How fucking embarrassing is that?

So there’s no way I’m getting that job. Why the hell would they give me an interview like that? I guess they’re just not interested in hiring anyone who isn’t super extroverted and confident. I don’t get it. Fuck.

434jg3,8,2016-01-28,I had my first orgasm last night.,vanillaaaaa,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/434jg3/i_had_my_first_orgasm_last_night/,"So, some background. I'm a 23-year-old female. I lost my virginity during my sophomore year of college after being fairly prudish due to untreated depression. Not only did my meds help me beat depression, they gave me my first experience of sexual desire EVER.

During my college years and study abroad, I had sex with a lot of people - this including sober and drunk college boyfriends and hookups, as well as a handful of men in Europe during my travels. I don't mean to brag, truly, but I experienced a lot of things that people fantasize about: sex outdoors, sex with my older neighbor, a hot steamy relationship with my supervisor during an internship. I posted pics on gonewild and have skyped a few people from my shower. I have an awesome vibrator.

All of this aside, I never had an orgasm until last night.

I met someone on Bumble who I thought was very attractive. When I found out he had sustained an injury that made it difficult for him to walk, I was worried. I didn't think (not to sound rude) that I would be attracted to a guy with a cane.

But this bad boy with a soft, caring heart has hung out with me for three days straight, taking care of me, helping me set up furniture, but also just having fun. I told him I wasn't in the mood last night but he asked to touch me. I obliged. He asked to taste me... okay, I said. Then it felt so good, I was ready for more. He loves pleasing me - truly - and thinks I'm so beautiful. I finally could just relax. And he is so talented.

Before I knew it, it went from my usual sensitive twitches to this feeling of desire that I can't describe. This amazing hot sensation - the pleasure - the feeling of ""holy shit, is this real?"" and being transported to this alternate state of consciousness and euphoria and the happiness and warmth that I felt afterwards.

I didn't think I was capable. I just thought I had mini orgasms and that was all I could reach.

Boy, was I wrong.

EDIT: Jesus, so much negativity. If it was a dude who had trouble for some reason or medical condition or something, he'd be getting celebrated... people are calling me a liar just because I finally reached a milestone..."

435anw,4,2016-01-28,I (F/23) was about to get back together with ex BF (24/M) but he went through my phone last night and saw messages that made him flip out.,bitch5eva,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/435anw/i_f23_was_about_to_get_back_together_with_ex_bf/,"I apologize in advance for the long post.

My Ex and I broke up almost four months ago, we've had a really rocky relationship the last year. A year ago he left for an internship (we we're living together at the time) came back six months later and moved back in with me (our old roommates moved out and he had some of his classmates fill their spots). He told me that he had cheated on me while he was gone with two of his ex-girlfriends but I still wanted to work things out. The stress and mistrust from that inflamed my anxiety, he eventually asked me to move out so we could reset some of the bad habits we had fallen into. I was resistant but eventually agreed. I needed to work on myself and get some independence, I could see how having my first apartment completely alone would help with my personal growth and anxiety (My greatest fear is being abandoned). So I moved less than a mile away, surprise surprise we broke up less than a month after I moved out. The actual break-up was very sweet and amicable, we thanked each other, cried, slept together and he took me to my new apartment. He was proud of the strides i'd made with my anxiety but it was ""too late"".

Since then our ""relationship"" has been a terrible roller coaster of sadness and hope. I wanted to get back together this entire time but he told me there was no chance of us getting back together,so I resolved to work on myself. I tried dating around, sleeping with people, being alone and completely cutting myself off. A couple of weeks ago I divulged my intentions and told him everything, I was desperately trying to fill the hole he left with anything I could.  I told him I'd slept with two other people and only then did he tell me that he wanted to get back together. He said he was just waiting for me to grow up, not be so dependent. 

I went on vacation last week with no contact, when I got back he told me that my heart was his &amp; he's be waiting. Since I've been back things have been amazing...until last night. He went through my phone and got extremely jealous that I tried to have a one night stand with someone we know from high school while we were broken up!!! He is also upset that his sworn enemy (our old roommate) tried to hook up with me and I rejected him nicely instead of telling him what a piece of shit he is. He stormed out of my apartment at 2 am then called me and we argued until around 4:30. He says he can't trust me, I've tried everything and I just want to get some outside perspective. Am I chasing the shell of a relationship that doesn't exist anymore? I need a reality check."
435nkf,29,2016-01-28,MFWTK what they can do about college costs,throwaway4mfwtk,myfriendwantstoknow,https://www.reddit.com/r/myfriendwantstoknow/comments/435nkf/mfwtk_what_they_can_do_about_college_costs/,"My friend is currently attending community college in the United States, majoring in Computer Science, and is planning to transfer once they completes their 4 semesters there. My friend's main problem is that every college that they look at is apparently ""too expensive"" for their parents; their parents don't want to have to pay a single penny for my friend's college costs. This includes even things like filling out a FAFSA because ""[the school] doesn't need to know how much [my friend's parents] make."" As you can imagine, this makes things difficult for my friend.

Now, my friend isn't exactly stupid. They have a 3.83 GPA for college (graduating high school with around a 3.8), have submitted a technical paper to an upcoming conference, got a 1980 on their SATs, got hired for an internship at a large tech company as a college freshman, and some other things like that. However, everything my friend looks at about financial aid seems to focus more on one being a minority in some way than about merit. Naturally, my friend doesn't have anything that they can use to claim minority status. 

My friend has also tried talking to the financial aid and transfer-related people at their current school, but that seems to always turn into ""Your parents won't fill out a FAFSA? Have you tried asking them again?,"" which, as you can imagine, doesn't fill my friend with confidence about what they can do about this. 

So this leads my friend to wonder: Are they screwed? Should they find the cheapest possible school and just take out unsubsidized student loans? Or is there another option?"
435uew,7,2016-01-28,20 old Australian in Hamburg for Internship,WarmPants,hamburg,https://www.reddit.com/r/hamburg/comments/435uew/20_old_australian_in_hamburg_for_internship/,"Hey guys, 

As the title says I am a dude who has just moved to Hamburg from Sydney and was wondering if maybe this subreddit would be a good place to ask a few questions:

1) I have been in Hamburg for about 2 weeks now and while I really like the place, because I haven't spoken to many locals (I work with a bunch of international interns) I have been wondering if there are any hidden gems in Hamburg. I am a big fan of cafes and pubs and was wondering if I could get a local's opinion on the best spots in town. 

2) What is the best German language course in Hamburg? I am currently using online apps like Duolingo and Anki, but have heard that maybe doing a course at the university might be possible. 

3) What are some nice weekend trips? I have spoken to a few people that say that you should visit Lubeck or travel along the Elbe. 
I am hoping to do some hiking in the spring but don't really know of any good trails. 

4) What are some other cities to visit? Hamburgers seem to really not think Berlin is that nice but I feel I should go anyway.

If you could answer any of these questions or have any information that you think might be cool to know please hit me up. I'll take anything I can get. 

Danke "
43601i,3,2016-01-28,What is tax technology?,coloombiano,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/43601i/what_is_tax_technology/,"I'm currently a Junior in college who just got accepted into my universities PPA(Professional Program in Accounting) program. Basically this just means that I'll be staying an extra year in order to get my masters and my 150 hours so I can become CPA eligible. Now the thing is that I have to choose what my Masters track is going to be by February 12th, and I am unsure of what I want to do. This is where the title of the post comes into play. As of right now I am in between MIS and Tax, but today I discovered that one of our options is to do a MIS/Tax track. I know that if I choose this I will have an internship with a firm in their tax technology department,the only problem is I'm not sure what that means. Here are my questions:

1. What is tax technology? What do you do?

2. Is this too specific? What are my advancements opportunities both in public accounting and then after?

3. Does this allow me to later concentrate in just the MIS or tax aspect of it? Could I switch to like a Tax Management Consulting group later on or am I limited by my experience in tax technology?

4. Anything else you guys can tell me will be really appreciated. 

I really enjoy both of these tracks which is why this profession intrigues me, but at the same time I also like to think more long term. 
Thanks in advance and sorry for formatting and/or spelling I am on mobile!"
4366nq,2,2016-01-28,"My girlfriend [19F] and I [20M] broke up over Christmas after almost a year. I feel as though I've lost a part of myself, and I don't know how to let go. How do I let go?",Engineer_Bacon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4366nq/my_girlfriend_19f_and_i_20m_broke_up_over/,"So, I haven't always had the most social life. I'm more of a bookworm than anything else, usually lending more time to stories than a hangout with friends. It's a facet of my personhood that I've struggled with whole life, introversion. However, it just so happened that my dad worked for a rather large church, forcing me to place myself in the most social of situations, most of which I was incredibly uneasy in. I was the pastor's son, a little bastard to be sure, just trying to survive in this world. It was business as usual until one day when I overheard my dad talking about an intern program. It was this intern program, some months later, that would eventually lead me to her.


She was younger than me by a year, give or take. Short, attractive, hilarious, intelligent, and more. She was loved by all, and it was easy to see why. We slowly became friends, each growing more comfortable with the other until we were close. We were amazing, and I guess that's where things started. Many things happened in that time and I valued her as one of my closest friends. I guess that's when feelings grew, from our friendship.


However, it didn't last. She was in a destructive relationship, so I held my tongue. Then, she moved 850 miles away, and I held my tongue. i wasn't able to say how I felt until she eluded to the fact that she was in love with my with an ""accidental text"" which I initially believed was ""accidental"" until I smartened up. Even though there was such a distance between us, I shared my feelings, and so started our little trope into madness. We started dating.........long distance dating. 


In some ways, our relationship was stressful, the distance being a massive factor. Not being able to touch the person that you feel love for is hell. It was, however, not without it's charm. We talked for hours in the beginning, still in a ""honeymoon"" phase. We moved from that to the sending of handwritten letters, each sealed with as much love as I could relate with words. It was lovingly romantic and I cherished every letter. We visited each other eventually, each of us going out of our way to make the other happy. Summer, Thanksgiving, birthdays, and Christmas were consumed with the thought of her.


I loved her. She was beautiful to all, but I cherished every touch, moment, and memory more than anyone. I knew, in my heart, that I wanted to be with her. I wasn't like her past boyfriends, I cherished her, and she cherished me. 


Then it all came crashing down. Ever have that moment after you've almost fallen or come close to a rather disastrous end, a moment of panic where your heart is crashing against your ribs? That was my Christmas last year. I traveled over to spend the holidays with her, but everything was off. Her family affected her in ways I never realized were possible. She barely spoke to me, instead burying herself in her cellphone. It lasted for days. I won't lie, I didn't handle it well. I came to resent her and I didn't think that she was in the moment with me, only buried in her cellphone. We fought, made up, and fought again. She even packed her things one time, sitting on the front step for a taxi. She didn't treat me like I was her boyfriend, or even her friend. Instead I was just someone else of little importance. But I still loved her. We eventually agreed that we were heading in two separate directions. I was second year Biochemistry and she wanted to pursue Journalism. We decided to part as friends, but I don't know if I can.


We don't speak anymore. The few times I've tried to reconnect, she's completely shut me down, saying that she needs time. After a few weeks of silence, I decided to write her a final letter, and to send her letters with it. They were too painful to keep around, sitting there on my desk. In the letter, I told her how I felt. I told her how painful it was to hold hope when there was none to be seen, for us to be just friends for the rest of our lives. I told her goodbye, until next time.



Now I feel numb, trying to adjust to this, my new life. I see the love of those around me, those in loving relationships, and I feel only contempt. I don't know how to move on after having felt what I have, and I can't bare to look back at her without my heart tearing. Most people think that I've moved on, that I've healed from this whole ordeal, but at any moment I am a split second from weeping. It's been a while since we walked our separate ways, and I still wake up from dreams of her, crying myself back to sleep. I loved her, felt connected to her, and cherished her, and I will probably never be able to love her again. The most important person in my life has disappeared and taken a piece of my heart with her. What do I do? How do I move on from what I've felt? How do I stop loving someone, the person who influenced me the most to be who I am today? How do I stop this?


   
tl;dr: I'm drowning in my past and I have no understanding of how to let go. How do I let go?!"
4367wf,1,2016-01-28,"Can't let go, can barely cope...",Serlusconi,ExNoContact,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/4367wf/cant_let_go_can_barely_cope/,"Let me first apologize and thank anyone who is patient enough to read this. I have a bad habbit not being able to summarize things briefly or getting straight to the point. Apparantly it’s also an adhd thing. :( but i appreciate any feedback. 

My story was one of a long distance relationship
In 2013 i was planning to go to Japan, i had already gone in 2011 and fell in love with the country. I met this japanese girls online who had pictures of herself with children and the sweetest most warm face showed up, completely sweet normal girl. 
Because how she looked between those kids, maybe my instincts thought, future wife potential lol, i still don’t know, but i wanted to get to know her. 

I’m 9 years older than her, so i wasn’t really thinking much, she was 22, i was 31. 
She told me about herself, how she had worked for habitat for humanity in india and philipines. That for me, as a humanitarian and idealist, was beautiful. 
Here’s a 22 year old who’s not a shallow one. The time after i spoke a lot to her and everything i thought from first impression got confirmed, really sweet, caring, sensitive.

She told me she had a condition that might stop her from ever carrying a child full term, and if i wanted to stop talking to her she’d understand. I was shocked, but not because of the fact she had that medical issue, but at her age she already had to deal with that type of situations. I told her it’s quite early to talk about that, but if i liked her and this worked out, i wouldn’t ever let that fact stop me, i’d be able to love an adopted child as much as my own and never hold that against her if my concern was having kids. As long as i raise it with the girl i love. Corny as f, but that’s how i feel lol

We talked a lot, seriously, alot.  she had issues with her self confidence, and people using her because she was too modest. We really hit it off a lot on family vallues, life vallues, sense of humor, sensitivity. She had issues with her ex who cheated on her. So i thought i like this girl a lot, but we need to take it slow, because of her issues i  never wanted to become either the rebound guy or use her insecurities or worries as a tool to worm myself into her heart. Her ex had left her a year before, but she was obviously not 100% over the shock of being cheated on. It made her feel insufficient.

2 months after we started talking i got a confirmation i had to deal with a medical issue myself, and couldn’t go to Japan yet.          I’m in Europe. She was looking forward to meet me so much she got upset, and shortly after suggested coming to visit me. 
1 month later she visited, because i wasn’t sure yet i put her up in a hotel, because  i wanted to take it slow. But we both fell in love even more, but i kept trying to play it cool, because my senses said, don’t abuse her fragility. This broken winged bird is so full of potential, if i fix her wings she might fly and never come back but i never abused that fact, i always tried to uplift her confidence and tell her she was a beautiful person who anybody would love. She only had to believe in it herself, because it’s already true.  I always downplayed myself, she always uplifted me too.

I’ve dealt with issues like depression and adhd which was undiagnosed until recently. I was always scared of not being worth a really good girl because if i love someone i want the absolute best for them, and perhaps i did not believe i was. I know now not knowing i had adhd messed up my self confidence a lot. And the depressions were a side effect of it. 

In the next months, i wanted to come to japan , but i was still on a waiting list for surgery. So i couldn’t come to Japan on two instances in 2013. She was sad about it, and thought maybe i was playing around, but i had my surgery she supported me a lot from long distance, and we were getting along very well. After my surgery in spring 2014 i went to Japan, and stayed with her for 5 weeks, it was perfect, i got an eye infection but she nursed me back to health and we had so much fun and loved eachother. 

But i realized she was still scared i’d leave her. I was in a good time in my life, i felt confident, socially very capable and outgoing, happy, and always talkative and making the mood and making friends. She wasn’t in that place yet, but she didn’t know, i am like a social chameleon and like the sad clown, always very social, joking, but there’s more to me. 

Both times we had to say goodbye she was crying the entire last 2 nights.  She was seriously distressed i left. Other times, around me though, she always smiled, and was full of infatuation to a level it made me feel embarassed… 

I’ve had women like me a lot, but i never had that with someone i really loved like i did her. Our mental and physical bond was so absurdly strong i almost started to believe in the twin flame or mirror soul thing, and i am a very sceptical person about religion or spirituality. But it also scared us both, as if that deep connection was also a source of discomfort, anxiety. I tried to calm my feelings down so much because i was so happy i almost felt guilty, as if i didn’t deserve this treasure in front of me.

The next few days she avoided going home because i wasn’t there waiting for her and she was feeling really bad. I was torn apart. I thought it would be a selfish  if i kept her from living a full life, in a huge city (Tokyo) for her, where she lived alone, far away from her family and friends. So i gently pushed her away saying i couldn’t speak to her on video because i’d miss her too much. To not show her how much i was hurting too to not be with her or to see her hurting.

I was crushed, but we kept contact, i caved and did tell i missed her, but i wanted her to live her life fully without worrying about me, because she was 23 by then, and i did not want her to sacrifice living a full social life because she wanted to skype with me. Or risk falling into depression or social isolation clinging to me. I recognized elements of her personality i used to have where she needed alot of social contact but had confidence issues. But in her presence, i always pushed her forward to believe in herself and not be too modest.

Now for the next few months we’d skype occasionally, i’d regularly tell her i miss her.        But the end of 2014, october, something i always fear happened, a depression fell over me, people who know real depression, the major or chronic type, knows it’s like a sword constantly hanging above your neck waiting to drop down on you, but you never know when or why. I couldn’t cope anymore,  i felt worthless, i had bad anxiety and fear of losing her, and i couldn’t message her out of fear of hearing she moved on, something negative. For 2-3 months i barely messaged her, and when i did in januari 2015, she scolded me for not giving her attention, and i felt like shit, because i knew she was right, in februari i tried to talk to her, and she told me it’s too late she was dating someone else. That i didn’t pay attention to her. She said she didn’t sleep with him though.            

Shortly after, she told me her grandfather was sick and passing away. To her he was like her 2nd father, he always lived with her family.  She was devestated, i was there for her through it all, we skyped constantly for many days in a row, i told her to hug your parents, hug your sibblings, i tried my best for her.  I kept myself available and told her i’d always be there. She told me she lied about the other guy, she went out with, she didn’t feel for him but she needed so much to see if i cared, and she only loved me. 

I told her i loved her and i was willing to fight for her, and that i was coming to Japan to live and work there later that year. I could tell she was genuine, but still scared of being abandoned. I was still in that depression state but i pushed my mind to the limit to be there for her and pretty much “fuck me and my needs.” After this, i knew she was tired and stressed, so i told her i’d give her space, but i loved her always, and was always there for her, she just needed to find me, whenever. 

Few weeks later, i was in a hyper tensed burned out state, fighting with my coworkers, fighting with a random guy outside, verbally, i knew i was absurdly on edge but didn’t know why. She had ignored my birthday, but because it was only a few weeks after her grandfather past, i let it slide. It was totally out of character for her though because she’s extremely attentive and considerate. 
After a few days i talked to her, said i was going to be in Japan in october, she said “it’s too late” she pushed me away, she said i hadn’t done enough for her, and it had been too long.      

I was already hyper on edge for 2 weeks and now i lost it, i told her i was fed up with these games, and summarized a list of small passive aggressive neediness actions she had done to me, and the fact that how could she treat me this coldly less than a month after i was there for her in her time of need. I said i was fed up with this. She was shocked, she deleted all our pictures and things from social media. 

I knew my response was over the top and i realized i had lost the plot with my depression and anxiety and my inner frustrations completely. I knew i had to get professional help. She was insecure, our long distance was getting to us both, especially because chatting is a tricky thing when people are emotional people read what they want to read into any message, and it’s not always positive. 

She would tell me months later she felt i hated her and dumped her pretty much at that point, i realized after the fact, these were the desperate calls from an insecure girl to get confirmation we could have a future. If i had said i’d fight for her instead of attacking her head-on, i might’ve had a fighting chance. Who knows. 

Few weeks later, she messages me, tries to find an opening, but i did not have the guts to get into a emotional talk, because i knew i was not well, i had to find out what was wrong with me first. So i kept it superficial. For 2 months between april and june all our talks were superficial, simply because i did not have the confidence yet to confirm she probably already was moving on. 

In may she said she was going to florida in september to meet a friend and stay with his parents. I kinda knew that had to be bad.  But i did not want to ask. 
Turns out he had been chasing her for 2 years while i was around but she had always kept him at distance because she loved me, deeply. I really believe it.  But after our april fight she ran straight to him,  i guess, because she truly believed i did not care for her anymore. she Booked a flight for september to florida. For a whole month i didn’t have the guts to talk to her. 

Then the end of june, 2 months after our last fight, i say “hi” just “hi” . her response “i’m getting married” , boooooom!! Man down. 
I didn’t have any real treatment for depression and anxiety thing, there’s waiting lists, i don’t do meds, so i was still not well, and that shattered me 100x worse than had i not been in depression. I knew inside, i knew it was bs, i knew she was an insecure girl in that moment trying to see again if i gave a fuck about her.

I went crazy and told her “what are you trying to do? Did you want me to fall apart and hurt hard? Because you succeeded. Then after a while she turned back on it and said she isn’t gonna get married but she’s moved on, we have no future. She said she thought i didn’t care about her, because i didn’t contact her much. and had i told her more clearly, it would’ve been different, but she’s got a bf now. And she blamed herself for not being more patient. 

I am not going to lie, i emotionally fell apart, and i did plead for days, and i explained her in detail what happened to me. and why i took the actions i took. 
Her words to me were “i loved you a lot more than him, but my feelings for him will grow” 

She contacted my sister because she worried about me, told her she still cares about me.      My sister explained to her what had happened my mental issues and why i couldn’t be emotionally available and she said “had i known, i wouldn’t have left” , she kept contact with my sister till she was sure i was okay, i learned that months later.  but told her that she didn’t think she could turn back now because she had a new bf. 

Of course i realized if she goes to florida i have almost no choice but to throw everything on the table before she leaves and write her a long heartfelt letter. 
It was a giant dilema, leave her alone to go to ""paradise Florida"" and risk it, or ""go for your last chance"". 

 I sent her a present and letter for her bday right before she left to florida. She thanked me, told me to please take care of myself. She was nervous, i could tell she didn’t want me to put doubt in her heart about her decision. after that she blocked me on every social media and messaging service a few days before she left. 

I was in a personal hell for a few months. I had the depression, the anxiety, i lost the girl i truly believed was the perfect fit for me, because of mental issues. I walked around the city at night, crying. 

If i could've been in jp sooner, it would never have happened, if i could’ve explained to her what was happening to me, it would’ve never happened. She was too compassionate to let that be a reason. 

I had the therapy, i found out i burned out and had a long lasting major depression. And finally after almost 34 years i found out i had adhd and it worsened every other mental problem like some sort of catalyst, mostly because i just couldn’t find rest inside and my mind was like a tornado of anything inside it, so if it was negative, it would be a tornado of negativity.

I left to Japan again in november for an internship. But i did not seek her out, obviously, since i don’t want her to be uncomfortable. But also not hurt myself.

Between september and januari i no-contacted her for about 3 months. Nothing, no mails, no texts, no nothing. This was after on her instagram i saw pictures of him and her, though it looked very awkward, hugging, not comfortable at all. In Florida… Well, i can’t beat florida :( Since then it seems everywhere i have to hear how awesome florida is lol

I too lost my grandfather in december 2015, like hers, also to cancer in early 2015. 
I felt like reaching out to her, so i mailed her, i used it as an opportunity to also explain what i learned about my own mental issues. And well, i pretended to be ok. And i told her had i not fallen into depression i would’ve never let her slip away from me, and i felt i was dealt a bad hand and lost someone very special because of it. Stressing i didn’t blame her at all, because i felt she had no way of knowing. She responded briefly, she felt sorry for my loss, she didn’t realize i was in Japan, please take care. and ended it with “goodbye” . She did reply one more time after when she realized i was in the same city as her, but after that quiet.

The guy she is or was dating he’s not listed as being in a relationship on his facebook so i don’t know what’s up. I am pretty sure they do not live together though.  I am pulling my hair out trying to give up. Give her her space, or ask her to meet up, or give it a few more months. 

I feel i am not ready to fully give up yet, why? Cause because it felt we had the same emotional wavelengths, same vallues, and knew how to uplift eachother, but circumstances killed it.              I know she had loved me very deeply, and i find it hard to believe that completely died.  The fact even she admitted she wasn’t really in love with the other guy, but she moved on because she thought i didn’t care about her anymore, simply because i couldn’t communicate properly in my depression. 

We will live in the same city. But i can’t make a move. I could call her, but it might be too soon. I don’t know what to do. Move on is easy advise, but i feel if i will always wonder about this.  Should i completely give up, or give her space and see in a few more months, but by that time it’ll have been a looong time since we saw eachother. 

I am at complete loss.I’m going back to Europe soon for a few months to wait for my new visa. So i’d not have a chance for until june perhaps. It'll have been a year. since she 100% broke with me, and even longer since i last saw her.

I just… cannot cope with the fact, depression, the thing i did everything to avoid by living healthy, exercising, socializing, staying busy, still got the best of me, and perhaps killed the first girl out of so many i dated that really made me feel she was made for me. That gave me a sense of peace.   I know i didn’t ask for this, and i know i did my best to not succumb to depression, but i still blame the hell out of myself… And i can’t let go…

As soon as it gets done uploading and formatted this weekend it will be posted"
436q0j,20,2016-01-28,I can't take it anymore.,LordMitchimus,Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/436q0j/i_cant_take_it_anymore/,"I'm doing this on mobile, so forgive me if the formatting is atrocious. I'm an eighteen-year-old, first year college student in Northern Indiana. I've been heavily involved with the church my whole life, and especially in the past couple years. This year I took an internship where I lead worship in my church's high school ministry. I loved it for a little bit. I took the position because last year the guy who was in charge made me feel like crap. Let's call him IS. I wanted everyone to feel involved and feel heard and happy, so I accepted the role of leadership. 
That being said, about a year ago, our lead worship pastor who leads the main congregation in worship left. He was a great guy, but when he left, nobody replaced him until a month ago. The guy who just took his position is bothering me. Let's call him N. 

We just finished practice, and N made me feel an anger I haven't felt since IS led. He simply didn't listen to me, but the thing is that it's ONLY ME. It's like all other leaders have it in for me. Furthermore, he says that he is going to start co-leading at the high school ministry with me. I'm not particularly fond of this idea. I don't like his style of leading and it is absolutely not right for high schoolers. I know. I was one last year. But wait, this is only problem one.

So I lead the high school ministry, and my girlfriend leads the middle school ministry. Now I know it sounds stupid, an 18 year old couple can't possibly know what love is. But we have a lot of healthy relationship mentors who help us out because our relationship is fantastic. The problem here is that when I complain about N, or even IS, she just didn't understand. N and IS both favor her well over me (IS has an outstanding crush on her which could have been his beef with me). She just doesn't get it, and it makes me feel so belittled. Like the one person I should be able to confide in just doesn't care. And to be clear, I do directly open up to her. But she just doesn't offer any advice or care, because she doesn't feel it herself. Call it her one character flaw. So my church is making me feel unimportant, and my girlfriend is making me feel like I'm overreacting. But that's just problem two...
About three years ago I was first diagnosed with cancer. Hodgkin's Lymphoma to be exact. In pediatric patients, there's a 95% chance that it will never come back. Which was reassuring until eleven months into remission when I was rediagnosed. I was already going to therapy and was on anti-anxiety and antidepressant pills. After a horrible, nasty breakup with my ex-girlfriend whom I was with for three years, I attempted suicide. I took a full bottle of pills, but all they did was knock me out. My parent never learned, and I've told maybe three or four people in all. That was the first semester of my senior year of high school. The only reason I share is to clarify my pre-existing mental health issues. 

So back to right now. I'm done with God. I felt he's turned His back on me and I haven't felt Him for years. I have panic attacks almost twice daily, and in those attacks, I hurt myself by punching walls, etc... But I also curse God in all of them. I could never deny God, as I know I've felt Him before. But right now, when I should feel closest, I feel nothing. He isn't there. 

I guess if I had to formulate a question, I'd say what should I do? About my position at my church, my relationship with my girlfriend, and my relationship with God? I want to know God. I want to feel Him. But he just isn't giving me anything. I just need ideas. Because right now, my only ideas or suicide or running away. And I've already proven that I suck at the former.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your support. I talked to my girlfriend last night about how I was feeling and she was incredibly understanding. I knew that breaking things off with her was not the right way to go. Also, sometime next week I'm going to talk to N and bring up how I feel. I'm not comfortable talking with him, but I know I have to. Since he first showed up, it's felt like he's been pushing me out. So I know talking to him will only frustrate me more, but I realize that I have to do that. Also, I'm going to talk to my parents (I live with them currently, going to school locally) about getting put back into therapy. The guy I was seeing was really good and really helpful, and always used God in the realest and most practical way. Thank you everyone for reading my vent and offering wisdom. 

God bless."

I was wondering is anyone here has been in this major or have taken any of the classes in the concentration. Like how are the classes, what are your experiences with the professors, what kind of internship positions are available to the majors.

Thanks in advance!"
436tgd,1,2016-01-28,shits been sucking lately.,ImTheNumber1Guy,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/436tgd/shits_been_sucking_lately/,"So the past sixish months have been a roller coaster of shit for me. I would say it started at the end of summer when I quit smoking weed. I was a mega stoner and had stopped because I was about to start an internship as a plant operator (possible hair test). I had to clean my system out and have clean hair so I stopped smoking for my last semester before my internship. It wasn't hard but it sucked bad because all my friends were still smoking. School started and between work and school I didn't have time to work out anymore, which has been a bummer because i was super into bodybuilding for a good while. Late October my grandpa on my dads side (his step dad) died. He was fairly old and on Hospice for awhile so I had been ready for it for awhile. In November I decided that i needed to change my depression and adhd meds because of the weight i was losing from not lifting. Bad idea. I had a HUGE depression spell and almost lost my job. Got back on my meds and was good about three weeks later. December comes around and things are looking up. I got a call from a plant for a high paying internship that i would start in January. I was going to be making thrice as much as i was making at my current job, and just as an intern! Awesome. So then i go on a trip to visit my moms parents out of state, my dad gets to go with us which hasn't happened in like four years so i'm super excited. The first day there i get a call that my cousin had been hit by a car going 50 and is in icu. were pretty close so i was really upset. Luckily she made it out with nothing broken somehow and is now doing good. I come back home ad start my internship, super happy and i'm loving it. get an email from an admin at school saying i need to take a humanities to finish this semester. Until now i thought I was done except for the internship. Angry, I sign up for history class online. Upsetting but not impossible. Then i get a call from my mom. My grandfather who we just visited not three weeks prior had shot himself. I was devastated, of course. Flew back there to attend the funeral and such. Back home with only one flight delay and an unexpected night in Dallas.  On to today! I am about to get off of work and my new boss calls me in her office. I have a bad feeling. She says I have all the intern hours necessary for school but they have to let me go because i'm not a ""good fit"" for the company. I hadn't even made a month. So now i'm sitting here eating pizza and neglecting homework to write this. 

TL;DR  My grandpa shot himself and then i got fired"

I used to be so driven and set lofty goals but lately I just feel so jaded and disillusioned with everything. 

Took the first job offer that paid the most right out of uni (banking / consulting etc, don't wish to be too specific). Had a terrible 5-6 months there of late nights and the excessive stress caused me to turn to anti-depressants.

I cracked and resigned, telling myself I will take up an ""in-between stress-free"" job somewhere and continue finding something I like. I'm currently working on my ""in-between"" job and applying furiously to every opening I can see.

In truth, I just have absolutely no idea what I want to do in life. I tailored my entire academic curriculum and internships to pursue the coveted consulting / banking path and everything went out of the windows in &lt;6 months. I felt the ""lost in life"" moment on one 2 am night when I was working on a powerpoint deck and looked to my left and saw my 40 year old boss beside me doing the same. For the life of me, I couldn't picture myself doing the same til 60.

My new job is relatively stress-free and I leave office around 6.15pm although I had to take a near 50% pay cut. It's not what I want to do for the long term and staying is out of the question. But my life is a complete rut now:

Go to work, go home, watch some tv shows and movies, hang out with friends on weekend. I'm single, have no girlfriend and literally spend the day waiting for time to pass. I no longer have any motivation in life and I can't find a single thing that inspires me. 

The thought of the rat-race makes me nauseous and interacting with my friends (who are fantastic people) reminds me how everyone seemingly has it all together and I'm simply wasting my life away in a pit of emotionless, mindless emptiness.

I don't know what I really expect out of typing this entire wall of text, but...it does feels better. I hope this gets me through the rest of Friday"

4375rx,10,2016-01-28,My boyfriend (21M) is high-flying and I'm worried I (21F) will slow him down in the future.,futureworries,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4375rx/my_boyfriend_21m_is_highflying_and_im_worried_i/,"My boyfriend and I have been together about 2.5 years, since freshman orientation.  We're in our junior year in college.  He's a computer science major and I'm a liberal arts/pre-med major, and we go to a very good school.  Just a bit of background.

My boyfriend is very very good at what he does.  He's great at coding and everything, and always leads projects and gets rave reviews from his professors.  He has a great job, does research, perfect gpa, everything.  He went to a career fair today and some of the recruiters were urging him to apply for the really big tech companies for internships and stuff.  Obviously those are huge opportunities that he's really going to capitalize on.

Meanwhile you have me.  I'm reasonably good at school, but my gpa isn't quite good enough for med school.  I have an upward trend and have been studying for the MCAT, so I should get in somewhere (likely a DO school), but I won't get to be very choosy about it.  My boyfriend knows this.  We're very much a serious couple, and we want to get engaged after graduation.  Granted, it would be a long engagement, but my plan was to get engaged, live with him for a while, and get married sometime after med school is over.

But this doesn't really take into account my boyfriend's career.  I always assumed he'd be able to move wherever I end up because there are programming jobs everywhere, but I never realized that he was THIS good and could end up in Silicon Valley or Seattle or something, while I'm in Bumfuck Kansas.  I think we could do long distance, but it would be a long time and the prospects are dismal.

I just feel like second fiddle compared to him.  Like I'd just be his little wife with her little job when he's out raking in the big money (I want to go into a relatively low-paid medical field).  And I also worry that if he did move to be with me, he'd resent me for holding him back.

I've tried to talk to him about this but he says it's not a conversation we need to have until we start filling out applications for med school and full-time jobs respectively.  This would start about six-eight months from now, but this still worries me.

Should I let it go for now?  Am I wrong to feel the way I do?  Any advice?

   
**tl;dr**: My boyfriend is a superstar programmer and I'm afraid I'm going to be left in the dust."

I'm starting an IT program at a new school, but in order to be accepted they required I be A+ certified. 12 days ago I found out I needed to have the exams done by today. I work 40 hours a week as an intern in an IT department, my daily routine primarily involves hardware setup and the occasional Outlook repair - nothing too drastic. Other than those simple things I had almost no prior knowledge that would aid me on the exam. So I studied like a mad man for 12 days.
I have always had a horrible, horrible work ethic when it comes to my education. I hope somebody else like me reads this and sees anything can get done when you work your ass off."
437o5m,1,2016-01-29,"My girlfriend (20F) of 1.5 years gets bored when she's hanging out with me (20M). Also, I'm basically pathetic and need help being less so.",throwaway1292016,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/437o5m/my_girlfriend_20f_of_15_years_gets_bored_when/,"There are two issues in our relationship.

1. She sometimes gets bored when we hang out. We used to generally just watch netflix together, but whenever we aren't (which we haven't been doing as much lately) we often end up just chilling in bed not really doing anything. I don't know what to do because my leisure activities are things I just do alone (browse the internet, etc) and those aren't really great couple activities. What are some things we can do to stave this off?

2. The second thing is way more serious. I've been diagnosed with depression for about 3 or 4 years now, and it's taking a serious toll on me. I stupidly stopped taking my medication for three or so months (don't bother asking why) and I predictably just got worse and worse. She's usually okay with dealing with it in regular amounts but I ended up being just an anxious nervous wreck. I'm taking the medication again but I don't know if it'll help me. Even worse, I have no drive. I know this is because of the depression mostly but I feel no compulsion to get a job, work hard in school, get an internship, anything. I know that I need to do these things and it stresses me out so much knowing that I haven't done any of them and can't find it in me to even start. It's putting a strain on us and I'm making this thread because of an argument we had that ended in her basically saying she's sick of trying so hard to get me to try, and then going to bed. I'm worried that I'm going to lose her eventually because of this. How can I force myself to do things that cripple me with social anxiety to just think about? Please, give me some advice here. Currently I've failed at least one class two semesters in a row and promised her I'd go to academic advising tomorrow to try to figure out what I'm going to do, as well as go somewhere on campus to ask for help with my resume (which is basically empty because of no work experience, and I'm incredibly embarrassed to show anyone it). 

I would really prefer if the classic ""just break up"" advice is left out of this post. I think our relationship is really great and wouldn't trade it for anything, but I'm afraid that my neuroses are going to ruin it. 


tl;dr: Help me think of fun things for poor college students in an apartment to do. Also help me get out of this pit I've dug myself into and stop me from ruining the best relationship I've ever been in."
438tvg,276,2016-01-29,"I [22F] am growing tired of always having to be the bigger person with my best friend, [23F]",twoplustw0equalsfive,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/438tvg/i_22f_am_growing_tired_of_always_having_to_be_the/,"My friend, we'll call her Alma, isswa 23 and still lives with her parents and has an internship at her uncle's law firm as a receptionist. She lives with her parents, doesn't pay any rent, doesn't pay for groceries, etc. 

I live on my own and work full time. I pay all my bills, my student loans, my rent and for my own food and entertainment. My parents will help me if I'm really in a bind, but other than that I'm financially independent and deal with all the stresses of that.

In the past 6 months I have gone through every life change imaginable. I graduated school, entered the workforce, got broken up with from a 7 year relationship, got a puppy, etc etc etc. I have an anxiety disorder and a history with depression that I try not to talk about too much with Alma about because I'm kind of a private person, but both problems have really been flaring up in the past 6 months as they characteristically do when I'm going through change.

I live in a big city, Alma lives in a small town. She loves when we come to visit, although it's extremely inconvenient for me. I love coming to visit, but for a number of reasons I can't. I get really bad travelers anxiety. By the time my week is over all I want to do is relax so jumping on a bus isn't exactly something I want to do. I also do my grocery shopping/other errands over the weekend.

When I do visit Alma, I find it extremely uncomfortable to be around her mom. Last time I went they had two loud arguments about the fact that I was there right in front of me and it was incredibly awkward. That kind of thing is why I moved out of my parents house in the first place and I just don't like being in that situation.

On top of this, it makes more sense in my eyes for her to come here. We have our own apartment, comfy couches to sleep on, and she only works 4 days a week so she's not losing all of her free time for the week.

So usually she comes here. She sometimes gets a bit snarky about it but we always end up having a good time. Her birthday was coming up and she wanted me and my roommate to come visit. We have a new puppy, so only one of us could go. I tried my absolute best to find other arrangements for the puppy but I couldn't. She knows I tried multiple different plans and they all fell through. Alma knew about all this.

Finally I told her I'd probably not be coming but my roommate could. She went off on me and basically told me all the reasons why I'm a bad friend. Because I don't come to visit her often enough, because she comes here so much more often, etc. Everytime I would defend myself and tell her my reasons she would tell me I'm being defensive or attacking her. So there was nothing I could say in the whole ""discussion"" except for ""I'm Sorry"" and ""you're right"" without being accused of being defense or attacking her. She attacked my character throughout the conversation, calling me a bad friend, condescending, accusing me of not caring about her feelings, etc. I'm extremely hurt by the whole way that it ended. It ended with me apologizing for not visiting often.

We stopped talking after that and I haven't heard from her since. I'm obviously not happy with how it ended and feel extremely hurt and like she doesn't feel any responsibility to make it right with me. Her birthday is coming up so I'm obviously going to have to reach out first but honestly, the way she's handled this has turned me off to her and made me lose a good amount of respect for her. But this will never, ever get resolved unless I reach out because I know she wont.

My roommate who is also in our friend group is caught in the middle of this. Things will be extremely awkward for her if we don't make up. I don't even know how to proceed and I'm just really frustrated and angry at this point with no desire to talk to her again.

TL;DR Friend refuses to ever open up a dialogue if we're having an argument. I'm hurt and frustrated by how she treated me and don't feel like I should be the one to reach out this time, but I know if I don't the friendship is likely over."
438yv9,30,2016-01-29,Feb-Jan line jumper! Finally finished my long birth story.,howverycleverofyou,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/438yv9/febjan_line_jumper_finally_finished_my_long_birth/,"This may or may not be a little traumatic for some to read... Keep in mind some of what I dealt with is not necessarily common (resistance to pain meds etc).

First, picture! If you feel so inclined to stay for my no doubt verbose story (most of you know how I get), great! Otherwise, [here](http://imgur.com/a/MRxY6) is our family's Player Three and I wish you all the luck in the world with your little ones!

Special thanks to my trooper of a husband, my amazing in laws, my mother for stressing me out from afar enough to bring on my stronger contractions, my due date buddy and my friends who kept me fully entertained during my alone hours, my fabulous care team and of course all you Bumpers with your cheering on and positive energy :)

So my MIL and husband threw me a shower on Sunday the 17th; it was supposed to be a surprise but I ended up finding out by accident. It was still lovely and so many of our family and friends came. I had the world's tiniest mimosa and it was tasty as hell. My MIL mentioned it looked like baby had dropped and I had felt that too but wasn't sure if he was just headbutting me or not. Everyone kept saying I still had time and would probably be late because this is my first. My SIL laughed and said ""yeah right, all 3 of my (our last name) boys were early, so were their dads, you could go anytime!"" I'd been suspecting baby would be a little early, maybe a week.

Got home and unpacked some stuff but still freaked a little about so many boxes of crap lying around (ah the joys of a new house in your third trimester).

I wake up at 5am on Monday (36+4) to a gush of fluid. Hobble to the bathroom while my undies soak. Sit down and lose a waterfall. I wind up peeing at the same time, so I'm 10000% sure what came before wasn't pee. And I'm at least 2% sure I don't pee from my vajay.

Call the midwife answering service. Wake up Hubby, let him know we may need to go. Midwife calls back and tries to tell me it was probably urine, but don't send my husband to work blah blah, I try to tell her I know this isn't pee, etc (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/41ihq0/364_woken_up_by_water_breaking/) ).

We get to the hospital in record time for snowy conditions, go in through Emergency, tell the guy at reception I'm going to maternity, and he says ""oh so you're pregnant?"" I immediately love this dude after all the ""zomg you're so big"" comments in the last 5 or so months. They wheel me upstairs where it's confirmed by my gross panty-washcloth (fml) that my water in fact did break (advice: stock up on comfortable pads and stretchy boy short undies early in your 3rd trimester!). I'm admitted and moved to the room where I'll be having my baby within the next couple days!

Hubby falls asleep almost immediately. Midwife and I discuss waiting for a while and what the augmentation options are after (my favorite midwife is on, which is awesome. She's very no BS and I love that). I'm put on a non-penicillin IV for a half hour every 3 hours because I was supposed to have my GBS tomorrow at my doc appointment. Ultrasound confirms baby is still head down and facing my back, and ""doesn't seem fazed at all by all this activity"".  I eat, Hubby goes out for coffees, diaper bag, and some other provisions.

Oh and btw, still friggin leaking. Would love to change into my own clothes and walk around but the flood won't stop. Slow trickle just to remind me where I am and what's happening in case I forgot. Starting to get crampier. Now five hours post-The Rupture.

Hubby goes to work for a few hours and plans to go home for a bit after to tidy up some as our house is still full of boxes and half built furniture. No rush dude, we aren't likely to meet baby tonight, but my midwife and the intern have now said it's probably best at this point to definitely start cervix-softening drugs around 5pm. Could still be many many hours til babytime of course.

10 hours in. Contractions getting more intense but still not much of a pattern. Still goddamn leaking. More monitoring followed by a HOT shower which felt so amazing (advice: bring flip flops for this, your feet will thank you). Think too much; thank goodness I groomed my lady bits recently, I'm super anxious about birth, I can't believe I didn't type and print my birth plan at like 27 weeks, etc. Stood with the shower head on my back and belly and rocked around through a couple contractions. DEFINITELY will be doing this again later. Nausea kicks in-- not sure if anxiety induced or labor or hunger or antibiotics related (all of the above). Drink huge thing of water while enjoying my last times to use my son as a table. Order a veggie burger from the kitchen. It isn't a veggie burger but I was so focused on forcing myself to eat that I didn't notice until I'd eaten half :( Hear lady next door have her baby, squee at little tiny cries.

Hubby comes back, by now contractions are still not having any pattern but they are INTENSE. I'm in tears and I'm so tired all I want to do is sleep but I can't, so I'm crying out of frustration and feeling like I'm going to hurl everywhere. Cave and ask for pain meds, which they give me in my IV and a shot in the thigh. Sleep for five or so minutes at a time for a half hour. Contractions waking me, killing me, I'm so out of it from the meds but my body hurts so badly I can't sleep. Sitting still is Chinese water torture. They check me and I'm at a 3, still fucking leaking, and chewing through my lip to get through contractions. Anesthesiologist comes to give me an epidural. It is GLORIOUS. 11/10 recommend. He left me with this magical button that has no limits on it as long as I wait long enough between presses. I can feel and move my legs but they are nuuuuuuuumb. Sleep from 3am to 5:30 before they come to do a quick straight cath. Nurse mentions they might want to start me on pitocin around 9 or so. Sleep some more. Nothing but ice chips now which sucks because I am hungry and craving a gourmet iced coffee.

Hour 30, and on pitocin level 2, start to feel some more big contractions kicking in and I'm so not ready to be that awake, so I press the magic button. My nurse tells me they are reconfiguring their monitoring system and she will have to sit in our room and watch it herself while they do that, and ""thank goodness you're the only one in labor!"" Hooray! /s 

Hour 32-ish. They cath me again, and moments later I am in absolute agony despite my epidural. The most pain I've ever been in. I'm sweating and dizzy. My nurse says emptying my bladder of 450cc's probably gave baby tons of room to drop, and boy is that what it feels like: like someone dropped a boulder on my cervix from a tenth story window. At this point I am sobbing and rolling around violently trying to get comfortable, they check me and I'm at 5 cm with baby at position 0, and they call the anesthesiologist back. He comes in and gives me a dose of pain meds into my epidural site. No help at all, in fact, the pain is worsening as he's sitting there asking me questions. They end up giving me a second epidural.

I'm able to sleep a little bit, but shortly after that they cath me again and I'm screaming. I can feel everything. I'm at a 9, baby is at +1, and I feel like I have to make the world's biggest poo. I do my antibiotics dose and after that decide it's pushing time-- midwife (not the one I was excited about, but a young woman I've never met, who looks like she should be on Grey's Anatomy or something-- also very sweet and confident) confirms I'm fully dilated and we are off to the races.

Man. Literally the most intense experience of my life. I remember them flip flopping me around trying to find comfortable and effective pushing positions for me, my husband feeding me ice chips and rubbing ice cold cloths on my face and neck, my midwife cheering me on and the nurse being my drill sergeant, almost barking at me when I'd start to give up and say I can't do this, I can't, I feel so sick, I can't believe I ever thought I was capable of having a baby, etc. I remember my husband telling me I'm amazing and telling him no, I'm not, because I can't do this, nothing is working, he isn't coming out no matter how hard I try. I remember in the back of my mind being so embarrassed and so exposed, having not wanted my husband to see everything (I'm insanely private about bodily things despite years in the medical field). Baby decided last minute to crook his neck just enough to make pushing him out absolutely miserable. My midwife at one point about three and a half hours in left the room and came back with all kinds of people, setting up sterilization stations and whatnot, the OB on duty came and looked at me, I remember them exchanging glances, and I wondered when they moved me to another room (they hadn't). Looking back I think I was actually tripping my ass off with all the firings in my brain and the lack of oxygen from all the pushing; it felt exactly like the times way back in the day I experimented with hallucinogenics. Suddenly I had to push, HARD, the most intense life or death need to push. Everything they say about ""you'll know when you have to push"" is true. You can't not know. I remember thinking this had to be the one, I don't have it in me anymore if he doesn't come out this time. A few minutes later my midwife, nurse, and husband were yelling at me to stick with it, don't stop pushing, give it everything I have, and there was this almost popping sensation followed by a warm flood of fluid, and the most euphoric relief of pressure, like a Mack truck was lifted off my pelvis. I looked down and my little boy was being handed to me, all slimy with lots of black hair and chubby cheeks. It took a few minutes to get him crying and I couldn't stop telling him how handsome he is. I looked up and my husband was crying. He cut the cord. We got the guided tour of the placenta and how it worked to sustain our son. It was pretty cool, if you're at all scientifically or medically minded I highly recommend letting them take a few minutes to show it to you. Our boy opened his eyes a few minutes later.

I got over two hours of uninterrupted skin to skin and a chance to try and breastfeed. My nurse helped me to the bathroom to clean up while she changed my mattress and bedding. She confided that at the point my midwife went to get the OB, they were about to get me prepped for a C section (she hadn't said anything to us for fear of me giving up), but that once they all got in there I somehow ""Hulked it up"" and got that baby out.

The next few days were pretty miserable, actually. Because he was technically preterm, Baby had to have his blood sugar checked every two hours or each time he ate, he was very lethargic and not into breastfeeding so we had to syringe feed him formula and expressed milk, and after one whole day of nothing but nice long cuddles with mommy and daddy, we found out he had elevated bilirubins and had to be put in a UV bed for 18 hours. Extra nights in hospital and watching our son the snugglebutt who loves to be swaddled squirm and cry in a UV bed in just his diaper and a protective eye shade, knowing all he wanted was to be held... It was torture. We spent our first several days at home still trying to resolve all that, and he wasn't breastfeeding well so I had to pump and supplement with formula, and my boobs were so so sore... I was running around to all kinds of appointments and not really able to sleep or relax.

He's 9 days old and much better now, got a clean bill of health the other day. No more pricking his poor little feet and is only getting breastmilk now, albeit still not getting the hang of breastfeeding, so to the lactation consultant we go. My body feels relatively normal; my feet and ankles aren't swollen, my boobs aren't so sore anymore, I'm down 23 pounds from my weight at admission, the only thing is my 3 perineal stitches are a little annoying sometimes if I'm up and about and doing too much (personality flaw). Sometimes it still doesn't feel real, like maybe I went to the hospital for something else and stole a baby on my way out. But he is the most beautiful and amazing tiny thing and we are so so in love with him.

TL;DR: 5am water break, 38.5 hours total labor, 3 doses cervix softener, 3 rounds pitocin, 1 failed dose IV pain meds, 2 epidurals that only partially worked, 4 hours 10 minutes pushing, 3 stitches, one 6 pound 11 ounce, 20 inch bundle of perfection and amazement."
439nlm,1,2016-01-29,Company owes season tips and wants me to return clothing that is now considered part of a uniform,GeneParmesaen,LegalAdviceUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/439nlm/company_owes_season_tips_and_wants_me_to_return/,"Bear with me. The story has a lot of components. 

A couple months ago, I did an internship at an American-owned private golf club in Scotland through my university. I had already graduated with my degree; it wasn't required of me and I did it for the experience. This was the first time the university had sent interns to this location (only 2)

Facts pertaining to:

I was supposed to stay 6 months. For certain reasons, I left after 5. This was a rotational internship in various departments, such as food &amp; beverage, member services, etc.

I didn't have very many office clothes for when I was working shifts that didn't require a restaurant uniform. I thought that it would be easy to buy clothes when I got over there since it wouldn't have fit in my luggage anyways. Turns out, its not that easy to buy clothes in East Lothian, especially without a car and not much time off of work. This is important to note, as I was given a bag of clothes from the girl who trained me on reception and then left the company shortly after.

I was given a contract to sign and hand back in the beginning for a restaurant uniform. (Side note: Never ended up receiving some items on that contract so I never actually gave it to them signed for fear that I would get charged in the end. I told them very politely that I would not be signing it because so many items were missing from the list.)

It's also important to note that I never received the clothes directly from her; our schedules didn't meet up so I picked it up from the front desk indirectly. This means there was never any conversation in regards to returning the items, etc. She did tell me, previously, however, that she was moving to London and had a bunch if clothes she could give me. I was gracious and accepted, even if most of it didn't fit properly. The bag of clothes was comprised of random office clothes such as suit jackets that barely fit and a few logo'd shirts from the company pro shop. As well as, a pink Galvin Green jacket with the company logo. Herein lies the big commotion. 

I ended up wearing this jacket a lot due to weather and long commutes walking to work. The jacket already had some noticeable wear as it had been worn by the previous owner for at least two seasons. The other receptionist has the same jacket. She mentioned to me one day about how they picked it out together (and from what I can remember) bought them together a few seasons ago. So the entire internship, I'm thinking, cool, I have this awesome new jacket. Not, 'I'm renting out this jacket and have to return it back to the golf shop at the end of my internship.'

So fast forward to the present. I have received a few emails from the pro shop inquiring about the jacket. I replied initially before Christmas saying that I had no idea it was part of the uniform and had I known I would have left it with my roommate, the other intern. I also nonchalantly asked if he (the pro shop manager) knew any word of when we would be receiving season tips in the same email. Of course, he said he did not know and to contact someone else about it (never mentioned who, just said he wasn't the right person to ask). He's right, however, I wanted to plant the seed of my reluctance to send the jacket back without getting wages owed to me. 

(This same manager last season prevented the company from knowingly not paying season tips to a loyal coworker just because he was going to school in the states because the company thinks that they will either forget, not care, etc. apparently. This coworker ended up dropping out of school and returned to Scotland to continue working at the club. So the company is already notorious for not paying wages) 

A key reason that I left the internship early, other than being treated like cheap seasonal labor, was finances. I planned out my income budget in the UK thinking I was going to be making tips from restaurant shifts. Of course I was sadly mistaken. And I had to put all cash tips I received into a pot, that I feared I would never see again And turns out I was right! 

The way the company handles tips: every time someone gives an employee a cash tip they must hand it in to their department. At the end of the year, the club members are asked if they want to add tips to the pot. The money is divided as the owner/general manager sees fit to each department. For example, the golf employees make a lot of cash tips, pocket probably half of those tips, and end up receiving the largest payout during the holidays. In my circumstances, I put most of my tips in the food and beverage department pot, so I would have received it from that department. I did, however, put tips in from the housekeeping department as well. 

one of my previous coworkers from the club said she would message me on Facebook to let me know when she got her season tips so we could compare if I had got mine also. Of course, its well after January and no word from her. I received my W2 in the mail from the company a few days ago. Spoke to my old roommate/fellow intern on Facebook yesterday and he said he had not received season tips, holiday pay, and had to email several times just to get paycheck stubs. I had already been involved in a flurry of emails and phone calls with them during the internship to get those paycheck stubs and I never ended up receiving all of them and they were very shady paycheck stubs (dates were messed up, etc) 

So from what you can assume, the company is shady. All of the finances will get sent back to their Florida office at bank of america and then get resent back to the UK to pay the employees. The two interns from the US get paid directly through bank of america and those wages never circulate back to the UK. This must be illegal in itself somehow. Also, the company used to employ many us citizens on visas to work during the peak season but later got in trouble and are now only allowed two 'interns'. Which they now mask as being a 'rotational management internship'. Far from it. 

Those are the major facts. I really don't want the jacket necessarily, but I'm more concerned with getting my wages that are owed to me. I have an acquaintance from the club who is visiting in Florida that wouldn't mind taking the jacket back with him. I also recently met a colleague, a doctor from England, who is more than happy to mail the jacket for me and has also recommended that I contact the Citizens Advice Bureau. 

TL; DR: Company notorious for not paying season tips. Didn't pay mine or the other intern's. Now they are constantly emailing me to send a jacket back that I was never told was part of a uniform. ~$500 in unpaid tips, used jacket now becoming collateral, probably worth around $100. Starting to think I need to lawyer up before I take any further action!"

When the flickering static became too much to bear, Norman closed his eyes and listened. A moth flapped on the whirring stove light, branches tapped on the window, his mother sniffed from her cold, and Neil Armstrong’s tinny voice changed the course of history.

After NASA announced the last mission of the space shuttle program, Norman knew he had to go. He had always told himself he would go to one of these launches, and it was now or never. In a small way, he blamed himself for The Challenger, as if his eyes on that Florida sky would have made all the difference.

During that year he had used his credit card more often than he liked, but it helped him accumulate 5,000 extra air miles. He bought a used camera online, and new clothes for the presumably sticky Florida weather.

On a Thursday, right in the middle of a CSI episode, his son called him. He was excited because he was offered an internship in the UK, and could he have dad's air miles? It was an expensive ticket.

Of course, Norman said, delighted. It wasn't every day an opportunity like this came along. Norman put his pre-bought ticket into the photo album, and on July 8th he turned on the TV, closed his eyes, and listened. His coke fizzled against the glass, the refrigerator hummed, and the recorded roar of the Atlantis launched without him.

I'm looking primarily for case management in a hospital setting, but I've been looking anywhere medically related. I haven't gotten my License yet as I want to wait until I actually have income coming in before spending for that.

I have 2 years of internship experience, 1 of the years was doing house visits for juveniles and the other year was doing mental health therapy.

I've been looking for 2 months, sent out well over 200 applications and have yet to get a SINGLE call back for an interview. All I'm getting are automated rejections. I have no idea what's wrong, and I'm feeling so overwhelmed and defeated.

ETA: I'm also looking at volunteer opportunities at local hospitals too while I'm applying, to hopefully network and get more experience."

I feel like a weight has indeed been lifted off my shoulders. It would be disingenuous to say I wasn't very fortunate in my career and the support of my family. I'm very thankful for my relatively good health. But maybe someone here will see this journey and learn something from it.

Pertinent information:

 * I definitely did not think about where the loan money was coming from, and so **during college, I spent all of my loans with abandon**.
 * The debt I started with included 1 year of parent plus loans (which I took on because that parent was underemployed and I felt responsible for the debt) plus all of my own personal Stafford loans. **In the end, I put $45,000 into debt payoff against 6.8-7.5% interest.** It's worth mentioning that my mother assumed the other 3 years of parent loans.
 * I took on one part-time unpaid internship in Summer 2010, Because it was for credit, **the job ended up costing $2,500** in tuition, which I paid out of pocket because my loans only covered the fall-spring school year. However, without this internship I would have been less qualified to get my...
 *  ...**full time paid summer internship** of 2011. This was probably the most lucky, and important point in my career. Getting any career-relevant job out of the gate is not guaranteed.
 * **Living at home for the first 6 months of my adult** life allowed me to get into good savings/debt payment habits. Having very low expenses is a huge privilege. It allowed me to take a big dent out from the get-go, reducing future interest.
 * **Through networking** at my internship, I was able to transition into a permanent position really, really quickly. I was able to meet folks from another company who were growing, but had not yet published online applications.
 * When I moved out, **I was able to share an apartment search** with my boyfriend, and we were both able to find something affordable relatively quickly. Rent started at $995/person, today it's $1,100/person.
 * **I have never owned a car**, and rely on public transit. Where I have to run errands in the evening or do trips on weekends, my BF and I will go together in his car. It is a 1995 Nissan Pathfinder that he inherited when his parents wanted an upgrade. It is on the verge of falling apart, but with some replacement parts it's still kickin'.
 * During **my first permanent job at $47k/year**, I received very small raises (under 5%). My responsibilities and skills had grown as I figured out how the real industry works, but management was in no hurry to help me advance. Although it was very degree-relevant, later on I ended up getting stuck on a project doing work that was rote, and did not make use of any technical knowledge whatsoever. I left that company out of boredom and frustration, where **my final salary was $55k after 3 years**.
 * **I used negotiating tactics while interviewing** for my second job. The hiring managers had no concrete way of discussing my role because I would be serving many functions for different offices. However, as a contractor, I would be billing my time towards projects. Because I did not know their billing rates or the exact role of the position, I asked them to visualize putting me into their projects and what level my billing rate ought to be. Therefore, I was able to get them to name a base salary first: $75k. Wow, a 36% raise right off the bat. But I didn't stop there. I looked at Glassdoor and other sources for info, and **was able to negotiate up to $78k** (not huge increase, but my source numbers were solid and it is already pricey for my level).
 * In the end, I got over-excited and started throwing any money I had into the debt, including emergency funds. I do not recommend this, especially if you are in an unstable place at your job or with your health. I am still building that fund back. **My average student loan payment over the course of the whole process was $827/month**.


TL:DR: My career went off without a hitch, and managed to keep my payments going

43azyl,14,2016-01-29,High and Low (1963) a character analysis,It_sAlwaysMe,TrueFilm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/43azyl/high_and_low_1963_a_character_analysis/,"High and Low centers around a wealthy shoe industry magnate, Kingo Gondo (Mifune), who has risked his entire fortune to buy a majority share in National Shoes, thus forcing out the other directors in the company. His desire is to make National Shoes a reputable company that prioritizes quality over profit, while the other directors care only about making money. Just as he shares his plan with his wife, Reiko (Kagawa) and his secretary, Kawanishi (Mihashi), and begins to celebrate, he gets a sickening call. A kidnapper has taken Gondo’s son and demands the sum of 30 million yen be paid or else the child will die. Despite his funds being tied, Gondo immediately moves to pay the ransom, saying he can raise more money later. The catch is the kidnapper abducted the wrong boy. The child in question is the son of Gondo’s chauffeur, Aoki (Sada). This gives Gondo pause. He believes the kidnapper will return the child realizing his mistake; after all a chauffeur cannot pay a ransom that large. The kidnapper, however, is unrelenting and his demands stand. The film evolves into a spectacle in police procedure and the human psyche. The police, lead by Detective Tokura (Nakadai), cover all the bases and slowly but surely close in on the killer. Gondo, ultimately decides to pay the ransom in the hopes that the police will be able to recover it in time for him to pay his creditors. 

While High and Low is technically categorized as a police procedural, or crime thriller, to narrow it down to one of these would be doing a disservice to the multifaceted nature of the film. The drama and emotion that Mifune achieves in his portrayal of Gondo is pure mastery. His performance makes one wonder if there was a movie star more adept at acting than him. His change in character is marked not only by his behavior, but also by lines spoken in the film. Towards the beginning, while his and Aoki’s son are playing cowboys and Indians, Gondo addresses his boy saying, “a man must kill, or be killed.” He says this with a certain degree of levity, but as the audience, we understand that this is truly the stance of this character. After Gondo decides to pay the kidnapper and shows signs of his deeply buried humanity, one of the detectives admits, “at first I hated him, maybe it’s because I grew up poor, but now…” This coincides with the press calling Gondo a hero and decrying the kidnapper, as well as the men who have forced him out of National Shoes. It is during a brief scene where a couple of detectives are interviewing workers at the factory Gondo oversaw, that we get a clearer idea of Gondo’s nature. The worker tells the police, “If you worked hard, Gondo was a great boss.” This scene coupled with the first one in the film, in which Gondo criticizes the other directors for attempting to manufacture cheaply made, but cost effective shoes, illustrates Gondo’s desire to produce good products rather than make as much money as possible. What takes time to understand is that, for Gondo, paying the ransom is terrifying, not because it means the loss of his personal wealth, but because his dream for National Shoes, and his life’s work, will be ruined. 

Taking Gondo’s character and the events that befall him into consideration is vital in understanding the overarching struggle that the film creates. Just as important to the film as Gondo is his adversary, the kidnapper. Ginjiro Takeuchi (Yamazaki) is a medical intern who lives in squalor below Gondo’s mansion on the hill. He is poor, and most likely came up hard. Having to look up at the pleasant, lush life that Gondo lives drives him insane and creates the hate and jealousy that leads him to kidnap the boy. While Takeuchi’s actions are irrational, his reasons for kidnapping pose an interesting question. Why should Gondo have so much while he has so little? In the final scene of the film when the two men come face to face, Takeuchi claims that Gondo coud never understood his troubles and hard his life was, to which Gondo replies, “did you really have it that bad?” This line is crucial when looking at the entire film. In the end, Gondo’s star has fallen, but the police recovered most of the ransom money (thirty million yen in 1963 was a little over two million dollars in 2016) leaving him with more money than Takeuchi would most likely make in his whole life. So, while Gondo lost much, his question to Takeuchi could just as easily be asked to himself. The difference is that Gondo picked up the pieces and moved on, working for a smaller but reputable company, while Takeuchi’s fate is sealed, and his hatred consumes him. 

The film’s title in Japanese, Heaven and Hell, implies a division. This division manifests itself in a number of ways. Gondo’s house on the hill is heaven while the poor neighborhood below is hell. A more telling interpretation would be the heaven and hell that exists in every person. Gondo was taken from the height of power and success to the depths of his worst nightmares when he ultimately paid the ransom. We as the audience realize that he comes out okay and things aren’t as bad as they once seemed. Takeuchi, on the other hand, tries to earn a place in his own heaven by robbing the man that caused all of his pain. The stakes are high for both characters, but what the film asks us is, what is it in our lives that really matters? Despite the joining of Gondo and Takeuchi’s fates, their lots in life mean that there will always be a gap between them. Takeuchi cannot understand Gondo and Gondo cannot understand Takeuchi, because what matters most in each of their lives is dictated by the natures of the worlds they both live in. Even when the two come face to face at the end they are still separated by the glass in the booth. When Takeuchi is taken away kicking and screaming, an opaque barrier lowers in front of Gondo, leaving him contemplating the meaning of all that’s happened.

I've also had an interest in teaching, and after applying to many different places (health related and not), I ended up as a teacher working at a early childhood education center for 3 years.

 I have interest in community health and health education, and would like to try again to make it in the public health field (my main interest has been chronic disease management/prevention related jobs, but I'm willing to try anything as I start out).

I have no idea what I'm doing anymore on my job search. I've never been laid off and it feels like every day of unemployment makes me less valuable as an applicant. Help. 

**Those of you in the industry who've been canned before, how'd you get back in the saddle? Do you have any advice for me before I lose the last shred of my sanity?**

Read on if you want a background to what got me here. 

-----------------

I've been in account services since 2011. Well, I *was* until this mess. I started out doing an internship in a small boutique agency working on their main account, a large media company (I'm trying to be as generic as possible here to not identify anyone), as well as dabbling in their other accounts - an online business and a pro bono non-profit. They hired me on after the internship and I stuck around for 4 more months until resigning. The 70+ hour weeks, the fact that I could be making more money working in the coffee shop down the street and the constant expectation from the Group Account Director that I put in more ""initiative"" despite having no life and making less than minimum wage had eaten away at me pretty quickly. Fuck it, I was young and my student loan repayment didn't start for another few months, so I could afford to shop around a bit. Even better, the Account Supervisor (who was my direct superior and was far more responsible for my day to day than the GAD) and the client on the pro bono account loved me, so I had some great references under my belt. 

Three months later I was back at it and had gotten myself hired on at a large multi-national agency on an automotive account. This agency was highly sought-after while I was still in school and actually passed me up for an internship originally, so I was extra proud that I made it here. Job hunting was really easy, too. I must have applied to 3-4 agencies at most, got 2 interviews out of it and both of them ended in job offers. All this came about from a passable resume and a witty cover letter that got my foot in the door. 

It's now early 2012. My new job was really great at first. I got to work on the highest selling vehicle nameplate, my supervisor was incredibly nice and made every effort to mentor me, the client was easy to get along with and my coworkers were also awesome in their own ways. I was excelling and I would say I generally enjoyed my job. There were ups and downs, sure, but that'll happen anywhere - advertising or otherwise. Within 2 years I had grown substantially and was promoted to Account Executive. This is when the cracks started to show, however. In hindsight the promotion was likely as much about my abilities and tenure as it was about keeping me around. My supervisor and a substantial part of my department had all left within a very short period of time right before it. They saw the writing on the wall from the upcoming ""restructuring"" and got the hell out of Dodge. Me? I liked my job and was willing to stick it out. How bad could it be?

As details began to surface we began to find out my agency had decided to go the single-client route and consolidated us with a number of our partner companies. We were all brought under one roof in a new subsidiary - efficiency and all that, right? It was a lot of change for many people, but I didn't really mind because realistically my group was only changing floors within the same building and I'd still be working on the same portfolio. ""Bring on the change"" was my mentality going into it. This industry is all about adapting to changes, after all. I was ready. Or so I thought. 

It's now 2014 and the environment of my fantastic new job had changed drastically. The new space quickly lost its lustre and working on a portfolio I knew and loved wasn't enough to stay happy anymore. In fact, it became apparent later on that it wasn't even enough to stay mentally sound. We went the ""open concept"" route, as so many modern workplaces tend to do, instead of keeping our old cubicle format. Open concept can be done right but it can also be done very, very wrong. In this case the office was put in the ""let's squeeze as many people into the same room as possible so that we can minimize overhead costs"" format that had dozens of employees sitting elbow to elbow in the same space. Now picture that but with sterile white walls and minimal decor. In an ad agency. A business where creativity pays the bills. 

Worse yet there was hardwood flooring in each working space. You just don't do hardwood if you intend to have a lot of people in one place. The noise became truly unbearable as the constant reassignment of desks lead to more and more people being shoved together. I vividly remember having to apologize to clients and vendors about the volume on the regular. Boardrooms were a luxury and the only escape was a series of windowless rooms that were quickly nicknamed ""Crying Rooms."" I saw many people break down and come out of hiding sobbing or red-faced in my year in our ""new and improved"" single-client agency. I also witnessed many of my coworkers succumb to alcoholism, with one heavy-drinking copywriter in particular that had also braved the consolidation confiding in me that he calls our new space his personal ""white hell."" By the end of 2014 I began to crack too. The environment was my main beef, but the combination of questionable leadership, plummeting morale, lack of recognition, below industry average pay and general feeling of being exploited had become the perfect storm of shit. I wasn't about to weather it. The night that I was forced to work through our after hours in-office Christmas party and had my own breakdown was when I knew I had to leave. 

By the beginning of 2015 I was hard at work on a new resume. My team knew I wanted out, but my Account Director had also recommended me for a promotion even before that was out in the open. Supervisor. A year ago I would have jumped for joy knowing I'd be a Supervisor here, but it didn't matter anymore. A year of this white hell had meant that, short of an enema-like cleansing of this place and management that would look at our environment holistically, nothing was going to keep me here. Nothing except going back to the way things were, which is consequently exactly what happened. Another Account Supervisor role had opened up in the old agency we split off of; the one I had such fond memories of. The old agency never fully recovered from the automotive account turning into this new subsidiary and was a shadow of its former self from the loss of staff and revenue, but it was a way out. This new account, which the agency had had for over 20 years, was also headed up by a very well-liked Account Director I had gotten to work with in 2012 and had the utmost respect for. It was my golden ticket. 

But that would have been too easy, right?

Fast forward four weeks into the new Account Supervisor role. The account unexpectedly cuts ties with my agency globally and hands the business off to its in-house agency. My old job has long since been filled. Meanwhile, the old staff I had known and loved have revolted and are actively leaving in droves. I ride it out for the 3 month transitional period between the in-house agency taking over, all the while unsuccessfully applying to new jobs. My agency shuts down and lays off the remainder of the staff. And now I'm here with my last role lasting all of 3 months, a black eye on my resume. 

Boy, that escalated quickly. 

It's now 2016. I've applied and I've applied and I've applied and have come up short. Is it still possible to come back from this? "
43c85k,0,2016-01-29,Analyzing the Nova rework,pcdn,heroesofthestorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/43c85k/analyzing_the_nova_rework/,"I have to start by giving kudos to Blizz and the Heroes team for being so proactive in the recent balance patches which have been largely positive and well thought out.

&amp;nbsp;

There's almost nothing more polarizing than a nova post on this sub.  I'll say up front that I'm a nova fan who believes that the hero needed a rework, but that the current changes on the PTR are overkill.  I understand that many players couldn't care less about nova and would be happy to see her nerfed to the ground, however I don't believe that the live state of Nova warrants what is effectively a removal of the hero from relevance.

&amp;nbsp;

I get that the hero is too binary currently.  I agree that nova on live is not healthy for the majority of the player base.  Please hear me out.  The following is based on the top Quick Match build for Nova on hotslogs.  Why only Quick Match?  Because that's where the majority of the issues exist.  The popular builds take the following:

&amp;nbsp;

Ambush Snipe (+20% snipe damage from stealth)

Gathering Power (+30% max ability power, based on kills, resets on death)

Anti-Armor Shells (+250% basic attack damage, increases time between attacks accordingly)

Precision Strike or Triple Tap (we'll go with PS because it's the most popular)

Lethal Decoy (decoy does 25% of nova's damage)

Double Fake (2 decoys)

Rewind (reset basic abilities cooldowns)

&amp;nbsp;

* **Damage Reduction:**

&amp;nbsp;

Lets start by looking at burst damage reduction.  We'll assume all abilities are used, followed by rewind, followed by abilities again (All numbers are taken from level 20 Try mode on PTR and Live):

&amp;nbsp;

**Typical Rotation on Live:**

&amp;nbsp;

1) Pinning Shot:

* 241 base

* +30% from Gathering Power = 313.3

&amp;nbsp;

2) Snipe: 

* 735 base

* +20% from Ambush Snipe = 147

* +30% from Gathering Power = 220.5

* Total with just GP: 955.5

* Total: 1102.5

&amp;nbsp;
 
3) Decoys (to keep it simple lets assume the decoys only get off one snipe and one pinning shot):

* 25% of Snipe with GP x 2 decoys = (238.875 x 2) = 477.75

* 25% of Pinning Shot with GP x 2 decoys = (78.325 x 2) = 156.65

* Total: 634.4

&amp;nbsp;

4) Precision Strike:

* 1000 base

* + 30% from Gathering Power = 300

* Total: 1300

&amp;nbsp;

Ability Damage subtotal: 3350.2

&amp;nbsp;

5) Rewind

6) Pinning Shot (same as above): 313.3

7) Snipe (same as above minus 20% from ambush snipe): 955.5

8) Decoys (same as above): 634.4


Total theoretical ability damage: 5253.4

&amp;nbsp;

Can you begin to see the problem here?  *Lethal Decoy + Double Fake + Rewind is extremely overpowered on Nova.*  The pre-rewind damage is borderline acceptable for a glass cannon ambush hero who has executed a perfect combo and blown their heroic ability.  The post-rewind damage is why you see some heroes get 100-0 deleted with little or no ability to avoid it.

&amp;nbsp;

But let's look at what a high damage PTR build might be (please correct me if there's a higher dps build i've missed):

&amp;nbsp;

Longshot (30% range on pinning shot)

Holo Stability (+120% decoy duration)

Snipe Master (up to +50% damage on snipe provided you never ever miss HAH)

Precision Strike

Double Tap (2 charges of pinning shot)

Lethal Decoy (decoy does 40% damage)

Rewind

&amp;nbsp;


**Typical Rotation on PTR:**

&amp;nbsp;

1) Pinning Shot:

* 241 base

* extra charge from Double Tap talent

* Total: 482

&amp;nbsp;

2) Snipe:

* 588 Base

* +50% from max snipe master (yeah, right): 294

* Total: 882

&amp;nbsp;

3) Decoy (as above, assume 1 snipe and 1 pinning shot)

* 40% of snipe w/snipe master: 352.8

* 40% of pinning shot: 96.4

* Total: 449.2

&amp;nbsp;

4) Precision Strike: 1000 base

&amp;nbsp;

Ability damage subtotal: 2813.2

&amp;nbsp;

5) Rewind

&amp;nbsp;

6) Pinning Shot (rewind only resets one cd, so just 1x this time): 241

7) Snipe (same as above): 882

8) Decoy (same as above): 449.2

&amp;nbsp;

Total theoretical ability damage: 4385.4

&amp;nbsp;

So we can see that in an absolute best case scenario where a player keeps up the 50% snipe buff, our total theoretical ability damage burst is **only about 16% lower** than the current live version of Nova.  It should be obvious to Nova players that it is very realistic to expect a high uptime on the +30% gathering power, whereas it is nearly impossible in a real game to maintain the +50% sniper master buff.  In practice I'd estimate that most players will go for One in the Chamber over Snipe Master, and that the basic attack damage would go up by 80% if executed perfectly, while the snipe damage on decoys and nova go down by 50%.

&amp;nbsp;

**So if the numbers aren't as bad as everyone initially thought, why does nova feel so weak and fragile now on the PTR?**

&amp;nbsp;


Well, let's look at what we lose going from live to PTR outside of damage.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Defense Reduction**

&amp;nbsp;

Decoys: A big part of nova's defense lies in her decoys.  Unfortunately when Double Fake was removed, so was a good chunk of her ability to juke opponents.

&amp;nbsp;

Spell Shield: This was available at lvl 13 and has been removed.

&amp;nbsp;

Advanced Cloak: Not many people have mentioned this, but advanced cloak was an excellent defensive/escape/sustain talent at 13 that was nerfed and moved to level 1.  On Live it gives +25% move speed and +2% health per second.  On PTR it is simply +30% move speed.  I much prefer the live version.

&amp;nbsp;

Bolt of the Storm:  removed.  While Ghost Protocol is kinda neat to use, IMHO bolt of the storm was a much better escape, and was a tough choice between it and Rewind.  On PTR I can almost never justify giving up Rewind, as it allows for more damage AND defense through the extra clone.

&amp;nbsp;


* **Utility Reduction**

&amp;nbsp;

Decoys:  Decoys previously applied effects from Pinning shot including vulnerability.  On PTR this appears to have been removed.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Opportunity Cost**

&amp;nbsp;

This mostly entails talent tier arrangement and the elimination of some combinations that were previously available.

&amp;nbsp;

1) We must now choose between basic attack bonus talents and snipe damage (One in the Chamber / Anti-Armor Shells / Snipe Master on same tier).  Given the existing ability damage reduction, there's not a lot of justification to further reduce by forcing this choice.

&amp;nbsp;

2) In addition, the Nova iteration on PTR has little if any reason to ever pick Anti-Armor Shells over One in the Chamber given the available build choices.

&amp;nbsp;

3) a note about Snipe Master on this tier.  It's just a bad talent with a very frustrating mechanic.  Unless you are a top 1% player in a pub stomp, you are not going to ever pick this in its current form.  It's almost laughable that someone at Blizzard thought this up and it got through to the PTR.

&amp;nbsp;

3) We are forced into a decoy talent at lvl 4.  The talents are decent, but they are a waste unless you plan to build further into decoys.  What was the thought here?  This does not promote overall build diversity.

&amp;nbsp;

4) We are forced to choose between vulnerability on pinning shot and lethal decoy now.  This used to be a choice between double fake and vulnerability which IMO was a more compelling choice.

&amp;nbsp;

5) The level 13 talents are kind of a joke.  Double Tap is going to be the best choice even on snipe builds.  None of these talents give a significant power boost at 13.  Lethal decoy should be moved back to 13.

&amp;nbsp;

6) Why are there so many noob trap mana talents?  Nova doesn't have mana issues.

&amp;nbsp;

* **Build Diversity**

&amp;nbsp;

I currently see a Snipe build (which is doomed to fail because it depends on Nova's ability to expose herself more often, which is a tall order given that she lost a lot of defense ability), a team fight build via double pinning shot + vulnerability, and a decoy rewind build.  Nova still cannot effectively clear lanes, has several trash talents (which is very annoying given this is a rework of the hero), has lost a significant amount of damage AND defense, and does not bring anything to the table over other assassins in the PTR iteration.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

**So my final plea to blizzard is this:**

* Taking away Gathering Power was enough of a numbers nerf if you also take away rewind.  Rewind was what enabled the cheese 100-0 delete-a-hero builds.

* Bump snipe back up to the original base, but take away Ambush Snipe if you wish.  

* Leave double decoy for defense and lower their damage from 25% each to 20% on each clone.  

* Get rid of Snipe Master, it's a dumb talent and isn't fun or interesting, only frustrating and volatile.  

* Keep Ghost Protocol in place of Bolt, it's an interesting choice once you remove Rewind.

* Give her a poke/wave clear build that sacrifices single target damage.

* Don't force us to choose a decoy talent.

* Please for the love of god rethink all of the garbage talents in this 'rework' of nova.  It's insulting that you guys take so much care not to overnerf certain heroes like Tyrande or KT who almost singlehandedly caused many pro players to quit the game and forced a stale meta for months, then seemingly stick your intern on the nova rework.  You guys have proven that you can make intelligent creative balance solutions when you want to.  The nova rework, while you may get praise from quickmatch nova haters, sticks out like a sore thumb as a half effort on your part.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT:** Removing the Zeratul bullet point.  People just reading that and flat out ignoring the entire post.

43cvyd,8,2016-01-30,Something Touched Me...,horrorgal98,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/43cvyd/something_touched_me/,"It was a horrible day and a horrible night. My alarm clock didn't go off, stuck in traffic, boss yelled at me in front of everyone including Derek the new and cute intern, spilled hot coffee all over my new blouse, and got a ticket for parking in the wrong spot. I came home to the sound of my neighbors fighting and the TV not working. This was the last thing I needed, overwhelmed and covered in sweat I headed to the bathroom to take a nice long hot shower. Water not working, great! I called my super who came 30 minutes later while I waited in my satin pink robe and got to the TV to work. He fixed my pipes while checking me out when he thought I wasn't paying attention.

""Hey how' about a drink sometime? Ya look like you could use one"". He said in a New York accent.

""Get out please I'm tired"". Once he left and I locked the door I turned on the water and let my robe slip down. I was in there for two hours when I decided I didn't want to look like a raisin for work tomorrow. I got out, put on my robe, and looked in the mirror and for a split second I thought I saw a man. I turned around so quick that my hair knocked down my toothbrush! It was a tiny bathroom so if someone else was in there I would know about it. I slowly opened the door and found everything the way I left it.  After I finished my microwave dinner and watching Jerry Springer hide from an obese man dressed as a woman I had enough and went up to bed.

Running I was running in my dream from the man that I saw in my bathroom. The creepiest part of it all was when he got me, I could feel like someone was pressing their fingers into my skin and onto my throat. The man had no expression on his face as his grip tightened and my windpipe felt like it was going to collapse! Then it stopped all of a sudden, just like that. I woke up petrified as I ran to my bathroom and could see visible finger prints on my forearms and a handprint on my neck...

I didn't go to work the next day since I was looking for a new apartment."

I have been out of the game for a while now. I sold my Ergodox to a friend of mine because it became tiresome about a year ago. Now, I have just my Leopold FC200R. While this keyboard is amazing and has been the keyboard that I have been using for almost 4 years now, I want to move on. I have an internship (programming) coming up this summer at a company that has an ""open office"". Needless to say, I am looking for a new keyboard that is small, portable and obviously mechanical.

I'm not looking to spend over $250 because I'm kind of afraid that my wife might kill me if I spend that much. I've been looking at the HHKB and the Pok3r with Browns. Are there any good 60% keyboards that I might have missed in the last two or so years? I'm looking for something kind of quiet but with a tactile bump. Any suggestions?

**tl;dr** Been out of the Mechanical Keyboard game for a while. Looking to buy a new 60% with Mx Browns. Thinking about getting the HHKB if there isn't anything *really* good new on the market."

43dkvi,3,2016-01-30,"I spiral everytime I'm rejected, sincerely worried things are going to get bad",Hamjamster,INeedToTalkToSomeone,https://www.reddit.com/r/INeedToTalkToSomeone/comments/43dkvi/i_spiral_everytime_im_rejected_sincerely_worried/,"College student, Male, 21. This is a throwaway account I made because I'm embarrassed to talk about all this. I would normally say sorry for dumping a ton of information, but that's kind of the point of this. This may be a little James-Joyce-stream-of-consciousness because  4:30 where I'm writing this, and I had internship from 8-11, class from 11-4, then work from 5-3

Not been in a relationship since I've been in college. I know it's not smart, sustainable, or healthy, but I can't help but derive a lot of my self worth from being supported by others I generally like myself and feel well-liked and well-connected around campus and in life. I hate that I'm not happy. I know objectively that I have no right reason to be upset. I'm talented, bright, involved on campus. I have good friends. I can count the blessings, know I have no reason to be upset, but I just feel empty and sad a ton of the time. It happens especially hard and consistently after things fall through with potential romantic partners.

Everytime I feel that I'm getting really close with female romantic type companion, things fall apart. I never seem to be able to have the interest of someone I'm interested in. Everytime things don't work out with women, I basically implode. I stop wanting to do anything, I don't eat or sleep well. It makes me feel like I should stop getting my hopes up; climbing upward only makes the fall longer, harder, and more debilitating.

The crux of the issue is a particular girl. Call her Argentina because that is where she is from. Argentina is everything I've ever wanted. At the advice of a friend of mine, a few months back , I made a list of what I was looking for (this was some hippie vision board style noise. No hate, but not exactly up my alley) and Argentina checks every box. She's brilliantly smart, compassionate, beautiful, unpretentious, stunningly beautiful. We shared a class, and the first time I heard her speak my reaction was that it was like music; her accent made all the words flow together and I knew that I could listen to her speak for hours and lose myself blissfully. She and I worked together for our class, occasionally. We helped each other in our Bio class, and we sat next to each other during a seminar/discussion course. She was in a long distance relationship this entire time, but this semester she broke up with the dude. I've been holding a torch for her the whole time, as much as I didn't want to admit that to myself. I would do dumb shit like try to leave exams at the same time as her just so we could have a shitty 30 second conversation about how we didn't see a question about Sxl mutation pathways in Drosophila coming and how we don't know how we did on the test. 

She and I have seen each other a few times this semester, and she told me that she broke up with the dude back home. I'm fairly neurotic (if you hadn't already gathered) and can't help but over analyze her reaching out to me and seeing me even though we don't have classes together this semester. Here's the breakdown: she contacted me because I am 21 and have a car, which is good combination to help her get alcohol (she is 20, we're in the States, drinking age is 21 here). She and her friend (a somewhat mutual friend, I know and like her, Argentina is very close with her) went to the store with me, I made the purchases. After this, the friend suggested we get dinner, and then later go out and engage in some night time fraternity party debauchery. I said that sounded really fun, because it did. When we got back on campus, our mutual friend told Argentina that her back was hurting and that she couldn't go out. Argentina asked if I still wanted to go, and I said yes because there was nothing I wanted to do more. We had a decent time, she was with other friends a lot of the time at the party; I'm super cool with this because she is her own person and I'm not in the business of being overly controlling or clingy. Additionally, she talked and hung out with another guy at this party; this I practically one an Academy Award for not acting devastated. Afterwards, we were at a subway where she confided in me about feeling heartbroken about a third different guy. I'm not surprised that a lot of guys are involved/interested, because Argentina is magnificent and people are going to be interested. I listened and we talked and she said she appreciated me being nice and being a good listener.

Over the next 10 days or so, we got a couple meals together. To say the signals are mixed is an understatement. This is a combination of me being dense and her being enigmatic. I consulted some female friends about what signals usually mean and the readings are all over the board


Generally Positive| Generally Negative
---|---
Left her umbrella in my car| Talks to me about other guys who are interested
Laughs (loudly) at lots of things I say | Used the phrase ""I'm not looking for a relationship right now"" (Particularly damning from what I understand)
Got dinner just us| Didn't make a ton of eye contact during a dinner with just the two of us
Shares with me good news she gets | Doesn't text me back for hours/days at a time
Walks really close to me when we walk | Rarely makes effort to initiate conversation, make plans
Said she might ask for my help with a Bio Course she's in | Does not make effort to maintain textual conversation
Saw her at a different party, she looked thrilled to see me, gave giant hug | talked with her friend and left said party almost as soon as we saw each other

I know that I have the tendency to over-perceive romantic interest from others, especially when I really like someone. I also know that I have the tendency to under-perceive how much I am liked when I am down on myself

I think I know that she doesn't like me. I think I know that but I don't want to admit it to myself because as soon as it's definite, I'm going to be devastated.

If I don't make moves towards trying to see if there is something there, I'll hate myself and I'll have to live with the regret. If I make moves, and she doesn't like me, we won't be able to be platonic friends anymore. That's rough, because as mush as I'm genuinely enamored with Argentina, I feel I'd be able to compartmentalize and downshift toward friends. I did it for a time when she was LDR with her ex.

Genuinely sorry for anyone who took the time to read through that.

Should i give up with her ?",Prygan,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43dr62/me_20_m_with_my_gf_20_f_8mo_just_broke_up_because/,"(disclamers : i'm not a native english speaker, i tried to do my best to write good english :) )

I've been in a relationship with my now ex-GF during 8 months. 
We met at University and at first all was perfect. Even if i was in internship, i could see her at every lunches. During summer vacations, i saw her a lot of times. I went with her and her family on an one week trip and i feel that her family loved me. She was very cute and attentive with me and i tried to do my best to be a good BF.

After summer vacations, all changed. She stayed in University and i quit it to go to an Engineering school. At this moment, we stopped to see ourselves. She was very busy with homework and could not give me any of her time. I tried to help her with it but she refused everytime (i guess she wanted to do it by herself). I don't blame her for it as i respect people who work hard to success. I tried to support her and keep in touch with SMS. In have an heavy schedule in my new school so i could only come to her school few times. Times passed and her messages became more and more occasional. Last week she even stopped replying me. 

Finally, yesterday she send me an SMS to broke our relation. She sayed me she was too busy to see me and she could not give me more time. Her love for me tended to disappear and our relation could not continue like this. Obviously, i knew this moment had to come one day (as she stopped to answer my messages during a whole week).

I didn't know how to react and sayed i understood. I don't want to force her to stay with me. I still love her a lot and i want her to be happy. But i really her to be my GF again. I feel like we are perfect for each others. 

My question is : Should i give up this relation or should i fight to make her fall in love with me again ? And how can i do that ? 
Next week, i have the possibility to come to her school. Should i do that ? I'm afraid that this will be a bit awkward and painfull.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I knew something was up when my wife Sharon met me at the door the second i got home from work. She had something to say and she needed to get it out in a hurry. ""What are you doing this weekend?"" She blurted out. I actually had to work a bit on Saturday morning, but she seemed so excited and my curiosity was piqued and i didn't want to dampen her mood. 


""You tell me"", I smiled.


""Erin and John have their uncle's cabin for the weekend and they invited us! You remember it, right? It has a pool table, hot tub, fireplace....what do you think? I was hoping you could take a half day on Friday and we could get there in time for dinner.""


""Sounds perfect."" I responded. It had been years since we were last at that cabin. I think it was for a New Years Eve party. It was in the middle of nowhere, but it was fixed up nicely. It had a great rustic feel but with all the modern amenities. When it was stocked with food and booze, it was an amazing place to be. We hadn't been away for awhile, so this was a great time to go back. ""I do have some work to do on Saturday, but i can get one of the other guys to cover. Is it just going to be the four of us?""


""Yeah, Erin wanted to keep it small. I'll text her right now and let her know we're in. Yay!""


My wife and Erin had known each other from grade school and were very close. I knew Erin since about a week after I started dating my wife. We had become very close too. She actually lived with us for about a year after she got divorced in her late 20's. She had moved out of state because of her husband's job and after the divorce she wanted to move back home but didn't want to move back in with her parents. We invited her to stay with us. The three of us always got along well, and I think we all looked back at that year as a fun time in our lives. Erin was really miserable in her marriage, so a fresh start and some time to relax was ideal at that point in her life. 


She didn't work for the first few weeks, and she was still young, so she was really living it up. We all joked that it was like she was back in college. I remember many mornings awkwardly saying hello to a half naked man who was drinking coffee in our kitchen after a night with Erin. One time, there was a guy who was totally naked. My wife did a double take when she walked in on him. He thought it was Erin's place and had no idea we lived there. He still hadn't bothered putting clothes on by the time I had made it into the kitchen for breakfast. Erin was still asleep and there was my wife, having a casual conversation with a completely naked stranger. She said it didn't faze her but I distinctly remember her complementing Erin profusely on the quality of her one night stand and then initiating sex with me that night. Erin was a very a wild girl, especially back in those days. She was actually the only other woman besides my wife that I have seen naked (if you don't count strippers) and she was the only other woman to see me naked. I had low self esteem in high school and never had sex during those awkward four years. When I met Sharon in my junior year of college, I finally lost my virginity. Sharon was six years older than me. I was 20 and she was 26. I had an internship my junior year at the company where she worked. We worked pretty closely and became really good friends and then got romantically involved. I had no idea that she was so much older at the time, but it didn't really bother me anyway. And when I had to go back to school the next semester, she had no problem with dating a college kid.


The first time Erin saw me naked was very much an accident. My wife and I had spontaneous sex at about 3 in the morning. Neither one of us could sleep so we decided on a quickie. Afterwards my wife wanted a glass of water and when I couldn't find my boxers she told me to just go naked. Erin had to be sound asleep, she reasoned. Well, when i turned the light in the kitchen on, it woke Erin who had fallen asleep on the couch while watching tv. I had no idea she was there when I stepped out from behind the counter and I was so startled I almost dropped the glass of ice water I was carrying. I yelped and half of the water splashed out onto me. She laughed so hard and i could only imagine how ridiculous I must have looked-- completely naked, and nearly jumping out of my skin. Her laughter was so loud that my wife had come out to see what all the commotion was. Of course she had stopped to put a robe on, so there I was, completely naked while the two of them, fully clothed, had a big laugh at my expense. 


The next day I saw Erin naked and that was definitely intentional. We were sitting around the dining room table having breakfast around noon on that lazy Saturday. None of us had showered yet. My wife was still naked under her robe, I had found my boxers from the night before and Erin was barely clad in panties and a t-shirt, her favorite outfit for lounging around the house in the a.m.. They were both still teasing me about the night before and Erin was relentless about seeing me naked. I guess I was coming across as bitter and wasn't taking the teasing well because Erin scolded me that I was being childish about the whole thing. She said it wasn't a big deal and they were only teasing because i let it bother me. Then to prove her point she stepped out of her panties and yanked the t-shirt over her head. I was speechless as she sat back down to finish her breakfast completely naked. My wife just started to giggle and said ""I guess you showed him.""


Years later we were at a Fourth of July party at Erin's parent's house. It was late and all of the guests had left. Sharon and I stayed behind to help clean. After Erin's parents went to bed, we decided to have one last drink. We sat by the pool, drinks in hand, and Erin lamented the fact that she hadn't had a chance to swim the whole day. She had been too busy helping with the party. It was a very hot and humid night, so a swim sounded like a great idea to all three of us right then. However Erin said she didn't feel like putting on a bathing suit. Sharon and I had gone swimming earlier and while i was still wearing my trunks, Sharon had changed out of her suit. She didn't feel like changing into hers again either so she suggested we all just skinny dip. She didn't hesitate to strip down to nothing and Erin did too. I watched intently as both girls disrobed and then eased into the water. They both turned to egg me on and I peeled off my trunks as they watched and i settled into the water next to them. We were probably only in the water for about thirty minutes or so, but it was exhilirating. The water felt great on my naked skin, but even better was the inadvertent touching. I accidentally grazed Erin's naked ass with my hand as I swam by her. She accidentally bumped into me at one point-- her naked breasts pressed into my back. Then Sharon fully embraced me and we locked lips as she reached down to see if I had an erection. She pulled her hand away after confirming that I did and she gave me a sly smile, knowing I was enjoying this twice as much as either of them. My dick stayed hard while we all decided to get out. We totally hadn't counted on the air feeling much colder as we were dripping wet, and none of us had a towel. We decided to give it a few minutes for our bodies to air dry before we got dressed. My wife embraced me to stay warm and extended an open arm to Erin to come join us. She squeezed in close to us, our naked wet bodies pressed together when my hard cock pressed into her hip. She hadn't realized until then that I was hard and as she pulled away she gave me a playful smack on the ass and called me a pig. My wife laughed and took hold of my cock slowly stroking it. She told Erin not to worry because she could make it go away in about 30 seconds. They both laughed and I even shocked myself when i said to Erin  ""It will go even faster if you help."" Without hesitation, Erin moved closer and reached one hand behind me, rubbing my butt. I clenched at first, but when i eased up her fingers softly slid between my cheeks. Sharon must have divulged our secrets to her at some point because she knew exactly what was she was doing when one of her fingers firmly pressed onto my asshole. She found my weakness. I hit the point of no return, right then. My wife was stroking the whole time and I came right then in front of the two of them, moaning uncontrollably as my wife milked me dry. It wasn't under 30 seconds, but it wasn't much longer than that. My wife could sense that I was a little embarrassed so she looked up at me and gave me a soft, reassuring kiss. 


That night when Sharon and I went to bed I broached the subject of a threesome with Erin. Sharon and I both fantasized about a MFF threesome and that night seemed like a good time to bring it up. She instantly shot down the idea. Erin was her best friend, she said. It would be awkward. Too weird. I was disappointed in her response but then she said something that completely lifted my spirits. ""I don't care if you two did it, though. That would be completely up to the two of you....I wouldn't mind."" I went to sleep that night with all sorts of sexy scenarios racing through my mind. What would Erin's pussy taste like? How would it feel when I pushed my dick into her. What noises did she make in bed? How would her manicured nails look wrapped around my shaft? When and how would I make my move?


Two weeks later Erin met the man who would become her second husband. John was a tall, handsome, successful civil engineer. He was older than her, in his mid 40's when they met. He is a nice enough guy, and I get along okay with him, but we don't really have much in common. He isn't into sports or pop culture like I am. When the four of us went out, I would spend most of the time talking with our spouses. Erin fell completely in love with him, though. A few short years after they met, and despite vowing never to remarry after her disaster of a first marriage, Erin and John tied the knot. That was seven years ago, and we're all still friends. (Even though I still secretly really wanted to fuck Erin.)


Friday rolled around and I worked from home that morning so I Sharon and I could leave as soon as possible. It was about a three hour drive to the cabin. Sharon had prepared a cooler with some steaks and sides, and of course we were bringing a generous amount of alcohol. The plan was to get up to the cabin, throw the steaks on the grill and have a delicious steak dinner and polish off a few bottles of wine. John had to work a couple hours later than me, so we were going to have dinner ready by the time he and Erin arrived. I was packed and ready to go when Sharon's phone rang. It was Erin. I could only hear Sharon's side of the conversation, but it didn't sound like good news. I waited on bringing my bag out to the car just in case. Sharon hung up and turned toward me. ""Slight change of plans. John has to work late tonight. I guess his company closed on some big deal sooner than expected and he has to attend some meetings. They were just going to drive up in the morning, but I asked Erin to come with us tonight. She might as well. No sense in her waiting for John when we have room in the car for her.""


""Yeah, sure. No problem. That sucks for John, but at least we'll see him tomorrow.""


We swung by Erin's house a half hour later and of course she wasn't ready. She texted Sharon for us to come inside and wait. She walked out of the bedroom in a robe and her hair wrapped in a towel. ""So sorry guys,"" she said ""I just got out of the shower but I'm almost done packing. Joe, if you don't mind, can you take the cooler and that bag there?"" She pointed to them and I obliged. Sharon had told her that she was taking care of tonight's dinner and Erin told her she would bring some stuff for breakfast and lunch on Saturday and Sunday. We planned on going out on Saturday night for dinner. There were a few restaurants to pick from within about a half hour of the cabin. The cooler was much heavier than expected, but I managed on my own and squeezed it into the trunk. Erin would have to put her other stuff on the back seat with her because we couldn't possibly cram anything else into the trunk. When I walked back into the house i could hear the two of them talking and laughing in the bedroom. We've all been so busy lately, it was nice to be getting together and getting away for a weekend. Over the past year, we really haven't seen each other much. The two of them were obviously in a great mood now. I sat on the couch and as I reached for the remote Erin came hustling out of the bedroom in just her panties and a tee. ""Don't mind me!"" she exclaimed as she headed for the laundry room. She was 42 years old and she still had an amazing ass. She put on a few pounds since I had first met her, but those pounds only accentuated her curves and made her even sexier. I couldn't stop staring as she bent over to get her jeans out of the dryer. She was wearing plain, white, cotton panties but they were so sheer that I might as well have been staring at her naked. Her back to me, she pulled the jeans on and buttoned them. They fit her ass perfectly and I was just barely able to look away in time before she turned around. As she hurried past me to the bedroom, I looked up and she flashed me a smile. I wondered if she knew how horny she had made me and if she got off on teasing me with her panty-clad ass. The two of them were laughing back in the bedroom again and I wondered if maybe they were talking about me-- knowing how hot and bothered it made me seeing Erin prancing around scantily clad like she did way back when the three of us lived together. The laughter quickly faded and I could hear just quiet murmuring as they chatted and Erin finished gathering her things. They came out of the bedroom together and I was asked to take the suitcase from the bed and load it into the car. It was much heavier than needed for just a weekend trip, and I struggled to get it onto the back seat. We finally left-- about forty-five minutes later than intended.


The drive was uneventful and mixed with small talk and excited musings about our plans for the weekend. We all pretty much planned on doing a lot of relaxing and eating and drinking. There was also some talk of snow tubing, as the cabin was surrounded by some hills that were perfect for it. Erin's father and uncle used the cabin for hunting but neither John nor I hunted, so that wasn't in the cards for us. We arrived at the cabin around 4 pm and snow was starting to lightly fall.  There was already about 6 inches on the ground, but the driveway was fairly level and I didn't have much trouble getting the car parked close to the house. There wasn't much sense in shoveling any of it, since we were only there for a couple days, so we trudged up and down the snow-covered steps carrying all of our stuff in. As i was struggling with Erin's suitcase, Sharon leaned in and whispered to me that Erin had packed every single sex toy that she owned. The bag didn't feel quite so heavy anymore and I was slightly aroused. Once we were unpacked, I grilled the steaks while the girls prepared the sides. There was a gas grill on the wrap-around porch and after I cleaned all the snow off, i had the steaks cooked to perfection in no time. Dinner was excellent. We had mushrooms and asparagus and roasted potatoes along with the steaks and we easily finished off a bottle of red wine. Sharon was opening another bottle when Erin's phone rang. It was John. She talked for a minute and then slowly walked into the back hallway for some privacy. Sharon gave me a concerned look. We cleaned off the table and did the dishes all while Erin was still on the phone. She finally walked back and poured herself another bottle of wine. ""He's not coming. We're getting divorced.""


""What?!"" Sharon and I exclaimed simultaneously. We were obviously shocked. ""I'm so sorry, honey,"" Sharon said as she embraced her.


""No, no....don't worry...it's all for the best."" Erin replied. ""I have wanted this for months. Believe me...this marriage has been over for a long time. I've already come to terms with it. We don't love each other anymore. We never have fun together anymore. It's not that I hate him or anything. Not like that first asshole I married. I just think we got tired of each other and this marriage has run its course. He loves his work. He doesn't love me. I told him this trip was a dumb idea, but he insisted we try getting away. When I refused, he suggested we invite you two. He thought maybe if it was the four of us, at least we would have some fun, and he and I could use it as a stepping stone to repairing this marriage. But guess where he is tonight?""


""Where?"" Sharon asked.


""Work!"" shouted Erin. ""He really did go to an urgent meeting. This was his bright idea to come here, to try to spark something again, and he decided at the last minute that work was more important! Obviously, he's as done with this marriage as I am! He finally realized it, though. He called between meetings and decided it would be best if he stayed home this weekend."" She quickly downed her glass of wine and poured herself another.


""I can't believe you never let on!"" said Sharon. ""I thought you two were fine. You know you could have talked to me about it.""


""I know. I just didn't want to say anything until it was really over. Just in case we did make it work. I feel so bad guys, I was hoping we could at least enjoy this weekend. I should probably see if I can get a cab to the bus station.""


""What? Don't be silly."" Sharon said. ""We can go home with you if you really want to go.""


""No, no...I don't want to ruin your weekend! You guys stay!""


""Then you're staying!""


""Are you sure? I feel like such a third wheel now.""


""Don't be ridiculous! We want you to stay! It'll be boring with just me and Joe! Let's all have some fun! Besides, it's YOUR uncle's cabin.""


""You guys are so awesome."" Erin took another sip of wine. ""Well, let's get our bathing suits on. I'm getting drunk in the hot tub!""


A half hour later, the three of us were in the hot tub, laughing and carrying on. Erin actually seemed genuinely happy, although it may have been the wine. She was on her fifth or sixth glass and she was not slowing down. ""You guys,"" she joked, ""You know now that I'm getting divorced again, I'm going to need to move back in with you!"" We all had a good laugh at that one. The stars were a beautiful sight that night, even through the crisp, cold night air. We found ourselves all quietly looking up at them. ""I feel so bad"", Erin remarked. ""You guys should be having such a romantic time right now. You could be out here naked right now!"" Sharon and I just laughed.


""We can still get naked,"" Sharon slyly responded. We all laughed.


Erin chimed in. ""Remember the time we went skinny dipping at my parents house!"" Her eyes lit up as she said it.


""I remember it very well."" I said quietly. The girls laughed and my wife leaned in to kiss me. The look in her eyes was mischievous as she smiled at me and I knew she was thinking of something naughty. She had plenty of wine already, and she was in a playful mood.


""You first, honey."" She said. ""C'mon...let's see that dick.""


""Yeah!"" Erin shouted. ""We're short one dick tonight, and I need to see some.""


Not that I needed to be coerced, but I had no choice anyway with them shouting and demanding that I take my trunks off. Even with the alcohol and the shrinkage, I could feel my cock was semi-hard as I stood up and slowly stripped naked. The girls shrieked and clapped, making a lot of commotion. I made a big production out of it and waved my trunks over my head and threw them as far as I could into the snow, and they got even louder. When they finally quieted down, my wife leaned over and whispered something to Erin. ""Your turn now."" I told the two of them.


My wife and Erin stopped whispering to each other and both moved closer to me. ""We will, honey"", my wife said to me as she firmly grabbed my cock. She started to stroke it with a huge grin on her face as I saw Erin reaching down between my legs. She gently cupped my balls and gave them a slight squeeze. Then her hand grabbed the bottom of my shaft while my wife stroked toward the tip. ""Does that feel good, baby?"" Sharon asked as she slowly and deliberately moved her hand up and down my cock. She then stopped to give Erin a turn and then they both alternated strokes. They kept getting faster and faster, perfectly alternating. My wife continued to tease in a breathy tone, ""Are you going to cum for us? Are you going to let Erin watch you cum?"" Erin smiled at me and looked me in the eyes. She pursed her lips and made a kissing motion toward me and my cock started pulsating and shooting cum. It was under water, so the girls couldn't see, but they knew I was having an amazing orgasm. I was moaning loudly as Erin moved her hand away but my wife continued to stroke me relentlessly. My moaning turned to shouting as I begged for my wife to stop. My penis was entirely too sensitive and she was mercilessly playing with it, the two of them laughing at my reaction. I finally had to forcefully remove my wife's hand. I was spent. 


After I had cum, the two of them took their bikinis off. I instantly regretted shooting my load so early as I intently stared at their naked bodies. I wanted nothing more than to get hard again right then and there.  i wondered if they had purposely made me cum before they got naked-- thinking that I wouldnt be as aroused at their state of undress. Taming the beast, so to speak. It didnt work. As they tossed their bikinis off to the side and sat down again, enjoying the feel of the hot jets on their naked bodies, I was instantly horny again. Every chance i got, i stole glances at Erin's body and imagined plunging my dick inside of her. i was aching for the chance to fuck her.


After a few more minutes in the tub, we decided to take a break from it. We all scurried inside, dripping naked and toweled off. We put on our robes and sat in front of the fireplace to get warm. i had the fire going earlier, but it had died down to embers so i added some more wood to get it blazing again. Erin was curled up in a chair closest to the fire and I joined my wife on the couch. I was still turned on from the hot tub and as she leaned into me, i softly kissed her on the forehead and then her cheek, and then we locked lips. We kissed for a few minutes when Erin announced that she was going to take a nap. I watched as she turned away from us, her robe riding up and revealing her long sexy legs up to her mid thighs. 


Sharon and I began kissing more passionately and my hands slipped under her robe to caress her breasts. My mouth moved to her neck and I breathlessly kissed it while my fingers circled her nipples. Her hands found their way to my chest and she ran her fingers through my chest hair, softly moaning from my touches and kisses. My hands moved down to her hips, her robe wide open now exposing all of her glorious nakedness. We locked lips again, furiously kissing, both of us extremely turned on. Her hand grasped one of mine and moved it to her crotch, signaling that she wanted me to rub her wet pussy. I resisted, making her wait and teased her inner thigh instead. I firmly squeezed it, our lips still locked and i could hear her softly moan in approval. I let my fingers inch closer to her moistening pussy while my mouth moved to her nipples. I let my tongue dance around them, lightly touching them before I closed my lips around them and sucked them gently. My fingers now easing up and down her wet pussy, I sucked harder on her nipples. She reached down for my hard cock and whispered for me to fuck her. I had forgotten all about Erin just a few feet away, her back to us, as she lay in front of the crackling fire. My wife whispered again, loude, that she wanted to fuck, her hand still wrapped around my engorged cock. ""Fuck me now"" she said, not bothering to whisper this time. When i asked her if she wanted to go into the bedroom, she let her robe drop to the floor and pushed me down onto my back on the couch. Her naked body straddled mine and she lowered herself onto my cock. I could see Erin perfectly just to the left of my wife and I wondered if she was asleep. My wife didn't seem to care as she slowly let my cock slide in and out of her, gasping with pleasure.


While she rode me, i reached up and pulled her closer so I could suck on her tits. Her hair cascaded around me as i moved in on her breasts and sucked them longingly. This was her favorite position for orgasming and I could tell she was getting close as she amped up the intensity with which she rode my cock. I did my best to stave off my own orgasm and lift my hips up into her to prevent my cock from accidentally sliding out. I didnt want anything to interrupt our rhythm and ruin her enjoyment. i was close to cumming and luckily i could tell that she was too. She was being loud. Much louder than usual, it seemed. I dont know if she was playing it up for Erin, or if fucking in the open, so close to her best friend, was making it that much more exciting for her. She was practically screaming now, and shuddering with orgasm. i was cumming too, shooting it up inside her, while stifling my own moans and grunts. I could feel my cock still jolting inside her as she collapsed onto me, smiling with tears of joy forming in her eyes. ""I love you"" she mouthed. My cock still inside her, growing soft, covered with her juices and my sticky cum. After a few minutes of gazing lovingly at each other, my wife nodded her head toward Erin and softly whispered to me ""Is she awake?"". 


We both turned to look at her and as if on queue, she turned toward us and playfully complained, ""are you guys done yet? Damn you're being so loud. Can't a girl take a nap!""


I just laughed sheepishly and my wife responded ""All done! You can nap now, we won't bug you anymore!"" My wife hadn't moved. She was still atop of me, on her knees with her legs straddling my hips. Her ass and pussy were fully exposed to Erin with my soft dick still barely inside. I was very conscious of all this and it thrilled me knowing that Erin not only heard us making love, but that she was looking at us now-- at our most intimate and vulnerable. Naked and exposed.


Erin stood up, her robe opening and she let it fall to the floor. ""Well, I'm awake now. I might as well hit the hot tub again. Who's joining me?""


I waited for my wife to respond affirmatively before I agreed and the three of us dashed naked across the back deck through the freezing temperatures and into the comfort of the hot tub. I was becoming more comfortable being casually naked in front of Erin and I wondered if I would ever put my clothes back on this weekend. Seeing Erin naked was still an extreme turn on, though, but I wasn't sure if I would be able to get it up again that night. I wasn't getting any younger and twice in one night was usually my max. Unless I masturbated. It seemed I could always have one more orgasm from masturbating no matter how many times I'd already came that day. I seriously contemplated studying Erin's exposed breasts and excusing myself for the bathroom with the image seared into my brain and then quickly jerking off to it. Before I could excuse myself, my wife announced that she had to pee and then she stood up, water dripping from her naked body and tiptoed barefoot across the deck and back into the house. I was alone with Erin. The two of us naked. I suddenly felt very aware.


""You've been very adventurous tonight."" Erin blurted out as she pointed to my swimming trunks still lying in the white snow a good thirty feet away.


""Yeah, it's been fun."" I paused. ""I'm still really sorry about John though. It sucks about you two breaking up. Him not being here."" I felt like an idiot. I didn't know what to say.


""Please,"" she smiled, ""No more talk about that. I just want to take my mind off of him this weekend. I do miss his dick, though. I was hoping we would at least have some great sex this weekend. He has a nice dick. Huge. Some nights it was just nice to have that dick inside of me even though I knew I didn't love him anymore."" She stopped. ""Oh, god....I think I'm embarrassing you!""


My face must have been visibly red. ""No,"" I lied, ""I don't mind."" She just giggled and then we sat quietly for a couple minutes until my wife came back out.


""I was embarrassing your husband talking about John's dick"" Erin told her as she lowered herself into the tub right next to her, and across from me.


""Oh, he has a great dick"" my wife said.


""What?"" I replied, dumbfounded.


They both laughed. ""She showed me pictures. It's big. Huge and thick. Sorry honey, you have a cute dick and I love it-- but he has at least two inches on you.""


Erin nodded. ""Yeah, we've compared pictures of you two and we think it's about two inches difference.""


""You've seen pictures of mine?"" I was stunned.


""Of course."" my wife responded as she laughed. ""It was for science. We were comparing dicks."" They laughed again. I know I am exactly 6 inches long and that meant that John was at least 8, if their crude science was correct. I knew I was a little on the small side, but I felt even smaller right then. I was suddenly very glad that John and Erin were getting divorced. I would hate knowing that she was getting pounded with 8 hard inches while my wife had to settle for mine. They must have known that I was pondering about it because my wife reached her foot out onto my crotch and playfully rubbed my package from side to side.


""Oh, honey, you know you're the perfect size for me!"" she said in a slightly condescending baby-talk voice. It did make me feel a little better though.


""At least you have a dick to play with this weekend,"" Erin frowned and feigned sadness. ""I'll be playing with my vibrator in bed tonite...all by my lonesome.""


""Oh honey"", Sharon hugged her. Then she joked, ""Do you want me to come join you and keep you company?""


""Yes."" Erin deadpanned. ""I want you to put a vibrator in my ass, and two in my pussy, while i rub a vibrator on my tits and you sing me a lullaby to sleep."" They both laughed and hugged each other.


""What about Joe"" my wife said, continuing the bit. ""Do you want him to help too?""


""Yes. I want him to rub my feet. With his dick."" She could barely finish as they both started laughing again. ""And then I want him to cum in my hair. So i don't need any conditioner in the morning."" I was amused, but also slightly annoyed. Why couldn't my dick be up her ass instead of the vibrator?


""You certainly brought enough toys"" my wife said, after wiping the tears of laughter from her eyes. 


""Oh god."" Erin replied ""I never know what I'll be in the mood for. I brought my vibrators, my handcuffs, my butt plugs, my strap on...""


""Strap on!"" my wife exclaimed. ""I must have missed that one while you were packing.""


""Oh i brought it. For sure. I was hoping to fuck John in that gorgeous ass of his one last time."" They both laughed again and my wife clapped her hands a couple times. I was glad that I wasn't the only guy who enjoyed some ass-play. I've never actually been fucked with a strap-on, though, but the idea of it intrigued me.


""I guess i will have to just use Joe's ass"" Erin said as she looked at me, as if she was reading my mind.


Sharon was having fun with this now. ""Oh he's never had a strap-on up his butt. Just a little finger. You might have to wait till he's asleep. Or maybe we'll slip something in his drink? Then we'll take turns."" They both laughed again, obviously a little drunk and far too relaxed.


""Poor Joe"", Erin said. ""Stuck here with us two crazy bitches. We're going to wake up tomorrow and his car will be gone!"" More laughter.


I needed a drink. ""I'm going to make myself a drink"" I announced. ""You two are cut off, though.""  I stepped out of the hot tub and Erin did the same.


""Oh, I'll come too. I need to make my special martini for me and Sharon. And i have to go pee!""


We both entered the cabin. Even though it was very warm inside, our naked bodies were shivering. For a second while we were toweling off I thought about hugging her for warmth and she was standing so close and facing me that I thought she might actually do it too. We didnt though and she walked off with the towel around her waist toward the bathroom. I decided to forgo the towel and walked naked to the bar, still shivering slightly. I filled a glass with ice and bourbon and topped it off with a little bit of club soda. The buzz from the wine had worn off and wanted it back as soon as possible. i took a sip and wondered if i should wait for Erin when she finally came out of the bathroom. She headed straight for me and without comment dropped a small blue pill into my drink. I knew exactly what it was. John was in his fifties and this had to be his viagra. 


""Drink up"" Erin said. ""I want to play."" She let her towel drop to the floor letting me get a great look at her stunning body.

43ffn0,17,2016-01-30,"Me [21M] and my girlfriend [22F], both engineering students, keep fighting over time together",damakameleon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43ffn0/me_21m_and_my_girlfriend_22f_both_engineering/,"Me and my girlfriend have been together just over a year. We're both in our **second year of engineering** at a top ten uni and we have the same career plans. We met during our first year, started off as a hookup, and slowly fell into something more.

**I'm not much of an emotional guy** and I don't live having my private life spread out everywhere. I know reddit will hate me for this, but I'm sort of a lad. I'm not disrespectful or violent or anything, but I like going out and drinking and hanging with the guys. That kind of thing. I tend to keep the emotional stuff under wraps.

**I love my girlfriend**. She's adorable, and sweet, and gorgeous. Sexy as hell and great in bed. She does well in school and constantly surprises me with how much she knows. She's sort of weird (I say this with affection)––she has unorthodox political views, is an atheist from a moderately religious family, and works for a human rights charity. I like to tease her a lot; that's just my sense of humour (and I do it to everyone not just her, lol). Winding her up is cute.

She's kind of a hopeless romantic. She loves the emotional stuff; she's written me love letters and things like that. Example: for our anniversary I wrote her a card filled with all our inside jokes while she cried while writing mine. I wouldn't call her clingy per se but she really likes to spend time together, and she's really physically affectionate in private. She's got her own life and isn't super clingy or anything, but she does tend to overanalyse imo

Here's our problem. I have ADD. I'm shit at managing my time. I both overly fixate on tasks (and shut everything else out) while procrastinating a shit ton. This means I'm usually in the library until 3 or 4 AM working. I do pretty well in school, but I admittedly can be self-centred. **But I absolutely 100% refuse to compromise on my schoolwork, because this is imperative to my career.**

This wasn't so bad during our first year, because I barely did any work (the year didn't really count). **We used to spend nearly every night together.** We fell really hard in love and she's the first girl I've ever had feelings for. All cringe aside, I really thought we had a future.

**Summer**: After first year of uni, we went back home for summer (we're from the same town). She got back a week earlier than I did. The first weeks I was home I spent with my family and friends since I hadn't seen them in ages. We chatted every day for a bit and she seemed fine. After a while she started to get really passive aggressive and I asked her what was wrong. She said it was ridiculous that we were in the same city and I hadn't seen her yet. I told her I'd seen her all year and I was currently chauffeuring my mum to and from work because she'd broken her ankle. She still seemed upset and I did see her after a while, but the same issue kept popping up. I'd go 5-6 days without seeing her and she'd get mad at me again. It was honestly exhausting. I then got really sick (like in hospital kind of sick) and then immediately left for a summer study abroad so we didn't really see each other that summer.

**First term of second year**: I went back to uni to move into a flat with some of my friends. She came back after summer and stayed with me for two weeks while she sorted out her accommodation with her friends. (Side note: her friends are kind of psycho. Like they drink a bottle of wine each a night and always seem to have some sort of emotional problem. They're nice girls and my girlfriend loves them, but even she recognises they don't have the healthiest relationships.) We were pretty happy and seemed to be repairing our relationship.

Term started and this year is really serious and important for our degree. I used to go out a shit ton during first year, now I barely go out once a month. I'm always in the library working and if not I'm trying to get some rest. During first term my girlfriend was kind of in denial about the fact that we had more work. She'd constantly procrastinate, drank a lot, stuff like that. She got really unhappy about the fact that I couldn't see her as much and said I wasn't prioritising her; I told her I refused to compromise on school. She tried setting up a weekly date night but that doesn't work for me because my workload is variable throughout the week. I now see her on average once a week. Things really weren't going well with us. She says since I've been so stressed out I've been constantly criticising her (I think it's just teasing/I'm looking out for her best interests) and ignoring her needs (but I refuse to compromise on work). We keep fighting about this.

**Now**: Over winter break this all came to a head. We were back home for two weeks (her for three) and I was busy with internships and seeing family. She blew up at me midway through my second week after Christmas because she hadn't seen me. I was so sick of the constant fighting that I told her we really needed to get our shit together over the second term or break up before exams because I don't want this distraction of fighting while I'm trying to study.

Now we've been back home and my girlfriend actually seems to have gotten her shit together, sort of. She's really working hard with school and her career, she goes to the library with me now sometimes, and she's gotten a job. We've made a little bit of progress. But we've got a load of deadlines this week for various career-related things and I've been drowning in work. We spent last weekend going out with my friends, but I knew I had to work come Monday. She messaged me on Wednesday to ask if I'd planned a date night this week and I'd snapped at her because I was annoyed she didn't realise I was busy. We then fought about this AGAIN and I told her I just couldn't see her this week and I'd plan something with her next Monday. I think she's just insecure from how badly things went last term and is scared but she keeps saying she wants 'stability' and for me to 'be considerate of her time since we have the same schedules and goals'.

We're compatible in most ways and I love her I just don't want this fucking fighting anymore. Tbf we only really ever argue about this one thing. She doesn't understand that with my ADD I really need a lot of time to process information while I'm studying and that I'm busy.

**TL;DR: Me and my girlfriend have recurrent issues over our schedules and I'm looking for an outsider's POV.**

43fock,3,2016-01-30,Should I [24F] continue with this relationship with a post-doc [32M] from my university?,EdithClarke,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43fock/should_i_24f_continue_with_this_relationship_with/,"We’ve been dating for over a month in a pretty regular way, we’ve had easily about 20 dates (coffee, dinners, lunches, movies, opera/philharmonic, shots, NYE at my friends’ party, this kind of stuff). I’m 24 and he’s 32, and while I don’t consider this a problematic age difference (I’ve always had a thing for older guys, but it had always been in a purely platonic way), I do realize it may not be looked at well and am actually a bit self-conscious about it. Rarely, but it happens. 

A little background. Since he is a post-doc at my university, we’ve “known” each other for quite some time – I had classes with him last year. Besides, it’s a small department in a technical field (electrical engineering), so basically everybody knows each other. In real life I’m a very shy and reserved person who has a lot of trouble talking to people I do not know very well, let alone any kind of flirting, but at uni it’s a whole another story – I frequently joke with professors and I feel I’m well liked, especially since I’m one of the best students. 

However, even though I always found him quite attractive, intelligent, a good young scientist in a field which I’m entering as an engineer, I never dared to openly flirt with him. I think I, weirdly, found him too young for me to do that. When I talk to people who are 40 or older in slightly flirty way, I feel kinda safe, like it feels completely casual. With younger people – it makes me feel extremely inappropriate. I know it’s kind of fucked up, but that’s the way I feel. However, since I knew he likes to read and listens to lots of classical music (it often played in his office), I found him the more attractive, but never did anything about it.

Fast forward to the end of November, my last class with him was finished and I went to collect the final grade on my project. I got my A, and as I was leaving his office I noticed a Brahms CD on his desk so I briefly remarked on how I love this piece. We chatted for a moment about it and I left. Later that evening I got an email from him with a link to another Brahms piece that he particularly loves. This quickly turned into very long and detailed email conversation about music, books, movies and other things that we found we also have in common. After approximately two weeks, when I admitted I don’t go to opera or philharmonic, he asked me to go with him. The invitation followed my joking remark on how I saw him walking without a coat on campus when it was freezing cold. Mind that we were still on the Mr/Miss basis. I was very confused as to what to do with this invitation, but finally decided, why the hell not, especially since it all felt completely noncommittal. 

The evening was really nice, but it was still very formal, but then he suggested for us to use our first names (it’s not common in my culture, especially when there is age and/or professional position difference between two people), invited me for coffee, then I invited him… And so now we’re officially dating. Well, officially in that we know about it, my best friend knows about it and some of his friends know too. The problem is, most of my friends are from my university and know him – either have had classes with him or from just passing by. Many of his friends are his co-workers, which makes them my former and/or future teachers. There are no official anti-fraternizing laws at my uni and at other universities in my country. In “older generations”, that is the professors, the marriages between faculty are not uncommon. Even in younger, as two post-docs being in a relationship – it doesn’t raise any eyebrows really.

Still, I don’t feel this would look well if anybody related to my department found out. The situation is even more difficult since his PhD supervisor and the chair of his faculty is now my thesis advisor who I think will be luring me to start a PhD in the future too. We’re not trying very hard to keep a secret, we go out like any other couple would, I guess we’ve just been lucky enough to not meet anybody who’d gossip. Sill, I find this a bit restrictive. I can manage, because I really really like him – we have pretty similar tastes, we can talk for hours, and he’s generally a very open minded person.

We agree that we should avoid at all costs any possible conflicts of interest – I won’t sign up for his classes and he won’t be in my thesis defense committee. Still, I don’t want this all to make me look like I’m doing it to make my life at uni easier – I’m a straight-A's kind of student as it is. I also realize that this relationship may jeopardize my future plans, if I decide to go through with a PhD (which I don’t think I’m going to since I don’t feel I’m up to it, but who knows) – if we break up, it would be a shitty situation, and if we don’t… well, here come the questions about conflict of interests and nepotism again.

Also, a couple months ago I got the chance to go to a better university in another part of the country for a semester-long stipend. This means that in a couple of weeks, for the next 5 months I’ll be 500 km away. We’ve talked about it and he says he wouldn’t want to interfere with my plans and wants only my happiness, but it certainly isn’t the perfect situation for us. I know 500 km doesn’t mean “the opposite side of the globe”, but it’s a long way anyway. He’s working most of the weekends, I’ll have lots of classes-related work so we’ll be able to see each other maybe every 2-3 weeks tops. Now we’re seeing each other almost every day, even if it’s just for a quick walk. 

I don’t really believe LDRs can work out for extended periods of time. Maybe if the couple has been together for quite a substantial time, and then there comes the ‘long distance’ part, then yes, but in a case like this… I don’t know. I also am contemplating the thought of staying in that another city for good – there’s way better professional opportunities there and the city’s much nicer too. That would certainly mean the end of our relationship – in here, when you get a PhD, you usually stay at your university for the rest of your career. There is very little opportunity to get a job at another uni, everybody prefers their own “breed”. There is also a very slight chance of getting a job that matches their qualifications in the industry for someone with a PhD. So I don’t think he would consider moving to be with me. The job market where I live is pretty harsh, there’s virtually no high-tech industry, so the most viable chance of professional development in my field would indeed be staying in academia. I’m very ambitious and wouldn’t settle for just any job that pays the bills.

Then there’s the “intimacy” problem. I seem to be initiating most of the physical side of our relationship. I’m not experienced myself, had sex with one person (yes). It was with a guy who (then) was really great and we got along truly well, we were on an internship together in a different city which got us really close (heh). The problem was, he had (and still has, from what I know) a girlfriend, on whom he cheated with me. I felt horrible about that for a long time, especially that I couldn’t get him out of my head for some time. Before that, I’d call us almost-friends, now we’re colleagues, we still like to talk, but it’s not the same. 
I haven’t been in any LTR. My dating record is pretty lousy, I think I have something about me that screams I’m uptight and not approachable. I like to believe I’m okay if you get to know me better. I have a sharp sense of humor (maybe sort of manly, which may be off-putting to some but attractive to others), I’m skinny and tall with long hair and nice smile, I dress womanly in skirts and dresses. I’d say I’m probably 6/10. And – I have a pretty large libido, I believe higher than average. 

With him, we’ve been french kissing pretty soon into our dating, but that was it. Once I made him go to drinks with me (he’s not much of a drinker – me neither, but I like to go have fun once in a while), after which things got somewhat heated in that his hand landed on my breasts and mine ventured close to his package. Then we’ve returned to only kissing, couple dates later my palm landed on his crotch again, but he wouldn’t go anywhere past my panty line, so I didn’t dare go any further either. Recently, I put his hand on my ass and he seemed to like it, rolled up my dress and groped me through my tights. And that’s that. He doesn’t show any intention of going further. I like to be a bit provocative in my talking, sending a little naughty texts and stuff - he doesn't engage in it.

May a man in his 30s be so shy with women? Or am I blowing things out of proportion? I’d much prefer he’d be more dominant – I’m generally a very independent person, but in a relationship, especially the physical side, I’d prefer the man to be the more decisive. How should I approach this subject with him? Or should I just cut it off and try to find my luck in the new city? I love talking with him about concerts and books, I love hanging out with him, but without much progress on the physical side, it starts to feel like a friendship, not a relationship. Or maybe I want to go too fast?

   
**TL;DR**: Been dating an 8 years older guy who is a post-doc at my university (no classes together) for about 1.5 month. Soon I’m leaving for at least 5 months to another uni for a stipend (500 km away) and generally don’t believe in LDRs. Besides our libidos don’t seem to match. Should I break up with him before I leave?"
43fvwn,16,2016-01-30,"Me [22 M] with my girlfriend [23 F] of a little over one year, one year of hell in our lives has left me emotionally numb and disconnected, she wants more from our relationship, I think I want my freedom back, what should I do?",throwawayabreakup,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43fvwn/me_22_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_a_little_over/,"So, here's the story.

We started dating in December of 2014 when we met as undergrads. I would identify both of us as academically motivated, and we were in the upper tier of our respective majors. We were both seniors at the time, but I had been planning on taking an additional year of classes to prepare for graduate school while she was in the process of applying with the relationship really took flight. Our relationship hit the usual rocky spots about a month or two out (this would be during the spring semester), but we worked through them and everything seemed okay. 


The spring semester was extremely difficult due to external circumstances: she was writing her senior thesis, and I was involved in some of the core classes of my major and needed to put in loads of time to do well. As such, it felt as if we were more like ""stress buddies"" instead of two romantically involved people. During spring break of the semester, we had a pregnancy scare. This really scare really messed with me, and I've had trouble being physical in our relationship ever since because of it. We attempted to talk about it the best we could, but the semester was moving too fast for us to really take time to slow down or seek professional help. 


As graduation approached, her senior thesis was turned in basically a couple of hours before she walked (huge stress amount of stress for us). In addition, her family came in to help her pack up for graduation, and she pushed me to the sideline because she didn't know how to integrate me into actually helping. I felt that most of her family was critical of the way I was helping because I wasn't part of their ""plan"". I resolved to do what I could, but it was difficult regardless. After talking about it later, she said she didn't mean for any of that to happen, and said that's just her family. Graduation came and went, and I was headed off to my summer internship while she headed home for the summer. She had been admitted to only one of all the graduate schools she applied to with funding as a late admission (this also added to the stress of the semester), and was preparing to leave in August. The graduate school was across the country, and she was confident we could pull off long distance while I stayed and finished my undergrad and she began graduate school.


I moved off to my summer internship, but unfortunately it was in a very barren part of the country. It was at least an hour drive to any sort of entertainment, and I was attempting to save money. I tried to stay in as much as I could, but it certainly didn't help my mental state during this time. All of the stress of the previous semester had begun to catch up with me, and I suspected I was falling into a sort of depression. No one in my life had ever dealt with anything similar, and so I assumed it was my problem to handle alone. She would ask how I was doing, but when I explained I didn't really feel happy or much of anything, she would get frustrated about me not trying. 


About the middle of summer, I decided to break up with her and attempt to get my head in the right place. Since we were doing long distance for the summer, it was a pretty awful setup. I definitely did feel like I recovered over the next month, but I had some terrible guilt for breaking up with her. I felt like I had a responsibility to her for some reason. The internship certainly didn't help as I was doing some work I really did not feel prepared for, but I put in the same amount of work I had been doing in the semester and by the end I felt at least somewhat confident. 


She had a trip to Mexico planned with friends from her church in which she would not have any communication essentially with the outside world. A few days before then, we began talking again and, with my mind recovering, I felt confident in giving the relationship another try. We decided I would pick her up from the airport when she got back to the states after her trip. 


I picked her up from her trip, but it took a while before we could really connect again. We really tried, but she had to leave for the drive across the country to her graduate school only two days after returning from her trip. I was not planned to go with her as her family was driving her out, and I had academic material to present at a conference on the other side of the country. As such, we began the second leg of our long distance saga.


Between presentations at my conference, I would call her and talk about what we wanted from our relationship this time. We attempted to be more intentional about everything, but her trip to Mexico had really numbed her to a lot of stuff because of the experiences she had there. She was emotionally available anymore. I had spent the time she was in Mexico (when I couldn't talk to her) thinking through what I wanted from the relationship and really becoming excited about our potential future together. It felt like my enthusiasm was met with a blank face from her because she was getting so involved in her graduate school and was just emotionally switched off.


During the couple of weeks before her school actually started, she obsessed about making a good impression on her graduate school class that I felt as if she was almost flirting with the guys in order to get accepted. It was difficult for me and I became frustrated as I felt she was saying her priorities were one way, but acted differently. 


Once school started, she found out she was very under-prepared for her program. She struggled each and every day, and the stress placed upon her to perform eventually started to take away her mental health. After performing very terribly on a midterm exam, she texted many of her friends from undergrad asking for advice as they were also in graduate school. They basically told her to keep trying, so she did. Her professor suggested she see a counselor for test anxiety, but she ended up seeing a counselor regularly. Her mental health at least stabilized enough to get her through to the end of the semester.


I was scheduled to fly out to her once her semester had ended completely, and I did. When I saw her, I could tell she was very emotionally numb. It was hard for our seemingly fledgling relationship already. I began asking very pointed questions on if she was actually ready for this graduate school experience. (Internally, I questioned whether it was possible for me to handle going through another semester with her several thousands of miles away and hearing about all of this stress secondhand.)


She eventually decided she wanted to head back to the town our undergrad university was (where I still am) so she could work and figure stuff out. So, we packed a U haul and drove back across the country and she stayed at my apartment until she found her own place (I live with three other guys in undergrad). She found a job, and her life has become a lot more stable and given her time to really think. However, my school has really picked up its pace for me in the last semester as I'm now writing my senior thesis and taking some of the hardest classes I can. My campus job financial aid has been cut in half, and my car has broken down all in the last week. I'm relying on her for her vehicle right now.


She doesn't know what she wants to do, and she doesn't really have a plan. I'm waiting to hear back from graduate schools this semester, but I am also not really that thrilled about it either. I altered the graduate schools I applied to for our relationship, but I feel some regret for not simply picking the ones I wanted to go to. I certainly see the benefits of some of these schools independent of her, but I feel I have a lot more potential. She is ""all in"" on the relationship now, but I'm burnt out from this roller coaster ride of a year that I don't really know how to deal. I'm not even sure if I want the relationship anymore, but I don't know how to say something like that to her after a year of hell for her. I daydream about being single again, so I could really apply myself to my future grad studies and have some freedom which I long for again, but I feel selfish in doing so. Since we've gotten back in town, I sought out a counselor on my university's campus, and I'm trying to work through some of the crap that's happened this past year. I feel pressure from her to move the relationship forward, but it feels like she's almost overly attached at this point. 


I honestly don't even know what questions to ask myself or deal with the situation. She's a good friend and supportive, but I don't feel as if I can see myself in a long term relationship with her anymore. I feel like I need time to really reinvent myself, but I feel like I will forever regret leaving the relationship. My graduation is coming up soon, and I feel like my life is a train wreck waiting to happen, so I'm trying to be proactive about it, but I really don't even know where to start with everything going on. Most importantly, how do I deal with the crippling guilt which would potential come if I did end things?


Reddit, any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

   
**tl;dr**: We've been dating for a year, and it has been a hell year involving me having mild depression, at least 6 months of a long distance relationship, pregnancy scares which have screwed with my head, and I feel like I'm clueless on what to do. She wants more from our relationship now that things are calmed down for her, but I want freedom back as I feel buried under stress and want to actually enjoy stuff again.

*also I'm currently seeing a therapist, so no need to suggest that* 


Sorry, but this is basically going to be stream of conscious writing for me. 

I'm 23, I graduated with my degree in May 2015. Right now I've applied to grad school for Fall 2016, just waiting to hear what goes on with that. I'm not even sure if I want to go to graduate school, it just kinda feels like what I'm supposed to do next. 

After graduating I lived at home for 3 months, then went out of state for an internship. It was incredible, exactly what I want to do professionally and I loved the work and everyone I worked with, but sadly it was unpaid and I couldn't stay there forever. Before leaving, I spoke with staff about coming back out to volunteer (it's a non-profit). My plan was to go back out, find a part-time job and then volunteer in my spare time. 

Since I've come home, it's all I've been able to think about. I felt more like myself during that internship than I ever have, I was happy, my anxiety was at an all-time low. The other volunteers and staff were wonderful, I came to think of them like family and since I've left we've kept in touch, they keep asking when I'll be coming back. I've been working while at home, trying to save up enough money to get myself settled with a car and such. I have a housing situation for moving out there, I'll be renting a room in a house with two other volunteers. If things go as planned, I'll be moving in three weeks. 

But I'm having such insane anxiety and guilt over this. My sister still lives at home, she's a year older than me. Financially she can't afford to get a place with her LT bf just yet, and I know she hates living at home. I feel so guilty about leaving her. I've talked to her about it, and she's told me not to worry about her, she wants me to move out and go back to volunteering because she knows how much I loved where I was. 

But I feel selfish, like why should I get to go do what I want to do when she can't? I also feel guilty about leaving home. I feel like I shouldn't leave my family. It's not one of those situations where someone is sickly and they need my help for care/bills, it's just I feel bad for wanting to leave. My parents are divorced, I spend a few weeks with one parent and then go see the other parent.  I get along with my mom for the most part, she's very conservative whereas I'm not so we butt heads occasionally but it's nothing terrible. My dad...I love him, but things are always tense in that house because of my stepmom. She makes living at my dad's house uncomfortable and border line unbearable. I don't want to not see my dad, but she is manipulative enough that if I moved in completely with my mom, she would turn my dad against me for it. Historically I've tried to just keep my head down, but nothing I do is right in her eyes and she'll complain to my dad, who then confronts me about whatever I did wrong. She freezes me and my siblings out, like we'll go somewhere as a family and she inevitably makes it about her &amp; my dad, and then the rest of us feel like a third wheel. More recently I've been standing up for myself but it's just not even worth it most of the time. I've tried talking to my dad about this stuff and sometimes he sticks up for us, other times he doesn't. And I know she makes his life difficult if he does stand up for us. 

I just want to move out and be my own person. I'm terrified to do it because it'll be far from home and I'm afraid of failing. And I always read things on Reddit about ""love your parents, you'll be sorry when they're gone and you didn't spend more time with them"" but at what point am I supposed to let that go and start living my own life? I'm feeling afraid and guilty about leaving home. I don't even know what I want people to say in response to this, I guess I just need to vent. 

I should also add that the field of work I want to do, there's really not any opportunities within a few hours of where I live (sounds weird, but it's animal related, which narrows everything). So it wouldn't help me professionally to just move out but still live close to my family. The only thing making me feel better about moving, is knowing I already have a support system where I'll be living. "

43g3ix,8,2016-01-30,How to take responsibility for yourself?,agent_skullz,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/43g3ix/how_to_take_responsibility_for_yourself/,"So, ever since I was a kid my Nparents made me distrustful of everyone, and framed my world so that I believed everyone has some ulterior motive and is only out to get you. I was purposefully isolated, not allowed to have many friends, and encouraged to break off friendships for stupid things because that just proved ""no one loves you like I do"" etc.

Now I'm 28, I have massive anxiety issues that I'm working very steadily at getting over and I *am* getting better. But the problem is I have no idea how to network, how to find social groups, etc. A lot of things I wanted to do as a kid you kind of would have to have started way before you're 28 (like acting, singing, generally artistic careers) but I was never allowed to do them because they were ""useless"" or ""you'll never make it at that; you need a job that makes money."" So I got a Master's in Information Science (note: as a girl, I was discouraged from *hard* sciences, which actually *would* be lucrative) only I wasn't allowed to take internships because ""you need a job that pays! Not this working-for-free shit!"" and/or they were ""too far away, do you want to go that far away from me?"" It's taken me far *far* too long to get enough experience to even qualify for entry level jobs, but now I've run into the problem of having *no clue* how to network and feeling bad that *I* have ulterior motives in talking to people just because I want a job etc.

Okay, so my question is: at what point do you stop being bitter and blaming your parents for the shit they did to you that's still effecting you and just take responsibility for yourself? I feel like at 28 it's self-indulgent to just sit here moaning about how wrongly I was raised and that's why I have so much trouble with life, but their behavior still has real repercussions in my life *now*. I want to take responsibility for myself and just cast off their bullshit with my best ""fuck 'em"" attitude, but at the same time I have absolutely no clue where to start because I wasn't even given basic socialization tools. It's like an endless cycle of making excuses and feeling guilty about making those excuses instead of going for whatever it is I want. Where does it end?

(Note: I am 2000 miles away from my parents right now and they can't do shit about it and have no say in what I do with my life at the moment. It's basically me fighting the voices they put in my head.)"
43g9od,3,2016-01-30,Personal Statements ... and Repressed Memories Brought to Mind,Forgotten_Remembered,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/43g9od/personal_statements_and_repressed_memories/,"I was writing about my reason for pursuit of higher education in a personal statement... and before I knew it, I began writing about my I pursued education not just because of some love for education, but as an escape from the raging tyrant that was my mother. 

I remember when I was still young and loved my mother like the innocent child I was. I remember when I used to hug her before going off to school, and ask for kisses on the cheek. But that was too long ago. 

As I grew up, my mother, who appeared so kind and loving shape-shifted into a a raging tyrant, a dictator. One moment, she was the mother who was so proud of her little boy, doing so well in school. The next, she was the dictator who screamed profanities, demanding to know why I wasn't constantly studying. The coat hangers, sticks, thin materials she could get on hand, and open fists of a terrifying God were what filled my worries at home after elementary school. 

As, I grew up, disillusioned by a wrathful God, who rapidly alternated from ""love"" to vile hatred for the ingrateful, worthless sack of shit that she birthed; I rebelled. I no longer stood up for the physical abuse, and put a stop to it myself. 

But that's when she switched to an even more insiduous strategy of guilt and shame. Now, it was no longer the pain from the marks left behind on my skin that bothered me, but the stabs in my heart and consciousness... when I questioned why I was born, I was such a horrible child, why I was so grateful, why I did not know how to love my mother, and why I was even having all these thoughts about her.... and the only way I could get away from all that was to go to school.

School was where I could be the star child I wanted to be, with my teacher as my substitute mother and father... to praise me for being a  good boy, to praise me and love me like I wish I could be loved. Yes, I went to school because I enjoyed the intellectual stimulation and the fun, play times with school friends. Yet, in reality, I went to school because it was the only time where I felt worthy to be alive, where I felt I was a capable human being. 

Now, in college, I struggle with school; I struggle with learning to trust and learning to be social with others. Yet, I slowly work through them. Since to college, I've made enormous strides in being social.... going up to people I didn't know, introducing myself... letting my close friends know about my deep dark secrets, taking control of my own life with journaling and taking the initiative to go to the college-provided therapy... I'm going to be joining the group sessions soon. And I am in the process of applying for summer internships. I've been making changes to my life, that i have never been able to do before. And I'm so grateful to have had the opportunities, mentorships, and connections with father-figures that have helped me to grow and become a more capable adult.

I know that my mother is not the evil person I irrationally think of her as. She has her own story, her own struggles, and her own fears. She is a human being, and I know that she has done her best to love me and care for me, and she has made many mistakes because she is human. I know that, and yet I still must face my inner wraiths. The inner wounds periodically open up like earlier in my post when I consider the reasons for why I have made my choices... but these are the problems that have shown themselves to me, to confront and change, so that I can learn to love my mother again. And to learn to love others and be a human again. 

.....

Meta-commentary/Summary: When I was originally writing this post, it was motivated by a set of past memories that resurfaced as I was writing about my personal background. The emotions overtook me, and after writing them down, I realized that these issues had still been on my mind even after I have made tons of progress on my emotional health while in college. Regardless, I hope it shows that even though one has had a less-than-fortunate upbringing, one can still strive to come to terms with their upbringing and change for the better.  "

43gqcn,9,2016-01-30,"Meet the Brewer, special beer release night at Half Full. Introducing our first lagers &amp; a chat with the new Head of Brewery Operations. Wednesday 2/17",Holly_Tyler,ctbeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/ctbeer/comments/43gqcn/meet_the_brewer_special_beer_release_night_at/,"From the Half Full website:  



On Wednesday, 2/17, we will be holding our first Rare Beer Night of the year, a barrel-side chat about “Sensible Decisions” with Tom Price, our new Head of Brewery Operations. During the chat, Tom will take you through his beer journey and the sensible (and not so sensible) decisions he made along the way. Attendees will have the opportunity to ask Tom questions (and hear stories) about his journey (like the time he came up with a Game of Thrones-themed beer, “Winter is Coming”) and will get a first look at what he has planned for the upcoming year. To celebrate this occasion, Tom has brewed two limited release beers, Sensible Decision #1 (a hop-forward India Pale Lager) and Sensible Decision #2 (a 9% Baltic Porter). This Rare Beer Night will be the kick-off of these limited release beers; they will be released to the general public through 7 independent events out in the marketplace in the weeks that follow, so make sure to join us to try them first! We will also have two other small batch releases and will be serving meats from Fleishers Craft Butchery and cheeses from Greenwich Cheese Company. Tickets are $40, cover all beer and food during the event, and are limited to the first 40 purchasers. All beers released this evening will be available for purchase as Growlers and Crowlers to go at the end of the event.

The story behind Sensible Decisions #1 &amp; #2

While Tom Price, the new Head of Brewery Operations at Half Full, may seem like the kind of guy who makes sensible decisions, his track record is spotty at best. Taking Medieval Welsh instead of Spanish in college? Not sensible. Asking his parents for a camera instead of a bed after sleeping on an air mattress for six months? Also not sensible. Hanging upside down from the rafters by his feet? Definitely not sensible (ask his wife about that last one).

Jumping into the brewing industry, and many years later joining Half Full, were eminently sensible decisions, however. After graduating from Harvard with a degree in history and literature, Tom had originally set his heart on working in publishing as an editor. He did find work in publishing, but in a marketing role. After a couple of years spent editing brochures for use in various international markets, a career change seemed in order. Deciding he wanted to make something tangible, Tom narrowed the career paths down to making furniture, cheese… or beer. One unfortunate attempt at saag paneer aside, he had the most experience with brewing, having homebrewed several batches out of his Brooklyn apartment. A few months and a move to California later, Tom had talked his way into an internship at a brewpub in San Francisco. Sensible Decision #1 had been made.

Tom spent the next decade brewing professionally. After being promoted to assistant brewer at the San Francisco Brewing Co., Tom eventually moved on to a shift brewer position at Gordon Biersch. A few years later, he and his wife moved back east and he landed a job as a brewer at the Brooklyn Brewery in Williamsburg. Over the next nearly 7 years, Tom ascended the ranks from shift brewer to lab manager to QA/QC manager. However, with the birth of his daughter Penny, life in the Borough of Kings/Hipsters began to look less and less livable. When Half Full’s Chief Hoptimist, Conor Horrigan, reached out to Tom with an offer to become the new Head of Brewery Operations, he jumped at the chance: Sensible Decision #2.

In celebration of Tom’s new role, and with the hope of more sensible decisions to come, he and the brewing team at Half Full have come up with two special beers: Sensible Decision #1 and Sensible Decision #2. In a nod to Tom’s previous experience brewing a certain craft standby, both of these beers are something new to the Half Full portfolio: lagers.

Sensible Decision #1 is a hop-forward India Pale Lager. This style is a close cousin to the perennial craft brewery favorite India Pale Ale; however, the use of a clean-tasting strain of lager yeast instead of fruity ale yeast allows the blend of American hops used for dry hopping to really shine.

Sensible Decision #2 is a rich Baltic Porter. Unlike most porters, Baltic Porters are brewed with lager yeast. This beer is deep black, and clocks in at over 9% ABV—the perfect beer to warm you up on a wintery night.

43h3if,15,2016-01-30,"Me [24 M] with my girlfriend [22 F] of two years. She thinks our relationship is getting boring, but doesn't seem to want to do anything about it.",boredgfhelp,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43h3if/me_24_m_with_my_girlfriend_22_f_of_two_years_she/,"Hello people

So, I live in the same dorm as my girlfriend and this is also where we met for the first time. We share a kitchen a bathroom with 10 other people and in general spend a lot of time hanging out together or with our roommates.

We've been together for two years, and they have been great. We used to go out, visit museums, go to concerts and in general had a really good time. 

However, school and studies has put a damper on that the last six months or so. I'm in an internship where I have to get up at five in the morning to go to work and she is writing her master's degree. So obviously, time is limited - so we usually just spend time at home together.

However, over the last couple of months, my girlfriend has said that she is getting a bit bored in our relationship. In her words we ""just come home, eat dinner, watch tv and go to bed."" She wants excitement.

So, I offered that we could go out on weekends or go out for dinner on weekdays. She said okay but now, every time I suggest that ""hey, shouldn't we go to the skating range and grab a pizza on the way?"" or ""maybe we should go to Phil and Amy's place on tuesday?"" she just says no or that she's ""busy"".

So, in retaliation I suggested that maybe we just needed to spend some time away from each other. 

As we live together in the dorm, we've quickly grown accustomed to each other. We've never lived away from each other - and as such, I thought it would be healthy to spend time away from each other. I figured it would help make the time we spend together more exciting.

She said that she thought it was a good idea and now, I try to do things alone every second day or so - just for a few hours. I play video games, work out or go out with my friends. She usually spends her alone time studying or hanging out in our common kitchen.

But every time I say that ""I'm gonna play games for an hour"" or ""me and Neil are going out tonight"" she gets annoyed. She wants me to spend my time with her instead.

I've tried pointing this out to her, but she says that she is having trouble with her schedule and prioritizing what is important. I told her I'm in the same situation but try to aim for a good balance.

So, dear reddit - what am I to do here? 

Maybe I should point out that we are still very attracted and intimate with each other. We have sex almost every night and are still exploring each other sexually. The trouble isn't in the bedroom, but rather in our social relationship.

**tl;dr**: Girlfriend thinks relationship is getting a bit boring. I suggest all sorts of things, but she doesn't really want to do anything about it."

I am planning a reunion of sorts amongst friends in Europe this summer before I start my internship. I end finals on the 11th, and my girlfriend and I convene with all other 11 in Paris, France.


We'll meet one of our friends who is from the area, we all met through a student exchange program in the states. 

* After we land, we plan to drive down to Geneva and spend a 3 days.
* After which, we drive down to Chamonix, France for another 3 days. 
* We then drive to Marseille, and spend another 1 day. 
* We then want to fly to Ibiza for 2 days
* return and drive towards Biarittz and spend two days there. 
* We then want to make our way towards Amsterdam, and spend another three days.
In total, thats **14 days**. I have to make it to **Dublin by the 1st of June.**

My questions:

1. Is this plausible?

2. Is this a good route?
3. We hope to rent a car, possibly 2, since there will be about 11-13 of us. Is this better than taking a train?



I hope to see as much of the countryside as possible.

We all like the scene you'd find in Ibiza, but very much appreciate long hikes, nature, beautiful landscapes, breath taking scenery, great food, good wine. I understand my friend will have recommendations of her own, but the more perspective and experience, the better of course. 

I appreciate the help."

43hd8c,6,2016-01-30,I'm falling back into depression again.,FuckItAllImGoingDown,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/43hd8c/im_falling_back_into_depression_again/,"I've been managing anxiety for all my life, I wasted my life in high school thinking nothing mattered, played video games and made no meaningful relationships, still have none. Had absolutely no self-confidence.

Now in school, doing well, graduating in a year. Very well-paying internship secured in the summer at a place I'm familiar with and with people I know which will likely lead into a full-time position.

During my past internships I did well socially, but still no meaningful relationships. My self-confidence went up and good times were had but I still felt incomplete.

As I said before, I'm now back in school doing my second-last semester but every day is getting worse. I am trying to hold off on falling into the pit of self-loathing by diving deeper into my field of study and keeping myself busy but the fear of depression as I had before looms above me.

I want to lose weight but I've stopped exercising due to a bruised foot. I am overeating again even though I started eating well after the new year. Still no close friends. FUCK. This is not the path I want to go down again.

I want self-confidence. I want close friends who I can share my thoughts with. I want people who care about me other than my parents. I still have this hope but each day it fades away more and more and I know where this is going. I'm right on the verge. I don't feel like I can do anything about it."
43hqj3,3,2016-01-30,on the search for a mentor/role model,seveneyedfox,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/43hqj3/on_the_search_for_a_mentorrole_model/,"So I blew it on taking any classes this semester because of a health scare and overall feeling pretty shitty (no pun intended, link: https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/42qo5g/should_i_go_to_class_tomorrow/). I was advised by my psychiatrist to get a mentor and it looks like I will be having some free time this semester so I figured I would ask here.

I was wondering if there were any bipolar math/programming nerds/web developers with a soul and some unlikely combination of intellectual hubris, self-sacrificing altruism and total narcissism willing to take on an apprentice/student/fanboy/unpaid intern and be a mentor.

Being a mentor wouldn't entail much. Just be a cool guy or gal and throw me some wisdom (cool books, articles, your personal aphorisms), a coding challenge or brain teaser, some programming busy work that will make your life easier, periodically check in to make sure I'm still alive, etc.

If you want to literally TRAIN me as like a padawan that would be even better.

In return you will have 1.) my undying admiration even if you are mean to me, 2.) a code monkey you can delegate work to, 3.) someone you can variously rant to/get encouragement and support from, 4.) someone who will think you are basically God.

Anyways, PM me if you think you'd like to take on an apprentice. Or if you want more info. 

Edit: just to clarify, I'm not looking for offering a job, this is not anything professional, just looking for a programming bud who is managing some of the same problems I am who can offer some guidance and wisdom periodically."
43htaj,3,2016-01-30,"My ex-boyfriend[24M] and I[24F] quickly got in a relationship [2 months] again, after 1.5 years of almost no contact. I expected the same happy relationship, but everything is different.",exgirlfriendreturns,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43htaj/my_exboyfriend24m_and_i24f_quickly_got_in_a/,"We began as best friends. We met in a university class, where we became groupmates for the semester. A year later, before the summer, we ran into each other and decided to apply at the same place for internship. We were assigned in the same project. Throughout the summer, we hung out a lot, and we both found that it was really nice to spend time together. I was in a long-term relationship (4 years) with another guy, so it was completely platonic.

When that relationship fell apart, I briefly dated a few people. He'd give out hints now and then that isn't happy with me dating around. He'd take me to dinner too, send me sweet messages, give me chocolates, try to touch my hand or my hair. A lot of people who knew us would ask me if I knew he loved me. People who just met us would ask me if we were together. I determinedly kept everything friendly. He's my best friend. I treated him like a sibling. There was zero chances of romance between us, in my mind.

The day I broke up with someone, we had dinner with friends before crashing at his place. When we were going to sleep, he asked me to come in his room. I didn't think about it and went. We talked about random things for a short while. I stood up because I was excitedly talking. To my surprise, he stood up as well. Within a few seconds, he hugged me, kissed me and told me he loved me. I couldn't believe what happened. I told him I don't want to try dating him, because I care about him too much to risk losing him due to a breakup. I told him he probably just likes me because I'm an extremely nice person, and I'm close to him. He said it's true, but he insisted that he really, really loves me. We talked the whole night, falling into a cuddle in his bed, and we fell asleep with him asking me to consider it, and me telling him I'll try.

A few days later, our mutual friend messaged me with exclamation marks, telling me she's ***so*** happy for me. I didn't know what on earth she was so happy about. She told me that HE told her very excitedly that we're ""kind of"" dating. And I remember I stared at the screen, not knowing how to react, until I laughed. I thought it was the sweetest thing. Does he really love me that much? Then I remembered everything he did for me, all the times he made me happy, and that first kiss we had. It was the moment I felt love for him. We got together right after. It truly felt right. And I was his friend for years, but I had never seen him so happy as he was during those first few weeks.

We had a happy half year of dating. My mom even likes him. He didn't believe in a lot of things, such as giving flowers, but he just threw it all for me. A few more months, and he talked of marriage. I had never been loved this much. Until now.

But I have recurrent depression. At that point in my life, other things in my life weren't going well, such as work. I didn't intend anything, but I just didn't want to talk him or anyone for two weeks... so I didn't. But at the end of the second week, we had a plan to go see a movie that was showing, and without texting at all, I went to the meeting place, thinking he'd be there. I waited for hours. I realized he wasn't coming.

I went to his house, and he told me he made other plans because I couldn't be reached for so long. I told him I literally didn't talk to anyone at all. He was mad at what I did, and I was upset that he doesn't understand that I was depressed, that he never liked me being depressed, that he always seemed to want me to stop being depressed at the snap of a finger, that those are all together the reasons why I hid from even him. But he thought I should have still messaged him. I felt that I could barely function myself. I couldn't be a girlfriend at that point, especially for a boy two didn't want to understand. We broke up after that fight. There was little closure. He didn't want to talk to me, because it hurts to think about it.

1.5 years later, we agreed to meet up. I moved far away, and I was back in town to visit another friend. We spent half the day together, like old times, enjoying eating together, watching a movie together, telling each other jokes. He immediately asked me dinner the following week. I agreed. That second night, we kissed. A month later, he told me that he loves me.

I'm extremely happy we're together again. After breaking up, I always thought I would be happier with him than with anyone. But it's been a month into the relationship and it feels completely different from before.

* No one in his life knows we're back together. He told me honestly that he doesn't want to tell anyone. If someone knows by seeing us together, that's alright, but he won't advertise it, he says. I can understand his hesitations, but it makes me feel sad because it's why I loved him in the first place.

* He's pretty much completely changed on the marriage front. He's always telling me that we'll try to last as long as possible, but understandably, there will be unexpected things that'll divide us.

* He'd reply to my texts only when I'm already upset.

* I ask him to visit me, but he doesn't want to. I must visit him.

* I'd ask him if he'd be busy, and he'd tell me not to think too much. Then I'd then expect him to be free, but he'd leave his house without telling me, meet with friends, and never contact me until the day after.

* I'd ask him why he's so cold sometimes, and he'll tell me that he loved me very much before, but after we broke up, his love for me grew less and less...

I asked him if he really did want me as a girlfriend though, and he said yes. I just don't know if he'll ever love me again like he used to. I don't know how to make him feel what he felt for me before. What can I do?

**tl;dr**: Relationship: The Sequel isn't nearly as good as the first one. Will the original relationship ever return?"

Also have about $4,000 in stocks(no debt). I've stayed at home since I graduated high school at it has worked well for me, and I've had a girlfriend now for over 3 years. Hoping to even start a small business over the summer with friends if I can swing it.
The issue is my girlfriend is absolutely dead set on me moving out (like point of breaking up with me). I love my girlfriend and do see a future with her, but I don't think this is the right time being that I'm still I'm school, and really don't have the time to devote to a apartment/home. The idea of renting doesn't really appeal to me either because it feels like I'm essentially giving someone money for nothing opposed to having a mortgage where I would own the home. I can not get a mortgage though because I have to many different incomes and I am in school. 
I feel I'm at a crossroads and really need some advice. I've asked most people in my life but I feel as if most have there own bias to some extent. Personal experiences or just general advice would be nice."
43ihe8,2,2016-01-31,I want to drop out of college and I feel like a failure. Is it okay for me to take online courses/go back home for a semester?,microuniversity,bipolar,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/43ihe8/i_want_to_drop_out_of_college_and_i_feel_like_a/,"Hi everyone,

Just posted here recently about inpatient treatment, wanted to say that I did go to the ER and was placed on detainment but didn't end up having to go inpatient. However, I return to my university tomorrow and feel completely overwhelmed. I was excited to be accepted to a top-10 university, but it is just too difficult to be enrolled while also bipolar. I somehow scrape by with B's, but once a semester I have a breakdown of some sort (last semester it was psychosis, this time it's depression). I'm so jealous of people who aren't mentally ill, and who can have the college experience I never will. 

All I want to do is drop out and work in a small bookstore in a college town while working on my writing (I want to be a screenwriter/comedian). But I can't sacrifice everything I gave up to be at this university to only leave less than a year later, and it would disappoint my entire family. I've considered transferring, but I would only go further into debt.

What I'm now considering is signing up for online classes and going back to my hometown for a semester. I've been back at home since I was discharged from the ER and have felt much more stable, and am not looking forward to returning to school tomorrow. Going back to school means going back to full-time classes (that I'm behind on, thanks to depression) and a stressful internship with long hours. 

I loved my classes in community college but have disliked each of my classes since transferring to this top university. I really want to think that college is a good experience for bipolar people, but I'm finding myself loathing attending class and feeling more horrible by the day. I don't know what to do. Advice? Motivation?"
43ip2o,0,2016-01-31,Retro gamers vs. Star Wars Battlefront vs. Battlefield vs. Me Enjoy This Fer Realz,ojonegro,battlefront,https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefront/comments/43ip2o/retro_gamers_vs_star_wars_battlefront_vs/,"The point of this whole post is that Star Wars: Battlefront is a badass game, in my humble opinion yet relatively long experience compared to many of us gamers. I understand gaming critique, how much more advanced and beautiful The Witcher III is, the story in any Bethesda games, Blizz, LoL, have played and loved the previous Battlefronts and Battlefields (is that really the argument?), etc. I would just like to give a personalized account on Star Wars games, if that's ok...

The Star Wars games I remember playing when they came out... Tie Fighter (94). Such a great space flying game that made you think you were in The Galaxy. A 386 PC hopefully. And at least a 200mb HD. Then ""Dark Forces"" (95), which was basically DOOM (93), single player just a lot better architecture. I was still in junior high.

Then came high school when the Nintendo 64 came out. The two SW games I remember were ""Shadows of the Empire"" (96) and my favorite ""Rogue Squadron."" (98) Shadows was like Mario 64 on even crazier cliff sides, in beautiful Empire dark hallways, etc. The jumping and controls were wonky though but we did not care. Great game. In 1997, ""Dark Forces II"" multiplayer came out and I had weaseled my way into an internship in a skyscraper, made friends with IT, and it was my first experience of LAN gaming. DF2, Duke Nukem, etc. That's another story.

Rogue Squadron on the other hand was like no flying game I'd ever played. This was the game you learned to really hog tie an AT-AT. And it was hard. You had to perfectly use that N64 controller at the right angle to actually fly around that for-the-first-time a ""mostly"" realistic AT-AT walking skyscraper. 

And I hate to say it, but I can't think of any other memorable Star Wars games from then until SWTOR (Star Wars: The Old Republic). I was totally down and I actually think it may have one of the IRL money economies and subs even though the gaming community has completely discounted em. I myself did too because everyone I knew, even virtual buddies, don't even talk about SWTOR anymore. Like ESO. 

And so then we have this thing that DICE and EA have built called ""Battlefield."" Well, I'm not gonna go into that cuz I actually love BF1-4. So throw out the idea that Battlefront can't be lovers with Battlefield. 

But while I've been playing Battlefront lately, the graphics and each type of gameplay really blows my mind. It's like having 8 different games and it's the future for them to focus purely on multiplayer. 

It really feels like we're in the world of the Empire. And for those of us who can look past the critical bullshit, let's have fun! I can't wait to show this game to my 3 year old niece, my 22 year old nephew (?), and my 38 year old brother. 

Just get a console, says I of the #PCMasterRace

EDIT: TL;DR - Star Wars: Battlefront is being crazy underrated. But maybe I think that cuz I played the original N64 Star Wars games (and a few even before that). Play the game and make the decision yourself, not IGN. "

43k1c6,0,2016-01-31,Completely fucked in life,whynoteeeh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/43k1c6/completely_fucked_in_life/,"I'm 25, just graduated with a mediocre GPA from a mediocre university with a useful degree, and year after year I've been stuck, trapped, stagnant. Waiting for my ""real life"" to start. I wake up everyday waiting.

Career and life disappoints are plenty. Displeased with way my life has turned out, and I think about this constantly. I'm in awe and incredibly envious of those who have a good career, a social circle, and a great girlfriend and are successful in the endeavors they're passionate about.  

I'm jaded about real life, frustrated with the limitations there are in pursuing my dreams. Problem is, I have no dreams, no passions, no hobbies. I'm directionless. I don't know what to do in my life. I have no purpose or motivation. I chose my field because it made money and I was somewhat interested in it, I'm interested in MANY things. I want to chase my dreams, but I don't know what they are. 

I haven't taken any risks ever in life. I've just done things because they seemed sensible, or fear. I feel I'm not living my life.

I'm too unmotivated and depressed to put on a confident face for applications. I have low self esteem and feel inferior to literally everyone. I'm terrified of getting a job and haven't held one since 20. The the constant rejection and pointless application churning is emotionally taxing. My parents keep pushing my asking me why I haven't done anything after two months. I tried to send in an application and became incredibly anxious and panicked at the thought of filling one out. I feel like I'm not good enough. I constantly look for other people to tell me what to do or how to act. I value their opinions above my own.

Honestly I'm incredibly intimidated being in the work place, being in an interview, or having a boss. I'm scared I'll be fired. I feel people generally dislike me so in previous workplaces i used to attract as little attention as possible.

Edit: after writing this I become very motivated, got a huge burst of confidence and told myself to suck it up and spent the last 6 hours researching jobs. Basically. My degree is useless and no one wants me. All my field cares about is the name of the school you went to, you get hired if you have an Ivy name. It's hyper competitive and I'm just not up to par. My degree might as well be a paperweight and now I feel more depressed about my situation. I couldn't even get a fucking internship despite being very involved in my field and trying. I'm fucked and will never make it into this field. I've wasted my life studying this shit and I'm incredibly upset.

I live at home with my parents. I have no job but have a few savings. I'm upset at still living here and being dependent on them. I don't want to live at home anymore. I feel held back here. I want to start my life. Make good money. Live in a nice apartment in a metropolitan city. Have good friends. Have a successful career.

I have been, almost all my life, desperately desperately lonely for friendships. On the outside I am good looking, well dressed, charming, and people enjoy making small talk with me. My girlfriends parents and friends all like me.

You cannot make friends without having friends. I have zero friends. no. I had 2 friends. They spent their time doing coke and getting fucked up. Would ignore me and not invite me to things, and slowly began replacing me with some new  guy until I felt alienated and incredibly depressed just being around them and cut them out because they'd make plans without me. I spent most of my 18-24 just sitting at home or endlessly going on dates with time wasting flakey women who would change like the weather to fill my time or have some semblance of social interaction. I have never been invited to a party. I have never had a group of friends laughing and enjoying each other's time. I feel I'm ""that guy"" people don't invite to stuff and the feeling and insecurity follows me around everywhere I go.

I have a girlfriend that is an emotional vampire with BPD that is addicted to prescription pills and completely codependent on me emotionally and physically, that expects me to carry her through life. She breaks down twice a week. Occasionally I have to rush to her home to prevent her from killing herself. She only takes and never gives. It's emotionally exhausting. I love her but realize I can never marry this woman. She's too crazy and unstable and I can't have her be the mother of my children. At the same time, the prospect of going back to modern online dating is nauseating..I've been through that already..finding a loyal woman is hard enough.

I'm unhappy with my body. I'm 25 but weigh as much as a 16 year old boy despite being above average in height. I'm weak and feel completely emasculated and inferior to other men. I want to be a man. I thought I would be a man by 25. But I'm a loser. I want to be a confident guy who has his life together, his job, his finances, knows how to do things, has hobbies and life meaning.

My life is an alterance of effort and apathy due to sudden bursts of motivation then a sudden realizations that my best isn't  good enough and won't get me anywhere. I feel haunted by the ghosts of who I might have been. I'm not happy with the paths I've chosen but don't know what other paths I could take.

I keep daydreaming about doing something crazy, following a ""dream"" doing something artistic. I want to travel and meet new people. I don't have money. I want to have a successful career in my field and make good money at least. I want to enjoy the life I'm living. In contrast to that, I have an intense fear of failure. I realize it's too late to go back or change things. I'm on this path and I need to be successful. My parents have high expectations of me. I come from a very poor but well educated family. I have no home to go back to. I have no cushion. I have to make it. I couldn't partake in many interests or hobbies as a child because I didn't have a privileged background.

Before graduating I was really motivated to get a job, study for grad school entrance exams. But now I don't know what to do. I haven't sent in ONE application since graduating when I should be sending at least 3 a day and networking. I have zero confidence or motivation.


**tl;dr:**

 just graduated, completely demotivated, realize i might not like my field, realize i dont know what i'm doing, terrified of getting a job, fear of failure, anxiety and panic when looking for jobs.

Like most of us, I was rubbish at languages when I was in school, and as an adult I want to start again and learn one to full fluency. At first, I thought Irish would be the obvious choice, since we're always being told what a pity it is that we don't speak it, but then it occurred to me that mastery of a major European language like German could help a lot more with getting a job. 

I'm waiting to see if I've been accepted for an internship at the moment, and if I get it, I'd like to be doing something else in my spare time that will help me become more competitive on the jobs market here. I'm always seeing articles in papers like the Irish Times talking about how many jobs we miss out on here due to our lack of foreign language skills.

According to irishjobs.ie, there are 53 positions involving IT work with German language skills available and 311 positions from all categories using the language. For IT work involving the Irish language, there was just 1 position available (as of the time of writing this post).

Patriotism aside, which would be a better investment of my time?  I can obtain language learning resources for free from my local library, so cost is not an issue.

It is worth considering that I hope to primarily work as a web developer, either with PHP and MySQL or HTML and CSS. Many IT positions involving the use of a second language like German are related to sales, customer support or analyst roles, which involve explaining the merits of a product or service rather than coding.

So, has anyone got an opinion?"

How do I move into a new apartment with a HORRIBLE credit rating?,pharmacymedtech,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43l7ni/might_need_to_relocate_3_hours_away_to_complete/,"Hello guys, so here's my situation:

In order to complete my degree, I need to relocate because internships in our area are extremely scarce and hard to come by. If I stayed in this area, I'd most likely have to wait 2 years to get one through my college internship coordinator.

I don't want to wait 2 years, so I decided to move to an area that has internships available for me, which also happens to be around 3 hours away.

How do I go about moving into a new apartment with an abysmal credit rating? I have been having some health issues and owe around $10,000 in medical bills that I cannot pay. Obviously the $10,000 is in collections and I'm being harassed daily by debt collectors.
I know that apartments like to know what your income is, and your credit rating, but the issue is that I have NO job (I'm living off of financial aid from FAFSA), and my credit rating is trash.

What do I do reddit? I can't afford to just sit here for 2 years, I need to finish my degree and get a job so I can pay off all my debts! What can I do to increase my chances of landing an apartment? I truly am a good tenant. I'm quiet, keep the place clean, and I always pay my rent bills on time. :("
43l9s1,11,2016-01-31,"What are my chances to receive a ~15,000 loan without a cosigner as a senior in college?",JohnYo55,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43l9s1/what_are_my_chances_to_receive_a_15000_loan/,"Hi all,

I am a rising senior studying computer science at my local state school (pretty good CS program). 

Due to fallouts with my parents and me not wanting to reconcile with them (say what you will, read my post history if you must) I don't think they will pay for my college tuition next year. This past year they did but who knows how much longer that will last. 

So to prepare for the worst, I'm wondering what my options are. I met with my financial aid office last year and since my parents refused to sign the FAFSA or tell the office that they won't provide for me (because they did, anyways) I wasn't eligible for any loans. Which is fine because my parents paid for it, luckily.

Next year, since we haven't really spoken at all this year (didn't go home for the holidays), they might not pay. 

I have an internship this summer where I'll be earning money and currently have about 5k saved. I pay for everything else outside tuition (rent, food, etc) so going into next year I might have around ~12k but tuition for my school is ~9k a semester. With rent and the current job I have, I'm probably short about $15k (very rough estimate).

The question that I have is: is it possible for me to receive a loan for that amount from any source? I don't have any relatives/parents who will cosign.. I will have a job when I graduate, I'm studying a good field, and I want to graduate as quickly as possible. I don't want to work for a year because that's just wasting money that I could be earning if I work full time.

I know receiving loans without a cosigner is nearly impossible so I don't really know what to do. In the grand scheme of things, I would pay a higher interest rate just to graduate on time. Even $30k in debt isn't that much considering I can pay that off in under 2 years.

I'm quite scared for my future and I just want a way out that doesn't include my parents. They made my life hell the past two years and, while I know I sound like a spoiled kid, I would be fine taking on loans just to be independent. Any advice?

Thanks."
43lhjk,3,2016-01-31,I[21F] can't get over my ex[21M] even though it has been a year since he broke up with me.,tinybonzai,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43lhjk/i21f_cant_get_over_my_ex21m_even_though_it_has/,"Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I [F21] need to get over my ex/best friend [M21]. We broke up a year ago. Our year long relationship was my first but not his and I thought it was completely amazing. I never clicked with anybody (friends, family, etc.) like I clicked with him. It was like we were meant for each other. We were friends for about a year and a half before we started dating. We talked to each other every day, never fought, had a healthy sex life, and did a lot of creative/ adventurous things together. I loved his family and they loved me. I spent holidays at his house (4 hours by train), attended his brother’s wedding and his grandmother’s funeral, and grew attached to his friends as well. I had even been thinking a week before he broke up with me about how I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him and how excited I was for us to enter the real adult world together after college. We lived in the same building at university and shared a large friend group. 

However, one night I went downstairs to cuddle with him and before I could even process it, I was broken up with. It was completely shocking to me. I had him try to explain it to me and he said he didn’t think he loved me the way I loved him and that while he loved me as a friend, we weren’t right for each other romantically. I was speechless and in shock. I decided in that state that I was going to try to be friends with him and put the past behind us because losing him was just incomprehensible to me. Not even a week after we broke up he slept with a mutual friend’s visiting friend from Germany who was staying in his apartment. I found out about a month later when I saw him texting her. It took me a few days to process and I fell into a deep depression, lost 20 pounds in 2 months from not eating, and pondered suicide numerous times. Sometime during the first 2 months after we broke up my ex and I got too drunk and made out on my couch. It made me doubt what he said about not having feelings for me so I still kept up hope.

 For 6 months we remained friends and I was in incredible emotional distress because I knew he was still talking to the girl from Germany. I always felt so at home when talking to him but as soon as I would think about the possibility that this break up was permanent I just shut down and became depressed. Eventually I decided to visit him at his house over the summer to hang out and go tubing so I hopped on the train and whilst on the train ride I found out that he was going to Germany later in the summer to visit the girl he slept with. I was devastated. However, I had a really fun time with him at his house. The last night I was there, we ended up making out and cuddling for about an hour and I was convinced the next morning he was going to cancel his flight to Germany and admit he made a huge mistake by leaving me. That’s not what happened. Instead he told me he didn’t regret the night before but he really wanted just to be friends. We talked about it a bit and I went home, discouraged. Still I had hope that he would realize he threw away something great when he broke up with me.

 Fast forward to the time he went to Germany, we were texting and he told me he broke things off with her while he was there because they got bored of each other. Then I helped him through a bit of a rough patch in his life where he felt depressed and bored. He visited me in NYC during my internship and had a fun time. Then we returned to school. I helped him unpack and we were hanging out like normal. About a month into school we ended up cuddling in his bed. The next week he tells me he’s met someone else and is suddenly very distant to me and things just feel weird between us. I am constantly plagued by jealousy whenever I think about him and his new girlfriend (who also lives in our building). Eventually I just decided I couldn’t see him in person anymore because I didn’t want to meet this new girl and be totally destroyed so we decided we would just text each other and not talk face to face. 

We both promised we wouldn’t lose each other and he has told me he wants to be a part of the rest of my life (but only as a friend). It’s been really hard on me losing my best friend and I had to stop texting him because every time I think about him now I just spiral into depression. I have been to therapy, have been taking antidepressants, and it has been an entire year since he broke up with me but I am still completely broken and even just seeing him around can make me really upset. I know that before we can try to be friends again I need to get over him which just seems impossible. I don’t know what to do anymore after having lost my best friend to silly feelings I can’t put behind me. 
---
TL;DR After a year of being led on by my ex-boyfriend/ best friend, I still can’t get over him. Now he is seeing someone else and I have cut off contact completely, but still think about him all the time and am very upset I lost him."
